My name is Glenn and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later in the call, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Halverson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Glenn. Welcome everyone to Extra Space Storage's first quarter 2014 conference call. In addition to our press release, we've furnished unaudited supplemental financial information that you can access on our website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.","Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, Tuesday, April 29, 2014.","The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Good afternoon. During last quarter's conference call, I commented that we were coming off two years of superior results and we're heading into what would be a great year. We are seeing signals that this is materializing. Core performance was ahead of expectations. We held rates flat in the off season to drive occupancy and we ended the quarter up 200 basis points at 90.4%.","Same-store revenue was up 7.9% with expenses growing at 4.7%. NOI growth was 9.4%. Our same-store properties experienced high snow removal and utility costs due to the severe winter weather. However, this was offset by lower than expected payroll and property tax expenses.","As we move into our rental season, we are seeing pricing power in higher street rates and lower discounts. Now I would like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Spence. Last night we reported FFO of $0.55 per share for the first quarter, adjusting for non-cash interest expense and acquisition related costs, FFO was $0.57 per share. We outperformed our guidance due to better than expected property performance, tenant insurance results and lower G&A and interest expense.","Since going public nearly 10 years ago, our definition of our same-store pool is not changed. In 2014, we added 99 properties to our same-store pool, bringing the total to 443. 90 of these properties were from our previous acquisitions and 9 came from our development pipeline. This change in our same store pool added about 80 basis points to our revenue growth. We had another strong quarter for acquisitions. We purchased 21 assets for $250 million. 17 of these properties came from a single portfolio in Virginia.","Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed 5 additional properties for $61 million. We currently have 4 properties under contract for $39 million which should close by the end of the second quarter. Therefore, as of today, we have closed or have under contract $350 million. We\u2019ve revised our full year 2014 FFO guidance to be from $2.41 to $2.49 per share these estimates include non-cash interest expense and acquisition-related costs. Adjusting for these items, FFO is estimated to be from $2.45 to $2.53 for the full year.","I will now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","","Thanks Scott. After all this said and done, our job as a management team is to grow FFO and increase shareholder value. The first quarter has added to a two year run of excellent results. The FFO per share grew by 24%, which marks 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth. To this point we don\u2019t see anything that would preclude us from delivering another strong year.","Let\u2019s now turn the time over to Clint to start the Q&A session.","Clint Halverson","","Thanks Spence. As in the past, in order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I\u2019d like to ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limited to two. If time allows, we\u2019ll address follow on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that we\u2019ll now turn it over to Gwen to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Hi thanks. Jordan Sadler is online with me as well. Just first question, in terms of the rank growth and the pricing power I was just curious if you could tell us where street rates are today versus scheduled inline rents for the portfolio? And maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on the pricing power that you commented on. Is it lower concessions and discounting primarily or are you seeing more traction in the ability to raise place rents or street rates?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. Let\u2019s back up just a little bit. As we entered the off season Todd, we said, we are going to hold rates and drive occupancy which actually worked out very well. At the end of March our street rates were up about 3% and as we walk into the busy season, we expect to be pushing rates obviously how the year turns out depends on how far we can push those street rates. In terms of in place rates, we\u2019re right on top of where we\u2019ve been. There has been no material change in that.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Have you seen renters respond differently to rent increases that you have pushed through whether by not moving out at the same rate as you had in the past or just less push back overall?","Spencer Kirk","No. Actually Todd, it\u2019s a combination of pushing the street rate or reducing the discount. And we are not trying just one single strategy, as we look at our revenue management system, we\u2019re employing a variety of strategies to maximize the revenue. It depends on the customer, the channel, when they came to us and what we know about that customer. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re not seeing any material change in consumer behavior as we\u2019ve applied our pricing strategy.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then just one question and then I\u2019ll hop off, really to the interest expense assumptions, I saw that it came down $5 million for the year and I was just curious last quarter when you provided guidance, you had most of the acquisitions either completed or under contract that you announced with the earnings last quarter. And so I think this quarter, there was roughly an incremental $50 million that we learned about. And I was just wondering what drove that interest expense assumption down so much, why was that not I guess baked in more last quarter when you provided initial guidance?","Scott Stubbs","Yes Todd, this is Scott. Our guidance really moves about $5 million like you mentioned and about half of that is really a non-cash item. So, what it is, is you are taking a gain basically from some out of market debt due to some acquisitions and that was kind of a last minute thing that we recorded as part of the acquisition of the one of our joint ventures.","And so effectively what\u2019s happening is reducing your interest expense by $2.5 million and then you can see in the last part of our guidance, it shows that you are basically taking that benefit back out. So, for FFO adjusted, there is no really effect from that.","So, the other $2.5 million comes from really three components, one is we\u2019ve elected to have three different loans, we had partially swapped and we were originally going to swap the entire amount, we\u2019ve elected to have a portion of that remain variable and that benefits us to the tune of about $700,000. In addition, LIBOR, the LIBOR curve is changed to the point where it\u2019s about a $0.5 benefit through the year. So that\u2019s $1.2 million in total between LIBOR and allowing these loans to float instead of fixing them. And then the rest comes from adjusting our amortization of loan fees. And we basically just trued that up from a run rate from prior years, where in prior years we had a little bit of [decisions] or additional write-off relating to that. So, half non-cash, half cash largely relating to variable rate loans and LIBOR.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","","Hey guys good morning.","Spencer Kirk","","Hey Christy.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","I just wanted to quickly follow-up on Todd\u2019s rent question. I heard you say that street rents were flat year-over-year in Q1 as you were able to drive occupancy. Did I hear you say that what was the big year-over-year change in street rents form April, so just trying to get a sense for how that\u2019s changing heading into the spring leasing season?","Spencer Kirk","Okay Christy, it\u2019s Spencer. Good morning. I\u2019m not really happy to comment about what\u2019s going on in April, let me clarify. Last fall, we held street rates in the off season to gain occupancy for the first quarter on average it was 2% and as we exited the quarter it was about 3%. So it\u2019s trending up and we like the direction.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","","Got you. And then on existing customer rents, you said that you are increasing rents on existing customers at about the same pace, I assume that\u2019s about 8% to 10%. I know that it fluctuates based on the length of stay but do you expect any change in 2014 in the percentage of your portfolio on which you are spending out rental rate increases?","Spencer Kirk","","No, that 8% to 10% range Christy is an average, it depends on the customer, it depends on how highly occupied a unit might be, it depends on seasonality, it depends how long the customer had been in that unit. So it could be less than that or it could be more but I would say for 2014, modeling purposes 8% to 10%.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","But I guess the question is 8% to 10% on what percentage of your portfolio, so will it be the same number [outstanding] that you are giving on a rental rate increase there?","Spencer Kirk","","Yes, no change.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","","Okay. And then just lastly, if I could sort of think about the 6% to 7% same-store rental growth projection for the year, you were at almost 8% in Q1 how do you expect that growth rate to trend through the year? And I know that you manage for revenue growth and you don\u2019t really disclose what the inputs are, but if I, you have your own internal forecast for what occupancy would be and growth in realized rents I am wondering if you could share those with us? So in the first quarter if you add about a 200 basis point occupancy delta and almost 5% realized rent growth what should those metrics look like for the full year?","Spencer Kirk","","For the full year on occupancy we are expecting that to trend towards 1% by the end of the year, so on average between 1% and 2%. We expected street rates, we just experienced it obviously 2% average for the first quarter so 2% to 3% by the end of the first quarter pushing them during the busy season during our summer month. And then we\u2019ll see how they hold in the fall. Obviously there is some risk if we don\u2019t find that we have as many rentals and if we have a drop off in occupancy but we are expecting to push rates in the summer.","In addition to that the other thing that is actually causing our rental growth to slow towards the end of the year is the fact that our discounts have been down 10 plus percent since last June. So we are coming up against some tough comps starting in June. So we are expecting our rental growth to slow as a result of the decrease in discount slowing.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","So when you say rental growth I understand sort of the slowing occupancy delta but as I am thinking about sort of the realized rent growth are you talking about that slowing as well?","Spencer Kirk","","What happened is last year our discounts started decreasing to the tune of double-digit and that benefited our rental revenue growth by just around 1%. We expect that to be a smaller component of our rental growth this year and that diminishing throughout the year. So the start of the year was still in the 1% range by the end of the year, it\u2019s tough to continue to decrease your discounts 10 plus percent year-over-year.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","","So is that 4.5% to sort of 5% growth in realized rents per square foot is that sustainable going through year even as you have discounts decreasing.","Spencer Kirk","If you take an average, let\u2019s say street rates on average are going to be 4%, your discounts are going to be half percent and your occupancy is going to be 1% to 2%, that\u2019s how you get that 6% to 7% because we are expecting street rates on average for the year to be maybe 4% if we are lucky 5%, it\u2019s going to depend the little bit on how much pricing power we have during the busy season. So it\u2019s really kind of 2% discounts called 4% street rates and then the rest coming from discounts.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Christy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Thank you, guys good morning.","Spencer Kirk","Hi, David.","Scott Stubbs","Hey, David.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","I won\u2019t make the (inaudible) again on this call, but I want to talk a little bit about transactions. And you are obviously running pretty close to your full year guidance. So I can assume the volumes are expected to slowdown in the second half?","Spencer Kirk","Where we are today David, we closed about $200 million right at the start of the year in the first 15 days. That transaction had been under contract from end of last year. Right now we are estimating at about $350 million done by the end of June and right now we really only have the four properties under contract for just under $40 million. So what we are saying is if we do a $150 million of one off transactions for the last six months of this year, we think that that\u2019s attainable and we think that that\u2019s actually good for our shareholders, if we come across a portfolio or something, obviously that's going to benefit us and we could do more.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Are you able to disclose aggregate cap rates on acquisitions completed so far?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, I can talk a little bit to that. Our cap rates have been as low as zero and I know that sounds odd and what I mean by that is we've done two certificate of occupancy deals in the first quarter of the year. And then on our stabilized our operating properties there between 6 and 7.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And then if I can just hack one more question on. The smaller industry contacts have been commenting recently that they are seeing notable compression in secondary, tertiary markets, but relative stability and sort of the institutional quality re-product, would you say that's true based on what you're seeing so far year-to-date in terms of deals that have been coming across your desk?","Spencer Kirk","David, it's Spencer. I would say notable compression might be a little strong. I think there is always the seller expectation of benchmarking or tagging their property to the core market transactional rate. But as we've been showing through disciplined acquisitions that you can still transact in that range 6% to 7% and I think that a lot of sellers hope to get a better rate, but are not necessarily achieving what they want.","I just, I think notable is probably a little stronger than I would have characterize it, there is a little bit, but it's not substantive is how I would say.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Thanks for the detail Spence.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Andrew Rosivach - Goldman Sachs","","Hi guys. I\u2019ll tell you my goal of this question, and ask it. As China figure out how an EXR same-store may be a little bit different from a same-store portfolio that hasn\u2019t been making a lot of acquisitions and you had the big jump in the first quarter for the tenant reinsurance running through your same-store.","And I\u2019m curious how much of that is like a truly stabilized asset getting a better rate and a better penetration versus some of it say assets that you bought in 2011 or 2012 that it entered the same store pool but really had not had the full tenant insurance penetration rate yet?","Scott Stubbs","Our growth in tenant insurance is really coming from two or three components. One is obviously as we increase the penetration, it\u2019s going to help us. Let\u2019s say you go from 67% to 70% that\u2019s going to grow it by 3%. The properties we acquire obviously help it a little, but the majority of our growth this year has come from increasing the dollars per policy. So we have tried to make sure that our tenants are adequately ensured and that is increasing the dollars per policy.","Andrew Rosivach - Goldman Sachs","","Got it. Now that helps Scott. Thanks.","Spencer Kirk","","Thanks Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Cheatham with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Brandon Cheatham - SunTrust","Thanks for taking my question. Just real quick on the snow removal for same-store NOI, if you normalized that what would same-store NOI have been? And then kind of the same vein, were there lower move outs in the first quarter year-over-year?","Spencer Kirk","","Yes, our NOI if you would have just normalized the snow and utilities would have been 10.4%. The one thing I would caution you on that is we did have the benefit of lower payroll and lower property taxes in the quarter that kind of offset that. So, if you get a normalized one you might want to normalize both so just to get to a normal run rate.","Brandon Cheatham - Suntrust","(Inaudible) that is one time?","Scott Stubbs","","Yes. To answer your question of move-out, obviously with the severe weather move-ins might have been a little bit muted. Well, if you can\u2019t move-in, you probably can\u2019t move-out either.","Brandon Cheatham - Suntrust","So, I guess you would say that they may have offset one another?","Scott Stubbs","","Yes. So, move-ins and move-outs we would say offset each other as far as the benefit or the detriment to same-store NOI obviously it affected that. But again, we did have the benefit of some up property tax appeals going in our favor in the quarter also.","Brandon Cheatham - Suntrust","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","","Hi guys. I just had a kind of over the last maybe say 12 or 18 months you guys have, all the acquisitions you have done and where you\u2019ve had the opportunity to kind of overlay your own revenue management system. Can you maybe just talk about kind of what, how rent growth was maybe say 12 months ago for those property and maybe what you\u2019ve seen as you\u2019ve kind of implemented or utilized more of your own system, overlay on those properties?","Scott Stubbs","","I would tell you that it really runs kind of a pretty wide range. We\u2019ve seen as much as 15%, 20% growth on some of those properties we saw that on some Cincinnati assets a year and half two years ago. We\u2019ve also seen as little as kind of similar to our same-store growth 5% to 7%. And what I mean by that is, there is a pretty big range of operators out there; some of the properties we\u2019re buying are very well run, others maybe are little bit [unquoted] in some of their methods. We\u2019ve bought some properties where they don\u2019t take credit cards, some that don\u2019t take cash. So, it really runs a range of anywhere probably between 5% to 7% and 15% to 20%.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks guys.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Vikram.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Spencer Kirk","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","First off, I do appreciate the added color on what the impact to the same-store pool was from shifting it, but I guess maybe a question or comment on that. Do you think it might make sense to revisit the definition of the same-store pool in so far as a property that hits 80% occupancy, maybe that would stabilized in the old storage era, but these days it seems to be a little light and it seems like those properties are coming into pool a little early and positively influencing the number?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you something that I think we\u2019ll consider going forward. But I think if you ask anyone if 90% was going to be the new norm as far as stabilized occupancy, I don\u2019t think anyone of us would see that. You also obviously have the risk of new development coming in at say self storage yields remain where they are; I think you are going to see some new construction. Right now there is really no new construction; I think we\u2019ve run into that risk is out there.","Spencer Kirk","Ross, it\u2019s Spencer. If I could just add another comment, the definition has served us really well for the past decade through the best of an economy and through the worst of an economy. And the idea of change unit is obviously something we need to evaluate, but there is still a lot of uncertainty and we don\u2019t know what the future holds into work to effectuate change on something that has worked so well. We just need to study that before we act.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Sure. I\u2019m just throwing it out there because obviously trying to get a quarter compared to last quarter is virtually impossible, right?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, I understood.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Okay. So, my question though is, I just want to clarify a comment made earlier and then push on it a little bit. Spencer, when you talked about street rates being up, I think you said 2% and then trending to 3%. That comment was sequentially relative to where the street rates were towards the end of last year?","Spencer Kirk","That year-over-year is what it is Ross. And the other thing that I think we\u2019ve got to be careful on anytime we\u2019re talking about rate growth is not to get too hung up on where we are just on street rates. I think we also need to consider where we are with discounts and that type of things also.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Totally with you, sort of a net rate count.","Spencer Kirk","Correct.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","So, you think that sort of 2% trending to 3% in March, your sense is that that number goes 4% hopefully and maybe even to touch above it as we get into the summer?","Spencer Kirk","We hope it goes 4% to 8%. We\u2019ll see how what kind of strength we have in the summer. It's too early to tell.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","I mean is there anything that you are seeing today, I mean it's already April, I know that\u2019s what\u2019s touched on. The biggest question I get towards the sub-storage industry is just a complete and total lack of visibility as to what pricing power is going to be two months from now. So, what can you sort of tell this audience as to what you are feeling today versus perhaps what you were feeling last in April 29th of 2013 with respect to pricing power at this coming summer?","Spencer Kirk","Right. So, without commenting about April, I can tell you year-over-year sentiment and year-over-year opinion. I am equally optimistic, I\u2019m buoyant. There are two factors and I didn\u2019t want to bring him up, but I\u2019m going to bring him up. There is still virtually no new supply. And number two, because of the power and the potency of our internet platform we\u2019re taking market share from the smaller guy. And that has not changed in 12 months and I don't see a changing in the next 12 months.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","","Thanks Ross.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","","Hi, thanks guys. Scott, you\u2019ve grown the size of the portfolio pretty quickly over the last couple of years. Just haven\u2019t really tap the street on secured debt market, I just wanted to see if I can get an update on how you are looking at to how you are going to structure the balance sheet and maybe your aspirations to tap the bond market and potentially achieve an investment grade rating?","Scott Stubbs","","It\u2019s something that we continue to look at. We're still struggling a little bit with covenants. We want to try to be as covenant light as possible. And if you go standard investment grade, standard bond offering, there are certain standard covenants that come with that. And so it\u2019s something that we're considering. I think our company is at a different state than we were five years ago.","I think really our leverage is in line and we're not looking at certainly to do a transformational transaction that makes us a rated entity tomorrow, but it\u2019s something obviously we\u2019re moving towards.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","","Okay. Thanks and just to follow-up with that, your cash balances according to the new guidance are expected to double. I just wanted to see what was behind that and is it really fair to assume you are using more internally generated cash flow when you are making your acquisitions and maybe lees a need for equity?","Scott Stubbs","","It\u2019s a combination of a few things; one is, more internal generated cash flow, two is the timing. Some of the acquisitions are bumped back and the loan has not necessarily bumped back. So, it\u2019s a combination of those three things.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. My question relates to industry consolidation, just trying to get a sense of where we stand today thinking about the universe of investment grade or properties that you and the other public peers might be willing to own. And so given that you guys that there has been very little construction over five years and you guys have continued to acquire and grow your managed pools, I was wondering if you could compare industry consolidation then to now?","Spencer Kirk","","Okay. I don\u2019t have all the exact numbers, Paul. What I can tell you is that the public companies own or operate about the same percentage that they did 15 years ago. I think as we look forward to the next five years, it\u2019s probably a fair assumption to say with muted supply and with recognition that the world has changed and it\u2019s not about yellow pages and drive up but it\u2019s about the internet and drive up, I think it\u2019s likely that you will see some continued operational consolidation as well as financial consolidation. The advantageous cap rates that are out there today I think are causing lot of people to say, if I don\u2019t sell now, when we would I sell. And we continue to see opportunities out there. And our transactional history over the last 8 or 12 quarters shows that the market is out there and you can transact.","If you use the number of 54,000 self storage facilities in the U.S. and you say that half of those are not institutional grade, it takes you down to 27,000; if you take the top several dozen operators owning or controlling about 7,000 to my way of thinking, there might be about 20,000 facilities out there that would fit the profile of saying yes this would be a nice inclusion into an institutional portfolio. So, a lot of stuff out there, we are never going to get to but I still think that the market is wide opened for a lot of consolidation either operationally or financially.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. I just didn\u2019t catch maybe the beginning part of your comments, when you said that compared to five years ago that the public operators own or manage about the same percentage, given that there was a lot of growth in your guys\u2019 portfolios and very little new construction?","Spencer Kirk","Okay. My comment was for 15 years ago, I don\u2019t know where we were five years ago, Paul.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Okay.","Spencer Kirk","But I can tell you from 2003 to 2007, there were about 13,000 self storage facilities built in the United States which put us over the 50,000 mark. So we could go back and reconstruct that. I am just speaking anecdotally from some loose data points but generally that the public companies have owned or operated about same percentage historically, it hasn\u2019t changed a lot.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Spencer Kirk","Good morning, Paula.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","I want to follow up on the transaction commentary and Spencer your comments that historically low cap rates are attracting what were perhaps previously reluctant sellers. Are you hearing that from your JV partners as well? Clearly those -- some of those relationships have been in place a long time. What\u2019s their propensity for recycling their capital?","Spencer Kirk","It depends on the partner, it depends on the fund whether it\u2019s open or closed and the investment objectives. I can tell you that many of our partners have reported year after year after year, self storage has been their best performing asset class. And if they got out of storage, they don\u2019t know where they would redeploy the capital to get the same kind of return. the same mentality exits with many of our third-party managed owners. Some of them are first generation are thinking about retiring or passing along wealth to their posterity and others are saying why would I want to sell, I don't know where to redeploy my cash, where I get the same kind of returns that I'm getting out of storage. So, it all depends on the individual, it depends on the fund, it depends on the portfolio manager. And that is a very broad swap, because about 500 of our assets that say Extra Space fall under that partially owned or non-owned category.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","And the acquisitions that you closed on in the first quarter and have under contract, were any of those from your JV or third-party relationships or were those off-marketed deals that relationships came to you in other ways or were those marketed deals?","Spencer Kirk","Two of those properties came from joint ventures, or once that were related managed entities. The rest were all outside third-party.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. That's all I have.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Paula.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Paula.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning guys. Just to go back to the portfolio of question, can you talk about just looking at market deals, what's the quality on the market, your peers have mentioned that quality is down a little bit. And then just go back to the street rate question. Since you guys pushed occupancy more or so in the first quarter than dry run rate, what was -- where you think street rates were up for the industry in the first quarter?","Scott Stubbs","This is Scott, I can comment a little bit on street rate. So on street rates, it's little bit difficult to comment on what we see as an industry, we compare our properties to kind of their closest competitors. And we don't necessarily move resulting on what they do, but we've seen them zero to 5%, it really depends on the property and the competitor?","Spencer Kirk","","And then on the transactional stuff, Mike, many of our competitors\/peers as I have even said, yet there are some lower quality portfolios coming to market, may be as a percentage the lower quality stuff is ticked up. It does not mean that there aren\u2019t decent portfolios that are out there to be had. And there is plenty of maneuvering room on acquisitions as you think that there might be 20,000 self storage facilities that are still out there that don\u2019t have one of the brand names of the four rates flying to flag over that asset.","So for us yes, there has been downtick in quality but it doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t good opportunities, solid opportunities, and decent assets to be added. You just have to maybe work little harder, be a little more selective and be a little more disciplined.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","","Okay. And this is my follow-up question. You talked about not seeing any new supply right now nationwide, are there any markets that you are starting to see and those will creep up in the last call it 60 to 90 days in terms of new construction? And then also just as you have many joint venture partners, you are looking at various things, have you seen any relaxation in terms of lending on new construction among the small regional banks?","Spencer Kirk","","So as far as new supply in the last 60 to 90 days, I can\u2019t tell you a market that has seen significant new supply or tick up there. As far as the bank\u2019s lending, I think it\u2019s still fairly difficult, we have not seen them lacks I think with the regulation. I think the banks are still more than willing to lend to people to have money. So if someone is well capitalized, I think it\u2019s pretty easier to get money. That doesn\u2019t mean development loans are not there. I think people can get development loans, it is usually through relationships or local banks.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks you much.","Spencer Kirk","","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","","Thank you, good morning. Spencer last quarter you commented on the potential for a disconnect between buyer and seller expectations and you attributed impart to your higher cost of capital and earlier in this call you seem to suggest the same type of relationship. So would love to hear you elaborate on that particularly in light of your much improved cost of capital?","Spencer Kirk","","My statement I think I could summarize it this way Dave. When I talk about a disconnect. If I could be very specific many folks think that a 5 cap or a sub 5 cap is the going rate for the best assets in the best markets, think Manhattan brand new property. The smaller operator perhaps with the property that\u2019s a little bit older in a secondary or tertiary market uses that 5 benchmark and says well maybe my asst could be where 5.5 or a 6 cap. And once again it all comes back to how Extra Space scores the quality of an asset. And this works for us. I am not suggest it for anybody else that\u2019s the storage operator, but for Extra Space our philosophy is very simple it is; we look at the quality of the market; we look at the quality of the physical asset; and we look at the quality of the location of that physical asset within the market. And we make a determination as to what we think that that asset will be worked.","And many times there is a disconnect between our view of the world and what the seller might expect and that\u2019s where I think it\u2019s fair for me to say Extra Space is interested in transacting, but not at any cost and not for any price point, but for a price point that simply is accretive for our shareholders. And we are working harder to find the acquisitions that fit our operational footprint and fit that quality scoring and with that what we will see what happens.","Our cost of capital moves up and down today, Dave, it depends on lot of factors, but the bottom line for us is we want to be disciplined and do accretive acquisitions.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","That\u2019s helpful, thanks for that. And directionally as your cost of capital has improved, is there potential for that disconnect to narrow?","Spencer Kirk","I think that what we saw was when the cost of capital got more expensive, the pricing didn\u2019t change a lot and now that is back down. I am not sure it will change that much either. It is possible just a point in time, you saw interest rates pick up for a period of time, they are now relatively -- they are not necessarily down but maybe the growth has slowed, but I think everybody would agree that interest rates are going up.","We don\u2019t want to go whips out, Dave with the changes and the fluctuations that take place over a short period. We are taking long view on our weighted average cost of capital. And we are looking at what the market is going to do, and there are lot of operational elements that pop-in and out of the equation. And we don\u2019t want to react or overreact any of those we want to be consistent and sustainable in our actions.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. One final question related to acquisitions. And as it relates to underwriting what we understand that every deal or portfolio deal is very different, but from a broad perspective over the last couple of years. How have you adjusted your NOI growth underwriting for say years two through five of the deal as the cycle has matured and you get slightly closer to the rival of new supply?","Scott Stubbs","No, our underwriting, we typically base it on how our properties in the area are doing and we have not necessarily made an adjustment or an assumption that new supply has or will come to effect that property.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay. So no change?","Scott Stubbs","No Change.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Dave.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Yes, good afternoon. Great results for the quarter. Most of my questions are on acquisitions, the deals that you guys announced this quarter, just wanted to clarify that, the stabilized asset were brought at 6% to 7% cap rate and there are still some assets that are technically a zero cap rate?","Spencer Kirk","That is correct. And we say 6% to 7% that's a year one forward-looking cap rate and some are absolutely CLO.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","And is 6% to 7% for the entire portfolio or just for the stuff excluding the CLO stuff.","Spencer Kirk","Just for the stuff excluding the CLO stuff.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","And what kind of NOI growth that are you assuming for that first 12 months that gets into a 6% to 7% cap?","Spencer Kirk","It is anywhere between 5% and 9% on year one, well actually probably 5% and 8%","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","On year one. Okay, that's helpful. Then the second thing, again you now have about $250 million of acquisitions locked in and your guidance is $500 million. Just kind of curious if you guys see a good chance of you guys exceeding guidance just given how well you\u2019ve done year-to-date and what your acquisition pipeline looks like?","Scott Stubbs","So Tayo, what I would say is, let\u2019s go back and put a little perspective in this just right after the year began we closed down the Virginia portfolio of $200 million in assets. That really was an activity that largely took place in 2013. And where we draw this artificial line at December 31st and January 1st and put something in one year or following year.","I won\u2019t get too hung up on that, I would say, a lot of what happens in our acquisitions guidance is predicated on knowing what we think we can do versus what potentially might happen. And all it takes is a joint venture partner to come to us and say, hey we're thinking about liquidating these assets, would you be interested in buying them, or it just takes someone to say, you know what, it\u2019s time for me as an owner to sell my portfolio and that\u2019s really hard to script.","So, we look at what we know. We know what the historical velocity has been and we give you our best prognostication. We certainly could do considerably better, but I don\u2019t have any bases and we don\u2019t have any bases for making that statement because we haven\u2019t had any substantive dialogue with any owner either off market or open market to substantiate that\u2019s how we\u2019d given our best guidance or our best guess.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","","Right. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one more, with occupancy now kind of breaking things, occupancy now kind of breaking 90%, I mean when we kind of start thinking about an upper limit for that number where you just kind of have structural vacancy you can\u2019t of get rid of it. You kind of guide us something about how we should be thinking about that just how much more that occupancy rate can go up?","Spencer Kirk","","Let me tell you the way I view the world. We think that just with about 6% to 7% of your properties are either vacating, 6% to 7% of the total units or renting 6% to 7% of the total units each and every month. You kind of say somewhere around 94% is a good place to start to think. And if you are at 94% occupancy, I can tell you if that\u2019s an average, you have a lot of site quotes that are sold out, which is something we don\u2019t like to do. We think you are leaving money on the table at that point, because if you are sold out in some of the more popular site quotes some of the less desirable units are not at that 94% they are in the mid 80s or high 80s.","So for us, we could wrapped up a bit during the absolute peak of the season, but to expect to get much above 94%, 95% I don\u2019t think is reality and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s somewhere where we think we are going to be operating. Certainly our revenue management system with the predictive inputs that it has to drive the algorithm is going to not let us get to those levels. Now as we learn and see what the market shapes up to-date, things could change. But today I would say, low to mid 90s is the limit for Extra Space.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Got it. And then lastly just one more, from a development perspective when you just kind of take a look at market pricing right now at what point does development start to makes sense again, while we\u2019re still a year away, two years away from that?","Spencer Kirk","","Well Tayo, I\u2019d like to give you my seven part thesis on why I don\u2019t see development coming this time in the near future, but I will give you a truncated version. Number one, banks are reluctant to win. Number two, there is off a lot of interest in the prime parcels from every asset class which is driving up land prices. So, banks are willing to win or the lending terms are less favorable thus this bring to the profitability, if you\u2019re paying more for the land that\u2019s being the profitability and then you are the mom and pop operator or the local developer and you can\u2019t compete on the internet.","You are going to have to sign up and have someone who can provide the flow of customers to your property and you are going to paying the management fee, you\u2019re going to be sharing some it not all tenant insurance and you are going to be getting hit with some downstream cost for a call center and other marketing expenses, so that\u2019s your third day on the profitability.","And I just think that the return versus the risk equation has shifted and people are little bit more reluctant. There is ample interest in doing development, but when you really see the number of properties that are coming out of the ground, it is still muted and I don\u2019t see those fundamental elements either on having to sign up a management company and paying a fee or property prices being pressured upward or banks willing to land to the smaller perhaps capitalized individual.","I think those are things that will remain in place for the foreseeable future. There will be some buildings, but I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to put a lot of new supply into the market in the near-term at all.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Thank you very much, good color.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Yes. Hi thanks, a couple of quick follow-ups. First for Scott, you mentioned in response to an earlier question on the tenant insurance that you\u2019ve increased the dollar amount per policy or that's where some of the growth is coming from. Can you just provide more detail on what you are doing with regard to insurance program?","Scott Stubbs","Our tenants are insured based on the dollar amount of the goods that they have stored. And what we found is we want to make sure that our tenants have adequate coverage. So, as we are offering tenant insurance, we are making sure that they are truly valuing their goods at the correct amount. And we are basically executing better at the point of -- point the rental was made and having them take the correct amount insurance, which is effectively pushing it up. So, for instance instead of them insuring $200,000 worth of goods, they are now insuring $300,000 worth of goods.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And can you quantify what the monthly dollar amount per renter is in terms of the insurance collections that you are receiving?","Scott Stubbs","I don't have it in front of me per renter.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. What about the overall penetration rate within the EXR portfolio today?","Scott Stubbs","Overall, it's around 70% depending, if you're looking mature or overall portfolio.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then a question on page 21 in the supplement where you break out the joint ventures, you have been in the promote for two other JVs now for some time. I was just wondering, if you could talk about, whether you're getting close to any of those other promote hurdles that are in the high single-digits for some of the larger joint ventures at all?","Scott Stubbs","No, on the larger ones we are not. Those promotes, actually had slight escalations that took effect at the timeframe, when we are actually going through a recession. So we have some catch up to do on those and we are not near the promote on any of these storages that legacy JVs the big ones there.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. All right, great. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Great. Thanks, Todd.","Operator","We have another follow-up question from the line Brandon Cheatham with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust","This is actually Ki Bin. Just one follow-up. What happens to a property when there is a new development next door? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve a lot of historical data, is it -- could you talk a little bit about kind of financial impact on whether it be occupancy or rents that typically happens when there is new supply moving in next door?","Spencer Kirk","","Okay. There are a lot of variables on that Ki Bin. I would say the biggest impact is, what is the population density and how many other self storage facilities are already in the market. So, if you are in southern California in Venice and you\u2019ve got 500,000 people in a three mile radius, there are already 20 self storage facilities serving that population, if you add one property, it\u2019s a 5% increase in supply. And it\u2019s not going to really have material effect. If you\u2019re in Wichita, Kansas and there are two games in town in a three mile ring, it can have a pretty detrimental effect, which is why most of the REITs want to be in the better more densely populated markets. It\u2019s your protection against the downside.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust","Okay. A related question, have you -- how much redevelopment potential do you have in your existing properties in terms of expansion entitlements that have not been used yet? Just trying to get a sense of, if you guys did pursue incremental more development or redevelopment, what the existing potential could be adjusting your properties as well today?","Spencer Kirk","Okay. Ki Bin, we are redeveloping our assets. We\u2019ve been looking at how to keep them relevant in the marketplace by bringing them up to the current standards. In terms of a bunch of properties that have a lot of expansion capability and a lot of vacant parcels next to it, it\u2019s not a lot. What we want to do is just make sure the assets that we have appeal to the customer and regardless of when new development arise into this market, we have an asset that is competitive, it\u2019s well located, it\u2019s well cared for, it\u2019s clean and it meets the customer\u2019s needs and that means you might be adding some climate control to the property, you might be knocking down the office and reconstructing a more retail oriented higher visibility office. So this redevelopment effort is something that we have fully engaged in. And it\u2019s all towards keeping the properties relevant. But in terms of adding lots of square footage because we are sitting on a bunch of vacant land, not so much.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","","Thank you.","Operator","","We have another follow-up question from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Hey, it\u2019s Jordan Sadler. Sorry, I wanted to quickly touch on the tax expense. Obviously, the tender reinsurance business is a good and growing business for you guys and as is that tax liability, so you are obviously making money. Is there another way to shelter some of that liability at this point, given the scale of that [TRS] at this point?","Scott Stubbs","","It\u2019s something we are looking at all the time; there is some risk with these. We want to make sure we about it properly. I think probably there is an opportunity to argue that tenant insurance is standard and customary to the point where you could move it into the REIT but that\u2019s a long process with the IRS but it\u2019s something we are always looking at.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. So potentially it is clean income, like your rental income stream and sort of an ancillary fee associated with owning the facility?","Scott Stubbs","We would need to prove that it is customary standard and the business.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Make sense to me. And then separately on the commercial segment of the business, not a lot of discussion. Are you seeing anything different in the commercial segment of the business relative to your individual renters, are you seeing more traction, less traction, anything, any commentary will be helpful?","Spencer Kirk","Okay, Jordan, it\u2019s Spencer. Here is what I will tell you. I am just coming up on 16 years in self storage. When I started about 20% of the customers were commercial accounts, today it\u2019s about 20%. It hasn\u2019t changed a lot and I don\u2019t expect it to materially shift over the next foreseeable period. So for us, it\u2019s out there; it\u2019s a part of our business; we like it; they tend to be on auto pay; they tend to be less sensitive to rate increases; but in terms of wholesale shift and driving our commercial accounts to 30% or 40% or 50%, market demand just isn\u2019t there and it\u2019s been remarkably consistent for the 16 years that I have been in storage.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you. With that I would like to thank everybody for their interest in Extra Space. We\u2019ll look forward to next quarters call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Norman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Andrew. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s fourth quarter and year-end 2017 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business.","These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review.

The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.","Joseph Margolis","Hello, everyone. Thank you for dialing in. I have been CEO for little over a year now. And over that time, I\u2019ve enjoyed meeting with many of you, and I look forward to continue to meet and talk about Extra Space and Storage throughout 2018. But mostly, I\u2019ve enjoyed working with a great team of talented and motivated people at Extra Space. I\u2019ve learned a lot over the year and I\u2019m excited to continue learning and move towards the future.","One year ago on this call, we discussed the concerns about new supply and deacceleration of revenue growth. At the time, we said that while these concerns were valid, the industry was healthy, and we were confident that our diversified portfolio, best-in-class operating platform and our talented people would produce solid results.","We projected 2017 would be characterized by a gradual return towards historical and sustainable revenue and NOI growth levels. That is exactly what happened. Strong occupancy together with increased rental rates to new and existing customers led to same-store revenue growth for the year of 5.1%, NOI growth of 6.9% and core FFO growth of 13.8%. We exceeded our guidance in each of these categories and we are seeing the predicted soft landing play out.","We also stated the along with the challenges presented by new supply would come opportunities. In 2017, we added 156 stores to our third-party management platform, approximately half of which were new developments, and we have a large pipeline for 2018.","Year-to-date, we have brought on 19 managed stores and we expect to add well over 100 before the year is over. In addition to revenue streams, these managed stores give us scale, density in markets and a larger dataset. Our managed portfolio, as well as our joint ventures provide a valuable acquisition pipeline that helped fuel future growth. These pipelines and relationships were important to us in 2017 with over 80% of our acquisition volume coming to off-market opportunities.","Despite a competitive market, we invested just over $600 million in acquisitions, 16 of our 2017 acquisitions were new Certificate of Occupancy assets in key markets, which like our C of O deals from previous years are performing ahead of projections. We also continue to see increased opportunities from developers to purchase new stores in various stages of lease-up.","Our 2017 acquisitions exceeded our guidance of $400 million, due to $210 million off-market portfolio that was presented to us late in the fourth quarter by one of our longtime partners. As we projected, our acquisitions were largely back-end loaded, with 85% occurring in the fourth quarter.","Finally, I would like to provide an update on the 36-store portfolio that we sold into a joint venture on November 30 for $295 million. We retained a 10% interest in the properties, and one of our existing joint venture partners, TIAA real estate account, purchased the remaining 90%.","We continue to manage all 36 properties for a fee and we now have the opportunity to earn a promoted return in the joint venture. We\u2019ve put the proceeds from the transaction to work the next day through a series of 1031 exchanges into other properties. These 1031 exchange properties have an average age of three years and average rental rate over $20 a square foot and strong demographics.","As a part of this transaction, we agreed with TIAA to extend and revise the terms of our existing 24-storage joint venture. This enabled us to monetize and embed and promote, increasing our ownership in the venture from 25% to 34%. We also placed new debt on the portfolio and modernized its terms, including reducing the preferred return to current market levels.","We are pleased with the outcome of these mutually beneficial transactions and the long-term value they create for our shareholders. We are also pleased to have renewed and strengthened our relationship with TIAA for the long-term.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As you may have noticed in our earnings release last night, we have made a change to one term. We\u2019ve historically provided FFO results, as well as FFO as adjusted. Going forward, we will refer to the latter as core FFO. We have not changed our methodology or the types of adjustments we make, but we have changed the name to provide consistency with other publicly traded REITs.","Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.12 per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $0.02 and core FFO for the year was $4.38 per share. The quarterly beat was primarily due to stronger than expected property performance. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 91.9%, a 40 basis point year-over-year increase. Throughout the quarter, we increased rates to new customers in the low to mid single digits, and we continue our existing customer rate increase program without changes.","We continue to evolve our balance sheet and plan to remain leverage-neutral in 2018. We added unsecured debt throughout the year and have increased our unencumbered pool by $1.4 billion. We have access to multiple sources of capital and have plenty of capacity to fund our future growth.","Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2018. Our new same-store pool will increase by 86 to a total of 787 stores. We expect to change to the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by 25 basis points over the year.","Same-store revenue growth is expected to increase between 3.25% and 4.25% in 2018. Same-store expense growth is also expected to increase between 3.25% to 4.25%. The increase in expenses is driven by difficult 2017 comps, with pressures specifically from property taxes in Florida, Illinois, the mid-Atlantic and Texas. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI of between 3% and 4.5%, which we believe will be towards the high-end of the self-storage sector and will compare favorably to other REIT sectors.","For 2018, we expect to invest $400 million in acquisitions, $255 million of which is closed or under contract. Our guidance assumes acquisitions be financed for $50 million in OP Units and the remainder through debt. Seller pricing expectations are still high and we\u2019re committed to being disciplined. We will only transact at prices that create value for our shareholders. Our full-year core FFO is estimated to be between $4.55 and $4.65 per share.","In 2018, we anticipate $0.05 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores for total dilution of $0.21. Our investment in C of O stores and value-add acquisitions continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and generate long-term growth for our shareholders.","I\u2019ll now turn the time back to Joe.","Joseph Margolis","Thank you, Scott. As we move forward in 2018, I expect this year to look similar to last year. We continue to experience solid fundamentals, steady demand, strong occupancy, and increasing rental rates to new and existing customers. We expect solid external growth through acquisitions and third-party management.","We continue to focus on and invest heavily in technology, in our digital marketing and revenue management systems continue to evolve and improve. Our bench step at all levels of the company has never been stronger, and I believe our team is second to none in the storage sector.","New supply will continue to present operational challenges. And I do not, in any way, want to diminish its impact on some of our stores. But as I have said before, this is a micro market business and the impact of new supply will vary across our portfolio. In 2017, we benefited from our highly diversified portfolio, our ability to capture disproportionate share of demand and a team with a track record of strong execution. I believe we will benefit from these same factors in 2018.","We remain focused on creating consistent FFO growth per share in order to maximize the long-term return on our investors\u2019 capital without taking unacceptable risk. I want to thank you for the trust you put in this management team as stewards of your capital.","I have been involved with Extra Space continuously since 1998, as a partner, as a Board member, and now as CEO. And I\u2019m as confident as ever about the strategy of this company and our team\u2019s ability to execute.","Let\u2019s now turn the time over to Jeff to start the Q&A session.","Jeff Norman","Thanks, Joe. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows, we\u2019ll address follow-on questions once everyone has had the opportunity to ask their initial questions.","And with that, Andrew, go ahead and start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Hughes","Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the time. So the midpoint of guidance calls for about 135-ish basis point slowdown in same-store revenue growth this year. I\u2019m just curious which of your markets contributed to that decelerating outlook the most, eight of your top 10 actually saw accelerating growth into the end of the year?","Joseph Margolis","Go ahead.","Scott Stubbs","Okay. Yes, Jonathan, as we\u2019ve done our budgets, we obviously did ground up budgets, looked at every single store, looked at the supply. The deceleration is implied in a couple of areas. One is the burn-off of the impact from the change in same-store pool or the benefit from SmartStop, so that affects it obviously, and then also the impact of new supply in certain markets.","If you look at those individual markets, some are impacted more than others. But overall, I would tell you, it\u2019s probably more of the ones you hear about a lot, for instance, Florida.","Joseph Margolis","When I look at our bottom 10 markets for projected 2018 revenue growth, the ones that are large contributors to us are the New York Metro, Miami, D.C. The others in our bottom 10 are relatively small markets.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe one of your peers did actually quantify the negative impact at the store level on revenue growth relative to non-impacted stores. Could you may be provide this number and take a stab at maybe how much lower that revenue growth is at those stores impacted by supply?","Joseph Margolis","So that that\u2019s really a difficult analysis to do with any specificity. We study real hard each of our stores that have new competitors opening. And sometimes, you have a new competitor opening within a mile and it has absolutely no effect. And sometimes, you have a new competitor opening on the outskirts of the trade area and it has a very large effect.","So to try to predict based on the number of competitors opening how monetarily it will affect every store and roll that up, that\u2019s a tough thing. You need to take into account the distance, the number of competitors, who\u2019s going to run the new competitors, traffic patterns, whether it\u2019s across the river, or the other side, there\u2019s just many, many variables.","But that being said, when we create our guidance, we created both from a top-down and a bottom-up approach. The top-down is the revenue management team\u2019s impact. The bottom-up is the district managers at each store identify and are provided with each of the competitors that we know of that are going to open in their trade area. And each store\u2019s individual budget is created with, based on the projected impact to that store. And that\u2019s all rolled up and used to create our guidance.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay, that\u2019s a great color. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll jump off. Thanks for the time.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Jonathan.","Joseph Margolis","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Wes Golladay","Hey, guys. Actually had a question on those variables that determine the impact of supply. But what do you think is the most important? Is it the actual radius? Is it the rationality of the developer? Is it the price point that you\u2019re at? And then, yes, take that one. And I guess, maybe a follow-up would be, what is your actual supply outlook for 2018 and 2019?","Joseph Margolis","So certainly, distance is a very, very important factor. We also think the operator is a very, very important factor. We would much rather compete with a mom-and-pop than one of our public peers. After that, you have a lot of other factors, saturation and traffic patterns and population growth, and all kinds of other things that go into the mix.","And then the second question was about development outlook? Is that correct?","Wes Golladay","Yes, the supply outlook, I guess, maybe for your markets from a bottom-up\u2019s perspective, maybe 2018 and 2019. Are you still seeing delays on deliveries?","Joseph Margolis","So we are still seeing delays on deliveries, that\u2019s true. It\u2019s interesting when you look at the supply outlook on our markets, we really have, in many cases, kind of not intuitive results. So I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples, because that was a real bunch of gobbledygook.","So in Atlanta, for example, we have 67 stores. And Atlanta is a market that there is a great deal of development. But when we look at how many of our stores are going to be impacted by new development in 2018, we only see six and that number was two in 2017.","So even though that\u2019s a market, where there\u2019s a lot of supply coming because of the locations of our stores, we\u2019re a little more optimistic about that market. And in fact, when we look at our projected revenue growth for that market, it\u2019s above our guidance. It\u2019s above our portfolio average.","On the other end of the spectrum, you could look at a market like Portland, where we have 13 stores and 10 of them are going to face new competitors in 2018, after three of them facing new competitors in 2016. So that\u2019s a market, where our projected revenue growth is below our portfolio average. And we could go through 67 markets and give you all those stats, but it gives you a sense of how we created our guidance.","Wes Golladay","Yes. Maybe we\u2019ve done a presentation someday. But yes, thank you for the answers on that.","Joseph Margolis","Thanks, Wes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys. Just following up on some of your supply commentary, are you seeing any shift in development or even acquisition yields, as buyers presumably adjust some of the rent growth expectations here?","Joseph Margolis","I really haven\u2019t seen any movement in cap rates for acquisitions. You would think giving the operational landscape and the rising interest rates, the cap rate should be going up. But there is so much interest in this sector, I think, because compared to other sectors, it\u2019s still pretty good that we just haven\u2019t seen any meaningful expansion of cap rates.","The development yields is kind of an interesting question. One thing we\u2019re seeing is that in our ManagementPlus platform, when we produce a budget for a developer, we\u2019re getting a lot more pressure from the developers that our projections aren\u2019t good enough, and they\u2019re pushing us and they need a better budget to bring to the bank. So that\u2019s telling me that given their costs, our projected budget doesn\u2019t hit a required yield. So to me that is a something that is going to control somewhat the pipeline of development.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And in your opening remarks, you did talk about seeing an increase opportunity for stores that are in lease-up. So I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s your appetite really is today in taking on some of those additional lease-up for C of O type of deals?","Joseph Margolis","Yes. So we have a strong appetite for buying good deals that meet our return requirements. And what we\u2019ve seen in the market is a number of developers at delivered stores, they\u2019ve gone to a certain point in lease-up, maybe it\u2019s stalling out, maybe they feel they just want to take their chips off the table and they\u2019re willing to sell beforehand.","If we can negotiate a price that we think provides value to our shareholders, we have enough dry powder, enough capital to execute. But if we can\u2019t get to that price then we\u2019re going to sit on the sidelines.","Jeremy Metz","Appreciate that. Last one for me is just in terms of the movements for the quarter, how did those net effective rents compared to the fourth quarter last year? So baking into \u2013 baking in the discounts and then just how are they trending so far in 2018 as well?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So our Street rates in the quarter, as well as into the current year have been about 5%, and our achieved rate has been closer to 3%, and that for the fourth quarter and then into this year.","Jeremy Metz","Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","And then in terms of discounts, I would tell you, we\u2019re discounting larger dollar amounts, but fewer tenants. But at this time of year, you\u2019re giving discounts to just about everyone anyway. So we are discounting slightly more.","Jeremy Metz","Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Jeremy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Todd Stender","Hi, guys. Just when you look at your size, scale and sophistication and Joe\u2019s remarks of competing against the REIT\u2019s versus the mom-and-pops. What are some of the defense measures for lack of the better term that you roll out when a new competing store opens up? It would seem to me that you\u2019d be able to match price or write out any discounting that the new competitions are offering a longer than they can, maybe just talk about how you compete potentially longer than the new build?","Joseph Margolis","Sure. So I could tell you that we do have a plan that we developed a playbook that sets out a series of actions that stores undertake when faced with new development. I could tell you that it\u2019s mostly reactionary, because as much as we think we know, they\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s all a little different. Specifically what we do, I\u2019m not really willing to tell you what our plan is.","Todd Stender","Okay. And then not sure if I missed this, but just talk about the C of O deals that we had seen kind of, I guess, demand waned as 2017 went along for the REITs, but you guys had an appetite obviously in Q4. Can you just talk about the stabilized yields that you\u2019re projecting, and then how long until you get to stabilized occupancy?","Joseph Margolis","Sure. So we approved 14 C of O deals in 2017, that\u2019s a pretty big drop off from the 38 C of O deals we approved in 2016. Seven of those we\u2019ll do in ventures, that allows us to control the dilution, reduce our risk and get a little enhanced yield because of management fees and tenant insurance. The stabilized cap rate on those 14 deals was 8.2%. They\u2019re all underwritten to stabilize within 36 and 40 months. But I\u2019ve got to tell you, we continue to outperform that number, but we\u2019re still underwriting between 36 and 40 months.","Todd Stender","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph Margolis","Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about the changes and promotion usage during the quarter and maybe thus far this year? I noticed that there were a lot less advertised promotions on the web, at least. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a larger change in philosophy, or is it just down to timing?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you it\u2019s not a large change in philosophy. We\u2019ve always used discounts through various channels. I think, if you look at the web that\u2019s just one channel, but overall, our discounts are actually up. So if you\u2019re only looking at the web and they\u2019re down, that\u2019s one channel.","Ki Bin Kim","And was that, because you were trying to program or train the customers not to be so used to getting promotions, or what was the reason behind that?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you that all in an effort to maximize revenue. I mean, at the end of the day, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do and we\u2019re trying to adjust those channels a little bit on the margins as we go. But it\u2019s going to vary by market, vary by channel at all times.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just last question. If I look at your LA market and I know LA is a big market. Your rent per square foot is about 19. Your PSA is at 25, and I use them just because they\u2019re a large competitor. And your New York rent is 22% versus 25% of your peers. Is there anything to say for the lower rent absolute number that might help some of your momentum in same-store revenue going forward?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you that\u2019s a mix of properties. I think that if you look at our properties where they absolutely compete, it\u2019s not a lot different. You also are probably including a little bit of the Inland Empire into Riverside and that type of thing.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Ki Bin.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Robert Simone","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question on the TIAA deal and then I have a follow-up. Is there anything on the table for 2018 that could look similar to the TIAA deal, a.k.a. is that kind of be like a funding source of choice going forward? And then also I was just wondering if you guys could comment at all on what type or what size of portfolio premiums you\u2019re seeing out there right now?","Joseph Margolis","We don\u2019t have a portfolio we\u2019re currently packaging up to do a repeat of that type of deal. But that being said, it\u2019s always an option for us. I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s a capital avenue of choice. I would say, it\u2019s one of many options we have. We always want to be in a position to have a certain segment of the portfolio teed up, where we could repeat that transaction in an effort to rebalance the portfolio and improve its quality.","What was the second question?","Robert Simone","Oh, yes. I was just wondering if you could comment at all on what kind of spread or base point portfolio premium we\u2019re seeing out in the market right now, given how much capital is out there?","Joseph Margolis","Yes, that\u2019s a hard question. I guess, 50 basis points. But it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a difficult question.","Robert Simone","Got it. So it really varies.","Joseph Margolis","There\u2019s not a whole lot of transactions to give you a bunch of data points where you could come up with something if you\u2019re real comfortable with.","Scott Stubbs","And also depend on what you call a portfolio. Is it four properties, or is it 36? I think, there\u2019s a big difference.","Robert Simone","Right. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you, I\u2019m sure you saw an addition to a bunch of management changes. PSA made an announcement that looks like they are going into the third-party management business as well after a number of years, there\u2019s nothing in that section. I\u2019m just curious as how you\u2019re thinking about competition in that space, and if you have come up against them at all as you approach properties at your platform?","Joseph Margolis","Sure, Smedes, it\u2019s a good question. So we\u2019ve been in the partnership business, if you will, since 1998. It\u2019s part of our our D&A, and we manage for other people. We\u2019ve done it for the longtime and we think we\u2019re pretty good at it.","So, obviously, having another entry into the market to compete for market share is not a good thing, and we\u2019re going to have to compete with them. And frankly, as long as we can put up numbers that exceed our competitors, we can have a very good argument about why people should choose us for management.","But I also think that the overall pie is getting bigger. More and more people are recognizing that they need professional management that they can\u2019t compete with the REITs. So while I \u2013 while it is difficult to see a new market entrance, then one that\u2019s capable like PSA, I also think the pie is getting bigger at the same time.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, there\u2019s a lot. As you know, supply remains a big concern. You touched on it a little bit. But I mean, do you have a view as to whether or not the supply will peak this year in terms of just sort of nationwide new deliveries, or do you feel like it\u2019s more of a 2019 event or later?","Joseph Margolis","Yes. I don\u2019t think we have a strong view. It\u2019s really difficult to have transparency into 2019 and see what\u2019s going to be delivered given the fallout rate and in some markets the quickness, which some of these properties can be entitled and shovel stuck in the ground.","Smedes Rose","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Smedes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Todd Thomas","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, your comments about developers sort of pushing back a little bit for higher budgets or higher projections. What\u2019s been your experience in those situations? Are they still moving forward? Are they getting the financing they need? Maybe opting to work with someone else? What sort of happened in those situations? And how big is the shortfall on average, would you say, between where you are and where the developer thought they\u2019d be or needed to be?","Joseph Margolis","Yes. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have the answer to the last one. I got to have to go talk to our guys about that. But we do have a \u2013 we do \u2013 obviously, we can\u2019t move our budgets to satisfy some bank or developer, because we didn\u2019t have to deliver. So we can only produce budgets that we\u2019re comfortable delivering on, and we\u2019re seeing the higher fallout rate. We\u2019re seeing that projects, at least, with us. They \u2013 more of them don\u2019t get done.","Todd Thomas","So to your knowledge, sort of tracking those projects as far as you know that they\u2019ve been abandoned or deferred for the time being?","Joseph Margolis","We see some probably a greater portion of them being abandoned. And there\u2019s other high leverage sources of capital out there. There\u2019s other ways to get deals done. But I think a good number of them get abandoned.","Scott Stubbs","Well, there\u2019s also local management companies things like that. I mean, there\u2019s local management companies. There\u2019s other opportunities for them, but I would tell you, things are still getting done with banks. I think that the local banks, as well as some of the large banks are still doing a relationship lending, but it is more and more difficult.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then, Joe, your comments about soft landing at the beginning of your comments. Can you just talk about what that means in the context of fundamentals? The deceleration that you\u2019re forecasting in 2018 for revenue growth at 135 basis points, is that the bottom, or do you think that we could continue to see additional deceleration as we head into 2019?","Joseph Margolis","So it\u2019s pretty early to start talking about 2019. But we\u2019ve said that, we believe the industry is going to return to historical revenue growth numbers. And I would think by the end of the year, we would be there.","Todd Thomas","Okay. So growth \u2013 so you would expect growth to bottom out in 2018? You\u2019ve historically said that your revenue growth is in a sort of 3.5% to 4.5% range, I believe over a longer period of time, right? And so we\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re expecting that to be \u2013 you\u2019re expecting revenue growth to be slightly below that longer-term average in 2018. And so by the end of 2018, you\u2019d expect to get back into that longer-term range?","Joseph Margolis","Yes, that is our expectation. Now we could have some economic shock that we don\u2019t all view or something happened. But currently, that\u2019s our view.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And just lastly, Scott, can you just tell us where occupancy is today, and how that looks on a year-over-year basis?","Scott Stubbs","So occupancy is pretty close to where we ended the year. It\u2019s down slightly from year-end just with the cyclical nature of the product. Your lowest occupancy is typically January, February, but it is year-over-year, it\u2019s not that different from year-end and it\u2019s in accordance with our plan.","Todd Thomas","Okay, great. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks for taking my question, again. Just a quick one. Have you noticed any performance difference between assets of different physical quality or by the age of equality, or age of the asset?","Scott Stubbs","I think it depends on the location of the asset, the quality, the square feet per person in the market, it\u2019s a lot more to it than just the age of the asset.","Joseph Margolis","How much capital has been put into it. I mean, clearly, your point is that, if you have two assets in the exact same market and one brand-new and one is old and hasn\u2019t been taken care of, the brand-new one should perform better. But in old, capital stock asset can do very well in some other markets.","Ki Bin Kim","Yes, that\u2019s right. I mean, I was looking at it all else equal. And are the developers generally doubling down in the markets they\u2019ve already developed in, or do you see them moving on to different submarkets or different MSAs?","Joseph Margolis","Well, that\u2019s a great question. I ask our ManagementPlus guys to give us kind of their observations before all of these costs, and that was one of the observations they gave us is, previously they saw people just inundating markets, and now they\u2019re seeing people spread out some more. So yes, we do see that trend.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Ki Bin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. So I just wanted to clarify your comments about the 25 basis points impact from the changes in the pool. Is that a combination of the 30 stores that you disposed off of? And is there any ongoing benefit from SmartStop in that number? Is that separate, or is there no benefit?","Scott Stubbs","There is some benefit from SmartStop and then a \u2013 some benefit from the change in pool. So we\u2019re growing from the 701 that we ended the year at. Two, we\u2019re adding the 2016 acquisitions, as well as some certificate of occupancy deals that are now stabilized. The 2016 acquisitions are not going to add a large amount, as many of those were joint ventures or previously managed. So it\u2019s a combination primarily of the C of O deals that are being added, as well as the little added benefit from SmartStop.","Vikram Malhotra","And that total is 25 basis points?","Scott Stubbs","Correct. It\u2019s higher at the start of the year, going closer to zero at the end of the year. So if you think of it in terms of a line, it\u2019s 50 basis points at the start and zero at the end for an average of 25.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, thanks. And then just second, turning to West Coast, any changes you\u2019ve seen in either San Francisco or LA in terms of maybe more LA in terms of new supply. Any sense of \u2013 do you see the market being as strong as it was last year? Are there any pockets of weakness? And just comparing to sort of some of the multifamily folks who are seeing maybe more deceleration than, at least, I thought. Just want to compare and contrast those two markets?","Joseph Margolis","So we are seeing some deacceleration in Los Angeles. There is a little bit of new supply, but nothing anywhere close to what we see in Florida or Texas or other markets. A lot of it is in Irvine and there\u2019s a few in Los Angeles. San Francisco is \u2013 we see no new supply in San Francisco, at least, none that affects our stores. And that\u2019s a market we actually \u2013 our 2018 projected revenue is accelerating is higher than in 2017.","So these \u2013 those two markets are still very strong for us. I don\u2019t think markets like that can be as strong as they were into 2015 and 2016 forever, but they\u2019re still very strong markets performing above our portfolio averages.","Vikram Malhotra","And just, if I may, just to clarify, you said San Francisco is one of the markets that\u2019s accelerating. Just can you give us a sense of maybe two other markets in that top band that are accelerating in your guide?","Joseph Margolis","Yes, I can give you exactly two other markets, because we have three. Maryland and West Florida, Naples are other accelerating markets.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Vikram.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is now open.","Trent Trujillo","Hi, this is Trent Trujillo here on for Nick, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just getting into another market in New York looks like on your supplemental disclosure you combined, I guess, the boroughs with New Jersey. Is it possible to break out the performance of how your portfolio performed in the fourth quarter and the trends you\u2019re seeing on the ground now?","Joseph Margolis","Sure. So absent the borough stores, our New York, New Jersey market had 4.5% revenue growth, 22% expense, so 6.3% NOI growth. We have eight stores in the boroughs, so pretty limited exposure. Our revenue in the boroughs was negative 2.5 and for a negative 2.9 NOI.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. And since you acquired or took on the tuck-it-away stores just kind of mid-year, how have those stores performed since they\u2019ve been under the EXR brand?","Joseph Margolis","We\u2019re still early in the transition, no storage needed significant attention to the physical assets. And we have spent a lot of time doing that, getting our people in there. But I would say, overall, they are performing at expectations.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. And maybe one more, if I may. On the same-store expense side,. I know there\u2019s pressure that you spoke about with property taxes than perhaps other line items. But is there a potential for an offset or an expense reduction opportunity?","Scott Stubbs","We\u2019re always looking for those, but it is typically smaller items. Our biggest pressure this year is coming from property taxes, which accounts for about a third of your expense and then your next largest or one of your largest expense item is payroll and it\u2019s coming in just north of 3%, which is inflationary plus. But there\u2019s not \u2013 anything else comes in below, it doesn\u2019t drive the needle very much.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Trent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hoglund with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","George Hoglund","Hey, guys, two questions for me. One on the supply side. I mean, you had mentioned two markets, Atlanta and Portland, where you gave numbers of how many properties are facing new supply. And do you have a number just across the portfolio generally, how many properties are facing new supply in 2018 and what was the number in 2017?","Joseph Margolis","So it\u2019s a little under 300 properties in 2018 and maybe closer to 250 in 2017.","Scott Stubbs","And that depends on the geographic\u2026","Joseph Margolis","Yes, I\u2019m sorry, this is \u2013 let me back up. This is a new supply opening within a three-mile radius. And we perfectly recognize that that is not \u2013 that\u2019s a convention and not a totally accurate description of what new supply will affect you. In New York City, three miles is irrelevant. In other areas, three miles is too small. But to have some type of consistent approach in numbers, that\u2019s what we used.","George Hoglund","And was your best guess for 2019 be greater or lower than 300?","Joseph Margolis","I don\u2019t have a guess for 2019 at this point.","George Hoglund","Okay. And then just on the demand side, what\u2019s your sense on how certain factors will influence demand in kind of 2018 things such as you have greater apartment deliveries overall, strengthening economy, more disposable income, how will that affect the demand side?","Joseph Margolis","Okay. Everything that we see and feel and experience tells us that demand is very, very steady, and there\u2019s \u2013 we have no indication that demand is waning. The top of the funnel is very strong and growing and our job is to convert as many as possible.","George Hoglund","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude our Q&A session today. I would now like to turn the call back to Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Joe Margolis for any further remarks.","Joseph Margolis","I want to thank, everyone, for their participation today and interest in Extra Space.

(Operator Instructions)  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I will now turn the conference over to your host for today Mr. Clint Halverson, Vice President Investor Relations.  Please proceed.","","Clint Halverson","","Welcome to Extra Space Storages third quarter 2012 conference call.  In addition to our press release we\u2019ve furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.  Please remember that managements\u2019 prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.  Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business.","These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC which we encourage our listeners to review.  Forward-looking statements represent managements\u2019 estimates as of today, Tuesday, October 30, 2012.  The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.  ","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer F. Kirk ","As we start this call I would like to simply say we are keenly aware of the natural disaster that has taken place and is still yet in process.  We aware of the destruction and disruption in people\u2019s lives and we want you to know that our thoughts and prayers are with all those that are being impacted, recognizing fully that the aftermath and the challenges going forward are not fully known nor what the course of the storm will yet be.  We want to just acknowledge that this is not an optimal time for a call but nonetheless we had to make a decision and we have elected to go forward.  But know that we are going to keep good thoughts for all those that have been in harm\u2019s way or will yet be affected.","Extra Space did have an outstanding quarter thanks to the diligent focused efforts of the entire team.  The environment and culture here are riveted on innovation, technology and performance.  Additionally, our industry leading results speak to the depth and sophistication of our systems, our processes, and our unique financial and ownership structures.  ","I\u2019ve spoken many times about our ability to deliver double digit FFO growth.  This past quarter was no exception with a robust 34% year-over-year increase.  Property performance was strong and our results benefited from accretive acquisitions.  Speaking of accretive acquisitions, we currently have six properties with an aggregate purchase price of $15 million slated to close by the end of the year on top of the $486 million already closed in 2012.  ","We continue to execute in a meaningful and substantive way to grow the REIT from open market and off market acquisitions.  We are delighted with the success of this quarter and our performance year-to-date.  We are keenly aware that the comps for next year will be a very large hurdle.  Please remember this statement.  I\u2019d now like to turn the time over to Carl to talk about operations.","Karl T. Haas ","During the third quarter we experienced very strong same store revenue growth of 6.8% especially in light of the 4.9% revenue growth we had in the third quarter last year.  Year-to-date same store revenue is up 6.6%.  We continue to see our Internet marketing and revenue management strategies pay big dividends.  As we refine our pricing model we will continue to steal market share from our smaller competitors.","Rental demand for storage remained stable in the third quarter and we haven\u2019t seen a meaningful influx of new supply which resulted in record high occupancy levels for our portfolio.  We ended the quarter at approximately 90%, up nearly 2% over last year.  Stable rentals coupled with the lack of new supply allowed us to increase street rates 5% on average per quarter.  ","Same store expenses continue to be below budget.  The primary drivers for expenses being down by 2.8% were lower repair and maintenance costs, continued benefits from sustainability initiatives and lower credit card processing fees.  The benefit of lower credit card processing fees began in October last year and this will dissipate in the fourth quarter.  ","Discounts were down year-over-year 15% for the quarter and 10% for the year.  This is due to higher occupancy and a focused effort to offer the right price and promotion.  All those combined to produce third quarter same store operating income of 11.4% on top of 7.3% growth last year.  With that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Scott for a little bit more.","Scott Stubbs ","Yesterday we reported third quarter FFO of $0.43 per share inclusive of a $2.5 million charge related to our acquisitions.  We exceeded the top end of our quarterly guidance by $0.02.  This can be attributed primarily to better than expected same store property results and the performance and timing of our 2012 acquisitions.  ","We\u2019ve had a banner year for acquisitions.  During the quarter we closed on 53 properties for approximately $450 million.  Of these 53 properties, 36 were from the Prudential transaction.  As of today, we have six additional assets under contract for just over $50 million.  These six properties are located in Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey and will be great additions to our portfolio.  With the acquisitions closed during the quarter we now have 416 wholly owned assets compared to 304 joint venture properties and 190 third-party sites under management.  We continue to focus on growing the REIT in a disciplined and meaningful way.  ","As of September 30th the company had five separate lines of credit with the total capacity of $340 million with $240 million drawn on these lines.  Subsequent to the end of the quarter we paid off the $100 million GE line that recently matured and replaced this line with secured loans.  Interest rates continue to be at all time lows.  As a point of reference we recently closed a five year loan at 2.8% and a seven year loan at 3.2%, both loans were swapped fixed.  ","Based on the results for the third quarter, we\u2019ve raised our full year 2012 FFO guidance to be between $1.56 and $1.58 per share.  Key assumptions relating to these estimates can be found in our press release.  With that I\u2019ll now turn the time back to Spencer for some closing remarks.","Spencer F. Kirk ","This year we have had one main theme and that is to focus on fundamentals.  Simply put, to maximize every revenue opportunity and appropriately minimize every expense.  Our third quarter results show that this focus is paying off.  We will continue to drive innovation in our systems, our marketing and our operating platform to capture the right customer, at the right price, at the right time.  ","It is no surprise but uncertainty seems to be once again a primary theme this earning season.  The word is being dropped frequently in many conference calls so far and it echoes much of what we are hearing both on and off the street.  However, we remain optimistic about the self storage sector and our ability to produce solid results for our shareholders going forward.  ","With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the time over to Clint to start the Q&A session.","Clint Halverson","We understand that there are several individuals that are not able to join us on the call today.  We would invite those that are on the call to ask all the questions that they have at this time and then we would invite those who are not able to be on the call to meet with us at NAREIT in the next few weeks.  With that we\u2019ll turn it over to the operator to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from David Toti \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","David Toti \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","I just have a couple of small questions.  I just want to discuss the acquisition strategy a little bit.  In terms of the operating platform, do you think there\u2019s a size where you sort of reach maturity because the pace has been pretty aggressive for a couple of years now?  Or, is it sort of an infinite proposition in your view?","Spencer F. Kirk ","When we started to build Extra Space we had scalability in mind.  That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had a significant technology focus and from my perspective operationally this is close to being infinitely scalable.  It\u2019s the vision we had and it\u2019s the way we have structured our systems and processes.  In terms of the integration of a fairly robust year of acquisition activity, I think we\u2019ve managed it well.  We\u2019ve been measured, we\u2019ve been disciplined and the good news as we talked about the 53 acquisitions in Q3 alone, 36 of those were from Prudential.  They were already in our system.","The management plus progress we\u2019ve had in growing that third-party management where we\u2019ve prospected and brought some of those properties in our balance sheet.  Once again, those were already branded Extra Space, our systems, our people behind the counter and so as you look at the three ways we can grow either the REIT through open market or off market transactions and the growth of the management plus program, I think most of these speak to reasonable pace and minimal risk as we go forward.","David Toti \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","At a certain point does it make sense to start putting some of the weaker assets, I know generally the operators are hesitant to do that because of the scale issue, but when you get to a certain size maybe there\u2019s some sense in dispositions?","Spencer F. Kirk ","Dispositions are something that certainly we look at.  As I\u2019ve said many times, we\u2019re in the process of building the company and as conduit loans and other things provide some flexibility we\u2019ll take a look at it but I think the primary word for us is growth not dismantling.","David Toti \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","My last question on this topic, as the operating base grows are there other synergies you expect in terms of operating leverage over the existing basket or is it just an expansion of the current synergies?  In other words are there expense savings that you expect to obtain as you sort of get into a new size?","Spencer F. Kirk ","I think size and scale still matter but I would say we\u2019re starting to talk out on the margins.  I don\u2019t think it would be reasonable to model in anything that is on a large scale or substantive base because I just don\u2019t see it.","David Toti \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","My last question, you mentioned in the press release that incentives were down.  How do you guys read that?  Is it just sort of the period, is it because of your occupancy levels, or is it just the overall environment where pricing power is increasing for you?","Karl T. Haas ","Discounts are down because our occupancy is up and as we reach certain occupancy thresholds it\u2019s done by unit type and so the discounts available for our managers to offer go down.  The first step is taking it down from full month to half month and then to no months.  The good thing is our major competitors are also more occupied and they\u2019re doing the same thing.","Operator","","Your next question comes from [Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors].","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","I hate to ask an insensitive question about the store but I\u2019m just curious if you have any intel on your own portfolio and any damage there may be?  Then also, is there any reason to expect that this particular storm wouldn\u2019t be beneficial for the industry like prior big storms have been?","Spencer F. Kirk ","It\u2019s not an insensitive question, it\u2019s just a matter of fact that we have to deal with the environment in which we\u2019re doing business and natural challenges and those things.  First of all, the storm is far from over.  We\u2019ve had a team that has been up all night.  What I can tell you today is we\u2019ve got one store that we know has about four feet of water in the office and the property has some serious problems.  But the vast majority of our stores are open for business and I think the preliminary report is positive and that we\u2019re in reasonably good shape.  But not knowing what the path and the rest of this storm has out there I would hate to prognosticate where I don\u2019t know.","Natural disasters obviously help drive the business.  We also know that there will be some expenses associated with this but the indications are right now that the guidance we have given that Scott just talked about is what we still maintain as the likely outcome for the performance of this company in Q4.  ","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","Then just as it pertains to your insurance business, that obviously had another good quarter in 3Q with expenses down.  Do you expect that the storm will reverse that trend next quarter or maybe even in 1Q?  I\u2019m not sure of what the lack is on sort of when those claims might be paid out or how that works?","Scott Stubbs ","We would expect them to be up some in the fourth quarter and potentially trailing into the first quarter of next year.  But, we had a pretty serious storm go through last year in the same area in New Jersey and while claims did go up slightly it wasn\u2019t like they spiked a significant amount.  The other thing that we\u2019re sorting through is which of those claims will be covered whether or not it\u2019s from rising water or from wind damage because certain types of things are excluded in the coverage.","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","Then just one more question and I\u2019ll hop back in the queue, I guess this one would be for Karl.  Karl, I would assume that rent growth this quarter was about 5% or so on average.  My question is, is more than 100% of that coming from increases on existing customers?  In other words, are move in rates still lower than move out rates or is that starting to dissipate?","Karl T. Haas ","No, it\u2019s starting to balance out.  It really depends on the length of stay.  If you take it on a micro basis, customers that have been with us for a long time can be well above street rates and so there is some negative churn for those but on balance we\u2019re not losing a lot it\u2019s pretty relatively flat Our street and existing customer rates are really close together.  ","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","So when tenants move out that\u2019s kind of flat revenue then assuming it\u2019s back filled but then the rent growth is really just coming from existing customer increases?","Karl T. Haas ","Yes and street rates being up slightly in comparison to the prior year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Salinksky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinksky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","First question, you talked about 5% street rate growth in the quarter, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s year-over-year.  Can you talk about how that trended through the quarter?  I believe when you talked back in July I think you said 3% so it sounds like there was some nice acceleration.  Also, can you give us a sense what you\u2019re seeing in October?","Karl T. Haas ","It is up and down continuously.  Our system controls it and it\u2019s doing it based on a very micro basis property-by-property unit type by unit type and so it goes up, it goes down.  I think it\u2019s better to look at it in a longer period of time rather than trying to get either excited or depressed about it being up and down week-to-week and month-to-month.","Michael Salinksky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Can you talk a little bit then I guess about the trend, what you\u2019ve seen under that pretense of the last 90 days?","Karl T. Haas ","It\u2019s holding pretty well.  Our occupancy is actually slightly above where we expected it to be, our delta to prior year.  So that\u2019s enabling us to hold the rates a little better.  Then it\u2019s a combination of that and the other significant benefit is just at the higher levels of occupancy we\u2019re giving away less discounts so our achieved rate continues to trend very favorably. ","Michael Salinksky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","The second question a little bit on asset pricing, have you seen any compression on cap rates I\u2019d say over the last 90 to 120 days?  Also, are you seeing any increase in volume, the amount of properties being put on the market by sellers at this point?","Spencer F. Kirk ","In terms of cap rate compression the last 90 days I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been substantive I would say as we\u2019ve looked out for deals we still think for us, somewhere between 6.5% and 8% is the sweet spot.  It obviously depends on the quality of the asset, the market in which that asset is located and other things because there is a broad range of variability in terms of asset quality.  But as we look at transactional volume we see opportunities, we\u2019re bidding on opportunities, there seems to be a fair amount of interest.  One of the big questions for us is what happens between November 6th and the end of the year and that\u2019s one of the unknowns.  I will say that after November 6th or 7th it becomes a little tougher to transact but we do expect there will be increased activity potentially.","Michael Salinksky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","The final question and kind of bigger picture question, we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of supply or starts in the storage space over the last 18 months, actually probably longer than that, but given the rent growth that you\u2019re seeing and the occupancy pick up in the storage spaces, when do you expect supply to start ramping up there?","Spencer F. Kirk ","It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.  I think I made a comment previously in another call that the bankers have been a little bit reluctant to loan against new construction.  As we\u2019ve demonstrated quite amply, if you\u2019ve got a stabilized asset you can get loans all day long but new construction has been a little problematic.  Once you are kind of in that mode, it\u2019s a year or two to get an entitlement, a year to build it and then two to four years to lease it up and having spoken with a number of folks in the industry I reaffirm that I think in major markets there might be several dozen properties being built and maybe in the entire country several hundred.  ","We\u2019re not back in the hay day of the mid 2000s, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 we\u2019re on average 2,500 or 2,600 properties a year were being built.  So it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess but this is one of those things that is driving the performance of the self storage sector and that is there is relatively no new supply and as I go around for instance I hear of a city like Phoenix might have three, four, or five assets come out of the ground we are not seeing massive amounts of supply.  It\u2019s going to just depend on market dynamics and financing and a whole host of issues but right now it\u2019s really good if you\u2019re an existing storage operator.  ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Just to follow up on the question about the acquisition environment, are you seeing more, particularly out of your third-party platform more owners being more willing to sell driven by tax policy concerns?","Scott Stubbs ","We have seen an increase over the last 60 days of owners wanting to get a transaction done by the end of the year.  They may or may not be able to get that down or we may be able to agree on pricing or not but we have seen more individual sellers versus portfolio deals.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Then out of the joint venture funds is it the normal course of capital recycle through your joint venture partners or is there a strategic change with they\u2019re being apparently more willing to sell those assets?","Scott Stubbs ","We would tell you it depends on the fund and their objectives.  Each fund is going to have different objectives but for the most part many of them are looking to buy more self storage rather than divest of their self storage investment.  All of our partners have been very happy with the performance of self storage.  ","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Spencer, you had mentioned in one of your earlier responses that not only your occupancies are high but many in the sector are high.  Even if we do see a more normal seasonality pattern through the trough in February, doesn\u2019t that suggest that portfolio occupancies will be higher than normal heading into the spring leasing cycle which should translate into some pretty healthy pricing power?","Spencer F. Kirk ","That is our hope.  There\u2019s a lot of distance between now and then Paula but that\u2019s one of the things we have modeled that with virtually no new supply and our occupancies being at the highest level we\u2019ve ever seen.  Going into the next prime season we\u2019re optimistic that it\u2019s going to be a good year for us and we\u2019ll capture and deliver some solid results.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","A couple of questions, first where are your street REITs today relative to the peak of the market back in \u201907?","Spencer F. Kirk ","I\u2019m not sure I have that handy.  Probably above it but we\u2019ve gotten back and above where we were but I don\u2019t have it handy with me.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","On the insurance side I just want to follow up and make sure I understand, there was a suggestion that not all claims fall under the policy, is flooding or water damage not caused by wind not covered under your insurance policies?","Spencer F. Kirk ","Generally no, we have two different types of coverage.  We have a general insurance policy and then a flood rider also.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","What percentage of the tenants who generally elect the general go for the flood as well?","Spencer F. Kirk ","Well, we just started offering the flood rider in the middle of this year so it\u2019s not a high percentage of our customers who actually have the flood rider.  ","Karl T. Haas ","I view it as a positive if our customers do have coverage and in an instance like this it helps to further enhance our salability of insurance and drives home the point that it\u2019s a good thing to have insurance.  So we will probably experience some claims but that\u2019s not a bad thing.  It helps our managers feel better about having this program and it will also drive home the point to our customers which is the same thing I think the big insurance companies, they\u2019re going to take a bit hit here but they\u2019re well able to do that and on a go forward basis it\u2019s probably going to help their business.  We view it in the long run one, it\u2019s good for our customers and two, it\u2019s going to be good for us.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","If I go back and look at the positive impact that other web related disasters have had on the storage business particularly let\u2019s take a Florida hurricane for example, is there a way you can help us quantify how much of an uptick in demand let\u2019s say over a 30 to 90 day period you typically see after one of these events?","Spencer F. Kirk ","It\u2019s tough to quantify the uptick.  What we can tell you is our internal discussions have been look, we\u2019re at 90% occupancy at the end of the quarter we don\u2019t have that much more headroom for the maneuvering.  This is very different than five years ago and so I would suggest we\u2019re going to have some gain in revenue, we\u2019ll probably see some nice uptick in occupancy in some of those affected areas.  We\u2019re also going to have some claims and I think the revenue and expenses we still reaffirm our guidance, I think it\u2019s still in that range of $1.56 to $1.58 for the full year.  We\u2019re not modeling anything dramatically different and that\u2019s based on lots of experience over lots of years.  ","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","When I look at your supplemental and I look at for the quarter on a year-over-year basis you had about 1,100 fewer rentals and about 554 higher vacates so those numbers how should we think about those heading into next year?  Obviously, we\u2019d like the signs in front of those numbers be reversed.","Scott Stubbs ","One of the things we caution people on is not to get too hung up on the year-over-year because last year may have been abnormally good or bad so what we generally focus on is how those trends appear on a seven year trend.  So we look at our rentals and vacates over a seven year period and we would tell you that those numbers lay right in the middle.  In addition to that our occupancy is higher than that so we would expect rentals to be down slightly and vacates to up slightly so there\u2019s obviously fewer units to rent and more people to vacate.","Spencer F. Kirk ","There\u2019s also one other thing to consider.  We do somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 rentals a month depending on seasonality.  When you pick a data point say you have 1,100 fewer and 500 greater, the order of magnitude we\u2019re talking 1% to 1.5% in context and I think a lot of that is well within the range of normal business cycle variations or normal economic changes that can\u2019t be modeled or forecast.  I go back to what Scott said, you need to be careful when you\u2019re taking a look at those numbers.","Karl T. Haas ","Plus, we focus on square footage not necessarily just units and our square foot delta is actually exceeding our expectations and we\u2019re pleased with where we are.  We expect our square foot delta, the gap to continue to close because we\u2019re \u2013 although I\u2019ve been saying this for a while and our system has changed a little bit where it\u2019s not just totally driven by occupancy so it hasn\u2019t closed as quickly as I would have thought but we\u2019re still in a plus two to the same time last year and in October at almost 90% occupancy.  We are where we want to be.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Then just two quick housekeeping items, when did the bulk of the acquisitions close during the quarter?","Spencer F. Kirk ","First of all G&A impact has already been modeled in everything we\u2019ve given you, no change there.  [Tim] has come back as Chairman of the Board and Chief Investment Officer and I think he\u2019s doing a good job in helping us to identify opportunities.  We are modeling officially the financial impact started July 1, 2012.  ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line [Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors].","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","Just going back to your cap rate comment of 6.5% to 8% I\u2019m just curious is that the range you\u2019re willing to buy at or do you feel like that\u2019s representative of some of your best markets versus some of the lower end markets?  I would think that many of the better markets would be well below 6% today but I\u2019m just curious if you can clarify those comments?","Spencer F. Kirk ","The 6.5% to 8% range is I think, a fair representation of where we think we should transacting to do accretive transactions.  I think we\u2019ve amply demonstrated that we are able to produce intelligent results without getting whipped into a frenzy.  We\u2019re in this for the long haul and I think it\u2019s important for us to remain disciplined and focused and recognize that we\u2019ve had plenty of activity that we don\u2019t need to pour an accelerant on something that is already going pretty well.  I think the results speak for themselves.","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","If we move that conversation to just sort of market cap rates do you feel like Boston, New York, LA, San Francisco type markets and maybe South Florida are kind of 5.5% today or where would you peg those and where would you sort of peg a very average market within that 6.5% to 8% range?","Spencer F. Kirk ","Let me see if I can answer this.  I think there will always be buyers that are willing to pay a lot.  I still maintain you can pay too much for gold.  An A asset in an A market you can get crazy and overpay for something.  For us, we\u2019ve said, in building long term value if it\u2019s a good asset in a good market we\u2019re going to be in the sixes and if we start to get into the secondary market it needs to drift into the sevens.  I spoke last quarter about asset quality being the physical condition of the asset itself, the quality of the market, and then the location of the asset within the market.  ","It becomes fairly complex because you have objective and subjective measures by which you value something.  For Extra Space we\u2019ve got a seasoned acquisition team, we\u2019ve got a lot of experience and we don\u2019t necessarily subscribe that markets have to be in the fives to produce meaningful results.  We\u2019ve demonstrated through 2012 that we can do intelligent acquisitions without being crazy.","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","A couple more questions for me, one would be have you looked at all or thought about potentially expanding into Europe at some point in the future through acquisitions?","Spencer F. Kirk ","This is one where I can be pretty clear, we are not going to Europe.  We are a North American self storage company and strategically the board of directors has decided that the greatest opportunities are in our own backyard.  A data point, and this is rounding, in North America there are about 54,000 self storage facilities.  In all of Europe there might be 3,000.  I think the greatest opportunity is right here where we are keenly positioned on the Internet, revenue management systems, operating practices, cultural things, linguistic capabilities of our managers, I think we\u2019ve got the right formula to produce the very best result.  I for one, am not interested in looking for a pasture that in my opinion, is not greener on the other side of the fence.  ","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","Last question for me, can you update us if you have the numbers off the top of your head but the \u201909 to \u201912 development pipeline?  What kind of stabilized yield are those tracking to?  I know you\u2019re out of that business now but are these properties exceeding what you underwrote?  How are they trending?","Scott Stubbs ","Right now they\u2019re leasing up very well but they\u2019re leasing up at rates lower than we originally underwrote.  Generally, once those properties become stabilized we\u2019ll push the rates.  So if one were to just look at the rates you would say that those properties are behind the original estimates but they are doing well in our mind because we want to fill them up first and then push the rates.","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","So you\u2019re going to stabilize at what kind of unlevered yield?","Scott Stubbs ","I think you\u2019re talking \u2013 and it depends on the property, it depends on the year, you\u2019re probably talking somewhere between 8 and 10 depending on the asset.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Richard Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Richard Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Most of my questions have been answered.  I\u2019m just curious in terms of marketing for your mobile platform how many of your customers are coming now mobile versus desktop?  And what do the conversion rates look like?  I\u2019m just wondering if you have an idea as to the smaller mom and pops, how many of those have a mobile platform?  What does the competition look like there?","Spencer F. Kirk ","Let me take the second question first.  I can\u2019t speak to what the smaller operators are doing with their mobile platforms.  One of the questions as to why we think the larger operators are taking market share is using Extra Space as a data point, we\u2019ve got 42 people internally and externally working on our traditional Internet, our mobile strategy, and our social media strategy.  We are spending tens of thousands of dollars a day on paid search.  The mobile penetration to date is just over 30% and the conversion rate is a little bit higher than that.  ","The mobile strategy is very important to us.  It\u2019s accelerating, it\u2019s accelerated very nicely and in fact, we have invested heavily in our mobile strategy and I can\u2019t imagine how a smaller operator can put those kinds of resources for programming and optimization into multiple platforms because you talk traditional Internet which is very different than mobile, which is different than social and you look at all the different devices and the software and it becomes a very large matrix and it\u2019s complex and it\u2019s expensive and I don\u2019t know how the small guy does it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi Investment Research.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi Investment Research","I apologize I jumped on late because I was on another call, but just in terms of expenses heading into the fourth quarter it would appear though your guidance has got about a 4% lift for fourth quarter expenses and just given the trend that you\u2019ve been seeing it just seems like a large growth rate so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything particular about this fourth quarter, I know we\u2019ve talked a little bit about claim activity, or is there anything in last year\u2019s fourth that we have to be mindful of?","Scott Stubbs ","Really, one big item is last year you had very little snow removal so basically our fourth quarter numbers are largely going to our budgets.  So we\u2019re showing that snow is going to be the historical norm which is our budget.  In addition we\u2019re losing the effect of the credit cards.  The benefit from credit cards took place October so year-over-year you\u2019re going to lose that in this fourth quarter so your big changes are really credit card and snow removal.  Then property taxes just coming in at 4% to 5%.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi Investment Research","How much would snow and credit card have an impact on that 4% growth rate if they were flat with the prior year?  What would that imply?","Karl T. Haas ","It would probably bring it down to closer around 2%.  ","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Arguably the snow and credit card is across the entire portfolio not just the same store as I would expect all expenses to be up.  Is there a certain level of drag on the entirety of the portfolio?","Karl T. Haas ","When we give our assumptions just remember those are just the same store assumptions.   ","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Correct, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying the snow and credit card would obviously have an impact on the entire portfolio?","Karl T. Haas ","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Is there some level, just a dollar number that you can share with us in terms of the negative impact both the aggregate on the same store and the entire portfolio, just what normal was in 4Q in last year and what the estimate is today, and what credit card was last year versus what it is today?","Karl T. Haas ","We actually don\u2019t have that in front of us right now.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Spencer, you were pretty clear in terms of your Europe answer, how does Canada factor into the mix?","Spencer F. Kirk ","Canada is part of North America and if and when there\u2019s a good opportunity to move northward into Canada we\u2019d love to participate.  It\u2019s very simple, we like Canada we just haven\u2019t found the right opportunity.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Just a follow up on your comment on real estate taxes, any markets that you\u2019ve seen surprisingly higher or lower real estate taxes?","Scott Stubbs ","No market, there\u2019s no theme between markets it\u2019s more property-by-property but no one individual market is significantly higher than it has been.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","I just had a couple of questions on acquisitions.  It sounded like part [inaudible] and increase in guidance for the remainder of the year was attributable to the performance of the acquisitions completed year-to-date, they\u2019re running ahead of expectations.  I was just wondering what you attribute that to?","Scott Stubbs ","Our PRISA III properties are running ahead of what we originally used in our budgets to the tune of about $300,000 in the quarter.  In addition to that, we\u2019re talking more about timing of those properties.  We originally estimated that six of those properties would close August 1st, they closed July 12th.  In addition to that the other four properties in regards to the New Jersey\/New York properties we estimated were going to close in late October, they ended up closing in August.  Timing was a portion of it as well as the PRISA properties.","Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Then based on what you see today, what\u2019s your general sense of the acquisition environment?  If you exclude the PRISA acquisition is the level of acquisitions that you\u2019ve seen something that you feel can be maintained for the time being?","Scott Stubbs ","We feel like things are pretty competitive out there.  We want to try to be disciplined and we feel like we\u2019ve done that this year and we hope to be able to continue to do that going forward.  If cap rates fall we have become a little bit more aggressive but we haven\u2019t necessarily chased them all away.   As we model things going forward, if you modeled something $100 million a year we would tell you that\u2019s reasonable, if you did $500 million a year I think that\u2019s going to be aggressive.","Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Then just lastly it sounded like you\u2019re pretty firm about expecting the tough comps to be challenging to overcome in 2013.  Is that a function of occupancy at record levels where there really isn\u2019t that much room to improve on the occupancy front or is it because you feel there\u2019s still a lack of pricing power based on what you see today?  I know you haven\u2019t provided 2013 guidance but it sounds like street rents are higher by 5% year-over-year, you\u2019re still getting the existing customer rent increases so in terms of revenue growth can you just help me understand where that statement, where the caution that you started the call with, really stems from?","Spencer F. Kirk ","The caution comes from this, NOI was up 7.3% a year ago we\u2019re up 11.4% this year, you compound that it\u2019s 19.53% so almost 20% over that time period.  That\u2019s pretty good and to expect double digit performance really puts us at the top end of anything that is historically the average.  I don\u2019t for one second want to delude myself or any of our investors or shareholders that continuously operating above what has been the historical norm is sustainable.  So yes, it\u2019s a great time in storage with no new supply and we\u2019re taking market share from the smaller operators and the assumptions that were in the press release speak to a little more optimistic and buoyant environment in which we can produce results that are on the top end of what the historical patterns have been.  ","But, I just want to make sure that we do not come to expect double digit NOI growth for year in and year out and have that become something that is attributed to self storage because I don\u2019t know that is something we can produce and I don\u2019t want to set an improper expectation.  "," Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","[Inaudible] the same caution if you think about just top line?  If you just think about revenue growth do you feel the same about that or is it more the function of the combination with the lower operating expenses and purely on same store NOI growth where you feel that that\u2019s going to be tough to replicate?","Karl T. Haas ","From the top line standpoint we\u2019ve benefitted from three drivers.  One is the rate which we\u2019ve gotten some traction on rate and that\u2019s really good.  The second is occupancy, we\u2019ve had very good growth in occupancy and we\u2019ve kind of gotten to almost a stabilized point on occupancy.  The third is discount so the reduction in discounts and bad debt expense over the last two or three years.  Both of those have been squeezed pretty hard, the discounts and bad debt and it\u2019s going to be hard to replicate that kind of growth to have that boost the same store revenue growth.  Unless we find something new or different it\u2019s going to be hard.  I read this in some of the analyst write ups on apartment complexes and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that much different, the norm is not 5.5% to 6.5% revenue growth long term in our business.  It\u2019s hard to maintain and so I think not just us, we\u2019re going to do as well if not better than our competition, that we\u2019re going to drive, but it\u2019s somewhat unrealistic to think that we\u2019re going to be able to continue with 5.5% to 7% same store revenue growth.","Operator","","Your next question comes from [Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors].","[Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors]","Can you just talk maybe a little bit about the stickiness of customers and whether that is increasing or not?  Then I don\u2019t know if you happen to know what percentage of your customers have been in place for a year or longer?  Then maybe just speak to any seasonality along that number?","Karl T. Haas ","Well, anticipating tough questions like this I have those statistics directly in front of me.  Greater than 12 months is 58.6%, greater than 24 months is around 37%, and I\u2019m not going to go into any more detail because then you\u2019ll just remember those and want to know it every quarter.  But, the good thing is that those numbers are slightly up from prior periods so we\u2019re not seeing any deterioration of our client base.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen we have no more questions in the queue at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Jeff Norman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. ","Jeff Norman","Thank you. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's first quarter 2016 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our Web site. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business.","These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the Company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, Tuesday, May 3, 2016. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Hello, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2016, revenue growth exceeded expectations coming in at 9.1%, mild winter helps moderate expenses leading to NOI growth of 12.3%. We ended the quarter at 92.8% occupancy, the highest in our company's history at this time of year. We acquired 25 stores during the quarter, six of which were through an off market transactions where we bought out a partner. Pricing remains competitive and so our expectations are high, we continue to find some accretive acquisitions in the open market and through our managed asset pipeline.","We ended the quarter with 1,371 Extra Space branded stores. Per share FFO as adjusted grew 25% year-over-year, this is on top of 21% growth to previous year, resulting in FFO growth of over 50% in two years. Our multifaceted strategy to increase shareholder value has five components.","First, operating performance, 12.3% NOI growth is outstanding by any measure and for any asset class. Second, accretive acquisitions, we\u2019ve strategically purchase 4 billion since 2012. Third, joint ventures, they have and will continue to produce an outsized return on dollars invested. Fourth, third party management, our program the nation's largest provide significant economies of scale in off market acquisition opportunities. And fifth, an optimized balance sheet. These five components have enabled us to produce 22 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth.","Now I'd like to turn this time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you Spencer. Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.86 per share exceeding the high end of our guidance by a penny. The beat was the result of better than expected property level performance, including costs associated with acquisitions, non-cash interest expense and 4 million legal expenses, FFO was $0.79 per share for the quarter.","Our same store revenue growth was primarily driven by higher rates to new and existing customers and increased occupancy. Our 2016 same store pool increased to 564 stores, the change in the same store pool positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points. Our top performing markets included Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tampa\/St. Pete all of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. Our slowest market included Chicago, Memphis and Washington D.C. Baltimore all of which still grew revenue at 3 plus percent.","In addition to the strong performance of our same-store pool, our 2015 acquisitions including SmartStop performed ahead of our underwriting, our platform continues to maximize results. Year to date we have 520 million closed or under contract all of which are wholly on acquisitions. In addition, we have 191 million in joint venture acquisitions where we will invest 50 million in 2016.","Based on our solid first quarter results we have increased our full year guidance. FFO was adjusted, it's estimated to be between $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be between 3.59 and 3.66 per share, guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate of occupancy stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that as anticipated will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they're performing at our portfolio average, these acquisitions should produce an additional $0.10 per share. ","I'll now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Scott. Demand is steady, and while new supply is appearing in pockets, it's still muted across the country. We see exceptional performance in many markets and even our slower growth markets are posting steady revenue increases, as we indicated last call, we expect 2016 to be another strong year.","Lastly, outstanding results of Q1 are the direct result of 3,278 dedicated employees focused on and working hard to maximize shareholder value, to each of them I say thank you. ","I\u2019ll turn the time over to Jeff to start our Q&A.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone's questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we will turn it over to Kia to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gwen Clark of Evercore ISI.","Gwen Clark","This is kind of a bigger picture question. It looks like you have a number of new markets added to the same-store disclosure such as Norfolk, Columbus and Greensboro. With the exception of San Diego, they look like they are pretty low rent per square foot markets. Can you talk about the operating performance since ownership and how you guys are thinking in regard to the future for these assets? ","Scott Stubbs","This is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that one. The performance of the assets in Southern Virginia have probably performed a little bit below our original underwriting estimates. In terms of the other markets, they have performed fine and these markets are like most markets across the U.S. I think they will be cyclical in nature, there will be times they\u2019ll outperforming and there will be times outperform within the portfolio average or even slightly below, I mean, it's tough to comment on a specific market like that. ","Gwen Clark","Okay, thank you. I guess as a follow-up looking five years out, how do you see your exposure within these markets?","Scott Stubbs","We'll continue to invest across the U.S. I think on average, we want to keep our portfolio demographic similar to what we have today on average, so if we investing one of those types of markets, hopefully we're also investing in some of the very dense metropolitan areas with low -- high ramp per square foot and good population and income demographics. So on average we are not looking to decrease the average of our property portfolio.","Gwen Clark","Okay that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies.","George Hoglund ","Just a couple of questions here. First, just on the $4 million settlement charge, can you just give some color on that?","Spencer Kirk","Hi George, it\u2019s Spencer. Big picture this is classed action in New Jersey it has to be with consumer contract and it cuts across many, many industries and many, many companies. So we attended a mediation where we reached an agreement on the parameters of the settlement. We are in the process of finalizing the terms of that settlement and getting court approval. And we've accrued an estimated cost of settlement in that\u2019s what we've been talking about. We expect it to be a onetime expense and it could be tough to better estimate until all of the negotiating is concluded, but we are giving you our best number and giving you as much color as we can.","George Hoglund ","Okay, thanks. Also just in terms of Chicago, it is a market that has underperformed the rest of the portfolio as of late. If you could just sort of address that. Then also it seems though there is a large portfolio in the market that has about 30 odd stores in Chicago area, is that a market you would look or would be interested in increasing your exposure?","Spencer Kirk","The Chicago for us, it would be long term it\u2019s been a good market for us. Clearly it's one of our focus markets, we like it, it's that great demographic, there is the lot of people there. Chicago if you look at few years back was one of our top performing markets as I commented on earlier these markets typically go in cycles. So we would look that Chicago as a long-term play, it's something that we would be interested in increasing our exposure in.","Operator","And our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc. ","Todd Thomas ","Just a question on third-party management in that business. I believe historically you said that adding -- or every 20 properties added about $0.01 to $0.02 per share of FFO. Is that still the right way to think about the direct contribution from those properties or has that changed at all?","Spencer Kirk","I think it's still pretty consistent, it's going to depend on where are those properties are and the ramp per square foot of those properties. The properties in New York City 6% of $30 rents is significantly more than 6% of $6 rents. So on average I would say that's still correct.","Todd Thomas ","Outside of the management contracts that you have been adding or properties that you have been adding to the platform from the strategic, the two other entities of strategics deploying capital for, how is the demand like from other operators to utilize third-party management at this time?","Spencer Kirk","We continue to see strong demand. We were at an industry trade show this past week and our booth was fully the entire time, we continued to talk to people. A good source recently has been some of the new constructions coming on. So while new construction is coming into the market we are bringing those on as management contracts.","Todd Thomas ","Okay. Just one last one if I may. Spencer, you have been plugged into the technology industry over the course of your career prior to EXR and at EXR and I know you spent some time with the team researching and trying to understand the full service or valet storage operating businesses. Curious to get your read on what you think here. Is it positive for storage, just tapping into new customers, creating awareness or is it changing the way consumers think about storage on some level and how the storage business may operate in the next couple of years? Would just appreciate your thoughts and comments a bit.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Todd. Just a few observations first of all that valet or concierge or full-service, however we want to characterize it is a logistics business. And we are looking at it very carefully. My personal opinion is, I don\u2019t think it's likely to be a disruptor for a self-storage. I think there is a segment of the population that will dial in into it and we are going to continue to monitor it, but today we are not making any announcement that we are getting into valet because it is questionable whether it is a viable business model. ","Operator","And the next question comes from Jenna Gallagher of Bank of America.","Jenna Gallagher ","I appreciate your comments on the different market performances. I was curious if you could provide a little bit more color around New York City and Houston. They did great but a little bit below the portfolio average, so just curious if they are seeing any impact from some of the supply? ","Spencer Kirk","So Houston I think it's probably a supply as well as an economic issue there. Our portfolio is about 2% below where it was the year ago, but even Houston has suffered from the energy downturn as well as some building, our same-store pool was about 5% and revenues were ahead of where they were last year and our bigger pool was about 7% ahead of where it was last year. So still solid performance and last year those properties did very well. New York City as a whole I would tell you is not suffering from over building, I think over building is going to affect in a micro market more than it is on the whole. But New York City on a whole is still three feet per square foot per person, it's still very low square feet per person in New York City.","Jenna Gallagher","I was just curious if you could provide an update on where occupancy is now?","Spencer Kirk","Occupancy is slightly higher than where we ended the quarter, call it 30 basis point or so.","Operator","And our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citigroup.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask you just a little bit about the quality of the product that you are seeing on the market as you look across -- when you are looking at acquisitions. It looks like you continue to be fairly active there and we have heard some sort of mixed commentary around pricing and quality and be interested in your perspective as well.","Spencer Kirk","So Smedes, its Spencer. As you look at what's out there, first of all there is a steady deal flow that\u2019s coming in. I think all of the larger company the REITs are getting call to bit. And with steady deal flow coming in, we see asset quality spending to spectrum, the one constant in all of this is prices are high, really high.","And you can have crappy assets that we think are just a way out of market, and you can have really nice assets that even for us or maybe even some of the REITs are getting a bit too rich to transact. So we are looking for those accretive acquisitions, the opportunities that make sense geographically and economically, and when they do we are going to act but quality spans the spectrum.","Smedes Rose","So could you maybe sort of quantify the change in cap rates over the past year or so roughly? Is it 25 basis points or 50?","Spencer Kirk","They are lower and call between 25 and 50 basis points.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","So just had a couple of questions regarding how pricing trends are coming out or playing out, end of spring. I guess in the winter, things were a little bit better than expected, getting the bigger year-over-year increases. Was just curious if you are -- I know it is only May 3, but is this spring, are you getting the year-over-year increases so far that you have been used to in previous springs?","Spencer Kirk","I would tell you pricing continues to be strong, January-February we were close to 10%, above where we were last year. Going into March and April, we are still 6% to 7% above where we were last year, which proves spring is still pretty solid.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. I mean obviously that 7% in April is not a small number but it is a little bit down from the January, February. Any particular reason your revenue management systems or the results are lining up that way?","Spencer Kirk","So we pushed rate harder in January, February and we gave a little bit on occupancy and you saw our year-over-year delta come in a little and now we are kind of easing off that and going a little bit more with occupancy.","Ki Bin Kim","Last question. Obviously your revenue management system is trying to optimize revenue, we get that. But just curious if we did see a little bit more move outs and less move in this quarter? Any patterns or reasons why more people left or less people moved in that you can point to that happened this quarter that might be unusual?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, I would tell you part of it is the unusual comp from last year. Last year you had a really odd thing in the North East, we had some pretty severe weather, which had very few move outs and very few move in, so I think part of it is year-over-year, if you look at a bigger average, call it five to seven year average, we are right in line with the five to seven year average in terms of move-ins and move-outs both.","Operator","And our next question comes from R.J. Milligan of Baird.","R.J. Milligan","I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more detail on who those buyers are for those really low cap rates and how much appetite you think there is out there from that competition?","Spencer Kirk","R.J, it's Spencer. There is a lot of appetite for self-storage, I think it's not secrete that it's probably the best performing asset class year in and year out. We are seeing pronounced competition everywhere we turn, from trade buyers and non-trade buyers. And the only comment I would make is as we look at this, it's great to buy this asset class, but once you\u2019ve purchased it somebody has got to operate it. It is operationally intensive and we think that that creates opportunity. And we will just have to see how things play out, but there is a lot of money chasing this assets.","R.J. Milligan ","Okay. And then on the C of O [ph] deals, can you talk about the sort of underwritten development yields that you were seeing maybe a year ago versus today and sort of where that middle ground is in terms of a cap rate where you guys are willing to buy those assets?","Spencer Kirk","You\u2019re still look in the cap rates, but we kept, we underwrite them 150 to 200 basis points, I would tell you today big were on the 150 basis points range recently, we\u2019ve said notice some deals and we continue to see things coming in the 7.5 to 8 yield once they\u2019re stabilize.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Burke of Green Street Advisors.","Ryan Burke","You disposed of a handful of assets, small dollar amount but it is relatively uncommon for you. What was the specific rationale for selling those properties? And can you give us an update on your plans for further dispositions, if any? ","Spencer Kirk","So from our perspective, we will continue to look at markets and whether it\u2019s, markets that are difficult for us to operate in or whether their markets that we still maybe have reached their potential or they may have need for CapEx to be put into those. So those are markets we\u2019ll look to dispose of assets, some of these were a little bit more rural and maybe not as core as we would hope for in terms of rent per square foot and the income of population demographics.","A - Scott Stubbs","Ryan as you know, we are trying to build the company and dispositions have not been something that we talked a lot about. But I think you can expect going forward that you will see us looking at the very bottom end of our portfolio and taking really good look at the economic performance as well as the physical characteristics of that particular bottom segment. And rationalizing whether it should be in the portfolio. And I think you\u2019ll see some activity year-end and year-out at the bottom-end, but it\u2019s not going to be a wholesale initiative on our part, because we are trying to build not dismantle.","Ryan Burke","Sure. Are you able to give us a feel for what percentage of the properties the bottom end defines?","A - Scott Stubbs","1% to 2%.","Ryan Burke","Okay. Separate question just back to New York City development. I believe that all of the properties in your current pipeline in the NYC boroughs are minority stakes. Does that speak to a desire to control your exposure there or is it more just the fact that that is the opportunity that has presented itself there?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s a combination of the opportunity that\u2019s presented itself as well as ability our leverage our returns in the lower cap rate environment.","Ryan Burke","Okay, and you picked up one property or a JV interest in one property in the Bronx during the quarter. That was 42% occupied as of March 31. Do you happen to have what the occupancy was on that asset as of January 1?","Spencer Kirk","I don\u2019t have that specifically in front of me, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s open recently, it continues to lease up really well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James.","Jonathan Hughes","I just had one, most of mine have been answered. But what renewal rate increases were you able to pass on to tenants in this first quarter? And then maybe how many left or vacated due to not wanting to pay those renewal rate bumps?","Scott Stubbs","Let\u2019s take the second piece one Jonathan. Our existing customer rate increase program continues to show financially that we are hitting the sweets spot, there might be a few move outs where people won\u2019t accepted, but economics are compelling in terms of the gain that we pick up from the high 90%, 95%, 98% whatever it is that accept it and don\u2019t move out, because this is a very sticky product type. Existing customer rate increases, the 9% to 10% range quarter on and quarter out and works well.","Jonathan Hughes","And then are many just not leaving because they simply don't want to take the time to move their stuff out or is it just to get lack of available space?","Spencer Kirk","Must be realistic about this Jonathan. If you are renting a unit any of yet a rate increase letter that says your rent is going up 15 bucks, you are not likely to go get a U-Haul truck take a Saturday morning, pack-up your stuff, go down the street, unpack your stuff, return the U-Haul truck to safe 15 bucks. People just want go through the effort to do that, it\u2019s an incredibly sticky product type.","What we have found that if rate increases more often than not my finally signal to somebody. The problem that I was trying to solve has past, maybe I should move out. And that is as I said a very, very small percentage, single-digit, low single-digits of the total customer based. So existing customer rate increases, it\u2019s a great program, we think we\u2019re operating in the sweets spot.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay. It\u2019s great color. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Just on discounts, what percentage of customers are receiving some type of promotion this quarter? And also just wanted to get a sense of what you are budgeting for discounts this spring leasing season? You are obviously coming off of a higher occupancy level having smoothed out some of the Q4 seasonal dip. Just want to get a sense of discounts.","Scott Stubbs","Yes discounts during the first quarter about 75% to 85% of our customers moving in -- coming in first time renters or new customers receive a discount. That is higher than it was last year when we originally looked at the year I think we had hopes that discounts would be flat, now we are projecting they will be up slightly.","But if you think of it in terms of whether discounts are up or down our rates are up 5% to 10%. So clearly if you rent to the same number of people discounts will be up 5% to 10% over where they were last year. We\u2019d hope to be able to cut them and keep them flat as a percent, but now we are seeing that they will be up slightly and we are projecting the same into the spring leasing season to up.","Todd Stender","Thanks for the color, Scott. And just one last question. I wanted to follow up on the question about the assets you've sold already. You are going to be managing them on a third-party basis. Can you just go over maybe what the standard agreement you have in place is? Is a cancelable by either side? The reason I ask is usually you get into the third-party management with the potential to buy the property, but I wanted to see if you can get out of this since you are obviously disposing of it?","Spencer Kirk","Yes so it's pretty simple, it's a month-to-months contract. We do advance the money for the rebranding of the asset and if they opt out before 36 months has transpired we can get some money back on that on a pro rata schedule. And we do not have the right of first refusal, we make this easy and hopefully our performance is enough to keep people in that they don\u2019t want to go somewhere else and we want the flexibility to do what we need to do.","So time, I think we are coming up on 8.5 years of third party management. Todd and we've learnt something's but work in terms of seller expectations and we've learned something's in terms of management expectations both coming and going and we are very comfortable that our property level performance and the results we deliver on a month contract speak for themselves and has work very well.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies.","George Hoglund","Just a follow-up on the transaction environment. Are you seeing any change in the motivation of sellers in terms of -- is it -- are you seeing more assets because pricing is so good or are you seeing people looking to exit for other reasons as could be seeing some private equity backers look to exit their investments maybe sooner than one would think?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, all of the above.","Scott Stubbs","Yes, I think it's tough to comment on seller\u2019s motivation, I mean they all have a different motive.","Spencer Kirk","Yes, it's all of the above its pricing, its motivation, it's everything.","George Hoglund ","And as far as concerns about development, I feel like people keep talking about it but it is kind of waning now. People may be getting more concerned about an economic downturn in \u201917. How do you think storage would behave differently through this time around if we head into a downturn versus the last time? Some factors are different; you don't have the oversupply issues we did last time. But how might revenue management impact things? And it seems last time basically PSA just lowered rates significantly that impacted of the industry, how do you think things would be different?","Spencer Kirk","George. It's Spenser. So what I would tell you is we are comfortable that self-storage is a great business to be in, it\u2019s a recessionary system, we've already proven that the industry has proven that. We were amongst the last to go into the recession amongst the first to come out of the recession and the REITS are better equipped at this point than at any other time to acquire customers. The chasm between the haves and have not has widened and the rate at which the chasm is growing is accelerating. So if there is a downturn I'm highly confident of the national players the REITs are in the best possible position to capitalize and produce the very best result. ","George Hoglund","Alright thanks for the color. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay ","Sticking with that last question regarding the downturn, I noticed you guys are having some pretty good success pushing rate and now you mentioned you want to build occupancy a little bit. Are you seeing anything in your predictive analytics that has given you caution or is this maybe the occupancy move specific to certain markets? ","Spencer Kirk","Now typically we are focused on just overall revenue growth and our models have certainly inputs and so you can tweet them slightly I would tell you early on in the year it was focus more on revenue growth meaning street rate growth and now we are focusing -- we tweaked the models slightly to focus a little more on -- just on occupancy.","Wes Golladay ","Okay. And then you mentioned a lot of people active in the market. Is SmartStop actually getting a little more active? Are you running into them and can you get some meaningful management contracts later in the year? ","Spencer Kirk","They continue to be active I think that we see them we see the other REITS as we hope they continue to be successful. We are not able to buy, we wish them the best because we have a good relationship with them, I think it works well for both of us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeremy Metz of UBS.","Q - Ross Nussbaum","Hi guys, it's actually Ross Nussbaum here with Jeremy. You touched on just a little earlier, but I just want to make sure I understood it. The vacates for the quarter were up 6.4% year-over-year, what exactly are you guys attributing that increases to?","Spencer Kirk","It's tough to attribute to anyone thing, part of it I would tell you is the comp year-over-year, last year had low vacates, it could be pricing, it could be a myriad of things. So we haven't attributed with anyone specifically.","Scott Stubbs","Also with more customers Ross, you\u2019re going to have more vacates. We\u2019re at the highest occupancy we\u2019ve ever been.","Ross Nussbaum","Yes, I think that is fair although the 6.4% number did catch my eye a bit. I was wondering, did you look at for those vacates, was there any trend in terms of average length of stay that it was more short-term people, more long-term people that you had received more than one rent increase? Was there anything in there that caught your eye?","Scott Stubbs","No, in fact our average length of stay increased, so we continue to increase our length of stay, but we have had some vacates but not anything concerning to us at this point.","Spencer Kirk","And Ross just two other points, if you look at an 8 year average, its well within the bounds of being normal, and second as Scott said earlier in this call you look at April occupancy is going up which means obviously we are doing something right. We can\u2019t look at just short periods of time. We need to look at this thing in terms of micro terms and we think 2016 is going to be a strong year.","Ross Nussbaum","Same type of question on the rental side. The number of rentals were down but again that is probably because your occupancy is higher and you've got fewer units. Can you give us some sense of what the traffic numbers looked like both at the store, on your website, on mobile, at your call center and those numbers look year-over-year in the quarter?","Spencer Kirk","Year-over-year our opportunities are within normal range or expected range and our close rates were also within the expected or target ranges.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. So no discernible change, there weren't a lot of numbers in that answer. So no discernible change in trend in terms of traffic?","Spencer Kirk","That\u2019s correct. The traffic on the internet are traffic to our call center were all within in the expected range.","Spencer Kirk","Yes, I think maybe one thing should looking for, mobile continues to be really important to growth rate as customers coming to us through mobile devices is growing well into the double digits. It's a phenomenon and we\u2019ve got a terrific mobile platform and its part of what's helping us to deliver the kind of results we have then.","Ross Nussbaum","Got it. Last one for me, can you give us a sense where in-place rents are today against street rents, what that variance is?","Spencer Kirk","So it's kind of mid to high single digit, but that depends on the time of year and the seasonality Ross. During the dead of winter it\u2019s in the high single digit, at the peak of summer its low single digits, if it's not right on top of each other.","Ross Nussbaum","I think Jeremy had a question.","Jeremy Metz","Yes, so I just want quickly on the dispositions, I know there was small but were those assets acquired SmartStop deal where those legacy extra states assets and that was keeping the management contracts a requirement of the deal? Thanks.","Spencer Kirk","No, we purchase those in June of 2011 as part of 15 property portfolio and keeping the management contracts is not a requirement but it obviously will lead towards the seller that which willing to do that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks, just a couple of quick cleanup questions here. Noticed a certificate of occupancy deal move out of the pipeline in Naperville. Anything to look at there?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, this was the property that I would tell you it's probably pretty typical what you seeing in SEO deals and what you seeing in the development. This is one that we got we could get done the developer was pretty conformable that they can entitled, we put it under contract we received some opposition from a neighborhood group and it's all out of contract due to the inability to get the project done.","Ki Bin Kim","Probably in some weird way, that is maybe a good thing for the industry.","Spencer Kirk","I think it's pretty standard, I think you see that not just with this one project, I think you are seeing it across country.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Is there any discernible trend in your New York MSA between the boroughs versus New Jersey? Performance wise?","Spencer Kirk","I would tell you performance is going to be a more on a micro market and depending on new competition within that market but overall it's pretty consistent, between boroughs and New Jersey, Northern New Jersey.","Ki Bin Kim","And just last one, can you comment on the SmartStop deal and what kind of growth you are getting in that portfolio in NOI right now? And if it is meeting your pro forma or better than expected?","Spencer Kirk","I would tell you it\u2019s slightly ahead of our projections, discloser to street was we originally projected that it would be about 5.5% cap rate in year one and I'd tell you it's add or above that in terms of that we're actually getting a little bit more in rate and occupancy is coming a little bit slower than we've expected although, we saw some good occupancy growth in April. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc. ","Todd Thomas","Can you remind us what your typical rent increase pattern is for existing customers, what the thresholds are and how frequently you increase rents to existing customers? And has that changed at all over the last year or two?","Scott Stubbs","Really hasn't changed in much over the last decade. Its five months for the first trade increase, its nine month thereafter, nine months thereafter and nine months thereafter. We do have covers on that, too far above the existing street rate, we bet the existing customer rate increase, but as we're pushing street rates up each and every year, customers that may have dropdown of the eligible pool, find themselves back in the pool and so, as I said, between 9% and 10%, we do this every single month and quarter to quarter, it provides meaningful revenue for this company, we like what we're doing and statistically we've shown that's the program that we have in place works in a good economy and a decelerating economy, we haven't changed that.","Todd Thomas","Okay, got it. And then Spencer, you mentioned that some of the move outs from rent increases, they tend to generally occur from customers that no longer need storage so their problem has been solved. Any sense for what percent of the portfolio might be discretionary at this time or not really need storage any longer? Is there sort of a way to gauge that based on how long people say they need storage when they move in or some way to arrive at an estimate?","Spencer Kirk","I don't know their thoughts and intents, I don't know even how to quantify that, but what I can tell you Todd is that I think it's kind of in mid to low single digit as the customer base, where there's any question mark, surrounding whether they're going to stay around or go","Todd Thomas","Okay, it seems much lower than what I think we had maybe talked about or heard back in \u201906 or \u201907 when I think it was closer to maybe 15% or 20%. Is that not an accurate assessment or has something changed today versus maybe that last cycle? ","Spencer Kirk","What I would tell you is over the course of the decade, a lot of things have changed including our repository of data and our understanding of our customers and without looking at some very specific numbers, I'm just having that give you off the top of my head, that this is something that has not materially changed and I don't know where the 15% to 20% number came from previously I\u2019d have to go back and look, but I personally believe it's lower than that today.","Scott Stubbs","Considerably, to quantify this Todd, we\u2019d be purely speculating or guessing. I mean this is really a customer need or customer decision here. ","Todd Thomas","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Spencer Kirk for closing remarks.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, everybody for your interest and your time today. We look forward to next quarter's call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call, Mr. Jeff Norman. You may begin.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s fourth quarter and year-end 2016 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company\u2019s business.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.","Joe Margolis","Hello, everyone. It was another strong year for Extra Space. We executed at a high level and produced great results coming off 2015, the best year for storage. 2016 same-store revenue increased 6.9% and the NOI grew 9.2%. FFO per share as adjusted, increased by 23%. For the fourth quarter, same-store revenue growth was 5.2% and we were able to decrease year-over-year expenses by 2.1%, resulting in NOI growth of 7.9%. FFO per share as adjusted, increased by 18%.","Our FFO growth was driven by property performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management, and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these tools to continue to grow shareholder value. As we expected, revenue growth moderated throughout 2016, as the benefit from growing occupancy went away and street rate growth trended from peak levels to more of historically normal levels by year-end. Despite the moderation, the fundamentals of the storage sector remained positive. While we saw de-acceleration of revenue growth in certain markets, we are also encouraged to observe re-acceleration in other MSAs, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We continue to enjoy the benefits of a well-balanced diversified portfolio and operational scale.","In the fourth quarter, we acquired 27 wholly-owned stores for a total purchase price of $316 million. This includes the buyout of a joint venture partner\u2019s interest in 11 stores, which we announced on our last call. For the year, we invested $1.1 billion in acquisitions. The large majority of these transactions were not broadly marketed and came from joint ventures, our third-party managed portfolio or through other relationships.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott Stubbs.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Joe. Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was a result of three factors, first, outperformance by our 2015 acquisitions including SmartStop and our CofO deal; second, timing of our Q4 2016 acquisitions that closed earlier than anticipated; and third, lower property and G&A expenses.","For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.85 per share, also exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $0.05. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the year at 92%, an 80 basis-point decrease from the end of 2015. This includes the impact of six expansion projects which were completed during the quarter. Excluding the additional vacancy created in these six stores, our ending occupancy would have finished 20 basis points higher at 92.2%.","During the quarter, we completed a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility. To-date, we have drawn $662 million. The five and seven-year tranches have delayed draw features, and we will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt. The unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goals include having access to multiple types of capital, laddering our maturities and maintaining financial flexibility. This credit facility helps accomplish these goals.","Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2017. Our new same-store pool will increase by a 168 stores for a new total of 732. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by an average of 50 basis points over the year. For 2017, our acquisition guidance includes 325 million in wholly-owned stores. We also project 225 million in joint venture acquisitions with approximately 75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. This results in total investment in 2017 of $400 million, approximately half of which is currently identified. Our guidance assumes the remaining balance will be weighted to the back half of the year. So, our pricing expectations are still high and we are committed to being disciplined and only transacting at prices that are accretive for each shareholders.","Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $4.15 to $4.24 per share. Our guidance includes $0.08 of dilution from our CofO stores and additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.16.","I\u2019ll now turn the time back to Joe.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Scott.","During 2016, there was significant focus on new supply and de-acceleration of revenue growth. The effect these issues have on same-store NOI is an appropriate topic to focus on, but not to the exclusion of FFO growth and the overall health of the industry. But, I\u2019ll make a few comments on these areas of concern.","First, we are seeing new supply. This supply is generally concentrated in certain markets but there are many other markets that have minimum new supply. We benefit from our highly diversified portfolio, which reduces the volatility of cyclical markets. Much of the new supply delivered early in the development cycle has had minimal or only temporary impact on our stores due to pent up demand and not one of our MSAs experienced negative revenue growth for the year, but our hedge is not in the stand. We recognize that new supply may have greater impact as we get further into the development cycle, and we have factored that into our guidance. Also, the development cycle has presented opportunities. We are adding new purpose built assets in key markets. These stores are performing well and adding value to our portfolio. We are also managing many newly constructed assets on a third-party basis which provide fee income, strengthen our brands and increase our scale.","Second, demand is steady. Traffic to our stores, website and call center remains consistent. And our ability to capture customers is greater than that of the smaller operators. We expect 2017, same-store revenue growth and NOI growth in the 4% to 5% range, which we believe will be better than nearly all the other state sectors.","Third, we have other tools that contribute to our FFO growth. We acquired almost $3 billion of assets in the last two years. And our CO deals will add to our growth in the future. We will continue to acquire assets, but only if we can do so accretively, given current capital and market conditions. We will expand our third-party management platform, and we will utilize the most advantageous forms of capital to grow the Company and maintain a flexible balance sheet. This is the formula we have used to become the best returning REIT in the U.S. over the past 10 years, and we will continue to executive on this strategy in a disciplined and focused manner.","Let\u2019s now turn the time over to Jeff and start our questions and answers session.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Joe. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions, once everyone has had the opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin to start Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from George Hoglund with Jefferies.","George Hoglund","What\u2019s the current level of street rates on a year-over-year basis?","Scott Stubbs","Our street rates year-to-date for January and February have been between 3% and 4%, which I would tell you is fair amount different than some of the reports that are out there, but we\u2019ve seen solid street rates year-to-date.","George Hoglund","Okay. And what level of existing customer increases are you able to push through in January and February?","Scott Stubbs","We continue to push at the same rates, high single digits.","George Hoglund","Okay. And then, just can you comment on a couple of the markets that were -- had negative same-store NOI performance for the quarters, Houston, St. Louis and Sarasota?","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s probably just a cyclical nature of the markets. Houston has seen some new supply; it\u2019s also a market condition in Houston in particular. And I would also tell you that those markets are immaterial. Some of those have experienced taxes. But when I\u2019m talking, I\u2019m talking more in terms of revenue. But, all of those markets I would tell you are in immaterial in terms of our overall revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citigroup.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask you your revenue increases that you are projecting same-store 4% to 5%, is that primarily driven by revenue increases -- rate increases and where do you see occupancy going by year-end 2017 from the [multiple speakers] that you ended this year?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. I would tell you, our occupancy assumptions for the year are that in our core pool, it\u2019s essentially flat, plus or minus a small amount in the new same-store pool which includes SmartStop, it is up slightly but not a material amount. So, majority of that growth is coming from street rate growth and a small amount from occupancy from SmartStop.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thank you. And then, the other thing is just could you update us on what you are seeing of total new supply across your portfolio? And I guess, maybe specifically just as you look to the top five markets, which I think are comprised of over 50% of your NOI, maybe if you could just drill down a little bit there, so LA, New York, D.C. [ph] Boston and San Francisco?","Joe Margolis","Sure. Thank you, Smedes. So, overall, CoStar\u2019s reporting about 900 stores to be delivered in 2017. I\u2019m sorry, CBRE, my mistake, and that\u2019s a good number as we can come to. We\u2019ve looked at eight of our top markets in depth and tried to aggregate as many different data sources as well as our people on the ground and brokers and our partners. And that accounts to little over 40% of our NOI. And we found 360 stores in those markets that were either newly completed, under construction or in some stage of the planning process. About half of those stores competed with our stores in that market.","So, we are certainly seeing new deliveries competing with some of our stores and we\u2019re seeing other markets where we don\u2019t have the same level of competition. The most difficult thing is of those 360 stores, a 135 of them are somewhere in the planning process. And we see a significant level of those stores fall out due to inability to get permits or financing or some other reason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Just following up on that supply question from Smith, just can help us benchmark that 360? I mean, do you have a sense of what that was at this point last year? And as part of that question, any views on how supply looks at this point for 2018 relative to 2017; do you expect it to be flat, higher, lower?","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s a really good question, and it varies significantly by market. So, for example, if you look at Chicago where we would identify 41 new stores, 23 of those have already been delivered. So, you are already deeper into the cycle with more stores delivered than being planned. Dallas is maybe on the other end where we have identified 83 stores and only 39 of them have been delivered. So, it really varies widely by market. Our sense is that there will be fewer deliveries in 2018 than 2017, certainly CBRE as well, I think their number was 400, but time will tell.","Juan Sanabria","And then, just back on the same-store revenue guidance. What are the street rate growth expectations, I guess as we go through 2017; and is there a SKU and how -- in the same-store revenue growth over the course of the year, is it accelerating or decelerating as the year progresses?","Scott Stubbs","Our guidance assumes that it decelerates a little bit more. So, you are going to start the year slightly higher than we end the year. And the SmartStop will actually start a fair amount out there with coming up against tougher comps at the end of the year. So, it will show more deceleration in that particular pool of properties, but overall, slight deceleration.","Juan Sanabria","And then, any color on the street rate growth that you\u2019re kind of assuming as the year goes, particularly into peak leasing?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you, it\u2019s going to be three to five; it\u2019s going to depend a little bit on strength of the market and your occupancy.","Operator","The next question comes from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta","So, following up on that deceleration comments on same-store revenue growth 2017, would you expect it to stabilize in second half of 2017 or would you expect it to continue to decelerate?","Scott Stubbs","We would expect it to stabilize in 2017 in second half. And again, the rate of deceleration has slowed. You are not seeing that drop, a significant amount quarter-over-quarter but we are estimating it will continue to decline slightly throughout the year.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you are seeing reacceleration from MSAs, can you talk about which MSAs those are and do you expect that to be sustainable?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. The examples I would point you to, in particular Chicago, Denver and Philadelphia, all three markets have seen reacceleration. Denver -- our same-store pool was slightly negative but in the bigger pool, it was positive and it\u2019s come back from being negative.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas","Just following up on the revenue growth guidance, what\u2019s in the model for effective move-in rates; how are discounts and pre-rent trending and then what\u2019s in the model?","Scott Stubbs","Discounts are up slightly year-over-year, but it\u2019s probably a little bit more in line with your rate growth. So, if your rates are up 3% to 5%, your discounts are automatically going to be up 3% to 5%, but they are up slightly above that and not a significant effect. So, it\u2019s mainly coming from rate this year.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then, in terms of new supply, I mean, can you talk about your appetite for CofO deals and lease up properties here, maybe just give us a sense for how large the 2017, 2018 and 2019 pipelines might be for Extra Space?","Joe Margolis","Yes. We\u2019ve become -- as we get deeper into the development cycle, we\u2019ve become increasingly more selective for Co deals. As I said earlier, there are some markets that if we can find deals where there is barriers to entry and no or limited new supply and we\u2019re getting compensated, we would certainly look at that deal. I\u2019d think, the case of our investment in CO deals will moderate probably significantly. But we are very comfortable with the deals we\u2019ve had. We have done very full due-diligence; we have underwritten conservatively; and performance to-date has prudent that out, if you look at how our stores perform. We also have a target cap of 3% on the amount of dilution. CofO stores will in aggregate contribute or detract from our performance. So, we want to keep within that cap.","And then, the last thing I would point out with respect to our appetite for COs is we have executed a number of these deals in joint venture format, which both reduces the risk to us and increases our returns.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And just lastly, looking at a couple other markets and just thinking about the occupancy, year-over-year decrease that you are seeing portfolio wide, but looking at some of the other markets like Boston, LA, San Francisco, some of your top markets, occupancy is lower year-over-year and that year-over-year negative spread actually grew larger in the quarter, worsened a little bit. Are you thinking about occupancy differently than you have in the past as you think about maximizing revenue or is occupancy coming down as a result of new supply in these markets? What\u2019s sort of happening here?","Scott Stubbs","I think it\u2019s market-by-market; California had a really tough comp the prior year. I would tell you we are not necessarily thinking any differently in terms of occupancy. It\u2019s obviously important in our model to drive revenue. But, I would tell you, we lost a little bit of occupancy, but we\u2019ve kept some rate. So, you know the fact that our street rates are up 3% to 4%, is a good thing. Our bottom line is to grow revenue, and occupancy is a big part of that. It\u2019s possible that going forward into the New Year, our budgets and our guidance assumes that we spend a little bit more on marketing also.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with UBS.","Jeremy Metz","As you think about that sort of slowing towards the long-term average from here and stabilizing starting in the back half of the year. In terms of some of your markets where revenues and NOI have moved negative or even just below the larger portfolio average, have you seen anything in particular from revenue management to give you confidence in your ability to react faster and therefore recover quicker back to that long-term on average or even just stabilize that average versus moving below the long-term average which is something, I think a lot of people wonder about and worry about?","Joe Margolis","Yes. We\u2019re consistently trying to improve the inputs to our revenue management system and its ability to both react and predict market conditions and how we optimize revenue in that. So I think we\u2019d be the first to say that last year in Denver our reaction was not optimal, and we\u2019ve learnt from that, and we continue to try to improve.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. So, some of what you\u2019ve learnt from Denver is actually already playing out and then helping overall in terms of what\u2019s going on in the current portfolio; is that fair?","Scott Stubbs","Absolutely, yes.","Joe Margolis","I believe so. I don\u2019t want to ever say that our learning is done and we will continue to try to make the machine better and make sure that when it doesn\u2019t work, there is human input. But, yes, we are better than we were last year.","Jeremy Metz","Okay, great. And then, Scott, in terms of longer-term funding plans, you have the $400 million of investment activity in guidance, let\u2019s call it $200 million and $300 million of debt maturing. You obviously have room on the lines and capacity from the unsecured notes you issued in October that you talked about in your opening remarks. I think you saw about couple of hundred million on the ATMs. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s baked in the guidance in terms of further capital raises, if anything, and then just longer-term funding plans for some of that activity?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. Our guidance assumes a $100 million of OP or some type of equity. We\u2019ve just included in there is OP. And then, from there, it assumes that the rest is with debt. And if you look at the growth in NOI, I would tell you our ratio has remained the same. So, we\u2019re not looking to lever up, and we will look to remain -- keep our leverage ratios similar to where they are today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gwen Clark with Evercore.","Gwen Clark","Going back to rate growth, I think you said it should be up 3% to 5% for the total pool. Can you talk about what your expectation would be for the 2015 acquisitions such as SmartStop?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. They will be higher than that but you are going to grow your revenue in that portfolio from a combination of rate as well as occupancy. So, if you think of street rates, in a portfolio where you are trying to push occupancy, you will get more from occupancies than you will form street rates and you\u2019ll also get more from moving your existing customers up to the current market rates. So, it\u2019s going to be a little bit different in terms of mix. But, I would say, overall, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying 3% to 5%, and that\u2019s obviously a range depending on market conditions. But SmartStop will get more through occupancy and more from existing customers than the other pool.","Gwen Clark","Okay, alright. That\u2019s helpful. I guess moving on to a bigger picture question. One of the questions that I feel like everyone has been asking is the trajectory for NOI growth and that was touched upon earlier. But can you talk about the scenario which could actually drive overall same-store NOI growth negative in say in 2018 or 2019?","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s tough to even fathom that. I think that from our perspective, the only time we\u2019ve ever been negative was in the great recession. It\u2019s a recession that was bigger than I think most people are going to see in their lives. And we were call it, 3% negative in 2009 and then we are positive first quarter to the next year and now today is not the exact same market as that, but I would tell you I think it\u2019s going to take a pretty big event for everything to be negative for the year.","Gwen Clark","Okay. So, it seems like it would be fair to say that the new supply which is probably going to hit in 2018 isn\u2019t really enough in your mind to drive it like to a hard landing of negative growth?","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s really hard to say what the level of new supply that\u2019s going to hit in 2018 and 2019 is. I would tell you that if there is continued delivery of new supply, it probably means the industry remains pretty healthy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.","Jonathan Hughes","Good afternoon, guys. Could you just talk about the level of demand you are seeing in January? One of your peers mentioned they had a really strong start to the year and a homebuilder this morning mentioned they\u2019ve seen a release of pent up demand for housing. I am just curious if you are seeing similar trend of increased demand so far this year?","Scott Stubbs","I can\u2019t really comment on what our peers have seen but I can say that we have seen demand to be relatively flat. It\u2019s stable.","Jonathan Hughes","So, no outsized growth in the first six weeks of the year?","Joe Margolis","Nothing significant.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay. And then, just one more from me. One of your competitors quantified the impact of new store openings on projected revenue growth at about 200 basis points to 250 basis points below the portfolio average. Does your guidance include a similar impact at stores exposed to new supply?","Scott Stubbs","Our guidance includes the impact of stores that are being added. So, I can\u2019t comment on what they are seeing, but we have taken into account where we have a new store coming on line near one of our existing stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Burke with Green Street Advisors.","Ryan Burke","Just a couple questions on the development pipeline. Joe, your comments earlier about slowing development, probably as we move forward, do contrast a little bit with the fact that the development pipeline increased in size pretty meaningfully this quarter. Can you reconcile those two dynamics? And then, second question is just scanning the 2018 projected opening. It does seem like there is a greater percentage of properties that are located -- and I don\u2019t want to call them in secondary markets perhaps, but maybe non-major metro areas\u2026","Scott Stubbs","Yes. I -- sorry, finish your question.","Ryan Burke","Well, just curious if the strategy there -- if it is a strategy or if it just happens to be the outcome of what was available.","Scott Stubbs","Yes. I would tell you, the jump in the pipeline comes from us putting certain properties now under contract that we are doing with the joint venture partner in a couple of areas of the country, one is in the Northwest and the other one is in the New Jersey -- kind of New York City down to Philadelphia markets. And those are our joint ventures that we have been discussing and looking at for a year to two years, and they actually just went under contract this quarter. And so, we\u2019ve had the policy or the standing that we don\u2019t want to talk about them unless they are under contract. So, this was just kind of an odd quarter where many of those went under contract, even though we\u2019ve been talking about those for a long time.","Ryan Burke","Okay. So, pipeline is kind of in place, but if things play out the way that you think they might in terms of operating fundamentals, et cetera, we should expect the pipeline to not grow significantly for the out years, beyond 2018?","Joe Margolis","I think that\u2019s correct. That\u2019s my comment about increasing selectivity in future years is that\u2019s what I was trying to drive at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC.","Wes Golladay","Looking at the expansion projects, where are those located; and do you have much more of those planned for this year?","Scott Stubbs","So, we have a few those, one is on Long Island, we have one Chicago, one in Salt Lake City are kind of the bigger ones. And we have ongoing expansions all the time. This was an odd one; typically you\u2019d pull them out of your same-store group, but they completed quicker than we expected. And so, part of that was just timing and we felt like resident changing the same-store group in the fourth quarter, we would just leave them in and talk to it. But we always have expansions going on.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then, trying to look at supply. I mean, how should we view it? I mean, we always talk about the nominal store count, but is there -- what do you see as a manageable supply level on a percentage of facilities; is it like a 4% to 5%? You mentioned the pent up demand. Are there any markers where there is large clusters that you\u2019re concerned about, in the other markets you are like it is not a big deal? How should we view it from the cluster point of view?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So, overall, I would tell you on a national level, I think that equal to population growth is healthy. And you\u2019ve got to look at square footage versus store count because stores today are being built bigger than they were before. I think that there are certain markets we are clearly concerned about and watching closely and there is other markets where you just have not same supply come. On the West Coast, California has seen very little new supply compared to the population. Texas has seen a fair amount, Atlanta; anywhere where it\u2019s easy to entitle things, you\u2019ve seen supply.","Wes Golladay","And would it be fair to say, you\u2019re going to try and expand more in the supply constrained markets, is that where you guys will target those?","Scott Stubbs","Absolutely.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","I mean, from our perspective, you are always going to look for low saturation -- population per square foot -- square foot per population.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Hi, thanks. And Scott, I think you gave some color on SmartStop, but I just wanted to see -- or if you\u2019ve talked about how it\u2019s performing relative to plan? And just as a reminder, when does that begin to show up in the same-store pool?","Scott Stubbs","So, it goes in January 1 of 2017, it\u2019s in there, and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the outsized growth. And compared to plan is -- it is performing a fair amount ahead of our underwriting.","Todd Stender","Is that on the occupancy? I think you guys were bifurcating it at one point, maybe in a presentation.","Scott Stubbs","In a presentation, we\u2019ve bifurcated it; going forward, it goes into our same-store pool this year, so 2017. And like I said, it continues to outperform our underwriting.","Todd Stender","Okay, thank you. And just get an update maybe on paid search costs as much detail as you can on how much you\u2019re budgeting for Google search this year and maybe any changes in strategy as you head into the spring leasing season?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. Our budgets assume a 6% increase in marketing, which last year we were actually down slightly. So, it\u2019s a tough comp it\u2019s up against. But costs, we continue to try to be more effective and more efficient, but reality is as more people are bidding, so costs are going up. So, we need to try to keep the cost for acquisition down.","Todd Stender","Is that a reflection of the Google, their rates are up and maybe utilization is down, what -- how do you look at that?","Scott Stubbs","So, Google rates going up are just there is more people betting, which drives the rates up. Utilization, people use paid search consistently. So, we\u2019ve found it\u2019s a good way to drive traffic. We will continue to spend money on paid search.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","So, I wanted to just get a sense of, as new supply is coming on line in the markets where you are seeing new supply, what are competitors doing in terms of maybe discounts or offering; how are they driving tenants into their properties versus your existing properties or even peers\u2019 properties?","Scott Stubbs","I can tell you how we react and I would tell you that that depends on a little bit of the velocity. So, if the store comes in, and for instance, if we open a store in Venice, California, the store filed up in six months, I would tell you a store that competes with that store, shouldn\u2019t have done anything; they should have just weathered the storm. So, typically when we open a new store, a CO store, we\u2019ll open it with rates 10% to 20% below market and we\u2019ll discount every single rental. So, it really depends on velocity and lease-up velocity when you make a decision on what you are going to do with the store.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. That makes sense. And then, just your comment on supply having sort of minimal impact, I guess so far. What -- either tactically or from the revenue management system, what factors could drive street rate growth, materially lower from here and vice versa, could you see reacceleration, post-2017?","Scott Stubbs","So, street rate changes, I would tell you are just one of the factors in the model. If you want to drive occupancy, the way you drive occupancy is your lower rates, you increase paid search spend, and you increase discounts. So, it\u2019s just one of the levers. So, it\u2019s going to depend obviously on your occupancy and your revenue growth; it\u2019s just one of the factors in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Neil Malkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, what is the premium to move-outs above move-ins in the fourth quarter, and then, what are you seeing in January?","Scott Stubbs","So, if you look at our -- when we talk about premium on move-outs, we don\u2019t talk about the rent roll down; what we\u2019re talking about is our average in-place rents compared to our average street rate. And I would tell you that on average for the year, it\u2019s mid to high single digits, depending on the time of the year. So, in another words, when we\u2019re raising rates in the summer that roll down or that negative mark is lower. But everybody does not move out in equal -- what I\u2019m saying is you have more churn. Our medium length of stay is 6 to 7 months but our average length of stay is 14 months. So, you have a group of units that are constantly churning to have a very short length of stay. So, many of those customers never received a rate increase or received one rate increase, and some of those moved in below street rates. So, when they move out, it\u2019s actually very little impact and also you have a large number of those that churn all the time. So, our negative mark-to-market is different than our in-place rents compared to our street rates.","Neil Malkin","Okay. And then, do you have a sense at all what your portfolio gain to lease is, so just kind of putting into terms the in-place versus market? Would you say it\u2019s mid single digit or\u2026?","Scott Stubbs","I am not sure I understand the question, Neil.","Neil Malkin","So, if everyone were to move out and replace with marketing your portfolio, what would the roll down look like?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you it\u2019s -- where our average leases are fairly close to market, and it\u2019s property-by-property.","Neil Malkin","Okay. And then, last one from me. Go ahead, sorry.","Joe Margolis","No. Go ahead.","Neil Malkin","You guys have commented for probably about 24 months now that the pace of lease-up on development in your CofO deals are well ahead of long-term trends. Are you seeing that abate at all or is lease-up still very -- the pace is pretty aggressive, I mean just given the supply -- new supply coming on, are you seeing those timelines elongate?","Joe Margolis","Yes. That\u2019s a good question. So, the earliest CofOs we delivered, we stopped within a year, most of them, just way ahead of historical margin underwriting. The more recent deals are leasing up between 1 and 2 years, on average. So, certainly, the pace of lease-up has slowed down, but we\u2019ve underwritten all of these deals at 36 to 42 months. So, they are not leasing up as fast as they were but they are still leasing up generally ahead of projections.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gwen Clark with Evercore.","Gwen Clark","Sorry. I just have two hopefully quick follow-ups. On G&A, can you remind us on how much I guess it costs when you put a managed asset into the pool?","Scott Stubbs","So, we actually have not just put that out in the public; it\u2019s something we\u2019ll consider looking at. But, we put a management fee into our properties that is what we consider a cost to manage when we underwrite.","Gwen Clark","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just next, can you just walk us through the performance of the New York City boroughs?","Joe Margolis","Sure. So, the five boroughs as opposed to our New York MSA which includes northern New Jersey and Long Island at revenue growth in the fourth quarter under 2% and for the year under 5%, about 4.7%.","Operator","And I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our host.","Jeff Norman","Thank you everybody for joining our call. We appreciate your questions and look forward to speak next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"8757":["Extra Space Storage, Inc.

My name is Jason, and I'm your conference operator today. Welcome to the Extra Space Storage Second Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Norman, the Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin the conference, sir.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Jason. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's second quarter 2019 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.","Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. ","Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today July 31, 2019. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Jeff. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a solid quarter with positive rate growth and healthy occupancy in a competitive summer leasing season.","Same-store revenue and NOI both increased by 3.9% exceeding our estimates. This property outperformance contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth of 6.1%, which was $0.02 above the top-end of our guidance.","We are pleased with our results in the first half of the year and the success our team and best-in-class platform have had mitigating the impact felt from new supply. In order to achieve this performance, we increased our advertising spend significantly on a year-over-year basis. And we do not expect the increased advertising spend to abate anytime soon.","As anticipated, we have seen the timing of expected deliveries slip on many developments. As these delayed projects deliver and begin their lease up, we expect additional moderation in the back half of the year. However, while the market will continue to be very competitive large operators with diversified portfolios and sophisticated systems like Extra Space Storage are best positioned to navigate the supply cycle.","We continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk\/reward metrics. Widely marketed acquisitions are still very expensive. However, we continue to find success acquiring off-market acquisitions through long-standing relationships.","During the quarter we purchased a non-marketed 11 property portfolio in a joint venture structure for $228 million. We also acquired one Certificate of Occupancy project and completed one development for a total investment by the company of $57 million.","We have also executed innovative capital-light opportunities to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter, we closed our first net lease transaction with W.P. Carey, which will include 36 total assets including five New York City assets that are new to our platform.","We are gaining traction in our bridge-lending program and our third-party management platform continues to see significant growth. In the quarter, we added 48 managed stores bringing our six-month total to 94 stores. Between our third-party program and our JV platform, we now manage 838 stores with the strong pipeline for the back half of the year.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Joe and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the quarter was a $1.22 per share exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property performance and tenant insurance income.","Revenue growth was driven by increased street rates with lower discounts also providing a tailwind. Year-over-year occupancy declined marginally in June, but we have already seen that bounce back in July and today our occupancy gap is approximately 30 basis points below this time last year. This is in line with our annual expectations.","Like last quarter same-store expenses were a mixed bag with increases in property taxes and marketing spend which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense. We view our elevated paid search and digital spend as one lever to drive revenue growth. However, pay per click advertising is expensive especially, in markets impacted by new supply.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to have access to multiple sources of capital and during the quarter, we accessed our ATM and issued approximately $100 million in equity. Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed a transaction that converted $500 million of secured debt to unsecured debt and extended the term.","For many years, we have been laddering our maturities and increasing the size of our unencumbered pool to strengthen our balance sheet. The quality of our balance sheet was recently recognized by S&P Global when they assigned a BBB flat rating. This is another step in our overall balance sheet evolution.","Due to our outperformance in the first half of the year, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 2.5% to 3.25%. As Joe mentioned, we still expect moderation in the back half of the year as we feel the additional impact from new supply. We also increased the bottom end of our expense guidance due to elevated marketing spend, resulting in an annual range of 4% to 4.75%. These changes result in raised annual same-store NOI guidance of 1.75% to 3%.","We raised our full year core FFO guidance to $4.79 to $4.87 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the second quarter. Our core FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores for total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions will provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.","With that, let's turn it over to Jason to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Scott Stubbs","Operator, do you have our first question with you?","Operator","The first question comes from Shirley Wu. You may now ask your question.","Shirley Wu","Hey, good afternoon guys. So my first question has to do with your revised revenue guidance options. So you raised revenue 40 basis points at the midpoint and that implies a 20 to 30 basis points acceleration of revenues in the second half. So, I'm just curious as to your thoughts on the cadence of revenue growth into the second half. And what would it take to get to the high versus the low point of your guidance range?","Scott Stubbs","Shirley it's Scott. So, without getting into too much detail in the exact cadence here, we obviously decelerated from quarter one to quarter two about 30 basis points. We are assuming that that cadence -- or some sort of that cadence continues into the back half of the year where we continue to decelerate and depending on where you're in the high and the low, I mean it's pretty simple math in order to get there. But without giving guidance as to where we are in that range, I think we do assume deceleration.","Shirley Wu","Okay. Thanks a lot. And so, on the street rates side, you mentioned that you saw slight increases. What were your achieved street rates in 2Q and also maybe quarter to-date into July?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. Our achieved street rates during the second quarter were between 1% to 2% and in July, they are slightly below that. But in exchange for that slightly lower street rate in July, we actually did see our occupancy bounce back a little bit, so as our model adjust we did see some benefit in -- with occupancy.","Shirley Wu","Thanks good color. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Shirley.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz. You may now ask your question.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, I guess I just wanted to follow up on that last question. As you think about where net effect of rents are and you talked about the occupancy gap coming -- narrowing a bit, but the deceleration you're expecting, do you think that's going to come more from the rent side? Or do you have a plan? You mentioned the tailwind in discounting has been. Do you expect to ramp discounting more here on a year-over-year basis into the back half?","Scott Stubbs","Jeremy, we don't expect discounts to benefit as to the same degree in the back half of the year that it did during the quarter. During the quarter, it benefited us by about 50 to 60 basis points. And then, if you look at our street rates or our achieved street rates over the past year, they continue to soften and those continue to flow through into our current rental revenues.","Jeremy Metz","All right. So it sounds like a little bit of both. So that's fair?","Scott Stubbs","Correct.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then, Joe, I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing on the acquisition front here. You've obviously been a big acquirer over the years. But just looking at what you have in the supp here, it feels like it's the first time in a while. It doesn't really look like you have much to anything under contract, just curious to read there.","Joe Margolis","Sure, Jeremy. We have about eight assets for $41 million under contract for the remainder of the year, and then a modest pipeline also compared to historically for 2020. And that's a function of how we perceive pricing in the market today. We see there's lots of equity seeking exposure to self-storage. I think people are concerned about a potential downturn in the economy. Self-storage performed well in the downturn of the economy and attracted that asset class it is easy to leverage.","So there's lots of equity keeping prices high and we're trying to remain disciplined. And if a particular deal doesn't work for us, we don't think it provides long-term shareholder value good risk\/reward metrics we will sit on the sideline with respect to marketed deals. That being said, historically, and certainly in this last quarter we've had success working our relationships and growing without accessing the marketed deals. And I hope that that continues in the future. Sorry for the long answer.","Jeremy Metz","No, I appreciate that. I mean, just given those dynamics that you talked about does it change any thoughts on selling some assets into that strong bid? I mean, you had the one in New York, but maybe some stuff beyond that to capitalize on that bid that you're talking about?","Joe Margolis","Yeah. Certainly, we look at our portfolio at least every year and we try to find assets that we think have lower future growth prospects than we can reinvest in. And when that situation occurs we will dispose off assets.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks, guys.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Jeremy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may now ask your question.","Todd Thomas","Hi. First question so you touched on street rates, I was just wondering if you can comment on move-in rates in the quarter. And how was this sequential increase that you achieved in move-in rates this quarter compared to prior years just moving \u2013 as you move throughout the peak season?","Scott Stubbs","So Q1 to Q2 rates were up slightly in terms of achieved move-in rate. In terms of where they are to in-place rates, we are below our in-place rates, as we move into the summer months. That's not odd. And what I mean by that is, if you look at an average existing customer rate compared to the achieved rate when they move in typically there is a roll down, but that is the average existing versus the new achieved. And you typically have more churn in short-term customers that are below the average. So it doesn't necessarily mean that there is always a negative churn as people move in and move out.","Todd Thomas","Got it. Was the move the increase in achieved rates from 1Q to 2Q this year, how did that compare to what you've seen in prior years?","Scott Stubbs","It was up, but it was probably a little softer. As we've see rates soften with the new supply, I don't think that's any surprise to anyone.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then Joe since announcing the net lease deal or transaction with W.P. Carey I'm just curious, if you had additional conversations with other owners to structure similar transactions? And how big is the company's appetite for these type of transactions?","Joe Margolis","It's a good question. So we issued a press release and as usual when that happens the phone starts to ring. So we have \u2013 are in conversations and have had conversations with other folks where this type of structure may make sense. And I think our appetite is as big as the deal dynamics that make sense. We're not going to target doing any more of these if we can't get the right type of returns for the risk we're taking, but as long as we can underwrite the deals successfully, and they are in markets within our operational footprint we'd be happy to do more.","Todd Thomas","Okay. All right, great. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Todd.","Joe Margolis","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.","Ronald Kamdem","Just a couple of quick ones for me. The first is just on \u2013 obviously there was a big increase in marketing spend and that will benefit move-in volumes. Just \u2013 could you maybe give us some color if that's still sort of a good use of \u2013 you're getting good returns on that spending? And if that's something we should expect maybe going to the back half of the year and potentially into next? As well as does that change the type of customers that moves into the property? So said another way, is it more a millennial? Is it more tech-savvy? Is there any discernible trends from the move-ins? Thanks.","Joe Margolis","So, I'll take those in reverse order. I don't think it changes the type of customers. I think almost everyone in society today searches for goods and services on the computer somehow. So we don't think it materially changes the type of customers. Yes, we do see continued elevated marketing spend throughout the rest of the year. And we're spending this money, because it produces a great return for us. And our systems bid on millions of keywords a day, and they go through algorithms -- complicated algorithms to determine how much to bid on any particular keyword and track the results to that. And we bid on keywords that produce acceptable returns to us, and don't bid on keywords that don't.","Ronald Kamdem","Helpful. The other question was just that as sort of -- as you're looking through some of your markets, particularly in the West Coast where you've had several years of pretty good pricing appreciation, are you getting any sense of customers fatigue at all? Or is there still some upside there? Thank you.","Joe Margolis","Yeah. I'm a little uncomfortable with the word customer fatigue, because there is still strong demand for our product and we don't see any moderation in demand anywhere. I think with respect to rents, I agree with you. You're right if you increase rents in a market like Sacramento by mid-teens three years in a row, at some point the product just gets a little too expensive and you can't increase it by that amount. Again, you need a little break. But we're still getting a bump portfolio at average rate increases in those markets. So to the extent, fatigue means you raise prices so hard, it backs off for a little bit. I think that's a fair observation.","Ronald Kamdem","Helpful, and thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citigroup. You may now ask your question.","Smedes Rose","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you when you're looking at acquisition opportunities and you said some of them come through off-market relationships and off-market deals, but is there any sort of market difference between what you're seeing for stabilized properties versus facilities that are still in lease-up on pricing? Or are there any like more attractive opportunities I guess for lease-up? We just have heard that the valuations there become much more interesting for some of those that are underperforming relative to initial expectation.","Joe Margolis","So, I'll tell you if you look at the four stores that we have approved for acquisition this year, all of those are unstabilized. They're somewhere between 54% and 79% occupied, initial yields between 3.5% and 5%. So, they are value-add type acquisitions that will stabilize in the low 6s somewhere. But some -- there is 4. It's not -- we haven't seen a huge rush or volume of those stores at prices that we believe makes sense to us. So...","Smedes Rose","You think that's something that could come maybe to fruition over the next several quarters or...","Joe Margolis","I don't think that the amount of capital that is seeking exposure to self-storage is going to change materially in the next few quarters. Therefore, I'd be surprised, if all of a sudden there is a flood of these opportunities that make sense to us. I think we're going have to, for the foreseeable future, work hard be innovative do some different things for our external growth as opposed to go out there and be the high bidder when there is lots and lots of other capital bidding on these assets.","Smedes Rose","Okay. Thanks. And then just Joe, you mentioned, the lending program, I'm just wondering if you could maybe update us on kind of where you are on that or just how many loans have you made? And what's the level of interest level has been like?","Joe Margolis","Sure. So, we expect to close about $100 million worth of loans by the end of the year. The amount of that $100 million that will be Extra Space capital we'll determine, because we will sell-off pieces to our debt partner in that structure that we've set up with them. And I think the interest is good. We have a good pipeline. We're being disciplined in underwriting these opportunities just like we underwrite acquisitions. But we are gaining traction. We're learning. We're getting better. And I expect that program to continue to accelerate.","Smedes Rose","Great. Thank you.","Jeff Norman","Thanks, Smedes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. You may now ask your question.","Ryan Lumb","This is Ryan Lumb. I just want to circle back on the topic of discounting. And if I understand correctly from prior comments and comments that were made last quarter, it sounds like the dollar value of discounting has been sort of lower than you had originally expected. While at the same time, the marketing spend online has been quite a bit higher. I'm just wondering if those two events are related, because we've heard similar trends from other large operators as well. I'm just wondering if there is sort of a trade-off that a dollar is better spent today with online marketing rather than trying to attract a customer with a promotion with the first month rent.","Scott Stubbs","Yeah. I would tell you that it's sum of both meaning we have made a conscious choice to spend more on marketing obviously. We feel like that's better than lowering rates. However, we still feel like discounts are effective. If you look at why our discounts are lower year-over-year part of the reason is because our rentals were down slightly. And so that causes your discounts to be down slightly.","And then in addition, we have changed our rental, our discount policy such that we do not discount at certain levels of occupancy. And so -- for instances on a last year no we're not going to offer a discount on something like that. So some small tweaks in the discounting kind of policy or procedure as well as lower rental volumes has also caused discounting to be down. And then also a conscious decision to spend more on marketing.","Ryan Lumb","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just kind of more of a broader question on external growth or acquisition appetite. If you think of Extra Space is one of the most capitalized with most attractive cost of capital in the industry. Who are you losing to? Are you losing to just someone who has much higher leverage profile or appetite to carry debt on the acquisitions? Or you think that Extra Space would just be among the most competitive in the acquisition environment right now?","Joe Margolis","So there is a wide variety of different types of capital out there. We're losing to local capital, private equity and in some cases the other public companies. And everyone's got a different cost to capital, a different leverage tolerance, a different risk tolerance, a different view of the future and maybe underwriting greater rental growth than we are a different hold period that they're underwriting to. So people are all making different decisions that maybe logical for them. But for us, we're looking at our long-term value creation, long-term cost to capital and trying as hard as we can to remain disciplined and only do deals that we feel very comfortable are going to provide long-term value to our shareholders.","Ryan Lumb","Okay. Thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore. You may now ask your question.","Joe Margolis","Steve, are you on?","Steve Sakwa","Oh, sorry, had the mute button on, sorry. First question. On the loan book, you said you're closing in on $100 million by the end of the year. Is there a target size that you're looking for that total book of business? Or how big will that business be? Or how big do you think it can be? And what kind of rates are you charging on that business?","Joe Margolis","So we don't have any limitation. Our balance sheet is in shape that we have plenty of access to different types of capital. And as long as we can make loans that earn a good risk-adjusted return, we'll continue to make loans. So we don't have an artificial cap on the size of that business. I don't really know the answer to the second question. And just one thing we're very curious about is how big this business can get.","And when we started it, we said, we're going to walk before we run and we're still walking. And we'll see -- I think time will tell how big it's going to get. And we have this debt partner also that allows us to -- it's kind a governor on the size. So if we decide we want to continue to make loans, but not put out as much capital we can lay off a piece of loan to our debt partner. So that provides us good flexibility and also a way to increase our returns. And then your last question was on pricing?","Steve Sakwa","Just the pricing on those loans.","Joe Margolis","Yes. I think we're competitive in the market I'd say that.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. I guess second question. Just as you think about sort of the deceleration that you're expected to see in the second half of the year. And you sort of talked about the supply still being somewhat elevated although and we've seen some delays in the deliveries. As you kind of think about the industry, is your expectation that we would continue to still see sort of a deceleration into 2020 even if supply does kind of peak this year and begin to moderate next year?","Joe Margolis","So we -- the supply cycle is not going to end on December 31, 2019, right? There will continue to be deliveries of stores into 2020 and we're going to continue to have to deal with that. The question is are the markets that may be on the other side of the development cycle, outweigh the markets that are more on the front end of the development cycle and we won't have a good answer to it till we individually budget every property and provide 2020 guidance.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Steve.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question.","Todd Stender","Hi, thanks. Just to kind of circle back with the triple net lease with W.P. Carey. Just so I understand I guess the general dynamics. You manage the properties and collect and book all the cash flow and then pay them a rent and cover the operating expenses. How does that kind of work?","Joe Margolis","So it's a traditional triple net lease, where we're responsible for all -- we collect all the revenue and we're responsible for all the operating and capital expenses of the properties, and we pay them rent every month. And the return we get has three components. It's a differential between NOI and the rent payment and hopefully that increases over time. It is a kind of baked-in management fee, it's not a management fee, but it's calculated management fee in the rent calculation. And it's our ability to sell tenant insurance at the properties.","Todd Stender","Okay. That's helpful. You're mostly a JV owner with other equity players. Why did you take the triple net lease structure and not a joint venture or really that was W.P. Carey's call?","Joe Margolis","Yeah. Exactly right. So W.P. Carey is a triple net lease REIT. They purchased a vehicle called CPA:17, which had wholly-owned self-storage assets in there some of which we manage some of which others manage. Now they had wholly-owned assets in that triple net lease REIT and they needed to do something with them. We would have loved to buy them or JV them, but that was not an option. So we came up with this structure that we felt is a win-win. They get a triple net lease with investment grade credit tenant on a long-term lease, which is what they're looking for. And we get to keep control of the 22 Extra Space assets. We get five additional assets that weren't Extra Space assets. And we believe it was a positive structure for both of us.","Todd Stender","All right. That's helpful color. Thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. You may now ask your question.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Hey, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups on the bridge loan program. If the loans defaulted, what would the cost basis look like compared to replacement cost? Just trying to get a sense of the mode of safety.","Joe Margolis","So we are underwriting these to value not to replacement cost. Replacement costs are a really difficult metric, I think in self-storage basically because of the land component. When you have something that has a really small market ring -- it's hard to find a comparable zoned piece of land to put in your land component. But to answer your question, how we're underwriting these things? As we underwrite them as if we're going to buy them. And then we lend 75% or 80% of what we would have been happy to buy the assets at.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And for the triple net deals, I'm just trying to get a sense of how close the rent you're -- the NOI you're collecting is compared to the rent you're paying. At the onset is it very tight or is there a nice margin? Just trying to get a sense of that gap.","Joe Margolis","We would tell you there is a nice margin. We underwrote these with the same discipline that we underwrite the $5 billion worth of acquisitions we've done over the last five years. Our track record is excellent if you look at the stats of our underwriting versus actual performance.","We knew -- I gave a bad number in my previous answer, it's 31 assets not 22 assets managed by Extra Space, that we knew those assets very, very well. And we're very comfortable with the underwriting and with the spread between NOI and rent.","Ki Bin Kim","All right. Thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks Ki Bin.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Joe Margolis.","Joe Margolis","Great. Thank you everyone for your time and interest in Extra Space. If I could just highlight a couple of things, we continue to experience solid property level NOI growth despite new supply. We do expect some moderation, but we're very happy with the way the teams and the systems are able to maximize performance in this environment and we've gotten better. As we get deeper into the development cycles, the systems and the machines learn how to do better and I think that's showing in our numbers.","And secondly, external growth is tough now, but we will continue to be disciplined and innovative to find ways where we can to grow as long as it makes sense for our shareholders in the long-term. Thank you very much. I hope everyone has a good day.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Jeff Norman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Ben. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s first quarter 2015 conference call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.","Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review.","Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, Thursday, April 30, 2015. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Hello, everyone. In our recently released annual report, we told our shareholders that they can expect more from Extra Space. I\u2019m pleased to announce that we delivered on that promise in the first quarter. We reached a record high occupancy of 92.5%, while producing same-store revenue growth 8.3%.","Year-over-year, NOI grew 11.4% and FFO as adjusted grew 21%, impressive for what has historically been the slowest time of the year. As of today, we have closed on $277 million in acquisitions and we continue to build our national portfolio. It was an excellent quarter for Extra Space and I'm confident in our position heading into the rental season.","I'd now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Spencer. Last night, we reported FFO of $0.68 per share for the quarter. Excluding costs associated with acquisitions and non-cash cash interests, FFO as adjusted was $0.69 per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily the result of better-than-expected property performance and tenant reinsurance income. ","Our same-store revenue growth was driven by increased occupancy and higher street rates. 120 basis points of this increase in revenue came from the change in our same-store pool. Specifically, the addition of our 2013 acquisitions which have performed extremely well.","We've been busy deploying capital. We've closed on eight stores for $84 million in the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired 24 stores for 193 million, which include a portfolio in Dallas. In addition, we have four operating stores under contract for $32 million.","These acquisitions should close in the next 90 days. We have another 16 certificate of occupancy stores under contract. The total purchase price of these store is 175 million, of which 58 million is expected to close in 2015. Additional details related to our C of O deals can be found in our supplemental package posted on our website.","Based on our strong first quarter results, we've increased our full-year guidance to be $2.90 to $2.98 per share. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $2.94 to $3.02 per share. Our guidance includes dilution from our certificate of occupancy deals and acquisitions that operate below our portfolio average. Accretion on certain acquisitions will be limited in year one as we bring them up to our performance standards. Our long-term strategy is to leverage our operating expertise and to maximize our shareholder return.","I'll now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Scott. We continue to invest heavily in our customer acquisition platform and our mobile strategy. This is driving more higher value customers to our stores. The pervasive use of the smartphone and our ability to reach and capture the mobile user has further shifted the competitive landscape in our favour.","We continue building our portfolio through acquisitions and the expansion of our third-party management services. Our balance sheet has never been stronger and we continue to execute on our business plan at a very high level. This is evidenced by our 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit FFO growth.","So, I will end the way I started by saying our shareholders can expect more from Extra Space.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the time back to Jeff to start our Q&A.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone's questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limit to two. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions. With that, we will turn it over to Ben to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Hoglund of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Hoglund","Hi, Spencer. Just wondered if you could give an updated view on the overall pipeline for new deliveries in 2015?","Spencer Kirk","You\u2019re talking specifically our C of O or you\u2019re talking holistically throughout the whole country?","George Hoglund","Holistically.","Spencer Kirk","No, I continue to maintain that the supply is muted. I personally believe that we are in the hundreds and I think that's going to continue into 2016, George. We are at a fraction of the supply that we saw about 8 or 10 years ago, when I talk to fraction, 20%, 25%, 30% pick a number, but we are at a fraction of that and I think that the muted supply is going to bode well for all storage operators, not only in 2015, but through 2016.","George Hoglund","Okay. And can you talk about some of the cap rates on the deals done and also how you are underwriting the C of O deals in terms of what our stabilised cap rates and what's your assumptions in terms of timing of stabilization?","Scott Stubbs","Yeah. George, this is Scott. Our cap rates have been, what I would tell you, all over the place and what I mean by that is our certificate of occupancy deals obviously don't have any yield at day one. We will do some of those this year, we\u2019ve done some over the past couple of years. We typically target a cap rate in the low to mid-6s for year one cap rate and some of the acquisitions have been that or better than that and some of them have been lower than that depending on the operator and if we felt like there was upside.","So sorry to be general as that, but I think that's really the way we view them and kind of what we\u2019ve been doing. As far as the overall market, things are competitive still. I think you've seen the REITs be probably the winner of a lot of these acquisitions, if something gets marketed, they typically have the lowest cost of capital and getting the majority of the deals.","George Hoglund","Okay. And then just one last one, just in terms of the third-party management business, how important do you view it as rebranding properties as Extra Space when you bring something onto your platform, I mean because obviously demand, if they get rebranded, I'm just wondering how much of a difference you think it would make if you didn't rebrand it?","Spencer Kirk","George, the difference is huge. When you spend seven figures on a monthly basis trying to build a brand and an awareness, our philosophy is that there needs to be a consistency of experience from cradle to grave and you can only achieve that to the highest and most optimal level with the single brand strategy. There are many ways to operate storage, we just happen to prefer a single brand strategy, it's huge. ","George Hoglund","Thanks guys.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. Just had a question on your thoughts, I mean every year we kind of keep talking about structural occupancy and maybe in some cases moving that up a bit. Just kind of wanted to get a sense of how you are viewing that going into the summer months and was there any impact in your mind either in move-ins or move-outs just from the winter.","Scott Stubbs","Vikram, this is Scott. We actually finished the quarter at record high occupancy from us. So we feel like it\u2019s going to be good summer. Our internal estimates are we feel like we can top out at just over 94% and we feel like it's going to be a good leasing season. As far as the winter months, I mean clearly it affected people's ability to move in, but it also affected people's ability to move out. So if you look at our net rentals for the first quarter, it was actually a good quarter for us.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just a clarification on one of the earlier questions. Assuming that there is, call it, 300, 400 or 500 units out there, what percent of that do you view as kind of competition for your own properties?","Spencer Kirk","That's a great question. With 50,000 plus stores in the US, we\u2019d have to break that down into which markets we're talking about, Vikram. And our presence in the market and what that new supply coming at the market, because not all markets are seeing the same surge of supply. There are vastly different starts depending on which municipality you are talking about. So, sorry for the general answer to the specific question, but that would be on a case-by-case basis.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Vikram.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys, good morning. Obviously had a great start to the year. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the rate side today in terms where you are pushing renewals and in terms of new rents and then also kind of as we look at the portfolio, where are realized rents today versus your in-place leases?","Spencer Kirk","Okay. So let me take a couple of those. Last question first, in-place versus achieved, it's kind of mid-to-high single digits delta. There is a little bit of roll down that depends on the seasonality. Obviously in the slower part of the year it's going to be more and at the peak season is where we're pushing rates. It's going to be less. So we think it's manageable and it has been manageable and we don't think it's a major issue. On the existing customer rate increases, Jeremy, we continue to put out rate increases to about 10% of our existing customers every single month. So that's 65,000 give or take. It's averaging between 9% and 10% and we think it is working well. Then your first question was --","Jeremy Metz","Just about street rents today versus how much higher versus last year.","Spencer Kirk","They are higher and our strategy, just to put a little color on that, Jeremy, has been in the slow season to maintain occupancy and we were the beneficiaries of something where not only did we maintain our occupancy, but we grew our occupancy and we also saw some buoyancy in the rates that we've been able to get because of those occupancy levels. That gives us confidence going into this prime rental season. I think you're going to see us in the summer time on the street rates be able to push things as much as high single digits. And during the year hopefully we will end up somewhere around an overall rate increase of about 5%.","Jeremy Metz","And have you been able to squeeze more on the discounting as well?","Spencer Kirk","Discounts are down, yes.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then just one other on maybe for Scott on the acquisition front. Obviously also off to a very strong start here with over 300 million either closed or under contract, just thinking about the guidance of $450 million for the year, just given the activities out already, would you be disappointed if you don't do more than that at this point?","Scott Stubbs","I think our expectation is to be able to meet our guidance of $500 million. Right now our guidance is broken into two components. It's $450 million for outside acquisitions and then $50 million C above deals and we're comfortable with that at this time.","Jeremy Metz","Alright, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Jeremy. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you and congrats on a really good quarter. So it seems like obviously business is doing really well and I doubt the entire industry is increasing same-store revenues at 8.3% and I would say versus just market expectations everyone probably assume that we're kind of getting over that camel's hump in terms of the pace and trends in same-store revenue growth. Just curious what have you changed or altered in terms of like the way you advertise in the Internet or mobile or maybe it's a pricing strategy that has allowed you to really push the same-store revenue this high.","Spencer Kirk","Ki Bin, it's Spencer. A couple of things. I think the ascendancy of the mobile device has been something that we foresaw. We invested aggressively and heavily and I think we've been the beneficiary of that early and significant investment. It's a complex world to go after all of the different mobile platforms and devices in ways that people can get to us. And our goal has been, as I said in my opening remarks, to drive more higher value customers to our facilities. ","And so to that end, there has been a tremendous effort inside Extra Space to rationalize, harmonize and optimize the call center, revenue management and the interactive marketing departments under one central nervous system so that we can truly produce the highest investor result and I would say it's not one single thing we're doing, it's an execution on a lot of different disparate elements to make sure that we drive as I said, the best value highest value customers to our facilities because every customer is not created equally.","Ki Bin Kim","Would you see the Internet advertising way of doing business as [indiscernible] on that equation versus just purely optimizing pricing day to day?","Scott Stubbs","It's all harmonized, you can't single out any one element, it's got to work together hand-in-hand, you can't have your interactive marketing people working at odds with revenue management and that's been a major initiative over the last two years here at Extra Space is to bring that all into one single department and have one cohesive strategy and it seems to be working.","Ki Bin Kim","And just last one, what percent of your customers are receiving some type of promotion this quarter?","Scott Stubbs","It varied a little bit during the quarter, it was as high as 85% and as low as 69% through the quarter and that's month-by-month. So the majority, call it, three quarters of our new customers coming in the door get some type of promotion, now the type of promotion they\u2019re getting is less than it has been in the past but majority of them are getting a promotion.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Ki Bin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Todd Thomas","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Just first question, I appreciate the detail on page 20 of the operations of the CofD deals. In terms of the lease up at these sites, obviously it's just four properties in four very different markets but you're getting the occupancy up fairly quickly it seems, where would say rates are at these sites relative to market and what kind of concessions are you offering to new customers?","Scott Stubbs","So in terms of the lease up of the properties, these properties are leasing up quicker than our initial estimates, typically we have estimated three to four years, I mean, I think these are on pace to do more two to three. In terms of rates, I think they\u2019re similar to what we were expecting; we typically entered the market being kind of the low cost provider or the low price option to try to get more than our share of the market to increase our occupancy quicker. And then, in terms of discounts, we are discounting almost every unit coming in the door.","Todd Thomas","Do you have a sense for where, you know how far below market the rates are?","Scott Stubbs","It might be 10%.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then, we came the disposition in Brooklyn picked up by some local papers I guess, the joint venture asset that was sold at a pretty nice price, are there any other assets in the ventures that you and you partner might look to sell, was there any thought to buying out your partner's interest there or just not at that price?","Scott Stubbs","We have a few assets that we might look to sell, it's more market driven, typically we're of the attitude that we're trying to build the portfolio. We are always interested in, we enjoy partners but we\u2019re always interested in buying out our partners. This particular asset you're talking about, an outside buyer approached us and offered us a price that was very difficult to refuse.","Todd Thomas","Okay and then just one more. Just thinking about the technology and how the industry has evolved. Looked like in the quarter, you sold some web assets, I think to Storage.com and just curious how that sort of plays into your thoughts and view around the technology for the industry, if you can share some thoughts and maybe some details on that?","Spencer Kirk","Todd, it's Spencer, we continued to invest in digital real estate. The fact of the matter is, our core business is not being an aggregator and we think aggregation has its role for certain assets and certain markets but since it\u2019s not our core business, we decided to take Storage.com and 15 other domain names, packaged them up and sell them off to a company and my understanding is, they are doing well with those assets and it's their core business and we're focused on what we do best.","Todd Thomas","Okay. Are you able to share any of the terms or economics on the transaction at all?","Spencer Kirk","I apologize, but there is an NDA and I can't.","Todd Thomas","Okay, alright, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Gaurav Mehta","Thank you, Spencer I want to go back to your comments on Internet, and driving higher value customers for Extra Space. So when you say higher value, is it the rents that the customer is paying, is the average length of stay and how did you find higher value for Extra Space?","Spencer Kirk","It's defined by a lot of things, length of stay would be at the top of the list, and as I've said several times, college kids aren't the highest value customer and why we would spend a lot of money going after them or offering a discount or a promotion defies logic. A customer coming to us in November is likely to have a length of stay that is considerably longer and if you start looking at AUTOPAY, and few of the other things whether they're using a credit card or not, you can pretty well start to figure out that a segmentation of your customer base is probably healthy and will yield a better result than just assuming that the market is one homogenous environment where everybody gets the same discount, they get the same price, they get the same everything.","Our goal as I've said many times is to deliver the right customer at the right time with the right concession with appropriate price to maximum the revenue and that's what we've been doing.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And my second question is on certificate of occupancy deals, so it seems it\u2019s growing. For Extra Space last quarter, you had 13, this quarter you have 16. How big is the deal pipeline for Extra Space and how big do you want to \u2013 how many properties do you want to have in that pipeline?","Scott Stubbs","Gaurav, this is Scott. Our focus is more on dilution and how much we are going to accept on an annual basis. We targeted kind of 2% to 3% of our annual FFO and so that is more of the governor for us. We are saying, we want to grow, we want to grow this part of the business, we think it\u2019s healthy, we think that they have good yields, if we can find the right one. But at the same time, we recognized that we don\u2019t want to have too much dilution on an annual basis. ","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Gaurav.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead. ","Todd Stender","Hi, thanks guys. You\u2019re entering peak season at arguably very high occupancy. Number one, is this above your expectation? And where I am going with this is that, it\u2019s high enough where you could actually see occupancy dip a little bit this year because your pricing is on the aggressive side, which ultimately drives revenues that much better.","Spencer Kirk","Obviously, we are pleased with the result. We also think that there is some more upside, Todd, coming into the peak season. We don\u2019t think that our pricing is going to cause a dip in occupancy. As we forecast what might happen in the coming months, we are optimistic that not only might there be a couple of hundred basis points left in the occupancy hitting the peak, but a little bit of rate. Our goal once again is to maximize revenue, it\u2019s not about rate, it\u2019s not about occupancy, it\u2019s about maximizing revenue. ","Todd Stender","Hey, thank you Spencer. And then just finally, your deal flow has been excellent, lots of visibility, where the acquisitions are coming from, you\u2019ve got the biggest third party management platform out there. Where ultimately the deal is coming from? Are those folks calling you up? The folks you are meeting at conferences, are they truly coming from third party management?","Spencer Kirk","All of the above. We are doing outbound efforts, we do take a lot of inbound calls. I think most sellers know that \u2013 and all of the rates is a really good place to start because they have got the cost of capital advantage that Scott alluded to earlier. Our management platform continues to be a strategic acquisition pipeline. ","And I want to highlight that the portfolio in Dallas we got done subsequent to the end of the quarter happened to be an OP unit transaction. Issuing OP units and selling the benefits of that to perspective sellers has been a competitive advantage and it\u2019s been the one that we have used successfully for several years now. ","Todd Stender","Thanks, Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","R.J. Milligan","Thanks. Scott, a question for you in terms of the CFO deals that you\u2019re seeing out there. Are you seeing more lenders enter the marketplace looking to make development loans or is that still holding off the new supply?","Scott Stubbs","We feel like it\u2019s still holding off the new supply. As we talk to banks, we obviously talk to them all the time, I think they are willing to make loans to well-capitalized, individuals that they have loans with or relationships with, but typically the terms aren\u2019t anywhere near what they were on hay day. They are looking for people to have equity at risk, real equity versus just putting up their land. And so we think it still absolutely as limiting factor in development.","R.J. Milligan","Okay. And then as you guys think about new supply coming online over the next couple of years, which is still expected to be small, do you anticipate bulk of that would be in sort of what\u2019s traditionally been the high barrier to entry markets given where rents are or do you expect to see more development outside of the Top 25 MSAs?","Scott Stubbs","I think you will see it both places. I mean, clearly people want to get things done in the top MSAs, but they are tough to get things done there, and it\u2019s easier to get things done in maybe a more suburban area. ","R.J. Milligan","Okay. Thanks guys.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks R.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Dave Bragg","Thank you. Good morning. And thank you for the disclosure on the same store pool on page 16, and the question relates to that. It looks as though, there was a 200 basis point benefit to NOI growth in the quarter from the inclusion of new same-store assets as you grow NOI growth there at a tremendous rate above 20% with these newly added assets. But can you reconcile that figure to the 50 basis point estimate that you suggested for the full year on the last conference call?","Scott Stubbs","So on an annual basis, you\u2019re going to see that decline. So for instance, during the quarter, you had a 120 basis points of revenue, half of which was occupancy. But you can see in that same table, our ending occupancy at the end of Q1 for both pools is the exact same. And it actually was about the same by mid-year last year. ","So you\u2019re going to see that benefit go very, very quickly. I think it might be slightly higher than the 50 basis points we originally said, but it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near the 200 you saw in the quarter or the 120 basis points of revenue.","Dave Bragg","Okay. I don\u2019t see that occupancy disclosure, but we will look on a different page for that. So are you saying that the benefit from newly added same-store assets is somewhere around 100 basis points of NOI growth in 2015? Is that a fair estimate?","Scott Stubbs","When we were talking benefit, we were focusing more on the revenue piece and how to plug down. We are assuming the expense benefit would not be there. And I think you will see that even out more throughout the year.","As far as the occupancy disclosure, that was a change that was pushed later last night. So if you look at the latest version of the supplemental, it does have the latest occupancy for both pools in it.","Dave Bragg","Okay. Thank you for that. And next question relates to cap rates. In your November NAREIT presentation, you included a chart, it was really just directional in nature, but it suggested that cap rates had stabilized or maybe creeped up a little bit in 2014. Could you just update us on cap rate trends as you\u2019ve seen them?","Spencer Kirk ","I think you\u2019re seeing cap rates somewhat have bottomed out. We haven\u2019t seen a significant tick up but I think that they\u2019ve largely bottomed out.","Dave Bragg ","Thanks. One more question if I may. Just going back to I think this might tie it to the Storage.com sale, but it appears as though you\u2019ve gotten on SpareFoot.com, something that you haven\u2019t really utilized in the past. Can you talk about that decision?","Spencer Kirk","Sure. So, we\u2019ve had our own internal aggregation business, Storage.com, which we\u2019ve talked about. We\u2019ve been out there competing with SpareFoot and we simply did a test with SpareFoot with certain assets in certain markets to see what it might yield. And as I said just moments ago, Dave, we think aggregation has its role and it can be a tool, but our primary effort is not aggregation, it\u2019s not relying on a third-party to supply our customers, and we\u2019re certainly not putting our destiny in the hands of a third-party. We have invested very heavily in our own strategy and I think our results speak for themselves.","Dave Bragg","Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit about the cost to acquire a customer through a form such as SpareFoot versus organically?","Spencer Kirk","It varies depending on what kind of customer you\u2019re going after, David. I would say our belief is internally our CPA, cost per acquisition, for a customer is below that of what the aggregators would charge us, which is why we spend the majority of our marketing dollars internally, not externally.","Dave Bragg ","Understood, thank you for that.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky","Hey, good afternoon guys. Spencer or Scott, could you just comment on the amount of total products you\u2019re seeing on the market right now, inclusive of third parties as well as your JVs? And of that, how much of that is price sensitive, meaning if they don\u2019t get the price, does it pull it off the market versus actively being marketed right now?","Spencer Kirk","I think that what we\u2019re seeing on the market today is pretty similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past in terms of the first quarters. Typically, at the start of the year, it\u2019s a little bit slower. We have seen some get pulled, but there have been a couple of larger deals, typically they do transact if they go -- especially if it\u2019s brokered. I mean, something that is more just an enquiry might not transact, but if it\u2019s brokered, they typically transact.","Michael Salinsky","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then this is my second question, I mean, three months into the year right now, how do you feel about supply in 2016 and I know you\u2019ve commented that there is a lack of financing is really driving it, but we had several good years of great growth, we\u2019ve also seen -- we\u2019ve also seen assets transact well above replacement cost. How long do you think we have to really start to see maybe private capital or someone else enter the arena to kind of make up for that funding gap?","Spencer Kirk","This is really interesting, Michael, there is an awful lot of talk about development. Trade shows, meeting with people across the country, everybody wants to get on to the self-storage train, because it\u2019s a great business. I would say, talk is cheap and execution is really tough. Financing is tough, paying up for land that\u2019s got to be suitable is tough and one of the biggest things that I am not sure that everybody has calculated into this is, it\u2019s great to get it build. Once you get it build, how are you going to compete against the REITs? So, you\u2019re going to start paying management fees and probably giving up some or all of your tenant insurance and the risk versus return curve has shifted and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just compelling to do this.","So, yeah, there is a lot of activity in New York. Let\u2019s talk about the lack of activity in LA and San Francisco, where we\u2019re talking single digit property counts coming out of the ground. So, for me, 2015, supply is not an issue, 2016, not an issue. Let\u2019s get a little closer to 2017 and we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s going to be impactful. The point I made earlier, Mike, was during the mid-2000s, more than 2,600 properties a year were fed into the market. Today, we\u2019re at a fraction of that and in 2016, it will still be a fraction and 2017, it will still be a fraction. So, supply is a factor. I just don\u2019t believe that the supply chain is going to deliver up product fast enough to have a material impact for the next 18 months and maybe beyond.","Michael Salinsky","Very good color. I appreciate the help. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open, please go ahead. Please check to ensure that your line is not on mute. And we appear to have difficulty with Ki Bin\u2019s line and I am showing no further questions, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Spencer Kirk for any closing remarks.","Thank you, Ben.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norman, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jeff Norman - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Shawn. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s third quarter 2014 conference call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished un-audited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.","Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, Thursday, October 30, 2014. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk - Chief Executive Officer","Hello, everyone. In the third quarter, we saw steady demand and muted supply. These factors contributed to year-over-year increases in achieved rates and occupancy. As a result, revenue increased 7.2%, NOI grew 9.3%, and occupancy increased 100 basis points. FFO as adjusted increased 26.3%. This is on top of growing 24% the year before. This quarter marks 4 years of consecutive quarterly double-digit FFO growth. The climate for self storage remains favorable and I believe that we will experience double-digit FFO growth for many quarters to come. Despite heightened competition for properties on the open market, we continue to grow our portfolio through accretive acquisitions and expansion of our third-party management platform. The relationships with our partners enable us to negotiate mutually beneficial off-market transactions.","Scott Stubbs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Spence. Last night, we reported FFO of $0.72 per share for the third quarter. Excluding cost associated with acquisitions and non-cash interest, FFO as adjusted was also $0.72 per share. $0.01 of our beat was due to better-than-expected property performance, including tenant insurance. The rest of our beat was due to lower income taxes in our taxable REIT subsidiary.","Over the last few years, we have researched the tax structure of our TRS, specifically the concept of paying a royalty to the OPREIT for access to its intellectual property. Charging this type of fee is not uncommon in the insurance industry and can be paid to affiliated companies or third-parties. Recent IRS rulings and expert opinions have given us the necessary comfort to adopt this practice. This change provides the tax benefit for the current year and will provide an ongoing benefit in the years to come.","During the quarter, we acquired three properties for $26.7 million in Florida, Georgia and Texas. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired two additional properties for $17.5 million located in Colorado and Georgia. We currently have 11 properties under contract for $108.2 million, which should close by the end of the first quarter of 2015. As of today, we have closed or have under contract $493.2 million. In addition to the $493 million, we have 7 other properties that we will acquire upon completion of construction totaling $69.5 million. These properties are under contract and will open in 2015 and 2016. The sites are located in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas. Two of these properties totaling $21.9 million will be purchased by a joint venture of which Extra Space will have a 10% equity interest.","We have revised our full year 2014 FFO guidance to be from $2.54 to $2.57 per share. The increase is primarily due to lower income taxes. These estimates include non-cash interest in acquisition-related costs. Adjusting for these items, FFO is estimated to be from $2.58 to $2.61 for the full year.","I will now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Scott. As a management team, our job is to maximize shareholder value. On August 12, we celebrated our 10-year anniversary as a public company. We are now included in the 10-year total return benchmarks with 106 publicly traded REITs. Since that time, our total return to shareholders has been the highest or second highest of any REIT on the NYSE. It is noteworthy that the total returns of all three storage REITs with a 10-year track record rank in the top 15. It has been a great decade for self storage and I am very pleased with the result we have created for our shareholders. Let\u2019s turn the time over to Jeff to start the Q&A.","Jeff Norman - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limit it to two. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had the opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we will turn the time over to Shawn to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citigroup. Please proceed.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","Hi, thanks. When you are buying in these C of O deals, can you talk a little bit about how you think about pricing? And is there a limit to how many you would buy in a given year to limit the dilutive impact, you have been pretty vocal in recent years about not going full on into the development game anymore?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, Christy, this is Scott. As far as the total dilution we are targeting right now it\u2019s 2% to 3% of your annual FFO. So, we would like to keep it fairly minimal, but also participate as far as how we underwrite them and what kind of returns we are looking for. It really depends a little bit on the market and the property, but it\u2019s usually anywhere between 150 and 250 basis points over what a stabilized property would go for today.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","Okay, go ahead.","Spencer Kirk","And on our prior call, Christy, we talked about that as the management team we have targeted 2% to 3% of our FFO as the target for dilution that we would be willing to accept. Now, that target may move, but with these C of O opportunities that are present in the selves, we have set a target to make sure that we deliver the earnings that the Street is expecting without massive dilution. We have been down that road before.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","Right. As you continue to gain scale, how do you think about your property management platform today from a profitability perspective? Is it still just sort of a future source for acquisitions and a source of incremental tenant insurance revenues or is it a profitable business?","Spencer Kirk","It is a profitable business, Christy. You hit the key point on the head and that is it becomes a proprietary off-market acquisition pipeline. That\u2019s why we are doing this. Secondarily, obviously we could like management fees to that point depending on where you put a property into the system. If you put a single property into Los Angeles, for instance, that\u2019s a very profitable proposition for us. When you go to places where we don\u2019t have the same kind of density, it\u2019s still profitable, but maybe not the same degree. Tenant insurance obviously works very well and not to be missed with 270 something properties that has provided us a much bigger footprint in the world of digital real estate with Internet searches and dollars that we can allocate to pay-per-click advertising on the Internet. So, the scale is of great benefit. And I think oftentimes that\u2019s overlooked.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Christy.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Burke of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Ryan Burke - Green Street Advisors","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the color on development versus acquisition yields. Are you able to generalize that dynamic on a dollar per square foot basis? So, where are you acquiring these C of O deals on a dollar per square foot basis relative where you could acquire stabilized acquisitions in a given market?","Spencer Kirk","We haven\u2019t been heavily focused on that, Ryan, for the reason that we feel like when we are buying certificate of occupancy deals, you are effectively eliminating two of the three risks associated with the property, you are eliminating the construction risk, you are eliminating the entitlement risk and we are taking on the lease up risk, which we feel like is acceptable and is something we are good at, something that we can minimize, but we haven\u2019t necessarily looked at it in terms of cost per square foot.","Ryan Burke - Green Street Advisors","Okay, thank you. Separate question, Scott on the tax benefit, I just want to clarify one point that I believe in your prepared remarks and that is that if you offered tenant insurance to a third party provider instead of doing it in-house, would you have been able to put this tax structure in place?","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s a little different. We are viewing it more from a taxable REIT subsidiary in the tenant insurance company that we do own as a fee that the company has to pay in order to have access to the intellectual property, the customer base similar to what is being offered to other self storage companies where those tenant insurance companies are paying a similar fee. So I am not sure if that clarifies it or not, Ryan.","Ryan Burke - Green Street Advisors","So, I will circle back working on that. And third question and we will jump back in line. There has been some news on a fire at your Venice Beach property and I don\u2019t want to shine a light on an unfortunate event, but if you could just talk to us generally about how the tenant insurance process goes into play in a scenario like this?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, so the tenant insurance process, obviously we have to go through the process of them coming in, seeing if there is a total loss. We then work with the adjusters, they make the claim through Beecher Carlson or management and they handle the claims typically if its total loss it would just be paid out immediately. Those losses we accept some of the risk upfront, so we will have a loss associated with this fire.","Ryan Burke - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","One of the reasons why we feel like it\u2019s a good thing for our customers to have insurance either through us or through the homeowners.","Ryan Burke - Green Street Advisors","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question we have comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vikram Malkotra - Morgan Stanley","Occupancies today, how are you thinking about seasonal trends going into 4Q. And just associated with that you had a very nice pop in rent growth, can you maybe give us a sense of was there any specific area that kind of gave you that bump up in rents this quarter?","Spencer Kirk","So from a rent perspective if you look at where our growth is coming from, year-to-date you have had 1.7 come from occupancy. The rest is really coming from rates, those rates then breakdown into increases in street rates, increases to existing customers and increases due to discount savings. So 1.7% comes from occupancy growth, 4.5% comes from increases in street rates. And then the rest is coming through increases to existing customers and decreases in discounts.","Vikram Malkotra - Morgan Stanley","And then as you think about a going into 4Q just kind of interplay between occupancy and rents, can you give us the sense of how you expect the seasonal trends to move?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, we expect to keep our prices lower in the fourth quarter. So we were quite aggressive in the summer months when we peaked out in occupancy. We expect to be less aggressive in the fall and winter in order to maintain occupancy so that we can push rates again in the summer.","Vikram Malkotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks guys.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Vikram.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, thanks. Question for Spencer, I was just wondering if you could just talk about the landscape for new supply today, maybe just give us an update on what you are seeing for the year ahead from a broader industry perspective and whether your view is changed at all since the last update?","Spencer Kirk","Great question, Todd, I would say on the periphery, my view has changed from the last call. I am still of the opinion that the new supply coming into the market may be keeping pace with the population increase in the country. One of the revelations that has come I hear a lot of noise about new developments coming out of the ground, but one of the revelations for me has been we have multiple parties often times claiming they have got a parcel under a contract and it happens to be the same parcel. So trying to weed through the noise on this has been problematic. I talk to a lot of folks in the industry. Obviously, with the performance of self storage everybody wants to get in but land prices are very high, nothing has changed there. The ability to get financing has not improved appreciably. And at the end of the day Todd, if you are going to compete and pull the value out of that significant investment you are probably going to have line yourself with somebody they can drive the result with the internet. And that means you are probably going to be paying a management fee and giving up some or all of the tenant insurance. So my outlook for 2015, there will be some supply I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be massive and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect our ability to deliver a decent result in 2015 as well.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then as you think about your investments sort of going forward your deal flow for \u201815 and maybe even \u201816, we have seen more C of O deals and less operating properties, do you think that that comp positions skews even further towards development in C of O deals?","Spencer Kirk","Not necessarily, I can tell you over the last 4.5 years, we have done $2.06 billion worth of acquisitions, acquisitions tend to be lumpy and I won\u2019t drop or extrapolate the lumpiness of acquisitions and the opportunity of C of O deals into any meaningful trend just yet. I think it\u2019s premature.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And if I can just sync one more in for Scott on the tax expense savings, so you mentioned that whether it will be an ongoing expense savings here, guidance implies about $1.5 million of incremental tax expense in the fourth quarter is that sort of the right run rate to think that going forward, so about $6 million per year or will be more chunkier or volatile in nature on a quarterly basis?","Scott Stubbs","That is the guidance for this year, it could potentially get slightly better in the future, we will just update guidance with our annual guidance this year. I would tell you just to look to our guidance for that number.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay.","Scott Stubbs","It could be slightly better next year.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Todd.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Scott, just going back to the last question, just thinking about the solar tax credits you are kind of in the \u2013 several years in the program and why would that, what could potentially bring that down next year from the run rate of the fourth quarter? I mean is there a potential to get more solar tax credits or what will be the driver that actually pull down is your last comment there?","Scott Stubbs","Solar taxes are coming down, so solar taxes will actually go away by the end of 2016, the benefit from solar tax. This benefit is actually a royalty fee charged between the OPREIT and TRS, so this is something completely different than solar.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","So as you grow the third party management business you would be able charge more royalties and it would actually take your tax expense down, I am just trying to understand the dynamics of that?","Scott Stubbs","So effectively you are charging a royalty between the insurance company and the OPREIT thus reducing income in the insurance company and reducing your tax expense.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Then just my follow-up, Spencer you talked about supply and people owning multiple parcels, are there markets right now that you kind of put on hold, you are just looking at supply coming online anything that concerns you, just from a market standpoint?","Spencer Kirk","By the way my comment Mike was people claiming to have under contract the same parcel which obviously is not possible. So just small semantic detail there, with regards to markets I will tell you there seems to be a huge amount of interest on the greater Metro New York area. I could also say the same for the core markets in Texas. And it comes back to the statement that we have made many, many times. Look I have to look at the micro market, generally a 3 mile ring around the property that is being proposed to ascertain whether you have got parcel that is going to be make sense or perhaps might not make as much sense, lot of markets claim to be over built and you might find a pocket within that market that is unreserved. So that would make a great deal of sense. So this is on a case-by-case basis, but I will tell you, Texas and New York are the two that we are a bit more cautious in our analysis because of the level of interest that has been generated to put new product into those markets.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks guys. I appreciate the color.","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s fine.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions regarding your pricing strategy and some trends that you have been noticing, could you just provide the street rates that you experienced in the third quarter and maybe the promotions on the delta year-over-year?","Spencer Kirk","So, without getting into specifics for exact times, Ki Bin, I would tell you that during the summer months we saw our street rates 7% to 8% up and then also towards the end of the quarter, they were probably more like 2% to 3% up. It\u2019s obviously at a point in time, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily focus just on street rates. I think that you need to also take into account your discounts being down which they were. We saw them go down into high single-digit decreases. And then in addition to that, you also have to look at the discount being offered on the Internet and what percentages closing at that lower rate too.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And my follow-up is that I think last year heading into the winter, you guys proactively decreased street rates year-over-year and the reasoning was that, that winter customer was of higher value longer term. Just curious how that\u2019s turning out, is it turning out to be, I know it\u2019s a small dataset, but turning out true. And what is the decision to maybe decrease street rates a little bit couple of months in advance of what you did last year, because it seems like last year you did that in the winter and now you are doing a little bit in the fall, just curious what\u2019s being behind that?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s actually been a pretty similar philosophy. I think that give or take a month or so here, but I think that we have been pretty consistent in decreasing them in the fall and then keeping them flat in the winter effectively. We do see the benefit from these customers and we have seen our average length of stay increase.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Ki Bin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please proceed.","George Hoglund - Jefferies","Yes, hi, this is actually George. One question on the tenant insurance just wondering sort of on the new leases or new tenants that are coming in, what is the overall participation rate?","Spencer Kirk","George, it\u2019s Spencer. New customers coming in were over 90% and for existing customers were north of 70%.","George Hoglund - Jefferies","Okay. And do you have sort of an update on how high do you think for the overall portfolio that can get to?","Spencer Kirk","I think we are starting to top out. There might be some incremental gains, George, on this, but when you consider that you have people storing automobiles or you have the small contractor with their own property and casualty policy. This is one of those things that I think we have done a really good job and I won\u2019t bake in a lot more at this point.","George Hoglund - Jefferies","And on the occupancy front, since you guys are focusing on keeping higher occupancy in the winter, so what can we expect sort of on a year-over-year basis do you think for maybe like 1Q \u201815?","Scott Stubbs","I think year-over-year we could potentially see them go another 50 to 100 basis points higher than they did this year.","George Hoglund - Jefferies","Okay. Alright, thanks guys.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question we have comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please proceed.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","Hey, good morning. Jeremy Metz here with Ross. I just want to quickly go back on the C of O deals, I mean, you have been pretty adamant in the past that you are out of the development business, so while you are not necessarily taking on the entitlement development risk here, I am just wondering what gives you the confidence in taking on the multi-year leasing risk again?","Spencer Kirk","Okay. Jeremy, it\u2019s Spencer. There are three risks that you take when you try to pull a property out of the ground. One is entitlement risk, the second is construction risk, and the third is lease up risk. So by effectively doing the C of O deal, we have hyped off what I would consider two of the more risky elements of bringing a new property into the market. What I think Extra Space has become really good at is driving traffic to a property. I have confidence in our Internet marketing prowess. I have confidence in our operational team to capture those rentals when they walk through the door. And with that on our national platform, I think it\u2019s a reasonable risk to take and it\u2019s something quite frankly that the small guy can\u2019t compete in that arena and we have a symbiotic relationship or the small developer does what they do best and we do what we do best and we replicate it again and again.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","Okay, so no real change in thinking though towards more ground-up development done at this point?","Spencer Kirk","No, we are out of development.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","And so I guess then if you have that confidence in the leasing, why the decision to be just 10% minority partner with no real control on these?","Spencer Kirk","On an earlier call I have talked about keeping dilution of our FFO to 2% to 3% and a JV partner allows us to operate the asset to have a nice take out when they decide to liquidate their position and keep us within the bounds of what we have wanted to do and that has maximized shareholder value by driving the highest and best result on FFO growth quarter in, quarter out.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","Okay.

In addition to our press release, we\u2019ve furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer F. Kirk","Good afternoon, everyone. We don\u2019t typically go last amongst our peers, so this has been a nice change to have a chance to see everyone\u2019s results and hear what they have had to say on their calls. For Extra Space, 2012 was a superb year. We produced strong operational results due to multiple factors. They include record high occupancy levels, excellent expense control, potent internet marketing, sophisticated revenue management, a high volume of accretive acquisitions and virtually no new supply.","With the exception of the Storage USA transaction in 2005, this was our single largest acquisition year. We acquired 91 assets in 24 states and grew our wholly owned portfolio by 26%. Our unique structure continues to provide us with numerous options for growth. The result, 71% of our acquisitions came from joint venture and third-party managed relationships. The credit for the outstanding results in 2012 goes to our talented, creative and hardworking team. Time and time again I have spoken of our unique levers that have driven our double-digit FFO growth.","In the fourth quarter of 2012, FFO grew by 23%. This is particularly impressive when you consider that the fourth quarter of 2011 was up 35% over 2010, and for the full year, FFO grew 33% on top of 32% growth in 2011 over 2010.","I\u2019ll now turn the time to Karl to discuss operations.","Karl Haas","Thanks, Spence. During the fourth quarter, we once again experienced excellent same-store revenue growth of 6.5%, and that\u2019s on top of 5.8% revenue growth we realized in the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, revenue was up 6.6% compared to 4.9% in 2011. While the pools were different in these years, it shows an ongoing positive operational trend.","Rental trends were strong in the fourth quarter and our square foot occupancy continued at record high levels. Our same-store pool ended the year at 88.6%, up 1.7% over last year. Demand for the product is stable and our interactive marketing and internet strategies continue to drive higher rental volumes. Strong occupancy coupled with the lack of new supply allowed us to increase street rates 3.5% to 4% on average for the quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we also had excellent expense growth that was partially offset by higher property taxes and Superstorm Sandy. Same-store discounts ended the year at 4.3% of rental income, compared to 5.3% at the start of the year. Overall, discounts were down by 12%. This is due to higher occupancy and a focused effort to offer the right price and promotion.","All this combined to produce the fourth quarter same-store net operating income of 8.5%, compared to 9.3% growth last year. Net operating income for the full year was 10.2% versus 7.6% in 2011. All in all, it was one of the best years I have seen in my 25 years in this business.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Karl. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter FFO of $0.43 per share including a $0.02 charge related to our acquisitions and $0.01 from Superstorm Sandy. For the year, we reported FFO of $1.59 per share, exceeding the top end of our guidance by $0.01. This can be attributed primarily to better-than-expected same-store property results and the performance and timing of our 2012 acquisitions.","As Spencer mentioned, 2012 was a great year for acquisitions. We purchased 91 properties for just over $700 million. Of these 91 properties, 57 were from the two large joint venture transactions. Since the end of the year, we have purchased our partner\u2019s interest in two more properties located in Baltimore and Chicago for approximately $12.9 million.","As of today, we have two assets under contract for $20.6 million located in Maryland and Texas. One of these two assets is a brand new asset that we are buying at [Ciavo]. As of the end of the year, we had 448 wholly-owned, 281 joint venture properties and 181 third-party properties under management. We continue to growth the REIT in a disciplined manner with a long-term view.","As of December 31, the Company had four lines of credit with a total capacity of $240 million of which $85 million was drawn. Interest rates continue to be at all-time lows. Without increasing our variable rate exposure, we have lowered our average interest rate from 4.7% at the end of 2011 to 4.2% at the end of 2012.","Yesterday, we released our full year 2013 FFO guidance of between $1.87 and $1.95 per share. We expect FFO for the first quarter to be between $0.42 and $0.44. Key annual assumptions related to these estimates can be found in our press release from yesterday.","I\u2019ll now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer F. Kirk","Thanks Scott. Last year at this time, I stated that our theme for 2012 was to focus on fundamentals. Since we don\u2019t have a MasterCard, we\u2019re going to stick with the theme, for 2013 it is, do it better. Everything we do is in pursuit of maximizing revenue opportunities and appropriately minimizing expenses.","Our focus on the fundamentals has served our shareholders well in 2012 and will continue to serve them well as we move into 2013. Record high occupancy, constrained supply in our operational sophistication set us up to again produce double-digit FFO growth in 2013.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the time over to Clint to start our Q&A session.","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I\u2019d like to ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limited to two. If time allows, we\u2019ll address follow-on questions once everyone\u2019s had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we\u2019ll turn it over to Shaquana to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Todd Thomas, representing KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, good afternoon. First question, in terms of investments, you probably have cash sort of the largest investment in that or the widest I guess in terms of what you\u2019re interested in markets and properties, and some of your peers seem to be a little more selective. Can you just talk about your investment rationale a little bit, and then given that, are you seeing sort of reduced competition on acquisitions to the market sort of opening up a little bit for EXR?","Spencer F. Kirk","Todd, its Spencer. Let\u2019s take the broader question. We look at open market acquisitions and then what I\u2019ll call off-market acquisitions. In the open market acquisitions, there continues to be a lot of money chasing what seems to be relatively small number of properties given the size of the total industry. And we just want to participate, but we also want to remain disciplined and make sure that the acquisitions we do are accretive.","On the off-market acquisitions, those out at the partnerships that we have, we have been pleased with what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve sold out over 280 assets held in joint venture relationships and we hope that at some point in the future when those partners decide that it\u2019s time to monetize their assets that will be the first call and hopefully the only call when it comes time to transact.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then second question, just looking at your occupancy today, it appears that there\u2019s still some occupancy upside in the same-store as it stands, but next quarter when the same-store pool resets and the new, I guess, 2011 acquisitions are included, what will occupancy look like for the same-store pool then? I\u2019m just trying to get sense from a same-store perspective whether or not we should expect to see occupancy fall as the pool resets a little bit and what the magnitude of occupancy upside will then look like as we look into 2013?","Spencer F. Kirk","We don\u2019t have the exact numbers right now, but we plan on addressing that at the end of the first quarter. We are expecting that the occupancy will fall slightly. As the pool changes, we\u2019ll be adding a fair number of properties to that pool.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy representing UBS. Please proceed.","Christine McElroy \u2013 UBS","Hi, guys, good afternoon. You said it was about $0.01 in your release, but I was wondering if you could quantify the exact Sandy impact and can you describe the nature of the expenses? And did it all flow through OpEx or were there other income statement lines impacted?","Scott Stubbs","It flowed through two items actually. It flowed through property operating expenses to the tune of about $0.5 million and then about $900,000 flowed through the insurance company.","Christine McElroy \u2013 UBS","And then with regard to tenant reinsurance, where would you say you are today on overall portfolio penetration? What percentage of new customers opts for the insurance? And if you look at the 18% year-over-year growth in reinsurance revenues in 2012, how much would you say has been driven by continued increases in penetration in your own portfolio versus the benefit that you get if you add managed properties?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. The penetration on new tenants is above 90%. Our overall penetration is in the high 60s. And I don\u2019t really have a breakdown of what\u2019s coming between the new from the third-party management versus just the increase from existing customers. I\u2019m sure we can get that, but we don\u2019t have it handy.","Christine McElroy \u2013 UBS","If it\u2019s in the high 60s today, do you have what it was a year ago?","Scott Stubbs","It was about in the mid-60s.","Spencer F. Kirk","The one thing that is clear though Christy is that growth does slow the higher it gets. So a larger amount of our growth does come as we add managed properties.","Christine McElroy \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti representing Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Spencer F. Kirk","Hi, Dave.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Quick question Spencer for you, now that we\u2019ve seen the forecasts from your peer group relative to expectations for next year, your top line forecast seem a little bit conservative given what\u2019s been pretty clear pricing power over the last couple of quarters. Then you touched on this before, but can you give us some background on maybe why you\u2019re being a little bit hesitant going forward despite the evidence of pricing power over the last couple of quarters? What makes you sort of hold back in expectations for rent growth prospects?","Spencer F. Kirk","The answer, David is our methodology for providing guidance and visibility has not changed. We are at the very beginning of a year. There is a lot of uncertainty out there and we\u2019ve looked down the road and said what can we reasonably expect to happen.","And as we\u2019ve rolled up our property level budgets baked everything together, we have come to the conclusion that where we are is our best guess as to where we think we might end up with a full year behind us with the benefit of hindsight. There is a lot of churn out there. Occupancy, yeah, there might be a little more gain. We need to see where street rates come in this year. But I think that the guidance we\u2019ve given is what we accurately believe we can produce.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","And then, can you just maybe give us a little bit more detail in terms of the mix in that top line? And I apologize I jumped on a little bit late. But is it possible to disaggregate the sort of new versus renewal growth that\u2019s embedded in that top line?","Karl Haas","As far as the exact percentages, David or what specifically\u2026?","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Yeah, I mean no, just a very rough number, but what are you assuming relative to the kind of growth you\u2019re going to see on renewal rates going forward?","Karl Haas","Part of that growth obviously is coming from the occupancy delta. We expect to get a bit of an occupancy delta this year. The next largest contributor is discounts. Discounts will continue to be below where they were last year as our occupancy remains highs. And then to a lesser degree, it\u2019s going to be street rates, and probably last in that list is existing customer rate increases.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Okay. And then just one follow-up question, what are some plans relative to technology improvements that you might have going forward relative to your revenue management systems? I know you guys are pretty far out relative to the specification of this system, but what are some improvements you might be looking at putting in place or expecting to begin to perform?","Spencer F. Kirk","David, its Spencer. Actually, I won\u2019t look for any quantum leap. We are on our third-generation of revenue management. Today, we track 56 different inputs and variables and metrics to help us define our pricing and I think it\u2019s going to be more of refinement out on the margin rather than any wholesale new initiative or way of looking at things. That\u2019s really a continuation of what we\u2019ve already been doing. And that is taking what we are learning from our data and applying it with finer granularity.","Karl Haas","This is Karl. We will also be focusing more on discounts, trying to get smarter and how we offer the discount, when we offer the discount, and that will also have an impact.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe, representing Citi. Please proceed.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Hey guys, thinking back to NAREIT, there was a decent amount of talk about PSA jumping their street rates by like 9% overnight. I\u2019m just curious whether you\u2019ve seen any sort of incremental improvement in pricing powers since that happened or things just have remained pretty consistently strong?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. We are pushing rates, but it\u2019s in the 4% to 5% range. And I think what you\u2019re going to find too is, as when we get these questions about where your street rates are versus existing customer rates, our rates are \u2013 our overall GPI and the percent change every month and even during the month is going all over the place.","I mean we\u2019re adjusting constantly, so you almost have to look at it over a longer period of time and it\u2019s in the range of 4% to 5%. We\u2019d like to think that \u2013 and I think this is probably the biggest upside potential that\u2019s out there, is as we all continue to get better occupancy that we might have the opportunity to push those rates even more, especially if no new competition comes along.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Gotcha, that\u2019s helpful. And then second question, I guess bit of a change of topic, but as your stock continues to work and your cost of capital comes down as a result, what type of unlevered return do you think makes sense on acquisitions for your shareholders? I\u2019m just wondering whether that metric change as your stock does better and your cost of capital moves lower?","Scott Stubbs","We consider that. Obviously, we consider our short-term cost of capital, but we also can ignore the long-term cost of capital. So, there are times when we might be slightly more aggressive as our short-term cost of capital goes down, but I think that your unlevered IRRs are still somewhere 8 to 10.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Gotcha. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott representing Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Hi, guys. Spencer, when you say that acquisition should be accretive, do you mean accretive only to earnings or would you consider acquiring an attractively priced lease-up situation that that may not immediately be accretive to earnings?","Spencer F. Kirk","Yes, we would consider looking at those lease-up situations and take a short hit on dilution. What we don\u2019t want to do is get whipped into frenzy with the rest of the market and pay rates that may not look so great five years from now.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","What were your thoughts on the Acadia sale? Were you an active bidder on that transaction?","Spencer F. Kirk","We were not.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, thanks.","Spencer F. Kirk","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of (inaudible) representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Looking at your same-store results by region, there are some differences obviously. So, first in terms of occupancy, would you say that your goal occupancy varies by region? For example, Chicago was able to increase about 7% to 90%, but Houston is still below 80% or is there difference \u2013 is there a reason for the differences by region?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Could you tell us what they might be?","Karl Haas","At some markets it\u2019s a lot easier to get in. They\u2019re a lot stronger and we\u2019re able to push to our goal overall occupancy quicker than in other markets. I mean, there\u2019s a certain drag that trying to cover or to overcome an occupancy gap in a shorter period of time, the cost can be significant. And so we do it more gradually and our system is looking to get you there, but they are going to get you there \u2013 it\u2019s going to get you there in a way that maximizes the opportunity along the way.","So if you\u2019re at 80%, yeah, you could get the 90% pretty quickly if you wanted to, and we could, but we\u2019d rather do it over a longer period of time and give away less and end up getting more of the whole way through it and we will get to our goal occupancy.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then also in terms of the variations between the different regions, it just comes out, I don\u2019t if it\u2019s a coincidence or not, but Chicago, it looked like had the largest reduction in expenses about 20% lower, but then Houston\u2019s are about 20% higher with everybody else kind of in between there. Can you maybe tell us why some are doing so much better on expenses than others?","Karl Haas","It\u2019s a very micro property-by-property. It has nothing to do with occupancy. It has a lot more to do with just variations and it can be just kind of a quirk of the particular properties in that market. But there\u2019s no plan, and really is no correlation between rent per square foot. It can be property taxes as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky, representing RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon guys. Can you talk a little bit about January and February trends?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. It\u2019s really pretty much the same as it has been. Expenses are up a little bit because we had a little snowstorm in the Northeast that hit us pretty good, and so we\u2019re going to have a little bit of variation as a result of the snow. But otherwise revenues that they\u2019re really holding, occupancy is holding, we\u2019re really pretty pleased with where we are, and it\u2019s pretty much according to our plan.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Second of all, you gave a little bit of color on street rates; I think you said 3.5% to 4% up in the fourth quarter. Just as we kind of look at the delta between move-in and move-out rates as you guys have been pushing aggressively on renewals, the street rates have improved, but not quite kept pace. So how is the delta right now between move-in and move-out rents versus kind of a year ago?","Karl Haas","It is about the same.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Is about the same?","Karl Haas","Yes.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then finally\u2026","Karl Haas","But once again, it is difficult to take a point in time, because our street rates are up and down so much. But when we look at it over a longer period of time, the gap is about the same now as it was a year ago.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And what is your expectation for street rate growth then in 2013? I mean, I realize it\u2019s on a \u2013 it is kind of on a bell curve, but just curious as to what you\u2019re kind of thinking\u2026","Karl Haas","Now, 4% to 5% that we\u2019ve been talking about.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","4% to 5%, okay.","Karl Haas","Yes.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And then finally, just in terms of acquisitions, the amount of deal that you\u2019re seeing right now, how does that compare versus this time a year ago, and are you seeing greater \u2013 I mean, with that interest tick-up if pricing were to compress?","Spencer F. Kirk","Michael, its Spencer. I would say year-over-year interest is about the same. It\u2019s the beginning of a New Year. We don\u2019t have the surge that usually happens in the fourth quarter when people are trying to transact. So year-over-year, it\u2019s about the same and quite frankly, if there is some more cap rate compression, there may be some more sellers. But right now, the question, I think a lot of sellers have is, if I sell my self-storage property and pay taxes, where am I going to reinvest my money and have as good of return as I\u2019m getting out this existing asset.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya representing Jefferies. Please proceed.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi, yes, good afternoon. Just in regards to the 2013 guidance. I mean, I think you guys have done a great job of telegraphing the potential slowdown on the top line, but in regards to the operating expense and the forecast, could you talk about some of the big ticket items that are kind of driving that large increase?","Scott Stubbs","Your largest increases are going to come from really three items. It\u2019s going to be payroll, property taxes, and credit cards. Credit cards, we had a positive delta last year that has gone away. Property taxes, we haven\u2019t seen major increases for several years and we\u2019re forecasting, depending on the area, 3% to 4% on those.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","On the credit card side, is it just swipe fees are going up or interchange fees are going up or what is it?","Scott Stubbs","They\u2019re not going up, but what happened last year is there were some new rules enacted that enabled us to process debit cards more like an ACH, so you weren\u2019t charged credit card interchange on those.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay.","Scott Stubbs","So it saved us a significant amount as well as everyone in the business.","Karl Haas","This is Karl. Last year it offset our increases. We don\u2019t expect an enormous increase this year, but we\u2019re not going to get the significant decrease that we got last year.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Got it. And then just a quick second question. I mean are there any markets at this point where you\u2019re actually seeing a slowdown in demand simply because the consumer is actually paying higher taxes and has a smaller paycheck to take home now?","Karl Haas","This is Karl again. No, we have not seen that. I mean, I know that a lot of retailers are and a lot of ad hoc information out there, but we have not have seen that yet.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick, representing Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys I\u2019m just filling in for Paula today. A couple of quick questions; first, I just want to talk about the private operator lending environment. What trends are you guys seeing and how have those trends changed at all in the past few months or so?","Spencer F. Kirk","I think for stabilized assets, just about anyone can get a loan. Obviously, I think from what we\u2019re seeing is, it seems like those with money and with scale, it\u2019s easier to get debt for those individuals than for a smaller individual. Not a lot of asset \u2013 I mean, not a lot of appetite for non-revenue producing or lease-up assets.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. And then I guess secondly, are you guys seeing any trends in your tenant mix, maybe more home driven renters or business driven renters?","Karl Haas","This is Karl again. No.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.","Spencer F.

Please proceed.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Hey, Spencer, I think you got a version of this question earlier. But with regard to continued attempts to better maximize price and price the product as well as you can, where do you think you\u2019re at now if you think about it on a scale 1 to 10 with 10 being sort of a perfect ability to maximize price to every single customer? Where you\u2019re at now and where do you think you can get to in the next couple of years?","Karl Haas","I\u2019ll give you a good solid three. I think there is a lot of upside, a lot of learning and a lot more that can be done, and I think the application of Big Data and mining our data semantically to better refine our models will yet yield better results, but we are far from the end game on this. We\u2019re far from perfection.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","So is that good news just for Extra Space or do you think that\u2019s sort of a signal that the entire industry going to have maybe above inflation type rent growth over some extended period of time?","Karl Haas","I would maybe characterize it more towards those larger operators that have the resources to go after a disproportionate share of what\u2019s to be had. I think that what we\u2019re doing? For instance, we have six revenue management people in our department. The small operator I highly doubt is ever going to be anywhere close to that. And for us, I think this is as the other publicly traded companies have stated many, many times, benefit that the publicly traded companies possess.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Yeah, thanks. And then a couple other ones for me. Is the $150 million of acquisition guidance for the year just a pure guess on the conservative side or is there some signs behind that?","Scott Stubbs","How about a guess?","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay.","Scott Stubbs","And I\u2019m not trying to be spread out, but we just don\u2019t know what the philosophy of transactions will be this year at the price point at which we\u2019re willing to transact.

Kirk","Yes.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And then last one. Scott, can you remind us of the solar tax credits and what the magnitude of that in the guidance is?","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s $5 million to $6 million this year as far as benefiting the current year.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","And what\u2019s the duration of that program and can it be replaced at some point?","Scott Stubbs","Right now I believe it goes through 2016.

(Operator Instructions), as a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Clint Halverson, Vice President, Investor Relations.

With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Clint. Hello everyone. Q2 was another excellent quarter for extra space, fundamentals remained strong and while there has been an increased interest in new construction we have yet to see any significant new supply in the markets in which we are located. Our technology platform, Advanced Revenue Management System, internet prowess and unique operating structure have again produced outstanding FFO growth, FFO was up 32% over the same quarter last year and we were able to increase our dividend by 60%, our disciplined and creative approach to sourcing and executing on acquisitions that enhance shareholder value has been validated. During the quarter we placed two portfolios located in core markets under contract for over $300 million, these transactions are a great representation of the value in building and cultivating mutually beneficially relationships. Now I'd like to turn the time over to Karl.","Karl Haas","Thanks Spence. During the first quarter we had same store revenue growth of 7.8%, that was on top of 6.7% we realized in the second quarter last year, rentals and vacates are within historical norms, our square foot occupancy remained with record high levels ending the quarter at 90.8%, that's up a 1.8% over last year. ","Street rates were up 3-4% for the quarter, discounts for new customers during the quarter were down 12% and the percentage of new customers receiving a discount was down over 10%, year over year. We saw expenses shift towards the norm, increases were due to growth on payroll, insurance and repairs and maintenance expense. Net operating income for the quarter was 10.4%; this is notable when you consider that net operating income was up 10.2% in the second quarter last year. Higher rates, lower discounts, stable rental demand and high occupancies continue to support record high performance. With that I'd like to turn it over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Karl. Last night we reported FFO of $0.50 per share, this is $0.01 above the high end of our guidance, this can be attributed to better than expected same store property and tenant insurance results. During the quarter we purchased four assets for approximately 48 million located in Hawaii, Maryland and Texas. Subsequent to the end of the quarter we closed on two additional properties for approximately $9 million, located in Arizona. Year to date we have closed on just over $70 million in acquisitions. As of today we have an additional 37 assets under contract for just over 300 million. 20 of these assets located throughout Northern and Southern California are from the previously announced OP unit transaction for 206 million, the remaining 17 assets are located in seven states. We anticipate that these acquisitions will close by early in the fourth quarter. ","During the quarter we continue to evolve our balance sheet and execute it at $250 million exchangeable bond offering. This unsecured financing fits well with our commitment to increase our financial flexibility. Based on our acquisition activity our new data estimates and our operational performance we have updated our full year 2013 FFO guidance to be between a $1.96 and $2.01 per share. We expect FFO for the third quarter to be between $0.49 and $0.51. These estimates include non-cash interest expense and acquisition related costs. When you adjust for these items FFO is estimated to be between $2.01 and $2.06 for the full year and between $0.51 and $0.53 for the third quarter. With that, I'll now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Scott. Our results show that we have the platform, the properties and the people to propel our performance. Same store results were strong but more importantly we had another outstanding quarter in FFO growth because of the multiple components or levers that we used to drive profitability. The operating environment remains positive and we remain focused in our efforts to optimize occupancy, maximize revenue and minimize expenses, we believe we will continue to produce double digit FFO growth for the foreseeable future. Let's turn the time over to Clint to start our Q&A session.","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone's questions, as in the past I'd remind everyone to keep your initial questions brief and if possible limited to two, if time allows we'll address follow on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions. With that, we'll turn it over to Derek to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) and our first question is coming from the line of Todd Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Market.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Market","I'm on with Jordan Sandler as well. First question, just in terms of acquisitions it looks like acquisition activity overall appears to be ramping up a bit and I was wondering longer time, I know the business is scalable so adding property to the platform makes sense, but I would just be curious to hear your thoughts about the company's appetite to invest today.","Spencer Kirk","Todd and Jordan, this is Spencer. We are seeing a large volume of acquisitions coming to the market, mainly in smaller one off transactions, it's interesting to note that seller expectations are incredibly, might even be characterized in some cases as ridiculous, so for Extra Space we want to participate where it makes sense, we want to remain disciplined and make sure that what we do adds value for our shareholders.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Market","Okay, so it's been a few quarters since anything's really surfaced from within the joint venture portfolio, are you having any discussions with your partners there, any indication that there could be some opportunity there in the near term?","Spencer Kirk","What I can say about the JV relationships, you know we've got 279 properties in JV relationships, we do have discussions, we give annual reports to our partners, if not quarterly reports in some cases and of course we're wanting to engage in the dialogue. But we don't want to be too eager, because that's going to drive up the price and be counterproductive. And so as I have said in the past, what we want to do is be a great partner and when our partner decides that it's time to monetize their assets, already will enable to transact and hopefully will be able to do something that is win-win situation for both parties.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Market","If I could just sneak just one in for Scott. I was just curious about the thought process behind the exchangeable notes offering, maybe relative to a more traditional five year off bank financing. And I was just wondering in terms of the pricing also, I think you got priced a little bit outside of the range that you are initially targeting 1.2% to 2%.or so. So just curious if you received any feedback maybe wondering why price where it did relative to your initial expectations?","","Spencer Kirk","I think the initial expectations we went in with were probably more relevant to the market as it had been, maybe two weeks or month prior to that, the market was pretty choppy, the week before, and then month after. So we have been probably a little bit more optimistic than maybe we should have been. We feel like we priced a deal that was very beneficial to company, its two and three deal with a 30% opt as far as the exchange feature.","And we feel like it's going to be a good option for shareholders, I mean the largest benefits for us is unsecured, so it frees up a large group of properties and enables our balance sheet which has become that much stronger because you have fewer properties tied to loan.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Toti, Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","","Spencer question for you, you talked about sort of positive fundamentals. If we think about the rapidly growing supply demand and balance assuming that the macro backdrops did more or less the same. What does '14 look like to you relative to industry fundamentals pricing power and could the supply outlook change relatively quickly next year given these kind of conditions? ","Spencer Kirk","","Lots of question in there David, look 2014 I remain optimistic for a few reasons. First is like the other operator, large operators for publicly traded companies, it appears that we're all kind of in record territory and occupancy that bodes well for perhaps pushing street rates and minimizing discounts. ","The new supply question is one that there is a lot of talk, there is a lot of chatter, there is perhaps even some activity, but to get a self-storage properties located in a great location is not a six month deal. It's a multi-year deal to get the entitlements and permits and everything to allow you to build where you are in a retail corridor rather than at the end of some cold (inaudible) in some industrial part. ","So with a one year construction timeframe on top of that and a lease up period of two to four years I still maintain to the best of my ability prognosticate that in 2014 there will not be meaningful competition from the news supply chain. ","It just takes too long to bring properties to market and have a broad impact. Last and final point if you look at the natural population increase plus immigration the country is growing at about 1% a year about 3 million people. You would need to have on order of 500 to 550 new self-storage properties per year coming into the market to just keep pace with what the population is doing. And so to our way of thinking 2014 we\u2019ve got strong Internet presence, limited new supply, record occupancies and I see no reason why 2014 won\u2019t be a good year for all of the larger operators.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","And then my second question just has to do more with technology and retail. If we think about your sort of technology advantage the success you\u2019ve had with the reinsurance product. What could Extra\u2019s Phase II by way of additional retail delivery, given a relatively massive and captive business to consumer channel? Have you guys explored potentially expanding the sort of secondary kind of high margin retail product delivered?","Spencer Kirk","We have, David, we\u2019ve done that for 15 years. I\u2019m sure other operators have done it for more than 30 years. And what we\u2019ve learned if I could be really direct customers want five things from the self-storage providers. They don\u2019t want prepaid phone cards, they don\u2019t want cell phones, they don\u2019t want car washes and convenient stores build into the side of a self-storage facility, they want something that is conveniently located to their home. It\u2019s clean. It\u2019s secure. You\u2019ve got someone confident curdiest behind the counter and it\u2019s a competitive price. You can\u2019t be out of balance. You deliver on those five elements and customers are happy. Focus group after focus group has just deliver on these five things and will store with you. You start missing or getting distracted, we\u2019re going to look somewhere else.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christy McElroy, UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Good morning, guys. You\u2019ve been talking for some time about a second half slowdown in revenue growth, and your guidance certainly implies that. Do you still expect your toughest comp to be occupancy? And just from a strategic standpoint, does public storages report last night of 95% occupancy level, give you some encouragement of potentially achieving those levels as well or do you think that you\u2019ll ever try to manage your portfolio to that higher than occupancy level?","Karl Haas","Christy never is a long time. So, I never thought that we\u2019d see any operator operating at 95%. Public does a lot of things very well and it seems to be working for them. I don\u2019t anticipate us going to 95% but I would say that as they get to those levels and continue to do well that it makes us think that we might be able to push what we see or what we have previously thought of as our highest level that we might have some more upside. But, our revenue management system really we put a lot of stuff, lot of different metrics in there, it\u2019s based on whole lot of different metrics, the competitor\u2019s prices, our occupancy, occupancy by type and everything else. And it spits out what our pricing should be, and kind of balances out the occupancy with the rate and the discount get to what we think is the right answer.","So we very well could go higher but right now it\u2019s not\u2026 we\u2019re not anticipating getting to 95% anytime soon.","Christy McElroy - UBS","And, Karl, just looking at the acceleration in your realized rent growth from last quarter. Can you talk about the biggest impact to that number going from 3.3% in Q1 to 4.9% in Q2 and maybe quantify the drivers? I don\u2019t know if I missed those, I think I heard you say the discounts were down 12%. But if you could also say what street rents were year-over-year and where you are pushing in place customers?","Karl Haas","The components, what we call the waterfall is 2% from occupancy growth, 3% from street rate, 1% from the delta in the ECRI or existing customer rates and 1% from the reduction in discounting.","Christy McElroy - UBS","And what were your street rents year over year?","Karl Haas","They were up about 3% to 4%. But keep in mind that\u2019s the actual street rates. That gets supplement with the reduced discounting that really helps to drive the overall growth.","Christy McElroy - UBS","And did you mention I know you have disclosed this in past quarters the impact on same store revenue growth of the newly added properties for this year?","Spencer Kirk","It's about 80 basis points.","Karl Haas","It has been running like 0.8% to 1%","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Karl, just to follow up on that, I am curious if I heard you right the revenue growth impact from street rate increases was 3 to 1 compared to the existing customer increases, is that an atypical relationship? Is that new?","Karl Hass","No. This is pretty consistent with what we have been have seen.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay because I was under the impression that street rents were not really strong enough to drive revenue growth so as customers moved out and new customers moved in, I thought most of the rent growth was coming from existing customers.","Karl Hass","Well, you got to keep in mind that what we are talking about is delta year-over-year and our ECRI we have been aggressive on ECRI all the way for the last six or seven may along that eight years, so while it is a big driver of our revenue growth and it does increase what existing customers are paying the delta in what we are doing as far as increases has not gone up that dramatically, does that clarify?","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Yes that helps thanks. And then Spencer, I am just curious if you can talk about Ken Woolley stepping down as CIO and what impact do you think that may or may not on your company\u2019s ability to continue to grow externally and just what sort of the long term plan for that role in terms of CIO, thanks.","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s really simple Michael. Ken is a very talented man; he has been Storage for 36 years. With Ken's intellect he will obviously also has a broad and diverse set of business interest and the change, the transition I believe is going to allow Ken to focus on some of those outside interest while still actively engaged in the growth and strategy of Extra Space. ","If you think about where Ken can add value, he has got a lot of vision and he is very creative and I think those idea will help propel innovation here at Extra Space but realistically the greatest contribution Ken can offer this company is being in a role where he taps into those long term relationships and utilizes the personal feeling and the personal connection that he can make to drive transactions in the off-market so that Extra Space is able to have meaningful growth without having to overpay for assets and I think if you look at what\u2019s going on right now in one of the two portfolios that we announced, Ken had a very-very strong and pronounced role in bringing that to a successful conclusion and that\u2019s the role that envision Ken as an Executive Chairman someone help in with strategy and help into leverage relationships so that we can continue to grow in a meaningful and accretive way.","Karl Haas","I would like to add to that where Ken brings value on my side of the business is that he is very and he is a guy that stays at 30,000 fee and helps and we don\u2019t need much of it, eight hours a month of him talking to our revenue managers and challenging what they\u2019re doing and he can talk at their level and also bring that practical experience to it and even with me with operations and we don\u2019t a lot of Ken\u2019s time but he is just incredibly valuable and with being able to come in understand things quickly and help kind of tweak the direction and we\u2019ll continue to get that for as long as we wanted and needed.","Spencer Kirk","Yes, I think Michael the answer is he left for Russia 4.5 years ago; he has been back just a little over a year and I think having settled back into his particular stage in life and what the stage that extra spaces in today we have found the right balance for the future it\u2019s working very-very well.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin Ken, SunTrust.","Kevin Ken - SunTrust","Did you guys quote a cap rate on some of the pending deals that you have to close?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s kind of in the six to seven range.","Kevin Ken - SunTrust","Okay is that range going in or stabilized?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s forward looking.","Kevin Ken - SunTrust","And could you comment on maybe the couple of other portfolios out there in the market, I know you guys said some forward expectation are seeming crazy, and could you maybe comment on maybe the more in for portfolio what you think that (inaudible) that portfolio is compared to your company's and where you think pricing we comment on that for that property?","Spencer Kirk","First of all I didn\u2019t use the word crazy, Kevin, I used ridiculous. Separately into state fleet with regards to the Morningstar, the only observations I would make threefold, number one we bid, number two we weren\u2019t invited back for round two, and number three we didn\u2019t think it was the best operational overlay for our existing footprint. We think there might be better portfolios in terms of where we\u2019re conducting business and for us I would simply say I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to come in ultimately on pricing but we\u2019re out and we\u2019re comfortable with it.","Kevin Ken - SunTrust","Would you be willing to state maybe where you guys bid that it didn\u2019t get where you didn\u2019t\u2019 get invited back for round two?","Spencer Kirk","I am not going to tell you specifically but I will tell you we\u2019re in the lower quartile.","Kevin Ken - SunTrust","And just last question one you expenses, it seems like property tax are going up for a lot, these offer other real estate factors, your expense haven\u2019t really moved up that much is this something that we can - I guess what should we expect going forward longer term?","Spencer Kirk","We would tell it\u2019s probably similar to inflation 3% to 4% that\u2019s what we continue to budget, we have been able to manage that and we hope that continue to come in 1% to 2% where it\u2019s coming in but our expectation is more in the 3% to 4%.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky, RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","","Spencer you talked 2014 being problem from supply standpoint but as you look out to 2015 given starts does that appear a challenge?","Spencer Kirk","","I don\u2019t know yet Michael my crystal ball doesn\u2019t go out that far we will have to wait and see what is going on there could be significant new supply and per chance maybe the economy starts to heal and get some momentum so how it plays out I would probably be a fool to speculate on 2015. All I can say is for the foreseeable future we are optimistic that the fundamentals are strong demand is strong the larger operators are taking market share from the smaller operators and we are in a good position.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Second Karl can you talk about the acceleration in street rate growth throughout the quarter and also kind of where you are tracking in July?","Karl Haas","","I wish I could tell you that I had some control over it or that it stays consistent but we are up and down every day based on what the model tells us and so there was really no specific trend up. I will say that and I guess we anticipate the question I might as well answer it now, July was a very good month. We held firm and we are pleased with where July came in.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Spencer, bigger picture question and using your term ridiculous, how would you define ridiculous maybe in terms of where assets are trading versus replacement cost? How big does that delta have to get before you would look at development as another one of the growth engines just given where market pricing is today?","Spencer Kirk","Ridiculous to me is relative and I am only speaking from the Extra Space perspective. We have a certain business model Michael and we want a certain spread on transaction so that we are doing accretive deals and I am not talking accretive in years four and five. Everybody\u2019s business model is different and so when I use ridiculous it\u2019s only from the very narrow perspective of Extra Space. ","Obviously in A markets, with A quality assets you can just fight very low cap rates but s you start to get into secondary and tertiary markets with properties that are maybe 10-15 years of age. We have a tough time wrapping our arms around the arithmetic that makes sense for Extra Space. So for us I would say looking down the road for development well just one other comment on purchasing we don\u2019t look at replacement cost as the primary thing we look at the cash flow and we are primarily a cap rate buyer. So as you think about development and where the spread becomes large enough I have made the statement a number of times Extra Space is out of the development business. I don\u2019t see us getting back into the development business. ","It doesn\u2019t make sense for this organization now the caveat there might be an occasional property or a joint venture partner that brings considerable other resources to the table where we might enter into a JV program we have nothing to announce today I don\u2019t know of anything that\u2019s contemplated but we can\u2019t preclude that with some other structure we might be willing to enter the game. We shut down a development department and this company has no plans to open one up and re-staff. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paula Poskon, Robert W. Baird. ","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Spencer, what are you seeing from the third party inbound calls? Are you continuing to see that at an accelerating pace and are you accepting more of those, turning away more of those? Just what\u2019s happening in that business? ","Spencer Kirk","","There has been an acceleration. I think there is a gradual awaken Paula, between the haves and the haves not and the thing internet is the great divider not the great equalizer. I think our friend Dave Rogers said that, folks aren\u2019t scared yet but I think there is a growing awareness that there are capabilities with scale and size that the smaller folks cannot replicate. So, we are getting inbound calls but I will tell you, way more than 50% of the calls coming in are getting rejected because either the market is not right, the asset is too small or the asset quality is not appropriate for this company. And so we are selective, we are growing nicely but quite frankly, I don't think we\u2019re growing as quickly as I would like us to but we\u2019re going to lower our standards to meet our actions. ","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","And are you seeing any changes in terms of your commercial customers, is that on the uptake as the economy continues to improve?","Spencer Kirk ","","No. What\u2019s really interesting Paula is I\u2019ve been doing this for over 15 years and the ratio between commercial and residential with very, very, very minor fluctuations has remained the same. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Todd Stender, Wells Fargo. ","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","","How many all of board acquisition, can you share with us some other details of that portfolio was just in terms of the rent per square foot, have that kind of compare to your current portfolio who knows California markets and maybe what you\u2019re strategy is to get the occupancy up which is think is in the mid 70% range? ","Spencer Kirk"," ","Without getting into too many details on the rent per square foot we would tell you that 12 of the assets are in Southern California, 8 are in the Northern, very good over lay with our existing assets and we would tell we\u2019re going to manage them very similar to the way we manage our existing ones using the same internet and pricing strategy that we do at our existing. ","Karl Haas","I think we also see some opportunities with our strategy of having multi-tiered pricing, more clear cut multi-tiered pricing and combined with the discounting that we see an opportunity. The pricing wasn\u2019t that bad but we think there is some tweaks and some of the things we\u2019ve been doing for a while that makes us feel like many other properties are very close to our properties and our properties are substantially more occupied and there, so we think that we have just through kind of tweaking what they were doing, we should be able to see some really good growth in occupancy. ","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Just at the margin if could stick with you, just with the expansion opportunities, are they in general smaller facilities or anything that you like about the size or of the possibilities to expand them. ","Karl Haas ","","Well, they are not overly large. They\u2019re decent size. Most of them are single story in markets that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be doing it in the short run but I think in the long run these properties our markets where where you could go up and so we also see in the long run some potential, they are in such great markets that we probably will have the ability sometime in the next three to five to 10 years to take some parts of these properties out and go up.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","And that starts to bring in the conversation of climate control and adding to that?","Spencer Kirk","","Well in California climate control is not such a big thing, so it's not going to be so much climate control. If we build up, we probably would do climate control. But you don't get a big premium especially southern California and Northern California for climate control.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line is Kate of Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","On the topic of large acquisitions being in the market, can you comment on the mix of properties you are seeing, whether there are many portfolios versus one-off properties?","Spencer Kirk","Once again we see a large volume of acquisitions continuing to come to the market, but primarily it's the smaller one-off transactions. The fact that there have been so few larger transactions and the only one that I am aware of is it's kind of hanging out there currently is Morningstar, speaks of the fact that larger portfolios are hard to build. And with the performance of self-storage, lot of people are happy holding of what they have got, and so I think it's going to be the smaller one-off transactions primarily in the future.","Unidentified Analyst","If you do see portfolio acquisitions, do you look at them differently and have different requirements and hurdle rates when they are that much larger?","Spencer Kirk","A little bit. We think that there is some benefit to picking up 20 or 30 assets out of whack or 40 assets, especially when the operational footprint is a nice overlay. So there is a premium we'll put on a portfolio, but we as a company want to be careful in not placing too much of a premium on, that the ease and simplicity of getting a bunch of assets in one transaction. This company has an acquisitions team that is geared up and ready to go and do a number of smaller transaction and hitting those singles has worked well plus the occasional double or triple or even homer. But I think it just boils down to we're ready to conduct business on whatever scale.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of RJ Milligan, Raymond James & Associates.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","","I was just curious if you could tell us what the occupancy was at the end of July?","Spencer Kirk","Yes we can, it was around 91.5%.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of (inaudible) Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","","Its Michael Bilerman. Spencer as you think about your comment about size and scale on the public landlords, where do you think of the last 12 to 24 months the operational differential has been between sort of public and the entirety of the sector? Put aside acquisitions, but how much market share do you think is been taken at the occupancy level, at the rate level, public versus private.","Spencer Kirk","You know Michael I don't have the exact numbers on top of my head. I can just say I look at the data supplied by REITS and SSDS and others say, larger more sophisticated operators. By the way some of those are private. There are some larger regional guys that are doing very well. As you look at our occupancies versus their occupancies our NOI versus their NOI, it\u2019s pronounced. And I can only anecdotally tell you two stories that I have first-hand knowledge because I ask the question. But I become really concerned not for me but for them when I am talking to an existing operator and they tell me that their NOI is 10% or more below where it was in 2008. And the storm has long since passed and the larger operators are pinning up record results and record occupancy. And I think the advantage is not going to abate any time soon.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","And so, going back to your ridiculous comment how much do you think sellers are trying to get credit for that differential of being able to sell portfolio of their assets into one of the public landlords that have that size and scale that can drive so much better efficiencies and occupancy? How much is that the tension that\u2019s happening where sellers are effectively trying to be greedy?","Spencer F. Kirk","I won\u2019t say they\u2019re trying to be greedy, I\u2019ll say they are trying to optimize what they have. when they see a notable transaction in the New York Metro area in the five cap rate and perhaps they live in Wichita, Kansas and they think well, I won\u2019t get a five but I can get a 5.5 or 6 because not New York based. I think they\u2019re just trying to optimize what they hold and maximize their value and I don\u2019t fault them in anyway shape or form. The question is what is reasonable and rationale and what is defensible and every company that\u2019s out there buying properties has to answer that for themselves.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","And then just lastly just on the 350 million that closed and under contract in terms of the acquisitions. You had mentioned 6 to 7 cap rate. Can you just share with us sort of what is the going in cap rate on those assets and when do you reach a 6, when do you reach a 7 it was just a pretty wide range? And I just want to understand the dynamics of these assets coming online day one versus of a forward yield?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you it\u2019s typically within a year to year and half that we\u2019re at those cap rates. So we\u2019re bringing up the occupancy and stabilizing the rents, to rents similar to what we have. None of these portfolios have, they are not 50% occupied or anything of the sort. We\u2019re basically optimizing what is out there today.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","Right, so where does it start and what\u2019s the going in, in the third quarter and the fourth quarter we\u2019re going to bring in $350 million of assets. Should we bring those in 4 cap, should we bring those at a 5 cap? How should we think about going in the yield versus getting to a 6 to a 7?","Spencer Kirk","Going in yield might be slightly below 6 and so it\u2019s not a significant discount. And then we underwrite fairly conservative going to potentially 6.5 or 7.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","Over 12 months\u2026","Spencer Kirk","12 to 18 months, correct\u2026","Operator","The next question is a follow up from the line of Todd Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","It\u2019s Jordan Sadler. Just on acquisitions, you mentioned that the only portfolio where was the Morningstar wanted, does that mean you did not look at the $375 million associated with PSAs expected to close on this quarter?","Spencer Kirk","Jordan, its Spencer, I don\u2019t know what portfolio that is that has been referenced. So\u2026","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","21 in Florida, 5 in Mass, 2 in California, 1 in Rhode Island and it could be one-offs in those, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a portfolio at all, I just doesn\u2019t sound like Morningstar\u2026","Spencer Kirk","It probably isn\u2019t Morningstar, it could be another portfolio. And we\u2019re aware of some that have been talked about being carved up. So when you ask me to comment on that, I can tell you we\u2019ve looked at some other stuff but not necessarily in totality.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then I think ultimately the word that will define this call will end up being with hindsight it will be ridiculous of course I think in all the years you haven\u2019t been want to be prone for hyperbole so I am interested in sort of following up on your comment there a little bit which is any thoughts on selling assets at ridiculous levels?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, I actually had discussion with someone last week, we were trying to buy their assets and they said that they would be a buyer at a four cap so if anybody want to offer Extra Space a four cap, yes we would be interesting in selling but right now, Jordan we are building a company, we are building value for the long term and dismantling this company is not something that I am interested in.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Not dismantling but are there properties around the edges worth pruning?","Spencer Kirk","Absolutely, few here and few there but it\u2019s going to be may be a dozen or two dozen and that to me 5% of the portfolio and what we have to look at is what the loan structure, what the ownership structure and it becomes a little complicated and at the end of the day those properties that are fully unencumbered or perhaps we have 100% control on, I can count on one hand or we say we have the ability to maneuver.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christy McElroy, UBS.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Two follow ups, the first is when Ken Wooley joined the board of American Home 4 Rent which is an entity controlled by public storages chairman, was that something he discussed Spencer with you or the board and how do you guys feel about that?","Spencer Kirk","He discussed it and I was fully aware of it, the board was aware of it and we were fine with it, once again Ken like many other chairmen sits on other boards and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s problematic in a public company setting.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","But nobody find it peculiar that it\u2019s a board controlled by the chairman of our largest competitor?","Spencer Kirk","Its peculiar but it's not unpalatable or unreasonable given how small the audience is, the fact is Ken used to work for Wayne and they have had a wonderful friendship for 30 years. they are both brilliant minds and I think Wayne was looking for a way to bring some intellectual horsepower to his new company. I think Wayne was smart and it has been a good thing for Ken.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Second question, fundamentally Michael Knott asked a question earlier in the call and he was I guess expressing some surprise that rent growth from existing customers wasn\u2019t as big a driver as I guess rent growth from street rents and I guess I shared that surprise because I thought you guys were raising rents in existing customers, I call it 8% plus, so I guess may be the question here is what percentage of your existing customers are actually getting that staying around long enough to get that increase and I guess I am not understanding why that\u2019s not a bigger driver?","Spencer Kirk","Okay, so I am going to put this back over to Karl but the issue is, let\u2019s verify what you have said yes we are getting more than 8% and that\u2019s about 45,000 to 50,000 customers month to get the rent increase but we have been in that range for a long-long time Ross, of the 7% to 8%. So you are not going to get tons of a juice out of that in a more stable environment.","Karl Haas","Well, this is Karl, the thing is if we stop giving increasing to our existing customer we would have a very significant drop in our growth but as long as what we\u2019re doing is just consistent year after year after year and people leave, people comment, but we\u2019re giving basically about the same number of increases and the same percentage, it\u2019s not going to be a big year-over-year increase in the delta and then that\u2019s what I was saying, what we\u2019re talking about was the water Waterfall.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Second derivative is flat it\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re saying, maybe we almost understood that original comment, okay that makes sense, just finally where your average in place rents relative to your street or maybe on a net basis native concessions, is there rent hold down any kind?","Spencer Kirk","And we\u2019ve been saying, that\u2019s the last year, it\u2019s basically flat, they\u2019re top on each other.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","All the way back into your supplemental on page 25 you show some details on your joint ventures and you a have column that shows whether you\u2019re in the promote or not, there is a couple that are, I\u2019m just curious if there is some hidden value and some promotes that just haven\u2019t been realized that no one's giving you credit for. just curious why maybe we haven\u2019t seen more of these be in the money on the promos just given how strong the operating environment has been, does it require a recapitalization of some sort?","Scott Stubbs","The majority of those they\u2019re not in the promote actually were from the storage USA acquisition, you think about what happen from the time the storage USA acquisition happened till today, you actually had a downturn where those property effectively went backwards and so some SMS were put in place and the agreement was put in place with these assumption that it was going go up from that point obviously and with the downturn, its possible we eventually get into the promote but we\u2019re not near right now and that\u2019s we\u2019re about half of that joint ventures on that page.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay and then if I\u2019ve done the maths right I think you have about 375 million of acquisitions that have either closed this year or under contracts, you\u2019re bumping your guidance really isn\u2019t that much more the one you\u2019re already got accomplished, I\u2019m just curious if that math is right then does that mean that you\u2019re being just very conservative on what you expect to happen the rest of the year or do you not think that there will be more opportunities?","Scott Stubbs","First of all I\u2019ll math is correct and we\u2019re looking at this terms of here we\u2019re the first of August and based on but we have under contract but we\u2019re looking at, it generally takes 60 to 90 days to close on something, so realistically based on what we have that we\u2019re looking what we\u2019ve discussed in our real estate committee we feel like 24 million is a number we can do, we hope to exceed that.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay and then second with acquisitions just curious if there is any evaluation or grading of pipeline of acquisition opportunities through the third-party management is coming along and is that paying off or is more just other benefit of that program that you\u2019re telling right now?","Spencer Kirk","We continue to talk to the owners and this year we\u2019ve bought two joint ventures partners one additional property out of that portfolio, we had one follow out contract due to some other reasons but we continue to farm that pipeline and hope to continue to close on acquisitions through that.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","And then just one more from me if I could and that would be on your tenant insurance just curious what is driving that growth of 16% in the same-store pool on the revenue side just because I would have thought your participation rate was already fairly high. And I don\u2019t sense that there is a lot of pricing power in that business but it\u2019s been just, so just curious here where that growth is coming from?","Karl Haas","This is Karl what really presents a good opportunity is as we bring in new properties where there is almost no penetration and then we are going from zero to 10 to 20% to the 60 some to almost 70% that we get into a maturity and you\u2019ve indicated earlier the reason we are one of the primary drivers for the third-party management is that when you factor in tenant insurance, it is a good business for us, if you didn\u2019t have tenant insurance, it wouldn\u2019t be worth doing it because while we are getting, it is a good pipeline and JV is probably even better in the long run, we are not stealing properties we are buying them, there aren\u2019t too many people that have these properties that are going to sell it to you without talking to other people or checking the market. So while it does gives us the ability to be kind of first in line but we are not the only one in line when it comes to buying these properties and so the only reason we are doing it a big part of it is the fact that we are adding to our platform, having more ability to spread our overhead and tenant insurance and we have had very, very good growth this year. I think in the first quarter we added 57 properties to our third-party management and most of those come to us with very low insurance penetration.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Yes I get that the income statement shows big growth in that business because you are adding new properties but just on the same-store basis I would have suspected that all those properties already had the programs in place?","Scott Stubbs","In our same-store pool if you remember we changed the same-store pool this year to include 15 properties in Cincinnati that had very low if any, tenant insurance penetration as well as 1 properties in Southern California as well the final development asset. so we added a fair number of properties that had lower tenant insurance penetration so that obviously has helped increase the tenant insurance.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Congrats on a solid quarter I wanted to back to the whole idea of acquisitions Spence I know you said that apart from Morningstar you weren\u2019t aware of any other big portfolio out there but I am just kind of curious and if you do take a look at your crystal ball and you kind of project out six to 12 months do you kind of expect for us to kind of see more portfolio deals with Morningstar just kind of being the first of many?","Spencer Kirk","I think that is a reasonable assumption obviously with cap rates drifting down as they have been seller interest is peaking and I think that is a very rational conclusion to can\u2019t you tie out there is going to be more and the question is how does the bidding take place and how does it fit into each company\u2019s respective financial modeling.","","Operator","Your next question is from the line of (inaudible) SunTrust.","","Unidentified Analyst","Have a couple of quick follow ups if I understand the 100 basis points increase in your chance NOI stems from rate increases of existing customers, that number if I understand it correctly, is 1% is that because as customers you get rent increases, let's say a couple of them and they eventually when they do leave, the replacement customer is coming in at a street rate which is much lower. so that spread dynamic unless street rates are rising dramatically or the level of rate increase you are giving out are higher, that number is difficult for that number to move up over time, is that correct? ","Karl Haas","Probably. You said, there is lot of pieces, and I know you, you are a deeper thinking and probably you\u2019re kind of going beyond what I am capable of explaining. The bottom line is it\u2019s just hard for it, unless we change, and unless we go from 8% on average increase to 9% or 10% and or we have a tremendous increase in the number of people we\u2019re going to give increases to, that delta is not going to increase that much. It\u2019s going to be relatively flat. So, yes, there is only two levers, it\u2019s the number of people you give the increases to and the percentage increase and the number of people we\u2019re giving it to is relatively consistent and the percentage increase is staying relatively consistent. Unfortunately, we were aggressive, very, very aggressive to start with on it and have been for a couple of years. So, it\u2019s not like, we were doing 5% and now we\u2019re going to 6% or 7% or 8%. We\u2019ve been at 8%, the range of 7% to 9% for a while. So, hopefully that answers this, because it is what it is. ","Unidentified Analyst","Right. But I guess you kind of answered my second part of the question was, do you expect as things get tighter to change the level or frequency of the rate increases. ","Karl Haas","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to change the frequency. But if we were at public storage level of 95%, we might be looking at raising more because you could afford. Yes, there is, we say that overall it doesn\u2019t impact vacates. But at some point it does have some impact and so unless you want to take the risk and increase vacates even more, you don\u2019t want to go past the certain the point. So, if unless we change unless we get toward totally different occupancy level, I don\u2019t see us being able to change the percentage increase. ","Unidentified Analyst","And then just quickly, you say 45,000 customers a month get it, what is that translate into percent of portfolio or percent of total customers? ","Karl Haas","About 7%. ","Unidentified Analyst ","7% a month. ","Karl Haas ","Somewhere there. ","Unidentified Analyst ","And your same store revenue on your management assets has gone up pretty significantly better than your core portfolios run rate. It's somewhat of a double edged sword, if you want to buy those assets, you make it more expensive on yourself, but maybe, have you guys thought about increasing the charge, the amount you charge to your partners or maybe adding a promote to those deals?","Spencer Kirk","We\u2019ve looked at it, the thing about it it\u2019s a commodity out there, management services to some degree and you can\u2019t be too far out of what considered market. So, what we feel like we are going to do better job managing these properties, we also need to be somewhat in the market. ","Operator"," ","At this time there are no further questions in queue.

My name is Denise and I\u2019ll be the operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Clint Halverson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Denise. Welcome everyone to Extra Space Storage\u2019s second quarter 2014 conference call. In addition to our press release, we\u2019ve furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.","Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, Thursday, July 31, 2014.","The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Good afternoon, everyone. We started the year with record high occupancies. And the question was asked, how hard can Extra Space push street rates? Well, street rates were up nearly 5% on average for the quarter. On top of this strong rate increases, discounts decreased by an average of 18% and aided by limited new supply occupancies still climb to 160 basis points to 92.4%.","These factors contributed to NOI growth of 9.9% for the quarter and FFO year-over-year growth of 26%. In addition, we raised the dividends 17.5%. It was another solid result for Extra Space. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Spencer. Last night, we reported FFO of $0.63 per share for the second quarter. Adjusting for non-cash interest and acquisition related cost, FFO was $0.64 per share. We outperformed our guidance due to better than expected property performance and tenant insurance results.","At the start of this year, we added 99 properties to our same store pool bringing the total to 443 properties. Ninety of these properties were acquisitions and nine came from our legacy development pipeline. This change in our same store pool added 75 basis points to our revenue growth for the quarter.","The acquisition environment has becoming increasingly more competitive. We\u2019re committed to remaining disciplined in our approach to build a long-term value for our shareholders and during the quarter, we acquired eight properties for $91.2 million.","We currently have five properties under contract for $41.4 million which should close by the end of the third quarter. As of today, we have closed or have under contract $382.3 million. Included in our year-to-date totals are two ground up development properties that we acquired upon completion in Q1. In addition, we have three more development properties under contract that we will acquire upon their completion in 2015 and 2016.","We revised our full year 2014 FFO guidance to be from $2.42 to $2.50 per share. These estimates include non-cash interest and acquisition related cost. When adjusting for these items, FFO is estimated to be from $2.46 to $2.54 for the full year.","I\u2019ll now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Scott. August 12th will mark 10 years for Extra Space as public company. That has been an excellent run. We went public with 136 locations and today we have nearly 1,100. I want to take a moment to thank our investors, our management team and most importantly our employees. It\u2019s a great time to be in storage. With the distinct on the Internet when it comes to customer acquisition and with muted supply, we see continued opportunity for double-digit FFO growth.","Our job as the management team is to increase FFO and enhance shareholder value. This quarter\u2019s 26% FFO growth marks 15 consecutive quarters of double-digit gains. Now, let\u2019s turn the call over to Clint to start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Spencer. As in the past, in order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I\u2019d ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limit it to two. If time allows, we\u2019ll address follow on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we will turn it over to Denise to start our Q&A session.","Operator","(Operator instruction) Our first question comes from the Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, good afternoon everyone. Spencer, I just want to follow up on your comment on street rents. Can you discuss some of the customer behavior that you\u2019re seeing when you change the rate and what your pushing rents sort of at the street level? And are you pushing those rents with the idea that you\u2019d sort of still like to push occupancy further to your holding back a little bit? Or are you kind of happy with this level of occupancy such that you\u2019re pushing rents as much as you can just to maintain occupancy?","Spencer Kirk","Christy, great question. Philosophically, what we\u2019re trying to do is maximize revenue. We obviously like where the occupancy is. I don\u2019t know how much higher you could go in a peak season.","We feel this quarter we have pushed rates as much as reasonable and rational. We are coming into the shoulder season. And we need to recognize that holding on to our occupancy gains is going to be a primary focal point for us.","To maybe to put a little color into it, I can tell you with at the end of June, the rates were up just about 7%. So as we started at the beginning of the year, we were holding the rates down to build occupancy. As we came into a busy season, we pushed rates hard and we also got 160 basis points of occupancy gain and this will come full cycle as we come into the latter half of this year where we\u2019re going to maybe moderate some of the push for rate to maintain the occupancy.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup","You are 5% on average for the quarter and 7% at the end of June?","Spencer Kirk","Correct.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, got you. And then Spencer, I wonder if you could provide your thoughts on the potential threat of the aggregators especially given \u2013 as a company, you\u2019ve been somewhat vocal on the topic. Do you see Google entering the game anytime soon? And what could be the potential implication to a pricing power?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s an excellent question. First of all, if you look at the aggregators in the space they play a roll. For Extra Space, I can tell you that our cost per acquisition, the CPA using an aggregator is considerably higher than our own internal cost per acquisition. So we do not use other aggregators to drive our business.","Google has entered other business sectors. They very well could enter the storage sector. Obviously, that would change many of the rules. But if Google becomes the source, what we would do is tell Google, the profile of the customer we want them to go after. Hence, my statement many, many times the single most valuable asset this company owns is now its data.","And with that data I think working with a company like Google, we would still probably be in a preferential position because we would have the knowledge to direct Google specifically to the higher value customers that would fit best with what we\u2019re doing.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Christy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Just a question on acquisitions. I know $500 million of deal is still a big number for the year, but I think it\u2019s been a little while since we\u2019ve gone two quarters now without there being some upper pressure on deal volumes and around your guidance.","So I\u2019m just curious whether something has changed with regard to your underwriting criteria, the quality or pricing of the deals in the market maybe sell our expectation. So it just appears that the investment environment has slowed somewhat.","Scott Stubbs","Todd, this is Scott. We have seen the environment and get very competitive. I mean it\u2019s not just before REITs, you\u2019re seeing a lot of other money chasing the deals that are out there. So pricing has gotten very competitive as we\u2019ve gone through. And then our guidance, we\u2019re still comfortable with the $500 million.","One thing that did change is it\u2019s pushed more toward the end of the year. And the cap rates have moderated somewhat. We would tell you the cap rates have come down, some even since we gave our initial guidance to begin the year.","Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","How much of car rates come down versus your initial guidance?","Scott Stubbs","Probably 25 basis points.","Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then looking ahead for EXR, do you see acquisition activity continuing to move away from stabilized property to more of the use of C of O type deals. I mean is that something that we should expect to continue to see grow in size within the pipeline as you\u2019re sort of thinking about it?","Scott Stubbs","We continue to look at these deals. I mean we bought one last year. We bought two in the first quarter of this year. We have a few more under contract that are slated more for 2015 and 2016.","We\u2019ll continue to look at those. We\u2019re trying to balance the growth in those properties with also the dilution that comes with those. I mean one of the things we would consider if it gets too big to look to a JV partner, something of the sort.","Spencer Kirk","Yes, Todd, this is Spencer. The only additional color I might give you is I think you\u2019ll still see Extra Space participating in the open market acquisition environment as well as what I call the off market where we\u2019ve got the JV and the managed assets that have provided meaningful growth for our company over the last several years.","You\u2019re going to also see more opportunities for these C of O deals pop up. To expect that there will be no new supply forever in this space is not reasonable. And I think what we\u2019re seeing is that there is some supply coming. It\u2019s muted, greatly muted at this point. But I think that most of those that would be developed \u2013 would be developers are acknowledging that the landscape for leasing up and operating that property that they helped to build has changed and they need to align themselves with a larger, more sophisticated organization.","And so I think you\u2019ll see continued acquisition opportunities augmented with some of these C of O deals coming to provide another growth channel. So I\u2019m actually quite optimistic that this gives us some new brand spank in new properties into our system that will complement the existing assets that are fully stabilized that we hope to use to grow the platform.","Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Okay, great. And that\u2019s C of O, yes, the plan is that Extra Space takes over 100% of the ownership?","Scott Stubbs","That is the plan right now. The ones we\u2019ve done to date have been 100% \u2013 again, we would potentially look to a JV as the volume increases. Where we buy the developer out with a JV partner, not necessarily JV-ing with the developer.","Todd Thomas \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Todd.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Could you give us a breakout of the price increase that you saw, the 5% price increase between street rate and existing customers?","Scott Stubbs","I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following the question. You\u2019re talking the 5% \u2013 so when we say 5%, our street rates were up on average 5%.","Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean \u2013 I meant the overall price increase. Could you just break that down into the different components?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. Our revenue growth has grown from several different components. One is the occupancy. Year-to-date, it\u2019s roughly 2% of our growth has come from that occupancy increase. About 4% has come from pricing. About 0.5% to 1% has come from discounts and then another 0.5% has come from existing customer rate increases.","Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just on the web based \u2013 for the Internet based pricing, was there anything that changed this quarter in terms of the overall strategy, meaning \u2013 I know you\u2019ve talked in the past about targeting customers even more. But was there anything changed on the web in terms of just pricing more granularly which may have [ph] pricing a bit but also could that help in sustaining a relatively higher level of pricing in the off season?","Scott Stubbs","We have not had any significant changes in this quarter to our web strategy.","Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. So similar to the kind of breakdown you gave just a second ago on same-store revenue growth, could you do a similar exercise for maybe what you expect in the second half of the year? And part of that reason why I ask this question is because mathematically, it seems like your same-store NOI guidance is on the surface coming down for the second half and possibly why your stock is right the way [ph] it is today?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, absolutely. So the two components that would change from what I gave just a minute ago, we view pricing as staying pretty similar. Our rate increases to our existing customers is very similar. The occupancy delta will go down. Right now, it has been \u2013 for the first half of the year closer to 2%. Right now it\u2019s closer to 1.5% and we see that dropping.","And second of all, our discount, while it\u2019s been closer to 1%, we see that going closer to 0.5% as far as the total add.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And so I guess at the end of the year your occupancy benefit should be maybe closer to 1%?","Scott Stubbs","Correct. So we see it for the \u2013 correct. You\u2019re absolutely right. It started at just over 2%, dropping to 1% at the end of the year.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay.","Scott Stubbs","Oh, 1.5% average for the year.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. All right, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Hey, guys.","Spencer Kirk","Hey, David.","Scott Stubbs","Hi, David.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","I want to go back to the development topic a little bit because of this has been an interesting evolution for the company. Hard core developer to no development to acquiring C of O sort of off balance sheet mitigating risk, how are you underwriting these yields [ph] today that would be differently than saying how you were underwriting in 2006? And I guess secondly, can we expect an evolution further closer to your historical franchise?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. I would tell you not to look for us to get into full scale development. I don\u2019t see that changing. I think we\u2019ve said it throughout the whole downturn and into today. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent in saying we don\u2019t want to do development.","The beauty of this is it enables us to add new properties to our pipeline. Many of our properties \u2013 as time goes by, properties age. So this enables us to bring new product in. As far as underwriting them, we feel like any time you do a development property, you have entitlement, construction risk and lease-up risk. By doing it the way we\u2019re doing it, you eliminate two of those three risks. The only risk we really have is lease-up risk.","So as we underwrite them, I would say your typical yield is going to be 1.5 \u2013 150 to 250 basis points. Your cap rate is going to be 150, 200 basis points higher.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","So I guess more specifically, what kind of stabilized yields are you looking for and what type of lease-up timeline are you looking at in those specific deals today?","Scott Stubbs","So lease-up yield, when we\u2019ve \u2013","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Just to get [indiscernible].","Scott Stubbs","Yes. When we\u2019ve underwritten these, we\u2019ve tried to go with our historical average lease-up. So they\u2019re usually three to five years, kind of depending on where they are, the density and the size of the property.","So we\u2019re not necessarily projecting today\u2019s lease-up because if you\u2019ll open something today, I think it\u2019s going to lease up very quickly. But many of these aren\u2019t going to be open for a year or two, so we\u2019ve tried to be pretty middle of the road on our estimates for lease-up.","Then as far as stabilized yield, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we are eventually going to get to the cap rates where they are today. So if something\u2019s trading at a 6.5 cap today, we\u2019re saying it\u2019s a 6.5 cap deal at 150 to 250 basis points to that.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I have a kind of a weird question which I never thought I\u2019d ask on a call. Are there any assets or markets where you\u2019re seeing such high occupancy levels that you\u2019re actually pushing rates so aggressively as to induce move-out and more turn?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s a great question. I would say on the margin, David, if I could use an example, I think Seattle might be a reasonable place to say we\u2019ve had some really strong success up there.","We don\u2019t like to push out customers. What we don\u2019t want to do is push so hard that the customer that has been with you for several years who has had multiple existing customer rate increases walks out the door. So it\u2019s not so much trading vacancy at the frontend. It\u2019s with your existing customers where you\u2019d be pushing the rate to create the vacancy.","I don\u2019t know if that helps.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Yes. I guess maybe said another way, is there \u2013 do you see a point where there\u2019s going to be served markets where the street rate is going to be so much higher than a lot of your in place that you won\u2019t be afraid to potentially dislodge that longer term customer?","Spencer Kirk","I can\u2019t foresee that. Anything\u2019s possible. But I think we\u2019re on a revenue management system working pretty well in a coordinated fashion to make sure that the street rate and the existing customer rates are where they need to be to optimize revenue not only at a snapshot in time but over a protracted period.","Scott Stubbs","And today, we really haven\u2019t seen a site where street rates grew so fast that they outpaced existing customer rate increases.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, great. Thanks for the detail.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital. Please proceed.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital","That\u2019s an interest one. Hey, guys.","Spencer Kirk","Hi, Michael.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital","First question. You gave some color on acquisitions. You said cap rates are down about 25 basis points on a year-to-date. Are you seeing the underlying IRRs change? Meaning, is gross keeping pace to support that cap rate compression or are people just being more aggressive in terms of bidding?","Scott Stubbs","We are seeing people being more aggressive in bidding. And again, it goes to their assumptions on their growth rates. And we don\u2019t know what those are. We haven\u2019t necessarily changed ours.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital","Okay. Second of all, as you think about C of O buyouts, they\u2019re obviously being 15, 16, we have a couple coming on [ph], what level of dilution are you comfortable taking on in a short-term for that long-term? I mean how are you thinking about managing that process?","Scott Stubbs","I think overall, Michael, if you looked at it in terms of we\u2019re willing to take 2% or 3% dilution to potentially have bigger growth in the future and to refresh the portfolio.","Spencer Kirk","Yes. So when Scott talks about dilution, you look at the total FFO that we might produce in a year and we say, what percent would we tolerate. And it\u2019s kind of in that 2% to 3%.","What we don\u2019t want to do is go back to the days which is why we are not going back into full-blown development. I\u2019ll take any ambiguity out of that. Because as a public company, we never got credit for the developmental pipeline and the drag of the development had on our earnings. And we think we can bring a lot of new product to market using a different methodology.","And that\u2019s with the C of O deal where we\u2019ve pushed off a lot of the risk \u2013 two of the three risk elements that Scott addressed. And even perhaps with the joint venture partner have much of this, for all intents and purposes, be off balance sheet. So for us, we think this is a way to refresh our portfolio, participate in some of the new product that will come to market.","What we offer is a win-win. The developer with local expertise can do things that we never were able to do. They have contacts and relationships in their local markets that we cannot replicate. On the other hand, we have a platform that once that property is built, that developer can never replicate. It\u2019s beyond their ability.","And it creates a symbiotic relationship where we both win. And we march forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.","Scott Stubbs","Yes. We would say it\u2019s going to be tough to really get a huge volume of these, Mike. Just in terms of pricing and in terms of actual new product coming online, I mean its\u2019 a competitive market out there. So to even get 2% or 3% I think is going to be difficult.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital","One of the [ph] two questions there and go back in the queue. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Okay. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi. Thanks, guys, and thanks for the color on how you underwrite the C of O deals. I think it\u2019s very helpful. Just to stay on that theme, just one question. Can you tell us what markets the C of O deals you have teed up for \u201815 and \u201816? Just thinking, do they need to be located within your existing footprint just to kind of mitigate some of the risk as you build out some level of scale?","Scott Stubbs","The three we\u2019re talking about, two are in Boston, one is Phoenix. The two that we bought to date, one is in Texas and the other one is in Connecticut.","Spencer Kirk","Existing footprint, Todd, is very important to us as we look at these opportunities. We don\u2019t want to go to indoor market where we have no operational scale and where we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to support it.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","And are you experiencing an inbound flow of questions or you guys are seeking these out from developers you have relationships with?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s almost 100% inbound.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Todd.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","(Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Yes, good afternoon. I just had a quick question in regards to mark-to-market on the portfolio. Again, this idea of how much you\u2019re getting when you get a new tenant moving in versus how much you\u2019re losing when an existing tenant moves out, what that spread differential looks like and whether that\u2019s still a big drag on the portfolio when it happens.","Scott Stubbs","So in the past, we\u2019ve always answered this with our street rates are on top of our existing customers which is still the case. But street rate isn\u2019t necessarily what you get. You\u2019re usually giving some type of discount or you\u2019re coming in at an Internet rate or something of the sort. So our typical rollback is call it 6%. It\u2019s mid single digits.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay, as a rollback, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then from the press release where you kind of talked about markets performing below the company\u2019s average, you do highlight Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. Just kind of curious that market in particular because I mean a lot of office properties having issues there and as well as also a lot of multi-family, whether this just a general economy in Washington DC, Baltimore that\u2019s creating the underperformance, and if you guys are seeing something very specific to sell storage?","Spencer Kirk","Okay, Tayo, this is a really important thematic piece. Storage is a great business, and we can take one of our worst performing markets today, DC and the NOI is still a very respectable 5.0% for that order. So if you were talking any other asset class, you\u2019d say, great job guys. And that\u2019s one of the worst we have.","So the themes of merit supply and dominance on the Internet still play out. And we\u2019re very comfortable that this is going to be a solid year in 2014 for Extra Space and for the other larger more sophisticated operators. Nothing has change. And I think there has been some concern about a pullback and of course there\u2019s going to be some seasonality to our business. But in terms of the fundamentals of the business, it\u2019s strong, it\u2019s healthy and DC is just a nice point of illustration to say a poor performing asset is still 5% NOI.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Tayo.","Operator","Our next question come from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Good afternoon. Returning to the topic of development, when we think about Extra Space and your Web platform, your data, your operating platform, we\u2019re interested in hearing how you think these advantages of yours could help you better select sites and hasten the lease up process?","Scott Stubbs","We obviously hope to outperform our lease up estimates. And I think that what you\u2019re seeing today is very good in terms of lease up. But as far as projecting that and actually underwriting that, it\u2019s not necessarily what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019d rather be surprised on the upside.","We think we do have the ability to drive rentals. And it is particularly strong in markets where we already exist. So for instance the properties in Boston should do very well because we have a very strong Web presence there.","So as we focus or look at any development, certificate of occupancy type deal, it\u2019s going to be important for us to have a presence there. And for this property, we have a very good location.","Spencer Kirk","So one other comment on that Dave, I talked about data being a valuable asset for this company. So when a CFO deal gets flopped into the middle of one of our core markets, we obviously have a lot of data as to what to expect on rate and transactional velocity. And we can and will use that to optimize the performance of that lease up asset, so that we end up with a better result than had we not applied the data to the assumptions and to the operations. So I think it goes hand in hand.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors","And along those line Spencer, do you think that your \u2013 the lease up [ph] pace that you experience will exceed that of your prior ventures into development?","Spencer Kirk","It depends completely on the product as Scott said, the size, the market, the square foot per capita and a host of issues that would cost let me say, Dave [ph], I\u2019m not even going to speculate. I\u2019m going to tell you that we\u2019re going to underwrite it to the best of our ability to prognosticate and we\u2019ll see what the result is.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. But all of those things equal is your process better? Is your data better? I\u2019m looking to understand if this will provide you an advantage as compared to others looking at similar deals.","Spencer Kirk","We think it\u2019s better. I think the major difference for us is there\u2019s less new supply today than when we were developing. I mean, there\u2019s a significant difference in the amount of properties coming online today. Obviously we\u2019re more sophisticated than we were then. So I think on the margins, we should do better.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Dave.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","At this time, we have a follow up question from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","Thanks. Just a couple quick follow ups, in your guidance, have you guys fully baked in the fact that when you have higher street rates [ph] the negative market to market or negative roll [ph] I should say from a tenant that has been getting many increase letters, then when they move out and lurk as mark too [ph], that benefits as well. And that\u2019s the benefit of street ways improving [ph], that comes better.","And also you\u2019re listening [ph] customer rate increases makes some more meaningful impact as your street rates [ph] go up. Have you guys \u2013 is your guidance fully baking into those couple other positive elements of higher rates?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. I think that we have baked all of that in. Obviously street rates go up, it enables us to raise existing customers more. And we have included that as we given our guidance. The one point of note here in our guidance, clearly our properties have done better than we originally estimated. But our acquisitions have done probably \u2013 they been slower later in the year than we estimate it. So part of that benefit of the properties doing better has been offset by slower acquisitions or acquisitions that took place later in the year.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","Okay. And last question for me. What is the \u2013 if I look at \u2013 if I think about full source [ph], the one part that hasn\u2019t gotten a lot of attention is maybe the downtime it takes when you have a customer and the days that takes for you to leave that back up [ph], even if there is demand, there\u2019s always seems \u2013 there\u2019s always going to be a structural delay. What does that look like for I guess maybe your 10 by 10 category which is the hottest segment, how many days as it stay in the inventory before you can leave without, even if there is demand? And have you look at ways to cutting that down further?","Spencer Kirk","It all depends on the size of the facility, the square footage per capita, the number of competitors with comparable product to offer. There are a whole host of issues Ki Bin. And we have not measured it. All I can tell you is usually the unit is swap out, the light bulb is changed and it\u2019s put back into the system ready to rent.","And so, it\u2019s just a function of what\u2019s the seasonality? What was the customer is searching for on an Internet search? What solution did we serve up? What price point and promotion? So this is one where we think that being ready to rent the unit as quickly as possible has been an operational focus. We don\u2019t want it offline, but when you figure that 6% or 7% of the total inventory of a storage facility turns over every month.","So if you have 600 units in a facility of say, 70 square feet, and 6% or 7% of that turns over in a month, that\u2019s somewhere between 36 and 42 rentals, divided into 42 \u2013 into 20 or 21 business days. So you might end up with 1.75 or 2.0 rentals per day. And then with 5 by 5, 5 by 10, 10 by 10, 10 by 15, 10 by 20, 10 by 30, indoor outdoor, upstairs, down source climate control, non-climate control, that\u2019s a really tough question to answer Ki Bin. [Indiscernible] one.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","[Indiscernible].","Scott Stubbs","How\u2019s that?","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","All right, okay, that\u2019s all for me.","Spencer Kirk","Transcribing.","Operator","Our next follow up question come from Michael with RBC Capital. Please proceed.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks guys. Just chiming back on, lot talk about [ph] street rates, any change you\u2019re now seeing in duration or is there any change to lease structure maybe where you\u2019re trying to link in these duration a bit?","Scott Stubbs","So we\u2019re not changing our lease at all, but there is an \u2013 the average length to stay is slightly longer than it was five years ago, but no significant change.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then the second question, I know you touched about no supply on a broad based across the US. But are you seeing any markets where you\u2019re seeing supply ramp up in particular?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. New York City.","Scott Stubbs","New York City, Texas is another one we\u2019re seeing a lot of \u2013 Chicago.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Any thoughts to potentially recycling maybe a bit ahead of that?","Scott Stubbs","We\u2019re always kind of looking at our portfolio. And we\u2019re not necessarily looking to sell a significant number, but we would selectively look at selling a few properties. So it\u2019s always on the table.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next follow up come from Todd with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Yes. Hi, thanks. You talked about new supply being muted in part because developers realize they cannot lease up the facility once they\u2019re developed. You also talked about cap rate compression you\u2019re seeing in the competitive environment on the acquisition side for operating property.","So on the acquisition side how deep is the buyer pool of investors that have the necessary sophisticated systems and the operating expertise? And then appropriate cost of capital, I mean, who are the buyers that are entering the mix here.","Spencer Kirk","[Indiscernible] Todd, it\u2019s Spencer, buyers are coming from every walk of life. And one of the things that has amazed me recently is buyers with a less sophisticated platform thinking they can extricate the same performance. And just because somebody has money, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re going to achieve the same result out of a less sophisticated platform. It\u2019s possible, but there\u2019s a big question mark in my mind.","So I would tell you, there are a lot of buyers, trade buyers, non-trade buyers and everything in between. And for us, we just need to make sure that when we buy an asset at Extra Space, it\u2019s accretive, it fits our footprint and operationally, it puts us in the best possible position for keeping our product relevant in a market. Hence, some of our efforts to refresh and renew our assets whether they be 10, 20 or 30 years of age, we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got something that as new developments come on or as others come into the space, what we have is compelling for the customer to look at extra space as the first solution.","Scott Stubbs","And Todd, the other thing I would add is you\u2019re seeing obviously the REITS [ph] looking to buy things. You\u2019re looking at funds, looking to buy things. Some of those funds are having their assets managed by us or by other REITS [ph]. You\u2019re also seeing private REIT [ph] money chasing us. So it\u2019s pretty diverse crowd.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Well, that\u2019s a good transition. I guess my next question was I saw the third party management, you\u2019re up about a dozen contract. I mean, are you seeing \u2013 are you getting more inbound calls from these investors? Do you think that we\u2019ll see growth accelerate in that line of business for you?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. There are a lot of inbound calls. What\u2019s interesting is we\u2019ve looked at this Todd, it seems to go in wave splash. We had 91 that we added into the system. We\u2019re not running quite at that pace. But all it takes is just one institutional buyer, somebody out there saying, look, I\u2019m a financial buyer, I don\u2019t want to operate these. And you could be back at last year\u2019s pace.","So for us there\u2019s still a lot of interest in the third party management. It continues to be a major strategic trust for us, because strategically, we ultimately want to end up owning high percentage of those that we manage, not necessarily everyone but a high percentage. And we\u2019re going to continue to promote and sell the benefits of being part of a larger platform.","It will appeal to some folks, it won\u2019t appeal to others. But now, it\u2019s still very healthy and growing. And the pipeline \u2013 folks that we have been talking to is quite robust right now.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","We have no further questions. I would now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.

My name is Brie, and I will be your operator for today. At this all, participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ","I would like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Clint Halverson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Brie. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's second quarter 2012 conference call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review.","Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, Tuesday July 31, 2012. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Clint. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are Karl Haas, our"," Chief Operating Officer, and Scott Stubbs, our Chief Financial Officer.","It was another very good quarter for Extra Space. We achieved year-over-year FFO growth of 41%. Our properties and our systems are performing very well. During the quarter, we increased same-store revenues 6.7%, and reduced expenses which resulted in double-digit NOI growth of 10.2%. I give credit where credit is due. To our people.","I think our 2,400 employees, who have worked hard and dedicated themselves to executing on the fundamentals of our business. Our internal and external growth efforts have been highly effective in acquiring quality well-located assets.","We have acquired 51 properties so far in 2012, 36 of which are from Prudential, and we have an additional nine properties under contract. We are disciplined in our acquisition approach and purchased assets when it makes financial sense for our shareholders.","As the country's largest third-party management company with 519 assets under management, we continue to assert and demonstrate that this is a viable off market acquisition pipeline. Of the 51 assets acquired this year, 76% came from these existing relationships.","Our company is driven by an entrepreneurial culture of innovation and growth and we push for continuous improvement in all areas of our business. This development and implementation of system-wide innovations will continue to improve our performance.","I would now like to turn the call over to Karl to talk about our operational success in more detail.","Karl Haas","Thanks, Spence. As Spencer noted, we saw excellent revenue growth of 6.7% in the second quarter. There are a few primary factors that drove this top line growth.","First, the latest version of our revenue management software is working well. We are gaining a better understanding of the price elasticity of demand for storage at a property level. We are often asked about our rental volume for a given period. Although the rental volume is significant, it is more important to maximize the long-term revenue growth of those rentals with the correct mix of incoming price, discount and rate increases over time.","Second, we continue to gain market share from our smaller competitors by leveraging our size, resources and sophisticated systems, we are driving traffic to our websites and properties. We are capturing more than our fair share of the rentals while lowering our overall cost per acquisition. Lastly, we are not seeing any new supply.","As we mentioned in the last quarter, our same-store pool of 282 properties includes 19 sites that over three years old and are in the final stages of lease up. As a result, during the second quarter, we received almost a 0.8% of top line benefit from these assets. By stripping these 19 properties out of the same-store pool, our top line revenue growth would have been 5.9% versus the 6.7%.","Same-store year-over-year expenses were down slightly, primarily due to lower utility cost as a result of our investment in sustainability initiatives. We are also seeing lower credit card processing fees, thanks to new regulations. While we continue to implement processes and invest in systems that create efficiencies, we don't expect our expense growth rate to continue at the levels it's been at Q1 and Q2.","Expense will return to more normal levels as we move through the year. With occupancy at historically high levels, discounts and promotions are down 11% for the quarter. When combined, all these factors bode well for the remainder of the year.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Karl. Yesterday, we reported second quarter FFO of $0.38 per share including $0.01 of lease-up dilution. We exceeded the top end of our guidance by $0.03. $0.02 of this was due to better than expected property and tenant insurance results. The other $0.01 was the result of lower than anticipated interest expense as we have been able to obtain loans at rates that are at all time historical lows.","During the quarter, we sold 8 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of about $225 million. These proceeds are primarily being used to fund acquisitions. We have seen good traction in the acquisitions market in 2012.","During the second quarter, we closed on the acquisition of four properties for approximately $21.3 million. These properties are located in Florida and Maryland. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed on the purchase of Prudential's interest in the PRISA III joint venture, adding 36 properties to the REIT.","As of today, the total number of wholly-owned assets is 408, as compared to 304 joint venture properties. This demonstrates our strategy to grow the REIT in a meaningful way. In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have closed on the acquisition of nine other properties for approximately $71.8 million.","These properties are located in California, Colorado, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. In addition to these, we have nine additional properties under contract for approximately $83 million, located in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Utah and Virginia.","We have updated our acquisition assumptions in our guidance to account for the increase in volume and acquisitions. We have revised our full year 2012 FFO guidance to be between $1.47 and $1.53 per share, and expect to earn between $0.39 and $0.41 in the third quarter. Key assumptions relating to these estimates can be found in the press release.","I will now turn the time back to Spencer for some closing comments.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Scott. Let me reiterate that Extra Space has one main theme in 2012, focus on fundamentals, which simply put is, maximize every revenue opportunity and appropriately minimize every single expense. We are executing at a high level on both fronts.","We exceeded our expectations in the second quarter and are pleased with the results, but I again caution that they should not be utilized as the basis for our long-term growth trend. If you look back over the last several years, it is evident that we are now running on the high end of the growth spectrum.","As a team, we can't take our eye off the ball, become complacent or become arrogant. We are keenly aware of the considerable competition that exists in the self storage sector. With this attitude and approach, I feel confident that we will consistently find ways to increase shareholder value.","With that, I would now like to turn the time over to Clint to start the Q&A Session.","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone's questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial question to (Inaudible) possible limited to two. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we will turn it over to Brie to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Close enough. Thank you for taking my question. Spencer, can you talk a little bit about the source of the deal flow you are seeing? Who is the incremental seller in this market? Is it mom-and-pop operators, or private guys liquidating their portfolios? Maybe on that note, if you can discuss the cap rates, which these acquisitions are based on?","Spencer Kirk","Let me first of all take the cap rate question. I would say the purchases of the assets we have talked about have ranged from about 6.5 to about 8, and that depends on the quality of the asset. In my mind, a quality score has three components. The physical condition of the asset, the market where that asset is located and the location within the market. So we tried to pay an appropriate cap rate depending on that three-tiered or three-pronged quality assessment.","We are getting buyers from across the board, Swaroop. Obviously, what call I call quasi-proprietary acquisition pipeline is not prettiness in any way, shape or form. 76% of our purchases so far this year have because of those existing carefully nurtured relationships and we will continue to work with our partners and provide a fair transaction if and when they decide it's time to exit a particular property or portfolio.","We do have mom-and-pops coming to us at an increasing rate. Many of the smaller operators are acknowledging that they cannot compete against the national operators. They don't have the platform or the systems, particularly with the internet to really drive traffic like the larger operators do.","Some of the mom-and-pops however still are looking for prices that are not realistic, at least not for Extra Space, and we have remained a disciplined buyer adding properties when it is accretive to this company.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","That's helpful. Second question I wanted to ask on the rental trend. If you can talk about asking rents, how they've trended this quarter? Then do you track your rents versus overall market rent? Can you talk about the delta between yours and the overall market?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. Our rates are holding quite well. We ended the quarter about 3% above the prior year, and combined with the occupancy delta to last year, which held better than I would have expected. That's what really the combination of that is what drove our growth this quarter.","As far as the competitors, it's kind of all over the place. Public storage, cube and sovereign, their rates are up and down, and in other cases follow us, or not necessarily follow us, but we are all kind of moving together.","The local operators, really, there's not much variability in their rates. They stay about the same, so we in this last quarter, I believe, we probably closed the gap a little bit with our competitors and in some cases we are above. Some cases we're below, but the gap closed a little bit because we held our rates probably a little bit more than other and that's not surprising, because our occupancy is at a better level.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Got it, so the local operators are sort of flat for the year you are saying?","Karl Haas","Yes. They really haven't adjusted their rates much at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott. Please proceed.","Michael Knott","Spencer, just wanted to ask you, is this as good as it gets, and what else can you guys do to keep this going, both on the internal growth side and on the external growth side as we all look into 2013?","Karl Haas","We are certainly not complaining as a management team. Looking at the overall economy and reading the bad news and then looking at what we're able to do in the storage sector. I am not going to say that it's as good as it gets, but it certainly is a very pleasant time to be in this sector and associated with the great team here at Extra Space, it's a very enjoyable time for me personally.","The things that I think will continue to propel our performance, Michael, are, number one is we have a unique structure and we are not reliant upon just one or two things to help drive our growth. In previous conference calls, I have talked about five levers of growth, which are significant and I think it's might be worth repeating that we believe Extra Space has a unique position.","The five drivers of growth that I think continue to propel performance are, number our poor property performance, which has been enhanced by superb execution at the site-level, which has all been enhanced with very strong technology base to give us the tools to produce what I would consider better than peer performance.","I am very pleased that our development pipeline continues to mature and the lease-up assets through 2014 will add value and meaningful cents per share to the FFO. We have got our off market, and open market acquisitions. I think as you have seen nearing $500 million in acquisitions that have been transacted or announced so far this year says that we are doing a decent job of working with our partners and also being competitive in the open marketplace.","Our tenant insurance program continues to provide meaningful FFO growth for this company, because every time we acquire a new property or push the lease-up of an asset or bring a new third-party management asset into the pool, we get meaningful new customers, thousands at a time typically in a quarter. The last area where we have done well is the third-party business continues to grow.","We are focusing certainly on those areas, where we have got an operational overlay on the footprint and we think that that those hopefully will become acquisition opportunities. Those are the five key levers.","Let me add a sixth. There was virtually no new supply coming into the market and that bodes well for the existing operators. The question is, with no new supply who captures a disproportionate share of what's available out there and that's where the power of the internet and the sophistication of our systems and the other national players comes into play.","I said it before that we have 42 dedicated resources internally and externally working on the internet to drive traffic and capture the disproportionate share and the internet which was supposed to be the great equalizer for all sort of operators has become the great divider and I am pleased to report that our internet strategy is not only robust, it's producing the results that we have invested heavily to capture.","So, I gave you the five traditional answers, Michael and reemphasize that no new supply and the power of the internet have made the playing field less in level.","Michael Knott","Thanks for that. I appreciate that. Then my second question would just be your capital structure and financing strategy as it relates to continued external growth. How do you think about your cost of capital with how successful your stock has been trading and how you might use that to continue your acquisition strategy?","Karl Haas","We are going to let Scott answer that question if I may.","Scott Stubbs","Hey Michael, it's Scott. With the stock price trading where it is and looking at acquisitions and growing there, it's obviously a consideration. You have interest rates at all time lows, but at the same time I think it's important not to ignore the long-term cost of capital. So while we have become slightly more aggressive on our cap rates and what we are buying right now it's not significantly more aggressive. We continue to finance things and buy things on largely a leverage-neutral basis.","Michael Knott","How do you guys think about balance sheet longer term? Just remind everyone.","Scott Stubbs","From a balance sheet perspective, we look at things as far as being leveraged in the probably where we are today depending on where your stock trades and what your net asset value is, you are kind of 30% to 45% range.","Michael Knott","Your leverage target is 30% to 45%. Is that what you are saying?","Scott Stubbs","It really varies depending on the markets. Right now, I think that interest rates are very attractive. We are going to do things on a secured basis, and not necessarily lever up, but we are not looking to de-lever right now, so I think it really depends on your net asset value and your net asset value is going to vary somewhat depending on what cap rates are, so that's why our range is as large as it is.","Michael Knott","Okay, just last question. Why not finance more of your growth as you go forward with more equity as opposed to leverage-neutral?","Scott Stubbs","It's something we are always looking at, Michael. We would look at issuing equity; we would look at, if we had somewhere to put that money.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Spencer, I think you touched on this a little bit, but can you just maybe walk us through what changed so dramatically in the last couple of months? Number one, to push performance to where it was relative to your original expectations and generally, what has been taking place that's kind of bright your view so much. It is a pretty significant move from the last time we had an update from the team.","Spencer Kirk","I think, David, the answer I would give you is, we are really focused on the fundamentals. So, we talk about enhancing property performance and it begins with making sure that we do everything possible to get the right price with the right discount to the right customer at the right time, and I think we are becoming better at that.","I also acknowledged that we are only at the leading edge of that. We have done a better job on our tenant insurance penetration rates. We have done a better job of controlling our utilities expenses and reaping the benefit of the sewer investment we have made.","It is incrementally, David, in my opinion, an amalgamation of a lot of the efforts and investments that we previously have made where we are starting to see the benefit and I fully acknowledge that we have had a really good strong rebound coming out of the recession. Our performance, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year have been a very positive and pleasant surprise for us.","But I don\u2019t delude myself nor does this management team delude itself into thinking that all is well. There are considerable significant negative exogenous forces in the world that could cause disruption and we want to provide the very best guidance recognizing that this team is executing exceptionally well but the operating environment of the overall economy to which the overall health of this business is tied remains less than certain.","We want to strike that fine balance between recognizing that we are executing well but also knowing that the economy is hardly on the road to recovery or in a position to provide a boost and with no new supply and the technological investments that we make, we are very pleased with the results. Our job, as a management, is not to think that it is a give me. Each and every quarter we are working as hard as we possibly can, recognizing that there is no free lunch and we need to earn our keep every day.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","I appreciate that. I appreciate the color. Do you think anything strange on the consumer side? Has there been a loosening of the purse springs? Have you just sort of figured out the psychology a little bit more? Has activity in the housing market perhaps contributed? In other words, has the backdrop of the demand part of the equation improved to map on to your internal efforts?","Spencer Kirk","I think it's all of the above, David. I visit a fair number of sites. I am in the field quite a lot, actually and as I talk to our site managers, I think there has been a loosening of the purse strings. There doesn\u2019t seem to be the gross negative over hang up, two and three ago.","The people are not overly optimistic about the future. The good news in all of this is storage is a need based product and those life changing events continue to happen in a tepid economy and our job as a management team has just been simply to say, what, people will be on the move. They will be in transition.","Life changing events will take place. How can we best maximize the value of each and every customer and how can we target and capture more than our fair share of those people that are going out to the market place.","And I will say it again; the internet was thought to be the great equalizer. It is the great divider and our investment in the internet is paying out a very rich dividend and we will continue to invest in, not only the standard, traditional, paid and organic searches but the social media and some of the other evolutions that are coming upon us in the interactive marketing world are things that we continue to invest in, monitor and will be prepared when the time comes.","So these are the things, I think, will help the performance in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy with USB. Please proceed.","Christine McElroy - USB","Just wanted to follow up on Michael's question regarding leverage. Your operating today at some of the lower leverage levels since going public but your target range extends pretty well beyond that. Are you effectively in low cost of capital world, preparing your balance sheet for the potential of an accelerated level of acquisitions or external growth over the next few years?","Spencer Kirk","I don\u2019t know that we are necessarily preparing it for that. I think that we are always prepared to acquire things. We always want to be at a level that serves our shareholders well, if you think about our balance sheet strategy over the past several years, I think it has served us well in good times and bad. We have naturally de-levered a little bit with the dividend. So we do have the ability to acquire some things right now.","So if we have opportunities we will use leverage as necessary.","Christine McElroy - USB","Should we expect that going forward? I know you haven\u2019t given '13 guidance yet but should we expect a similar level of acquisition?","Spencer Kirk","I think that\u2019s hard to expect that. I think we generally put a $100 million as kind of our target number and then hopefully exceed that but I think it's hard to expect that, especially with cap rates decreasing,","Christine McElroy - USB","And then, just with regards to your dividend. How close are you now to your expected cash flow income for this year and given your earnings growth, is it possible that you might have to revisit the payout earlier than the usual Q1?","Spencer Kirk","We are generally very close to the tax flow REIT minimum. So it is something that we will keep our eye on and as FFO grows it is something that obviously may or may not need to be adjusted.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Macquarie. Please proceed.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie","If you go back to your comments on breaking out your same store revenue growth, thank you for breaking out the contribution from undeveloped or unstabilized properties, but I was curious to know if all your unstabilized properties in the past, I don\u2019t know how many years, four years, are included in that 0.8% breakout? Or is it only the '07, '08 vintage?","Scott Stubbs","It's really a mix, Ki Bin. This is Scott. We added, I believe, 29 properties this year. It's really, probably about 19 of those properties.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie","So how far off an advantage developing your standpoint does that go back because I know you guys develop (inaudible) all through the 2000s? So was curious what bucket that is captured in your same store?","Scott Stubbs","It's really the ones that just got added this last year. Our same store definition is the property has to be open for three years or be 80% occupied for one full year, measured January 1. So the oldest the property could really be is three years and 364 days.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie","I don\u2019t want to beleaguer to a point for the 20% of infra revenue coming from unstabilized assets, is that more than one year's worth of development, or is it one time act?","Scott Stubbs","It does have a little bit more than one year's development but it also has some acquisition that was in lease up also. So it's not just straight development.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie","The reason I was asking was because there was development from '05, '06, '07 that are priced still reaching for full occupancy that probably helped that number even further than 0.8%. Is that correct?","Scott Stubbs","Even through the downturn, our properties have continued to lease up. They haven\u2019t necessarily struggled from an occupancy perspective. It's more on the rate side where we have rates. A few of those properties, obviously, have struggled some. But for the most part, our developments have all leased up fairly well.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie","The second question, going back to your comments about the acquisition cap ratio ranging from 6.5 to 8, at what point, I am guessing the 6.5 is for the best stuff out there, but at what point or what level does that 6.5 cap will have to come down to maybe justify any development and would you ever do it, equal, I mean ever is a bad question, but have you come any close to it?","Spencer Kirk","Ki Bin, Its Spencer. I am not going to give you a threshold as to what that needs to come down. We do think that there needs to be a very 250 to 350 basis points spread to do development. To take on the risk of development versus what we can buy in the open market. We think that there needs to be something substantive to make it worthwhile.","We exited the development world and currently we have no plans to reenter the development market, and ultimately I would just underpin all of that and say we're going to do what is best for the shareholders, but we have been through unprecedented times and I think our current strategy is providing the highest and best return with the lowest risk profile currently for our shareholders and as the environment evolves, perhaps the strategy will evolve, but I think we've been pretty clear on our direction on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed.","Eric Wolfe - Citi","I just wanted to follow-up on David's line of question on sort of what's changed relative to your guidance. If you look at the different components of your revenue growth, occupancy renewals, street rates, et cetera, then what specifically has surprised you relative to your guidance that you gave last quarter, and does that change your strategy at all going forward?","Scott Stubbs","Eric, its Scott Stubbs. The guidance we gave last quarter was at a time when we are looking at April was all right, but it wasn't that strong. If you look at the year, we were right on budget at that time or very close to budget.","During the second quarter, we have exceeded our budgets and therefore adjusted our estimates for the remainder of the year when it comes to our properties. If you think about, we just exceeded by $0.03, we then adjust our remainder of the year slightly. I think it didn't make sense in the current environment not to increase our guidance.","Eric Wolfe - Citi","Right. I know you are very focused on revenue maximization, so you are not so focused on, say, just building occupancy or pushing rate, but if you look at where you sort of ended up this quarter from an occupancy perspective and rate perspective. I mean is there any sort of noticeable difference versus what you had initially conceived or is it pretty much just everything stronger across the board.","Karl Haas","This is Karl. We're pleased with occupancy delta being as high as it is and it was somewhat unexpected, because we have been more aggressive on rates. I think in prior two calls, I have tried to prepare everybody for that occupancy delta to close, and at some point it will, but we're out there with a system doing what it determines is the best store-by-store way to maximize revenue, and it's just played out that while we push rates, we've been able to hold the occupancy as well. From the supplier standpoint the thing that probably helped us the most is that we knew we were pushing rates, but we were very pleased that our occupancy held.","Eric Wolfe - Citi","Right. Okay. That's very helpful, and just last question. Looking at your guidance for the remainder of the year, specifically on the revenue growth side, you seemed to be dropping from call it high-6s, 6.7, second quarter to sort of the low 4s. Is it just sort of a conservative take on occupancy that takes you down there that that gap might not hold quite as much, because I'm just trying to figure out what can take you from that high 6s to the low 4s in such a short period of time.","Karl Haas","I think it's a combination of looking at 2011. I mean, when we do our budgets and we come up with our numbers one of the final things I look at is graph that plots what we are doing this year, compared to what we've done in the prior couple of years. A couple of things come into play.","Last year, we had an odd phenomena and it's graph side, I had went back like four years, five years, we've never had a year where we didn't have the downturn in the fourth quarter. Last year, it did not downturn. I don't expect that that's a permanent trend, so when you look at the gap and you look at the numbers, we are continuing to go against, we just feel like that's a pretty realistic estimate. Going back, when we look at our performance even so far this year, we've actually hit pretty close to our budgeted numbers. We speak on expenses on expense by a lot more than we have on revenue side as far as our actual budgeted numbers.","Eric Wolfe - Citi","Got you. That's very helpful detail. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with KBW. Please proceed.","Smedes Rose - KBW","I just want to ask you on properties that you have acquired that were in lease-up or some of your newer properties that are continuing to lease up, are you seeing the demand come in incrementally faster given that occupancies have held up better than what you thought. Are you sort of seeing that across the board or is it in more mature markets or denser markets?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. It's kind of all over the place, and I think two years ago, we were seeing a much smaller than expected rent-up and that's kind what is impacting these 19 properties. They took longer to rent-up. Normally, in the past it's been a three-year rent-up to four-year rent-up, now it's becoming during this recession, a four to five-year rent-up. All in all, we're pleased with the rent-up of the properties that are in that phase right now, but it varies by market and actually even within the market it varies. We've got a good number of properties in Florida that are in that rent-up group and recently they've done very, very well.","Smedes Rose - KBW","Okay. Then I just wanted to ask you on your tenant reinsurance program. It looks like it was running a little better than at least what we had estimated. What sort of customer penetration does that program have at this point?","Karl Haas","We're in the kind of between 65% and 70%, and we're pretty much hitting our target. The speed that we are able to increase the overall penetration has definitely slowed down. We are maturing. What helps is, when we are able to add new properties and especially new third-party managed properties, which come in with very, very low penetration and we can grow those pretty significantly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas - KeyBank Capital Markets","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. A follow-up question actually on the acquisitions. Outside of the Peru deal just wondering what the average cap rate and where occupancy is for the properties and the nine under contract.","Scott Stubbs","This is Scott. It's been pretty similar. Your cap rates have ranged from 6.5 to 8 and your occupancy for the most part we are buying stabilized assets, and it's the same for the properties under contract.","Todd Thomas - KeyBank Capital Markets","Then, Karl, I think you noted earlier that asking rents were 3% higher versus last year. I was just wondering where asking rents across the portfolio are relative to in line rents, and also do you have the growth in net rent per occupied square foot for the same-store pool year-over-year.","In the supplement, you give that number, I see it for the different segments, but there's no year-over-year comp and obviously the pools have changed over the course of the year.","Karl Haas","As far as Q2, 2011, 13.52. Q2, 2012 is, 13.97. As far as the asking rates versus the in-place rates, they are relatively even. I actually haven't looked at it really recently, but that's become kind of a non-issue for us.","Todd Thomas - KeyBank Capital Markets","Okay. Then just lastly do you have occupancy as of today last day of the month.","Karl Haas","Yes. We're little over 90.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Raymond James & Associates. Please proceed.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","Good afternoon, guys. The updated acquisition guidance, I guess would imply pretty minimal activity for the rest of the year and I was wondering if that's a function of maybe a smaller, sort of short-term pipeline if that's a issue of expected closing dates or that' just sort of being conservative?","Spencer Kirk","It's based on what we have that we are looking currently and what we have under LOI, so right now we don't have a turn in the pipeline.","Karl Haas","Spencer, just one other comment. Realistically by my math, you've got four months left in the year. If you take out the holiday season and all this other stuff, so if it's not under contract, you are under a substantive discussion right now for likelihood that you are going to transact that's material between now and the end of the year is going to become increasingly more difficult, so I think if you look at our guidance for the rest of the year, I think you are going to find it to be pretty accurate, because we are not in any type of dialogues with people that will provide something to us.","Now that could change, but right now there's nothing in the pipeline that's going to be a surprise between now and the end of the year that we would be able to highlight.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. Thank you. My second question is more for the on the supply side, I'm curious how much do you think rents can go higher before we start to see new supply and is it a purely a mathematical question before we start to see new supplier, or are there other barriers, financing, entitlements, et cetera.","Spencer Kirk","Yes. We would tell you that the main barrier right now not only is the yield, but also financing, which obviously financing is part of the yield. Banks haven't loosened their first string so to speak to the smaller operators. If you think about the development that took place in 2003 to 2007, call it, we were developing more than any of the public companies and we were doing 10 to 15 a year, so we were a very small portion of what was being added, so until the smaller operators were able to get attractive bank loans, we don't see it significantly.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","If there was access to the financing, how far do you think you could push rents before you started to see the smaller developers come in and start building?","Spencer Kirk","A way to look at this, RJ would be to say, all right if the banks turned on the lending, say, 12 months for now, we've got to get through the entitlement stuff, because some of those [sales], so that's one to two years. A year to construction and then three or five-year to lease up, so when we talked about no new supply, I think we've got a comfortable cushion, but it all depends I think primarily on one banks starts to lend, because that will signal to the smaller guys that it's time to get back in the game.","Let me give you a data point to just to underscore what Scott said. I did a quick back of the napkin sketch of developments in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2006, 2007. 13,011 self-storage facilities were built in the United States by one measure. That's 2,600 a year, and Extra Space is the prolific public company developing was producing 12 to 15. Hardly a drop in the bucket against that backdrop of 2,600 a year on average, so a lot of things can and will change, but the lending environment for the small guy hasn't changed a lot. We'll just have to see how things play out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","I want to follow-up on the lease-up assets discussion throughout the call and maybe ask this in a different way, so often you all have had a slide in your investor presentations talking about the what the stabilization of those lease-up assets would add to FFO through 2014. Is that still true, or is some of the occupancy gains that we've seen an acceleration of that lease-up stabilization.","Scott Stubbs","It's still about $0.07.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thank you, Scott. Any thoughts about moving to an unsecured financing strategy?","Scott Stubbs","It's something we'll look at. I mean unsecured obviously an option. We're not looking to go to a completely unsecured financing strategy.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon, guys. Scott, first question as we look at the second half of the year, what are you guys expecting in terms of real estate tax appraisals maybe on a year-over-year basis and also looking at financing cost, just curious whether you could you see new secured today? What kind of terms you were hearing from the banks as well as insurance companies and things of that nature.","Scott Stubbs","Our property tax consultants have reduced the number about 4% for year-over-year increase on property taxes. So far it's been running fairly close to that as the assessments come in. As far as new secured financing after the subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did a tranche of seven-year money just under 3.2%.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","What was the LTV on that?","Scott Stubbs","About 70%.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That was 10-year, right?","Scott Stubbs","It's seven-year money, so if you compare that to unsecured, it's quite a bit lower interest rate there.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Karl, my follow-up question, you talked about renewal and steep rents, what is the delta right now between move-in rents and move-out rents?","Karl Haas","I don\u2019t have it right in front of me. We could get it for you, but it's probably move-out rates are probably little bit more than the move-in rates, but bring people in at aggressive rates and then raise the rates, so it doesn't stay. That gap doesn't remain all that long.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","If you could provide that offline, I'd really appreciate, but how does that compare right now versus call it a year ago, that delta. How would you see that\u2026","Spencer Kirk","It's close because our existing customer rate increases have not changed dramatically, but our rates are starting to climb or street rates are starting to climb, so based on that it has to be close.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Congrats on an amazing quarter. Quick question. I mean with your overall strategy working so well, I am just kind of curious what are you seeing in regards to higher competition is basically reacting to what you are doing? Not necessarily the public guys, but a lot of the local guys that are in your market that makes up the bulk of the market?","Karl Haas","They really don't react very much. They haven't adjusted the rates. They are afraid to lose occupancy. They aren't as aggressive with existing customer rate increases, because they are afraid of losing occupancy. We have seen our public competitors follow a lot of things that we are doing and every once in a while we follow what they are doing, but the bulk of the sites out there, they are making money, they are not in trouble and they are not unhappy with the results.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","At what point do your prices become so far away from their prices that customers actually start to notice on and focus on that differential when they are thinking of taking a new unit?","Karl Haas","Well, our prices aren't outlined with their prices. Where we make up for it is, we've been able to gain occupancy and our existing customer rate increases for the customers once they are inside, because people don't move until they don't need it anymore, so our price is competitive.","The other thing that's a little bit different is, that we have an internet price and we did lead the industry in this. We have two-tiers of pricing. We have internet price and we have a street rate, and so when you walk into the site, those people are less sensitive to the prices and so they are quoted a higher price.","If they pushback or they walk out, or if they have checked the internet, they'll get the internet price, which can be as much as 15% lower, so when people are comparing us on the internet, us to our competitors, they see that internet price and that's a very aggressive price and very competitive price.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie. Please proceed.","Ki Bin Kim -Macquarie","Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Going back to just your commentary about the second quarter strength you are seeing and maybe we could use occupancy gains as the measuring stick, and so from 270 basis points gain, if you had to break that up into just overall industry occupancy pickup versus market share gains, how would that look like?","Karl Haas ","Ki Bin, this is Karl. I have no idea, but we can get back to you.","Ki Bin Kim -Macquarie","Okay. Just the second question. I know you said development price go far away, especially given financing markets and what not, but if you had to look at the most viable site in your portfolio or where you are located, where would stabilized development yield based on today's market dynamics to be? For the most viable site?","Karl Haas ","Manhattan. We don't have any sites in Manhattan, but you could do a site in Manhattan, things would be great.","Spencer Kirk","Yes. It's been a very key just by market just because it depends on what the land is selling for. It depends on what the self-storage densities are like in that market, and then obviously it depends on the yield you are going to get, so it's pretty variable. I mean the only place you'd every really consider obviously is a place with higher barriers to entry.","Karl Haas ","Long-term, Northeast is proven to be a very, very good strong long-term market for us, and we know that Chicago has turned out to be pretty good, but probably in a long-term it has been as great as it's been recently.","Ki Bin Kim -Macquarie","Okay. Well, I guess, what I was asking is that are yields just close to where you can buy assets which goes far away or how does that relationship look like?","Spencer Kirk","We haven't looked at it significantly, so it would be difficult to comment on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","I guess this one would be for Karl. I think we've had a few variations of this question. I don't think anyone is asking. I don't think anyone has asked this one just yet, but year-over-year change in street rates for maybe the end of 2Q, compared to I guess the end of 2Q '11, and then maybe how that differs from the same year-over-year comparison at 1Q '12 versus 1Q '11.","Scott Stubbs","That's tough. Well, 3.5% at the end of Q2. I think it was 3% at the end of Q1. I don't remember what it was at the end in 2011, but it was probably less than that. It's gone up and down. I wish I could say that I said it, but the system really it evolves based on our system.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Then I guess with the proliferation of internet rental I guess when we even asked about street rents on these calls. Are you talking now those numbers that you just gave are those literally the street rents and the stores or is that a blend of your asking rents at the store level and on the internet.","Scott Stubbs","One follows the other, say, if there was a gap, but one follows the other. Our internet price is 15% below our street rate. When we say it's 3.5%, both would be up 3.5%.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Got you. Then just one real quick one. I think you gave a number of occupancy was a little over 90 at the end of July. How does that compare to the end of the July 2011?","Scott Stubbs","It's still up about more than 2.5%. Actually, about 2.7% on our own pool, and 2.9% on the big pool.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Does your revised guidance consider that maybe that occupancy gap won't close quickly as you thought?","Scott Stubbs","I mean it's a combination of what we can get with rate, we also are getting a little bit more aggressive with rates, and I expect to see that drive down that. I don't think we've taken seasonality out of our business and we will see a drop in our occupancy and the delta should close, because we are at a very high level of occupancy and probably little higher than we expected to be.","One scenario it could play. I mean, we're going to push rates and if the occupancy holds, that would certainly help us reach the top end of our guidance and that will be a good thing, but I wouldn't want to go and guarantee that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Back when I was in the [past] life. I think you may have been asked this, but just I want to just in case I missed it. When was the last time the portfolio was over 90%. Do you think this is a relatively sustainable level at this point?","Scott Stubbs","Never. Well, remembering that it's seasonal and we are not going to be 90% year around, but this is the highest level we've been. I mean, we're up 6%, 7% from three years ago. It's been a pretty good run.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Assuming that world mustn't get a whole lot worst, is it conceivable that that portfolio could stabilize above 90% at this point?","Scott Stubbs","Anything is conceivable.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed.","Mike Bilerman - Citi","Yes. It's Mike Bilerman. I may have missed this. I jumped on a little bit late. On the operating expenses, which you've been able to control pretty well during the year. When you sort of look at, at least, what was the same-strong guidance of 3% to 4% that you had provided originally when you put out 2012 guidance, and obviously that went to 1% to 2.5% last quarter, and it's now down to 0% to 1.5%. What is sort of driving almost 300 basis points of savings on the expenses and just looking at the total portfolio if you are getting the same sort of savings, it's about $3 million, I'm just curious if you can sort of bucket it a little bit in terms of categories for us.","Karl Haas","Well, this is Karl. If you go back to our Q1 call, a big chunk of it was explained there and that was we had it unbelievably mild winter and we had almost no snow removal and that is a big chuck. It's one quarter. It doesn't obviously carryover into the rest of the quarters, but also utilities. To mild winter, our utilities were dramatically down and those were the by far the biggest drivers and the biggest surprise before the year began guidance to what we're ending up with.","Those don't repeat, and now what we're getting the benefit from is our investment sustainability, which we are seeing ongoing benefit on the utility expense, but nowhere near the level that we were seeing earlier or in the first quarter and we will continue through about October, getting the benefit of the reduced credit card fees, because that started actually last year in the, I believe October-November, so that will equalize and balance out.","Mike Bilerman - Citi","You are seeing that through all the entire portfolio whether it'd be same-store, the core, the unstabilized and also the assets that you manage?","Karl Haas","Yes.","Mike Bilerman - Citi","Is the margin on the tenant reinsurance is obviously higher as you keep on driving that. Is that affecting the same-store numbers at all?","Karl Haas","Hope it is slightly.","Scott Stubbs","But it's in our guidance.","Mike Bilerman - Citi","When looking at the same-store revenue growth, that bumping up from what was 4 in the quarter to 5, 3, 7, 5 to midpoint. A good chunk of that is tenant reinsurance going up $3 million from the original forecast, correct?","Scott Stubbs","Marginally it's helping, but the majority of it's the property themselves performing better. I mean tenant reinsurance adds, 50 basis points.","Karl Haas","Actually I think it's going down. I think it's 0.3.","Spencer Kirk","We've hit the top of the hour.

As many of you know, last month, I announced that I will be retiring at the end of the year and that I will be succeeded by our Chief Investment Officer, Joe Margolis. I have had the opportunity to work with Joe for more than 18 years. He was instrumental in structuring our first JV with Prudential in 1998. He served on our Board of Directors for more than a decade and he has excelled in his role as our Chief Investment Officer. He has the right balance of real estate expertise and leadership skills to lead Extra Space in its continued growth and success.","So at this time, I would like to turn the time over to Joe.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Spencer. Good afternoon, everybody. It has been great to meet with many of you face-to-face since we announced Spencer\u2019s retirement, and I look forward to getting to know you better through future interactions.","It was another strong quarter for Extra Space. FFO per share as adjusted grew 26% year-over-year. This growth was the result of more than solid operating performance. It was also fueled by accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these levers to continue to grow shareholder value. Operationally, we continued to push rates to new and existing customers in the quarter and experienced average street rate growth of approximately 7%, similar to 2015. This growth was partially offset by an increase in bad debt and discounts, which resulted in same-store revenue growth of 6.1%. Discounts, while still very low from our historical measure, are up from an all-time low in 2015. Expenses increased only 1.4%, which led to NOI growth of 7.8%. Quarter end occupancy was strong at 93%.","Year-to-date, we have acquired $825 million in wholly-owned stores. With very few exceptions, these acquisitions were not broadly marketed but came from our JV, managed and other relationships. The largest of the off-market transactions closed on September 16 when we purchased Prudential\u2019s majority interest in 23 stores for $238 million. Concurrently, we sold our minority interest to Prudential and the remaining 42 stores in the joint venture for $35 million. We will continue to manage these stores. In addition, we are under agreement with the JV partner to purchase its majority interest in 11 stores for approximately $153 million. We plan to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, which will result in wholly-owned acquisitions of $1 billion in 2016.","We also expect to close $255 million in CofO acquisitions in 2016. $90 million of these will be wholly owned and the remainder will be in joint ventures with our investment in these ventures totaling $53 million. Our JV strategy and our CofO program are working and are creating value year in and year out.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Joe. Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.02 per share exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. Including cost associated with acquisitions and non-cash interest expense, FFO was $1 per share for the quarter. The beat was primarily the result of stronger than anticipated performance from our 2015 acquisitions, specifically SmartStop. We also benefited from the collection of $1 million in business interruption insurance proceeds.","As Joe mentioned, our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assumed no benefit from occupancy and a headwind from discounts in the second half of 2016. We continue to have solid revenue and NOI growth throughout our diversified portfolio. Our top performing markets in the quarter included Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and Tampa St. Pete with revenue growth in the high single-digits. The slowest markets were Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston and Memphis. With the exception of Denver, which represents about 1% of our revenue, all of our markets showed positive revenue growth year-over-year.","Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed a $1.15 billion unsecured credit facility. The facility consists of a $500 million revolving line of credit; a 5-year, $430 million term loan; and a 7-year, $220 million term loan. The credit facility has an accordion feature that allows us to increase total capacity to $1.5 billion. At closing, we drew $300 million on the 5-year tranche and paid off and terminated 3 of our 4 bilateral revolving lines of credit. The 5-year and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features. We will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt. This unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goal is to have access to multiple types of capital to [indiscernible] and to maintain financial stability. This credit facility helps accomplish all of these goals.","Due to the outperformance of our 2015 acquisitions, we are increasing our annual FFO guidance. FFO as adjusted is now estimated to be $3.78 to $3.80 per share. FFO is now estimated to be $3.63 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth.","I will now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Scott. This is my final earnings call as the CEO of Extra Space. I have enjoyed working with each of you and I am grateful for the relationships and friendships that have been developed over the years. Going forward, I will continue to be actively involved as a member of the board and I will remain the company\u2019s largest individual shareholder. My interests are perfectly aligned with those of our shareholders.","Thinking back 7.5 years ago when I took over as CEO, it wasn\u2019t about my predecessor Ken Woolley, and today, it isn\u2019t about Spence Kirk. It\u2019s always been about our constant and capable executive team, which has an average tenure of 14 years. I am 100% comfortable that Joe Margolis is the right person at the right time to lead this very strong team. Our unique structure and our ability to execute a clear business strategy has allowed us to be among the fastest growing REITs in the nation. None of that changes with this transition.","Over the last 5 years, we have profitably acquired over $5 billion of real estate. These acquisitions alone would constitute one of the largest storage companies in the nation. When you combine that kind of external growth with the industry\u2019s best operating platform, which just delivered its 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit FFO growth, Extra Space is well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth for years to come.","With that, let\u2019s turn it over to Jeff to start the Q&A.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Spencer. In order ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we will turn it over to Jonathan to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan from Baird, your question please.","R.J. Milligan","Yes. Good afternoon guys. First off, congratulations, Spencer. It\u2019s been great working with you. So congratulations on your retirement.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you.","R.J. Milligan","Scott, I had a question in terms of the acquisition and sort of plans for long-term funding, obviously a lot more acquisitions this quarter and for the year more than planned, but given where the stock price is trading, curious what your plans are for funding those acquisitions and if you would be comfortable raising equity at the current price?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. First of all, I would tell you we don\u2019t look at our current stock price anytime we make an acquisition decision. It\u2019s not made with a short-term cost of capital in mind. We always look at the long-term costs. So we have always tried to have many sources of capital. And right now, I would tell you that we still do. Debt is an option. We just closed this facility that gives us a fair amount of capacity. The preferred market is still a very good. And our stock price, we don\u2019t like it as much today as we have in the past. But I think that we have always looked to access the cheapest cost of capital, which could also include joint ventures or even proceeds from the sales of properties.","R.J. Milligan","So would you be willing to increase debt levels for the short-term until you maybe have a better stock price?","Scott Stubbs","Marginally, yes, we would.","R.J. Milligan","Okay. I will get back in the queue. Thanks guys.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","All the best, R.J. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch, your question please.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, good afternoon guys. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the state of demand, if I look at Page 20 of your supplemental, it looks like rentable square feet on a same-store basis declined year-over-year for the three months and for the nine months and you kind of talked about concessions going up, so just curious about the health of demand and kind of what you are having to offer to get people to sign the leases?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. I am assuming you are looking at the rentals and vacates in our supplementals.","Juan Sanabria","Correct.","Spencer Kirk","First thing I would do is we always tell people to be careful looking at rentals and vacates. It depends a little bit on what happened last year. We focus more on occupancy and revenue growth. I would tell you demand is so solid. We are very near our record high occupancy for this time of year. Last year was our best year ever. So while we are slightly below last year, it\u2019s still very solid. We are still seeing rate growth in our street rates. For the quarter, we grew 6% to 7%. And we continue to push those here into the fourth quarter.","R.J. Milligan","Any color on concessions to get people in and then what \u2013 how that\u2019s changed as a percentage of revenue or absolute dollar terms?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So our discounts are up slightly from where they were. Last year was the kind of bottom, where you \u2013 as a percentage of revenues, if you take discounts divided by revenues, you are around 3%. Current year, they have ticked up slightly from there. But they are going to tick up for a couple of things. One is the fact that our rates are up. And then the second thing that affects discounts, obviously, is how many rentals you are doing in that month. With rentals being down slightly, that helps. With rates being up, that hurts. And in addition we are offering slightly more discounts right now to try to compensate a little bit for our drop in occupancy. We ended a quarter about 40 basis points below where we were last year. We would like to pick up a little bit of that going into the slow season here.","R.J. Milligan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz from UBS, your question please.","Jeremy Metz","Hi guys. Just two quick ones, in terms of the joint venture acquisitions, can you talk about what prompted these, was this driven by your partners coming to you and saying they wanted to sell and any insight into why now. And then did you ever row flow on those?","Spencer Kirk","So I will answer the second piece. We have a row flow in all of our joint ventures, but that was not the triggering factor here. We have done five transactions with four different joint ventures, all managed by Prudential. Each venture is run by a different portfolio manager, has a different strategy and the catalyst for the transaction in each case was different. In some case, we had an unsolicited offer for a property that we didn\u2019t want to sell. That started the discussion. In another case, the portfolio manager wanted to change up his geographical diversification and wanted to sell a bunch of properties, primarily in California. From our standpoint though, the similarity in each venture was that we had embedded promote in the venture that we could not get to without a capital transaction. So we restructured \u2013 earlier this year, we restructured two of the accounts without a capital transaction and realized over $40 million in promote. And then in the purchases we have done from the two single client accounts, the sales proceeds to the venture would be sufficient to satisfy the accrued preferred return, pay down some capital and put us in a position going forward where we will be cash flow promoted in the ventures.","Jeremy Metz","I appreciate that color. And then I just had one \u2013 second one on supply, just any changes in the supply picture in terms of expected starts out there, any new markets where you are seeing it start to get more heated than maybe you initially thought?","Spencer Kirk","I think the picture looks pretty much the same to us. We see increasing supply from a period where there was very little supply. The markets that we see supply are the markets that have limited barriers to entry, primarily. Many markets in California and others don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t see that supply. Maybe a new market we are starting to focus on will be Austin, Texas. But overall, supply \u2013 we are in a development cycle. We are seeing increased supply. We are seeing in some instances, it affects our operations. In some instances, it doesn\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t \u2013 we, on a portfolio level, we still perceive it to be at a manageable, moderate level.","Scott Stubbs","Jeremy, I would maybe add one thing to that and that is currently as these properties open, there is demand. If you look in our supplementals and look at the occupancy of our CofO deals, these properties are leasing up extremely quickly. So obviously there is some type of pent-up demand.","Spencer Kirk","By the way Jeremy, it\u2019s Spencer. One of the things you need to know is just because a macro market might have a lot of supply, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s going to impact certain individual sites. A lot of noise has been made about South Florida and Miami. Well, this past quarter, our revenues were up 6.8% and NOI was up 7.3%. So there can be new supply in Miami, but apparently today it\u2019s not having any impact that\u2019s discernible on our property level performance, because those sites aren\u2019t within a three mile or four mile or five mile radius of our current operations. So it all depends as you look at across the country, the impact of supply.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Jeremy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC, your question please.","Wes Golladay","Hi guys. It looks like street rates are still pretty healthy, renewal rates are pretty good, concessions are slightly higher and occupancy is just the tad lower than you would expect, but we are seeing about 150 basis points sequential decline in revenue growth likely three quarters in a row potentially to get to a low end of the guidance, what is going on, is it just you guys are above market and you are just resetting back to a more normal level, is that the driver or is that the concessions, what is driving the 150 bps a quarter?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. So year-to-date, we have had 150 bps per quarter. So Q1 to Q2, Q2 to Q3, it\u2019s been 150 bps per quarter, that\u2019s coming off of all-time highs, record NOI growth. I would tell you, the rate of decline has slowed from the second going into the third quarter. So it was fairly steep and then later in the third quarter, it is absolutely slow.","Wes Golladay","Okay. So would it be potentially you guys are just above market for even though new lease growth or effective rent was growing or street rate was growing call it 5%, you guys might have been above and as your portfolio starts to reset back to where the market is, the pace of decline will start to moderate and maybe start to reaccelerate again, is that how should we should look at it?","Spencer Kirk","I would tell you it\u2019s tough by market, because every market is a little bit different. Some markets, it truly is new supply. Other markets, it\u2019s that we have grown 15% for 2 years in a row. We wouldn\u2019t expect to grow 15% again next year. So, Denver is a combination of supply plus Denver in 2014 grew double-digits, 2015, double-digits, 2016, it\u2019s now \u2013 in this quarter went slightly negative. So, it varies by market, but overall, you are coming off of record highs. It\u2019s just the timing of when you are coming off of those.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then as I recall you guys do have some governors that you want to be too far above market. It sounds like you guys might have been somewhere where the governors were at and then you had the new supply and that\u2019s where we are seeing such a drastic decline in Denver and that will probably be the most extreme example. Is that a fair assessment?","Spencer Kirk","I think that\u2019s probably fair. The one thing we do have like you mentioned is the governors. So what governs that is street rates. So, as street rates are increasing, you do have the ability to increase existing customers also. But if street rates aren\u2019t moving then your existing customers won\u2019t be getting rate increases at some point also.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then lastly just on the \u2013 there is a lot of new supply and we already talked about how it will affect your current operations, but would you see as far as the managed business or maybe your CofO business, I guess, how much share of the new development can you take in your market, either developers wanting to affiliate with Extra Space. I see some developments in Charlotte that will be managed by you. I just wondered how much an opportunity it is for you?","Spencer Kirk","Well, thank you very much for asking that question, because we always talk about development as a risk to our business. Well, development also provides an opportunity for us. And if you look at our supplements and see how our CofO assets are leasing up, you can get an idea of what good investments those are going to be and the value those are going to add to our shareholders. And also on the managed side, as you point out, the vast, vast majority of our incoming \u2013 our pipeline of managed stores are new developments. So, we will be able to grow that platform. We are growing it this year even though we had some sales out of the management plus platform and be able to continue to grow that business both as a revenue generator, a source of additional data and a pipeline for future acquisitions.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks a lot. Congrats Spencer and congrats Joe.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Wes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Your question please.","Smedes Rose","Hi, how are you? I wanted to just ask if you are seeing any changes in seller expectations despite very healthy fundamental still the pace obviously has declined. And I was wondering if you have changed your underwriting at all given a little bit the slowdown of the industry or are you seeing any kind of change in private market cap rates?","Spencer Kirk","Well, sellers always have unrealistic expectations and I think they still have unrealistic expectations. But to the point of your question, we feel that the cap rate compression has stopped and that things are still trading at very healthy prices, but perhaps there is fewer bidders and there is not as much pressure on pricing. We I think through this period, we have done a good job of being realistic and disciplined in our underwriting and because of that, we have not been successful with widely marketed deals. Only about 12% of the deals we have accrued this year in our real estate community were from a broker. Everything else came through some type of relationship or off-market transaction. So, we have not changed our underwriting. We continue to try to be disciplined. And I think we are going to continue to be largely unsuccessful in the bid auction market until there is a significant change.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And just switching to CofO deals for a second, have you seen any sort of change in the frequency of folks approaching you of these kinds of deals say versus 6 months ago?","Spencer Kirk","I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I think we have always had a very strong pipeline of CofO deals and we see \u2013 storage is still very, very healthy business and folks who have not been in storage before want to get into storage and want to be developers and approach us in a pretty consistent basis. So, I think the pipeline is still strong and we are very selective both in terms of who we want the developers to be and which projects we want to commit to in terms of what else is being developed in that area.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And Spencer, I wanted to add on my best wishes to you as well going forward. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you very much, Smedes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund from Jefferies. Your question please.","George Hoglund","Yes. First off, Spencer, just enjoy your retirement. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you.","Spencer Kirk","Likewise, George, thank you.","George Hoglund","And I guess my two questions have two specific markets. I guess one in New York if you can just comment a bit on the performance on the sequential slowdown in revenue growth? And then also in Denver sort of what drove that large increase in same-store expenses, up 25%?","Scott Stubbs","I will take the Denver one first and then maybe, Joe, you want to take the New York? The Denver one is actually a property tax increase in expenses and it\u2019s not that the tax of this year went up. It\u2019s a comp from last year where we won an appeal last year and so you had expenses go down, because we got effectively a lower rate or cash back. So, it\u2019s really more of a year-over-year comparison on the expense side than a big increase in expenses.","Joe Margolis","The New York is a little bit of a mystery to us. It\u2019s a good market. There is some development coming online. The saturation is extremely low. Perhaps, it\u2019s a market where valet is making a little bit of an inroad, but we have a hard time understanding and predicting the New York market right now.","George Hoglund","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, George.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital. Your question please.","Todd Thomas","Yes, hi, good afternoon, Spencer, best of luck in retirement. Good luck. Just first question, Joe or Scott maybe just following up on the discounting, can you just talk a little bit more about the discounting in the quarter, maybe quantify what percent of customers receive discounts in the quarter, how that compared year-over-year?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. So, year-over-year, current year about 58% of our new customers received a discount compared to last year it was 47% of our new customers. Now that can be a little misleading sometimes because it\u2019s going to depend on which discount they receive. So even though fewer customers last year received a discount, it\u2019s possible you could have given more discounts if you gave a larger discount, but that is \u2013 we are still \u2013 majority of our customers coming in the door are getting the discount as they come in.","Todd Thomas","Okay. So, how should we think about that discounting in the context of the 7% higher asking rents that were mentioned year-over-year? I mean, what does that mean for move in rates in the quarter on a year-over-year basis?","Spencer Kirk","So discounts, assuming all things were equal, 7% increase in asking rates would be a 7% increase in discounts. I would tell you, they are slightly higher than that, because we have increased the percentage of customers getting the discount. And then we have also \u2013 depending on the market, depending on occupancy, we will continue to change discounts offered, the specific discount offered. But it\u2019s not significantly higher, but it is higher and it is affecting your net rental income.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then just maybe for Joe, just like a bigger picture question here. Just sticking with revenue growth and the deceleration that we are seeing today realizing we are coming off record highs, are there any signs of stabilization today whether it is discounting or something else though that you might be able to point to or do you think that this deceleration on a broader portfolio level could continue over the next several quarters?","Joe Margolis","Our view is that deceleration is going to moderate and flatten out and we are going to revert to more normal rates of growth, self storage normal, which historically has been higher than other property types, so we are already feeling that and that\u2019s what we expect.","Todd Thomas","Okay. So, it seems like your comments suggest then that you think that you would just sort of moderate and sort of stair step down to a level that stabilizes in the coming quarters then?","Joe Margolis","Correct.","Todd Thomas","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust, your question please.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. And Spencer, it was great working with you and best of luck.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you.","Ki Bin Kim","You\u2019re welcome. So maybe we can just start off with maybe you could provide some October stats on street rate growth and promotions?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. Our street rate growth for October is slightly lower than where it was in the third quarter. So you are mid-5s \u2013 in street rate growth mid to upper-5s depending on kind of the time. Discounts are pretty similar to what they were in the third quarter, up slightly. But \u2013 the reason we are adjusting discounts and pricing is obviously to try to recoup some of the occupancy that we were down.","Ki Bin Kim","Right. So if I look at your guidance, adjusted guidance and what it implies for the fourth quarter, we are roughly looking at a low 5%, same-store revenue growth rate, what\u2019s interesting about that is that probably, that your rent per occupied square foot growth rate for the first time is going to surpass same-store revenue growth rate, at least just trending that way, so it feels like there may be some levers, whether that\u2019s promotions like we talk about or existing customer rate increases having a lower benefit to those same-store revenue numbers or just decrease in street, but it feels like there are some other levers that are giving way, so I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. I would tell you in terms of the levers, the majority of our growth the end of last year and all of this year has been street rate growth. Existing customer rate increases don\u2019t add a lot, but it is almost entirely rate growth. That has been offset slightly by discounts and bad debt has increased dominantly also.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And I guess on the same line of questioning, I know we tend to focus lot on the supply issues, but maybe something on the demand side, because it feels like even your good markets are not just L.A., but overall some of the great markets are becoming just very good and just kind of toning down a notch, is there something that you can point to on the demand side, are customers shopping price more often o is there just less traffic or are there some things that you are seeing out there that is pointing towards just a little bit weaker demand than what we are used to?","Joe Margolis","I think what we are seeing is just the cyclicality of markets. If you \u2013 we did a study, we looked at almost 90 markets over a 10-year period. And one thing you see is that markets are strong and then markets are less strong. And they are not correlated and they move in all different directions. Our number one market for 10-year NOI growth is Chicago, which is now one of our weaker markets. So we fully expect to see markets like Sacramento be very strong for few years and then perhaps be not as strong. One of our markets now that we reported is a weaker market is Boston. Boston is not a market that\u2019s been impacted by a lot of supply, but it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s kind of in that cyclical pattern that we see. So we are very happy to have designed a portfolio that is highly, highly diversified across many, many markets that will smooth out ups and downs of individual markets.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Ki Bim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley, your question please.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. Congrats Spencer on retirement and congrats Joe on the new role. Two quick questions, just on the comments about steady state, can you give us some context, if I look at the last 10 years self-storage same-store NOI is probably in the 4% to 5% same-store NOI range and I am just going to understand that when you say steady-state, given sort of all the changes in technology, etcetera, is that somewhere in between the long-term average and today\u2019s numbers, is it \u2013 can you just give us some sense of what steady state means?","Spencer Kirk","I would tell you, we are reverting back to that historical average of 4% to 5%. And I think as a company that\u2019s obviously our belief, you are going to have times that\u2019s above that, They are not going to be way above. And there is times you are going to be below that and they are not going to be way below. It\u2019s the beauty of self-storage that it is a fairly stable property type.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just on supply and talking to some private operators, it seems like in markets where there was this up-tick in supply, given their performance \u2013 subsequent performance, it seems like some projects are getting either pushed out or delayed and it\u2019s also just taking longer to get new projects started, just given capacity issues in terms of contractors, I am just wondering if you have seen that in any market?","Joe Margolis","Yes. We see that across all markets, that a fairly sizable percentage of planned projects do not get built because of local opposition, increasing construction costs, difficulty getting financing, land costs, whatever it is. But that being said, there are projects being added to the funnel and a good portion of them get \u2013 don\u2019t make it to the funnel, but there are still more projects getting added to the funnel. So I think the factors you talked about, it will slow and moderate the development cycle, but not stop it.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Vikram.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald, your question please.","Gaurav Mehta","Yes. Thanks. A couple of quick ones, number one, for your existing customers, have you seen any pushback from your tenants on rent increases and can you comment on percentage of move-out for rent increases in your portfolio?","Joe Margolis","So we have not seen any changes, if that\u2019s the question. We still have a very small percentage of customers who will actually go get their boxes and move out when they get a rate increase. We continued to \u2013 every time we sent out a rent increase, keep a control group and measure the control groups move-out rate against the folks who got the rate increase. I think about 1% of the people move-out. So there has been no change in that. It\u2019s something we continue to monitor and it proves to us that the rate increase program continues to be valuable.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And the second, you talked about discounts \u2013 higher discounts in the quarter, were there any markets where you had to use more discounts than other?","Spencer Kirk","Any market that\u2019s shown softness in terms of occupancy or rate, we will typically increase the discounts. As we look at the leverage we have to pool, you are going to look first to increase your spend on the web. The last thing that you want to do is decrease your rate. So in terms of magnitude, you will difficultly increase your spend on the web. You will increase your discounts or you will change your rate and you typically want to do them in that order, because of the costs, long-term costs or benefit.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Gaurav.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gwen Clark from Evercore ISI, your question please.","Gwen Clark","Hi, can you give us an update on how you are thinking about valet storage the threat to the industry and then also some color on sites like SpareFoot?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. We have done quite a bit in terms of research on the valet storage, and we don\u2019t see it as an imminent threat. We understand it a lot. We have done deliveries with companies. We have done click-throughs to see if they choose them over us. And right now, based on the way it\u2019s priced, we do not see it as a major threat. The only thing we have is the ability to get into that business fairly quickly. We have the real estate. We have the customer list, so not a huge threat at this time.","Gwen Clark","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on a different note, it looks like Denver was one of the first markets to go negative can you give us an update on how to think about what markets could be next and what would be driving that?","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s tough to predict the future. If you look at a market that has had 15% growth 2 years in a row and had a lot of new supply, I think that it\u2019s probable that, that market is not going to be great next year and you might again\u2026","Gwen Clark","Understood. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Gwen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Burke from Green Street Advisors, your question please.","Ryan Burke","Thank you. Scott, I appreciate the comment in regards to not focusing necessarily on what your share price is today in terms of driving your external growth strategy, but what is that the team looks for that would \u2013 or that will eventually tell you that it\u2019s time to slow \u2013 slow growth from that perspective?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you when things are not accretive anymore. So in other words, what you are paying for a property is greater than your cost of capital. So we are very careful in terms of assessing our cost of equity as well as assessing our cost of debt. And trying to look at that long-term and having realistic growth assumptions. But I think that\u2019s what can cause you bigger problems, pricing stays extremely low.","Ryan Burke","Okay. And you have obviously seen great success on producing this double-digit FFO growth over many consecutive quarters now, do you consider that a hard target internally as you are looking at acquisitions or is that more just an outcome of what you \u2013 what the strategy that you have employed and you are okay with not producing double-digit FFO growth at a certain point in time?","Spencer Kirk","No, we are not okay with not producing \u2013 that\u2019s too many negatives, sorry. Our goal \u2013 we are very focused on producing double-digit FFO growth, both through acquisitions and all the other levers we have to pull that are \u2013 to do that whether that\u2019s as we talked about restructuring our ventures, our management plus platform. We will add over 9,000 units this year through expansions or combats where we have turned 10 by 10 to 5 by 5. So we are very focused on that goal.","Ryan Burke","Okay, thanks. And just wanted to make sure that we sort of round out quantifying the rent growth trends for the quarter, I think what we heard is sort of 6% to 7-ish percent both street rate growth and move-in rate growth, are the increases to your existing customers, have they changed at all?","Spencer Kirk","No, they are still high single-digits.","Ryan Burke","High single. Okay. And then are you able to quantify what the roll-down is for move-out to move-in for the quarter?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. It depends on what we are doing with street rates, but they are typically low to mid single-digits and they can get as bad as high single-digits, right now you are more in low to mid with the fact that you have been pushing your street rates.","Ryan Burke","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender from Wells Fargo, your question please.","Todd Stender","Thanks guys. I just want to get a sense of how you are evaluating your cost of capital and how you are deploying capital at this point in the cycle, can you talk about the three buckets that you invested in, the JV assets, that sounds like they are pretty mature, I think you acquired three properties outside of that in the quarter and then your CofO deals, is there a way to quantify your return expectations side by side with those three?","Scott Stubbs","Well, the question is on one tie [ph]. I think I would tell you we are very focused on the long-term cost of capital. That\u2019s going to take into consideration debt as well as equity and it\u2019s going to be the mix of debt and equity. In terms of returns, we are typically a cap rate buyer. We also consider your replacement costs, we also look at IRRs and we also look at cash on cash yields, because we are long-term holder. I think cash on cash is probably the most relevant one that we focused on rather than just looking at the cap rate today or stabilized cap rate, what\u2019s the return because that equalizes \u2013 if you look at a 7-year cash-on-cash return on a CofO deal, you now can compare that to how is that cash on cash doing acquisition. So I would tell you we are focused on long-term cost of capital, we are focused on cap rates and cash on and cash yield.","Joe Margolis","Yes. The other thing to add is, if you look at those three types of acquisitions, they all serve a different purpose, right. The assets we buy from a joint venture partner that we have managed, we have already maximized performance. There is less upside in those assets. But there is also less risk. We know the inside and out. We know exactly what the performance is, there is already branded. So those are kind of our safest, lowest returning assets. The CofO deals, where we are taking full lease up risk, construction risk and we have the period of dilution that Scott mentioned, those are higher returning type deals in return for taking that lease-up risk. And then the deals we buy on market, they span the globe. There is deals \u2013 our first year cap rate on acquired deals range from 2.7% to 8%. So that just tells you how much juice there is or lease up or value is out there as in those deals. So, those could be anywhere along the spectrum.","Todd Stender","So what are you guys expecting? What\u2019s the cash on cash return for the Pru assets, because it sounds like we are going to see some more JV assets being pulled into Q4? What\u2019s the kind of return expectations there?","Spencer Kirk","So, the deal we just announced with [indiscernible], where we dissolved that joint venture and purchased 23 assets, the forward 12 cap rate on that was a 5.8. So that gives you a sense of that.","Scott Stubbs","Yes. It\u2019s tough to give you the cash on cash yields, because they vary so much depending on lease up, CofO versus bps. I would tell you JV is more like buying the safe annuity and some of the others are more swinging for the fences, much higher returns.","Todd Stender","Great. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Just a follow-up on Todd\u2019s question, just curious what your typical return is for the CofO deals that you are looking at today that are in the pipeline?","Joe Margolis","So, we try to target \u2013 we target 200 basis points over what we believe a stabilized asset \u2013 we would buy stabilized asset for in that market. So, we are looking at stabilized cap rates of the 31 CofOs we have approved this year between 6.5 and 10 and that will give you a 7-year cash on cash between high 5s to 8, all un-levered.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And then could you give us just a snapshot it sounded like SmartShop was a big driver of kind of outsized non-same-store growth of where that portfolio stands today?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. So, SmartStop compared to our underwriting assumptions all year has been outperforming in terms of revenue growth. It continued to outperform in revenue growth. Our problem has been on the expense side, where we have been spending higher than our original projections. In the quarter, the expenses continued to be \u2013 well, didn\u2019t continue, they actually came in right on budget and our revenues continued to be \u2013 continued higher. We actually were about $1.1 million ahead for the quarter for SmartStop alone in NOI.","Juan Sanabria","What\u2019s the occupancy there?","Spencer Kirk","You are just over 90%.","Juan Sanabria","And just one last question, I think it was Joe, correct me if am wrong may have said that on demand valet could have been a driver of maybe some acceleration in New York. Do you guys have any sense of market share in New York or other large metros for the on-demand or valet?","Joe Margolis","We really don\u2019t. Talking to some folks who have large exposure in Manhattan in particular, they had a hypothesis that there maybe \u2013 that business maybe gaining some traction there, but it\u2019s really just a guess at this point.","Juan Sanabria","And any other markets that kind of mimic Manhattan like San Francisco?","Joe Margolis","We haven\u2019t heard that yet.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Juan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Neil Malkin","Hey, guys. And Spencer just wanted to say congrats and it was good working with you. I know everyone else has said that, but wanted to get that in myself.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Neil. I appreciate it.","Neil Malkin","Sure. And then my question \u2013 two questions. One, how many people in the quarter were eligible in your total renter population to receive a renewal?","Spencer Kirk","In terms of how many people are eligible, it\u2019s tough to\u2026.","Neil Malkin","Percentage wise is fine.","Spencer Kirk","Yes, percentage wise, we give about \u2013 was one-twelfth basically, because we are raising rents every month, but we give about 80,000 rental increases every single month.","Neil Malkin","Okay. I just wondered because you do the 5 and 9, so do you think if people are there for\u2026","Spencer Kirk","Yes, some people don\u2019t stay the full year though, so some people yet get that and get both and other people don\u2019t get that. They just get the first. And some people don\u2019t get it.","Neil Malkin","Sorry, so it winds up working to about roughly like saying someone gets one per year because of the churn and people leaving, etcetera?","Spencer Kirk","About 10% of our customers actually get them every single month is where it turns out to be. So it\u2019s slightly higher than one-twelve\u2026","Neil Malkin","Right, okay. And then my last question is on expenses for next year, obviously I know you guys aren\u2019t giving guidance, but would you expect to seeing anymore pressure on expenses just from real estate, number one, because you have more deliveries coming so maybe more price discovery from municipalities. And then number two, as you get more competition you will be spending more on marketing and things along those lines that will hit the expense side?","Spencer Kirk","So I would tell you, from a property tax perspective, it will be above inflation. I mean, the last couple of years we have seen 4% to 6%. We expect that again next year. We hope to be able to grow less than inflation in some of the other areas by some of the things we are doing. So hopefully, that will offset some of it. But in terms of marketing, hopefully as we grow, we will certainly experience of the size and scale benefit. So we hope to keep that somewhere in the inflationary.","Neil Malkin","Thank you, guys.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender from Wells Fargo, your question please.","Todd Stender","Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just back to the migration from a secured balance sheet to the unsecured, does that do anything to your cost of debt, I know you are a nimble borrower on a secured basis, but now on an apples-to-apples basis, do you think that will adjust your cost of debt down, that\u2019s part one. And then part two is do you think that helps your valuation in the stock as you guys kind of move towards a more I would say, modern era REIT?","Spencer Kirk","I would tell you there is a couple of things for us, one is hopefully it decreases our average cost of debt. And then two hopefully, it extends out the average length of maturity. In terms of whether or not that increases the value, I think that will leave that to the investors and the analysts.","Todd Stender","Great. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gwen Clark from Evercore ISI, your question please.","Gwen Clark","Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I think there is some confusion about what a normalized growth means for the sector and for Extra Space, can you try to quantify it a bit more specifically?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. So there are a lot of numbers out there, Gwen. It\u2019s Spencer. And if you look back over the last 10-plus years, it\u2019s hard to get an exact read on this because you got some occupancy gains and other things mixed in there. But some numbers that I have used in the past for the 10-year average for this group, this storage sector, operator specifically, the NOI growth has been about 5.3%. That\u2019s a very healthy report card in the world of REITs by any measure. Extra Space has done a little bit better than that. We have averaged about 6.7% over that 10-plus year period and the last quarter we just reported was 7.8%. We are still way above the historical norm. And you can pull out some of occupancy and other things that might be inflating some of those numbers, but my personal opinion is not only today, but going forward storage will be amongst the best, if not the best performing asset class. So yes, we have seen some deceleration. I am personally a little surprised at the negativity, but I have a high degree of confidence that storage and Extra Space, in particular are going to put up excellent results by any measure in the world of REITs and I don\u2019t think any of that changes. So reverting to maybe more normal historical trends, it\u2019s still impressive.","Gwen Clark","Okay, so that\u2019s helpful. And it seems like there is clearly some benefit from occupancy in more recent years at TI, if you were to try and take out the occupancy gain and then take out the benefit from the TI, are probably kind of reached peak penetration, do you have an idea of what the revenue growth would be like?","Spencer Kirk","I would have to get back with you on that. For me to shoot off the hip won\u2019t be the right thing to do.","Gwen Clark","Okay, understood. Thank you very much.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Gwen.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Gwen.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I would like to hand the program back to Spencer Kirk, CEO for any further remarks.","Spencer Kirk","Again, this is very heartfelt. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with each of you. Thank you for making the last 7.5 years so enjoyable. I appreciate your support and interest in Extra Space and we look forward to next quarter\u2019s call.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation."],"8750":["Extra Space Storage, Inc.

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jeff Norman, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Andrew. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited, supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, Thursday, November 2, 2017. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I just want to say how impressed and humbled I am by the sacrifices our teammates made in Florida and Houston and Puerto Rico. They went the extra effort to take care of our customers, to take care of our stores and most importantly, maybe to take care of each other as family. I am very proud to be associated with a company that has teammates like this. I want to say that all of our employees are safe and we didn\u2019t have any injuries in any of our stores, and I am very grateful for that. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to say that. And I will start my remarks.","Throughout the third quarter, we had strong execution and posted another solid result. Same-store revenue growth was 4.8%, NOI growth was 5.5% and FFO as adjusted growth was 10.8%. If we exclude our properties in Houston and Florida from same-store totals, revenue growth for the 640 stores not impacted by hurricanes actually improved 20 basis points to 5.0%, and NOI increased 40 basis points to 5.9%. So, our outperformance this quarter was driven by strong operating results produced by our diversified portfolio, not by one-time events. Houston did grow occupancy and is well-positioned for growth going forward, but there was no benefit to revenue and NOI in the third quarter. Florida received some benefit to occupancy and revenue growth in the quarter, but we don\u2019t expect the long-term benefit to be significant. We have provided additional details related to the performance of these markets in our supplemental financial information posted on the website.","On our last call, we announced that Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, decided to internalize management, and as planned, its 94 stores left Extra Space\u2019s system effective October 1. As of today, we have added 121 properties to our managed platform this year and we expect to add approximately 30 more between now and year end for a projected 2017 total of 151 stores. From a store count perspective, this offsets the loss of the Strategic Storage Trust properties. Further, our 2018 pipeline is the largest we have had in our history, with over 100 stores approved to be added to the platform already. Third-party management will continue to be a growth driver for Extra Space.","Finally, I would like to provide an update on the 36 store portfolio that we have marketed for a joint venture recapitalization. The transaction is now under contract, debt financing has been arranged, and we plan to close by December 1, 2017. Proceeds will be reinvested in other properties through 10\/31 exchanges, which we have under contract. We will be prepared to discuss additional details after this transaction closes.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Joe. Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.13 per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger than expected property and tenant insurance results. We recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to property damage and cleanup from the hurricanes. We recorded an additional $2.3 million for tenant insurance claims for a total of $4.4 million related to the hurricane. These losses have been added back to FFO as adjusted to more accurately reflect our run rate.","Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 93.9%, a 140 basis point increase. The growth in occupancy wasn\u2019t just the result of the hurricanes. Same-store occupancy growth in non-hurricane markets was up 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter, we were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single-digits and we continue our existing customer rate increase program without changes.","During the third quarter and subsequent to the end of the quarter, a number of our acquisitions closed or went under contract. As of today, we have closed $140 million in wholly-owned acquisitions and invested another $50 million in stores held in joint ventures. We also bought out our joint venture partners\u2019 interest in several other properties, adding another $20 million in investment for a year-to-date total investment of approximately $175 million. We have another $240 million under contract and scheduled to close by year end. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.","We funded our acquisitions and loan maturities with draws on our credit facility and the closing of our 10-year $300 million private placement that we announced last quarter. The funding is part \u2013 the funding of this private placement is part of our strategy to lengthen our average debt term, increase our fixed rate debt ratio and expand the size of our unsecured pool. Based on performance year-to-date, we raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5%. Year-to-date, expenses have been below budget and we have lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.25% to 1.75%, increasing our annual NOI guidance to 5.75% to 6.5%. As a result of the Q3 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.32 to $4.35 per share. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our C of O stores and additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.15. We are accepting some short-term dilution in exchange for outsized long-term value creation.","I will now turn the call back to Joe.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Scott. With most of the year behind us, 2017 has shaped up well and we are pleased that our sector leading performance has allowed us to increase guidance each quarter. The fundamentals in storage are healthy. Demand has been steady resulting in growth in occupancy and rental rates. As expected, the rate of our revenue growth is moderated since the beginning of the year, but the rate of the moderation is flattening. We are confident that our systems are well equipped to maximize revenue in the current environment and our team has demonstrated a track record of consistent execution.","We also have some headwinds, which are unchanged from the previous two quarters. High seller expectations continue in this competitive acquisitions environment and several submarkets have felt the impact of new development. However, these challenges present opportunities. The competitive acquisition market allowed us to put our 36 property portfolio under contract at attractive pricing and the new development has led to the acquisition of purpose-built assets that will create significant long-term value for our shareholders while enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio. New supply has also resulted in significant growth in our managed portfolio, which generates an income stream for us today, increases our footprint and provides a meaningful acquisition pipeline for the future.","Our three-pronged ownership structure positions us to continue to grow efficiently in the current or any other economic climate. This external growth platform, together with our sector leading same-store performance and our efficient balance sheet, all contribute to meaningful and consistent FFO growth and to our ultimate goal of maximizing the long-term return on our investors\u2019 capital.","Let\u2019s now turn the time over to Jeff to start the Q&A session.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Joe. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows we will address follow-on questions, once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","And with that, we will turn it over to Andrew to start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Gaurav Mehta","Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions, I guess. You mentioned 3Q was ahead of your expectations and you raised your same-store revenue guidance for \u201817. I was wondering in terms of markets, which market outperformed your expectation in the quarter?","Joe Margolis","Yes. The West Coast markets in general continued to perform very, very well for us. Orlando and Las Vegas and the West Palm have also been the strong markets for us.","Gaurav Mehta","And I guess, on the expense side, what\u2019s driving the expense guidance growth for \u201817?","Scott Stubbs","So the fourth quarter looks like its elevated expenses, but it really relates more to a tough comp. Last year in the fourth quarter, we had negative expense growth, right around negative 2%. So year-over-year is really the difference.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all for me.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Gaurav.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gwen Clark with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Gwen Clark","Can you talk about where street rent trends \u2013 sorry, can you hear me?","Joe Margolis","We can hear you now, Gwen.","Gwen Clark","Hey, sorry, about that. My phone just came off the headset. Can you guys talk about where street rent trends are today and then where move-in rates are? And I guess what you guys call your effective rate?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So throughout the third quarter, our street rates were about 5%, ahead of where they were the prior year and our achieved rate was about 3% and moving into October, those continue strong.","Gwen Clark","Okay. And then I guess on that piece, I know promotions as a percentage of revenue seems to have been trending up as of early September. Can you talk about where that is today and how that fares relative to your expectations?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So discounts as a percentage of revenue were just under 4% and we continue to discount rentals about 55% of our rentals receive some type of discount in the third quarter. Most of those, the most popular discount continues to be first month free and we continue to use discounting as a way to move occupancy. You can move rate, you can move discounting or you can move your marketing spend and right now, we are probably a little more focused on the discounting side.","Gwen Clark","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And sorry again about the headset\/","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Gwen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Todd Thomas","Yes, hi, thanks. First, can you provide an October occupancy for us and where that is year-over-year?","Scott Stubbs","So, our occupancy year-over-year at the end of the quarter was 140 basis points. We have actually seen it come down a little bit, closer to the 1% delta at the end of October. That\u2019s primarily a result of some of the move outs we have seen in Florida as the elevated occupancy around the hurricanes has kind of gone away.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then the increase in rental activity in the quarter, rentals were up 7 \u2013 a little over 7%, is that more inbound hits or is it driven by a higher conversion rate? What\u2019s the mix like there?","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s a little of everything. And as Scott pointed out earlier, we are constantly playing with the various tools we have to maximize revenue and we are able to increase occupancy by using those tools this quarter.","Scott Stubbs","You also saw more activity with the hurricanes, Todd.","Todd Thomas","Okay. How do you measure your conversion rate or how would you quantify that? Is there something that you can share with us around what your conversion rate looks like?","Joe Margolis","We don\u2019t share that information, Todd, sorry.","Todd Thomas","Alright, thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, thanks for the time. Just on the same-store revenue as you commented that you thought that the pace of growth was decelerating, but the fourth quarter implies kind of at the midpoint of your guidance, 3, 4. Is that where you see things, I know you have kind of had a history of beating and raising or is that \u2013 is there some conservatism built in there? That will be my first question.","Scott Stubbs","Yes. Juan, so the fourth quarter does imply some decelerations. The number you give is kind of your number, I would tell you just kind of depending on where you pick in the range, but I think if you look sequentially from the second to the third, the average 4.8% after starting \u2013 ending the second quarter at 5.2%, somewhere in that quarter, you were below 4.8%. So, I think you see some deceleration in the fourth quarter, but it has moderated significantly.","Juan Sanabria","And when both \u2013 and can you just talk a little bit about SmartStop and where the occupancy is there versus the rest of the portfolio, because I think it still contributed to a fair amount of the relative performance this past quarter when you thought that, that be kind of flat in the second half of the year?","Joe Margolis","Yes. So, it\u2019s within 50 basis points in terms of occupancy compared to the rest of the portfolio. So, it\u2019s really right on top of the rest of the portfolio. We started the year thinking that it would add on average for the year about 50 basis points of benefit, the change in same-store pool. Now, we are probably closer to 75 basis points on average. Our thinking was it would start the year at 100 basis points and be zero by the end and it\u2019s probably on the higher end of the 50 to 75 basis point range.","Juan Sanabria","And so sorry, just to clarify the occupancy is 50 basis points below the rest of the portfolio? Is there anything...","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s actually \u2013 so it\u2019s very close and it\u2019s going to be market-by-market. What I am saying is, it\u2019s within 50 basis points, but it\u2019s a combination of rates as well as occupancy that have provided the benefit from the change in pool.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. Your line is open.","George Hoglund","Hey, good morning guys. Just one question on the acquisition environment, just what are you guys seeing out there in terms of portfolios in the market? And then also, are you seeing any change in the competitive landscape for acquisitions in terms of how is the appetite from a private equity? Has there been any noticeable change there?","Joe Margolis","Sure. So, transaction volumes are down significantly. The last statistics I saw was 63% between 2016 and today through the end of the third quarter. So, the volume overall is down significantly that we believe the quality of most of what we see on the market in terms of product quality or markets is lesser than what we would like to chase. So, it\u2019s just a very difficult environment. And as you suggest, there is significant interest in private equity in self-storage. I think that even with our reduced numbers from prior years, we still look a lot better than other real estate asset classes and people are looking to get exposure to self-storage and we are seeing new private equity money compete in this space.","George Hoglund","Okay. And then just following up on that, as given the amount of private equity money looking to get into the space and given where some of the stocks have gone over the past 12 to 24 months, where do you think is a likelihood of large scale M&A in the sector?","Joe Margolis","Yes, I am not sure I could really predict large-scale M&A.","George Hoglund","Okay, thanks.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, George.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Neil Malkin","Hey, guys. Good morning. In some of the other sectors, we are seeing just the lending environment tightening give way to the ability for the REITs who have better access to capital to provide that mezz part of the capital stack. Have you seen more people come to you looking for mezz financing and are you considering that just given sort of kind of the outdated supply and the less dilutive impact of that versus C of O lease-up?","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s a really good question and we thought there was going to be an opportunity in mezz and frankly, we thought there would be a void in the capital markets there would be a way we could attractively place capital given the current acquisition environment. For us, we would be unwilling to do it on a development property. I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I have to take over some broken development property. But we thought maybe for people who had under-leveraged assets with long-term debt on it, there might be an opportunity. We made some inquiries in the market, and we\u2019re wrong. We just \u2013 we haven\u2019t found that to be an opportunity, but we will continue to try to be creative and find ways to invest investor\u2019s capital at good risk-adjusted returns.","Neil Malkin","Okay. And last one for me, just given the sentiment and nature of the environment for stabilized assets and pricing. Are you kind of alluding to you, you are getting more comfortable with your C of O pipeline? Do you see that increasing? And if so, what size relative to the enterprise are you comfortable with this part of the cycle?","Joe Margolis","Two good questions. So first of all, we have an internal governor on the amount of dilution. Our C of O pipeline and value-add stores, they were willing to accept. And we monitor that every quarter and we do our best to stay within it. One way, if we see attractive deals that we can continue to participate but stay within that dilution governor is to execute deals in joint ventures. And I think if you look at our C of O pipeline, there is a good number of the deals, are executed in joint ventures. We still believe there are opportunities in C of O in development, although they are fewer and far between. We approved in 2016, 38 C of O transactions and we have approved so far this year 15, 7 of which are in joint ventures. So we are about half of the pace that we were a year prior, but we have never out of the market, and to the extent someone has a submarket of location that makes sense \u2013 costs that makes sense, we will continue to participate.","Neil Malkin","Thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to dig into sort of the West Coast markets a bit more, maybe if you could compare and contrast LA and San Francisco a bit, LA did seem to decelerate quite a bit where San Francisco sort of was more stable. Just wondering what are your expectations over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months for those West Coast markets and if you could just compare the two?","Joe Margolis","So de-acceleration is relative and we are still growing rents in Los Angeles at over 8%. So, that\u2019s a pretty good clip and it\u2019s real hard to think you can sustain over a long period of time higher rent growths. I think those markets are going to continue to be very strong, because we just don\u2019t see very much new development. It\u2019s very difficult to get things built in those markets. There is some exceptions, Irvine and San Jose, but overall, we expect those to continue to be very strong markets.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just on supply sort of now coming towards the end of \u201817 into \u201818, any updated thoughts on sort of the pipeline and deliveries. It seems to be there is a couple of different figures out there now, I am just wondering what your thoughts are and when you expect to see the peak impact from this in the markets where you are seeing supply?","Joe Margolis","So, earlier this year, we are asked that question on overall number, we said 600 to 800. If we have to give an update now, we would say we are probably towards the lower end of that range. But I want to caution as think I have in the past, overall number and the focus on markets, I think you\u2019d be misplaced because the most important thing is where these stores are being built. So for example, Dallas is kind of the poster child of a lot of development, possibly overdevelopment. But Dallas\u2019 several markets, our stores in South Dallas are growing revenue at 10%, where North and East Dallas are slightly negative. So it\u2019s real hard to say how many stores are being delivered in the country, what\u2019s the overall number or even how many stores are being delivered in a market, because it depends where those stores are being built.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, good. Thanks, guys.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Vikram.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","This is Ki Bin. I am sure you figured that out. So, it seems like the results are just trending a little bit better than guidance, obviously. If you had to look at all the variables that you are always managing to drive occupancy, drive revenue, what is the surprising factor that came in better than expected?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you, occupancy has been better than expected as well as we have been able to have a little bit more pricing power than I think we expected early on in the year.","Ki Bin Kim","So when you say occupancy, if you can dig in a little bit deeper, is that because different ways of advertising is the private market getting a similar uplift in your MSAs or are you taking share just wondering if you could provide more color on that?","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s hard for us to get really good statistics on the private market, but I will tell you we believe in our platform. We believe in our systems that we can stick the most people into the funnel and convert the most people out of there. And we are never happy with where we are. We are always going to try to improve it, but right now, the system is working pretty well.","Ki Bin Kim","And when you say the system, how much of it is truly your algorithms and your pricing systems outputting something and you guys do it versus something more subjective that you might do during the quarter?","Joe Margolis","So our machines, our algorithms work in conjunction with our people. We don\u2019t turn the machine on and just let it run. There are situations that a machine doesn\u2019t know the road in front closed or whatever, and so it\u2019s a combination of our people on the ground and in our data science and revenue management teams and our algorithms.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Ki Bin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Todd Stender","Hi, thanks guys. Can we hear details on the properties you acquired in the quarter, specifically locations and maybe stabilization occupancies, that kind of stuff?","Scott Stubbs","Combination of a few things we did, Certificate of Occupancy in Georgia, we bought one in Virginia, we bought one in North Carolina, one in Florida and then one joint venture in Massachusetts. Majority of those are lease up or Certificate of Occupancy deals.","Todd Stender","And Scott, can you go through your underwriting assumptions, I guess if you are willing to take one on balance versus one in a joint venture, if you go through maybe the growth \u2013 annual growth rates and maybe going in yields?","Scott Stubbs","So, we underwrite all stores the same regardless of whether we are going to offer it to a joint venture partner or not and their question to us would be sometimes it\u2019s the size of the store, sometimes the wholly-owned return is unacceptable to us, but the joint venture return, which is enhanced, is acceptable to us, exposure to a market, different factors such as that.","Joe Margolis","And then sometimes just managing the dilution, quite frankly.","Todd Stender","And you guys have an updated dilutive number or dilution number, maybe an annualized number?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So, in terms of Certificate of Occupancy, we have got $0.07 in our current number and then $0.08 related to stores that will stabilize at a number higher than our current earnings. So, $0.15 total of additional earnings from those C of O or from those lease-up properties.","Joe Margolis","The other factor frankly to give a complete answer is sometimes, developers bring us stores that they will only do on a joint venture basis where we don\u2019t have the access to the transaction unless we are willing to do a joint venture.","Todd Stender","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Joe Margolis","Sure. Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","So, just a quick one, when you guys had the C of O deals that you are doing this year, is probably half the pace, are other players picking up that slack or is it just less getting done?","Joe Margolis","I would say there is less getting done.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. That was it for me. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Margolis.","Joe Margolis","Thank you everyone for your interest today in Extra Space and look forward to seeing you shortly. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"8551":["Extra Space Storage Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Director of Investor Relations, Jeff Norman. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Melory. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s third quarter 2015 conference call.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Hello, everyone. For 2015, the top two priorities at Extra Space are operational excellence and seamless integration of new stores on to our operating platform. Year-to-date, our focus on these priorities is paying off.","Operationally, we had a record breaking quarter. We excelled in producing same-store revenue growth of 9.9%, NOI growth of 12.6% and a peak occupancy of 94.9%. This enabled us to achieve FFO as adjusted growth of 12.5% on top of last year\u2019s growth of 26.3%. This marks 20 consecutive quarters of double-digit increases. Perform at this level while simultaneously preparing to close a large and complex transaction showcases the depth of our operation\u2019s team and our ability to execute.","In the first three quarters, we added 82 wholly-owned stores to our platform. On October 1st, we closed our acquisition of SmartStop and integrated an additional 165 properties. This brings our store count to 1,335, all branded Extra Space. Preparations to have these stores began months earlier. Thanks to the work of our team and a cooperation of SmartStop, we were able to review financial systems, train employees, plan technology conversions, and evaluate CapEx needs well ahead of closing. There is still work to be done but we hit the ground running. This is the right acquisition at the right time for our shareholders.","And I\u2019d now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Spencer. Last night we reported FFO of $0.81 per share for the quarter. Excluding costs associated with acquisitions and non-cash interest, FFO as adjusted was $0.81 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily the result of better than expected property performance. This was partially offset by higher than forecasted income tax as well as an increase in interest expense as we accumulated the funds for the SmartStop acquisition.","Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers, increased occupancy and lower discount. Our top performing market year-to-date include Atlanta, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Tampa\/St. Pete, all with double-digit revenue growth. Our platform continues to maximize results in this favorable operating environment.","During the quarter, we acquired one store in Maryland for $6.1 million and we acquired a certificate of occupancy store with a JV partner for $5.4 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired 124 stores for just over $1.3 billion. All but two of these stores were part of the SmartStop portfolio. We currently have 9 operating stores under contract for $82 million. Six of these acquisitions totaling $53 million are scheduled to close before the end of the year. In addition, we have another 17 certificate of occupancy stores under contract. The total purchase price of these stores is $177 million of which $26 million is expected to close in 2015.","We were active in the capital markets in the quarter. We filed a $400 million ATM under which we sold 31 million. We also issued 575 million in exchangeable senior notes and used a portion of the note proceeds to repurchase 164 million of an existing tranche of exchangeable notes. The October 1st, SmartStop acquisition as well as our strong year-to-date results require revisions to our guidance. Our full year FFO guidance is $2.69 to $2.72 per share. Our guidance includes dilution from a certificate of occupancy deals, acquisitions that operate below our portfolio average and $45 million in transactional and debt elimination costs related to the SmartStop acquisition they will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Our FFOs adjusted increased to $3.10 to $3.13 per share which removes the non-cash interest and non-recurring transactional cost.","I will now turn the time back over to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Scott. Fundamentals for the sector continue to be strong. New supply which is still muted will not be a factor in the next couple of years. We expect occupancy to remain at all time highs which should allow us to further increase rates for new and existing customers. Only time will tell if pricing power will remain as strong as it is today, but the fundamentals support the positive outlook. The acquisitions environment will continue to be extremely competitive and Extra Space will remain a disciplined buyer. We\u2019re focused on accretive acquisitions and maximizing shareholder value. I\u2019m pleased with the outstanding performance of our team. We have executed at a high level across the entire organization.","Now let\u2019s turn the time back to Jeff to start the Q&A session.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limit it to two. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we will turn it over to Melory to start a Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Becker with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jeff Becker","My first question is on the integration of SmartStop. I know it\u2019s only been a month but any lessons learned you could share with us on the underwriting of the deal, positive or negative and maybe specifically on some of the new markets you\u2019ve entered?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, in terms of underwriting and performance, I would tell you it\u2019s probably too early to really comment on that. What I would say is the properties are performing right where we were expecting them to perform when we put this under contract several months ago. So, the occupancy and the revenue performance when we took them over, was right where we expected.","Spencer Kirk","With regards to the markets, one of the really nice things about this transaction is in many markets, we picked up even greater footprint which is going to give us greater presence digitally on the internet and allow us to further drive occupancy and rate at those stores. So, it\u2019s coming together very well. We are pleased.","Jeff Becker","So too soon to tell if the underwriting was too conservative; it seems like the integration has gone very well, as you said, and then acquired properties performing better than expected within the first let\u2019s say once and other deal.","Scott Stubbs","Everything is right on course; it\u2019s too early to tell what the trend is but we are very satisfied with how we started.","Jeff Becker","And then I had just have one other question on the 17 certificate of occupancy under contract, I guess can you provide a little bit more details on that; where those came from, existing markets, some of these markets?","Scott Stubbs","So, I would tell you that they are similar markets to where we have been in the past. I mean they\u2019re all markets where we currently have properties, they range from Boston to Phoenix; so they\u2019re across the U.S. These are local developers, most of them we have relationships with. The majority of them, we feel like are going to be very good acquisitions and are -- as we\u2019ve underwritten them -- we have underwritten them with we would say certainly prudent, lease-up assumptions, meaning we\u2019ve kind of gone to our historical average. We recognize that the market won\u2019t always be what is today. Some of these C of O deals are out into 2017, even out into 2018. And so we have been prudent in our underwriting assumptions and we expect them to perform well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vikram Malhotra","I just had a kind of bigger picture question. You referenced that supply should not be an issue for the next couple of years. I think we were sourcing maybe 16, now maybe 17. You started off same-store NOI kind of in this 8% range and now clearly you\u2019re 10% to 11%. Looking forward what are you sort of -- what metric would you say can continue at a very strong pace, if you were to sort of pick one and what are you most worried about?","Scott Stubbs","Vikram, it\u2019s Scott. So, obviously we are not ready to give 2016 guidance, maybe just kind of commenting on where we are today and where we can kind of see things going. I would tell you we\u2019ve had a very good year. I think that we have had outstanding performance. If I look into the next year, I think it\u2019s going to be very good. I think that our occupancy can\u2019t continue to have a 200 basis-point delta year-over-year; our discounts, we can\u2019t continue to push them lower year after year but I do think we will have some pricing power going into next year and it will be a very good year still.","Vikram Malhotra","And just one clarification, so, on that pricing power, you had very solid growth. Can you just sort of give us a bit more color what was the price increase in terms of street rates, how much they grew, and then the price increase to existing customers?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So, our existing customers, we continue to increase them in the high single digit. In terms of the pricing, our prices to -- and Street rate, it depends on the time of the year. During the summer months we saw 8% growth. So, we continue to push on those. If you look at waterfall and where our growth came from, our growth came about just over 200 basis points in occupancy, about 50 basis points from discounts, and the rest came from rate, primarily from new customers coming in the door.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open","Todd Thomas","Just first question following up on rents and then price increases, if I think about your portfolio overall generating rental income growth of 10% in the quarter, some markets obviously well above that. Just given the churn you see in your portfolio and the time it takes to re-tenant space when customers move out, that suggests to me that you are increasing rents well above 10% across the portfolio. You just mentioned that you are increasing rents to existing customers in the high single digits and even in the peak season street rents were only up 8%. So, I\u2019m just sort of curious, what am I missing that the blended overall portfolio rental income growth in the quarter was 10%.","Scott Stubbs","One of the things that happened is we actually have some negative churn that takes place. So depending on the time of year, our negative churn is typically mid-single-digits but it could go higher than that, depending on what we\u2019re doing with rates. So if someone moves in, in the summer where there are peak rates and then we drop the prices in the fall, if someone moves out, you have a negative churn. So that\u2019s one of the things that I would tell you, just in doing the simple math you\u2019re missing. The other one is raising our existing customers high single digits but we did that last year. So year-over-year, it\u2019s really not generating a lot of lift to our income.","Todd Thomas","I guess both of those actually sound like they be headwinds to rental income growth; is that right? Is that what you\u2019re trying to say with that? So, if someone moves in, in the summer at a higher rent during the summer, then they move out and you replace that with someone in the fall or in the winter at a lower rent and same thing with sort of the net increase to existing customers, you\u2019re saying that the churn causes that to be lower. But I\u2019m wondering how the blended overall rental income growth in the quarter was 10% when -- it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re increasing rents to anybody 10% or more. Street rates were up during the peak 8% and existing customer rent increases are less than 10%.","Scott Stubbs","So 200 basis points to 250 basis points on occupancy, you get a 0.5% of discount, so that\u2019s 3%. You then get the rest from rate. So, if you\u2019re pushing your existing customer\u2019s high single digits and you did that last year, maybe slightly more this year, you get a little bit from that. And then we pushed street rates this year 7% to 8%.","Todd Thomas","And then my second question just regarding the C of O deals, curious how big that pipeline will get. During the last cycle you had about $300 million development pipeline, obviously the size of the Company was much smaller and it\u2019s much larger today, but just curious where you see that pipeline growing? Do you think you\u2019ll get back to $300 million or even higher?","Spencer Kirk","As you think about a C of O pipeline, the governor for us is dilution, and we\u2019ve set a target of about 3% of FFO as what we\u2019re willing to tolerate. And depending on whether we do those C of O deals just by ourselves or with the JV partner can affect that calculation. So obviously, we would like to do nice new properties in as many core markets as we can. It\u2019s a competitive market and we have a dilution threshold that we want to be very disciplined, so that we don\u2019t go backwards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. ","Todd Stender","Can you provide some fundamental data points for the operating properties, or the one you acquired in Q3, you also have some under contract that you\u2019re expecting to acquire in Q4, just seeing that these are stabilized and any details you can provide?","Spencer Kirk","Most of the properties we\u2019re looking at stabilized cap rate in the mid-6s, your year one cap rate is usually going to be slightly below that. Some of these properties have a little bit of upside but not that significant.","Todd Stender","But occupancy or rental rates, anything, any context you can provide with those. ","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s both. And it will depend a little bit on the properties. So for instance that one we bought in the quarter had more rate growth potential as well as a little bit of occupancy, going forward, some of the other properties we\u2019re looking at buying have a combination of rate and occupancy and then others just have rate growth for opportunities.","Todd Stender","That\u2019s helpful, Scott. And then -- go ahead, sorry. ","Scott Stubbs","I said it really depends on the property and the market.","Todd Stender","And just switching gears to the third party management. We used to talk about it a lot more often, it seems like it\u2019s been overshadowed by your good fundamentals, definitely you\u2019re entering into C of O deals. Just wanted to get a sense of how much the third-party management pipeline that provides you guys with acquisition opportunities; how much of that is still in place?","Spencer Kirk","It still is the prime reason we\u2019re in the business, Todd, to create off market acquisition pipeline. We haven\u2019t made a lot of noise about it, but we added 43 managed assets on the SmartStop acquisition, and by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have grown that pool by more than a 100 assets. So for us, the strategic opportunity that it presents and we continue to buy from that portfolio that we manage. We also get economies of scale and the tenant insurance, and the power of spending more on the internet in those respective markets. So, it continues to be a very important part of our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. ","George Hoglund","I just had one question on the outperformance relative to the peers on a same-store NOI basis. I mean it\u2019s been pretty substantial this year. I\u2019m just wondering what do you guys think the driver of that is. I know a part of it can be just how you guys determine the same-store pool relative to the peers, but what also you attribute your outperformance to?","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s tough to comment on their results. I would tell you we\u2019ve put information in our supplementals, breaking out our current pool versus our last year\u2019s pool. But I would tell you, both pools have performed. I think that we\u2019d like to think that we have the best mousetrap out there that we have -- we\u2019re most aggressive on the internet, we have the best revenue management systems. But it\u2019s tough to comment on how we compare to them.","Spencer Kirk","George, it\u2019s Spencer, if I could just make a comment, because this continues to come up. We have not changed our same-store definition in over a decade. We\u2019ve been consistent. And I can tell you in Q3, the same-store properties that have been added in which were not primarily lease-up, but rather just properties that we acquired, provided an uplift of 80 basis points on revenue and 110 basis points on the NOI. So, if you subtract that out we\u2019re still very pleased with what our properties are producing, our platform enables us to do, and probably most importantly what our team is executing on. I think it\u2019s a combination of people, platform and properties that have allowed us to produce the results that we\u2019ve produced.","Todd Stender","And then just one more, in terms of markets where you may be seeing -- or are you seeing in any markets somewhat of a pushback on the rates where you may be seeing a little bit more of occupancy decline or are you really seeing that anywhere?","Scott Stubbs","So, even our worst markets we\u2019re still seeing 5% growth. So, I think that it\u2019s healthy across the U.S. Markets are somewhat cyclical, some are better than others. I would tell you, our worst markets are probably Chicago and maybe Washington D.C. but they\u2019ve been very strong in past years and they\u2019re still experiencing 5% growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. ","Ki Bin Kim","So, maybe looking forward, not asking for guidance but we look at the same-store revenue composition this quarter is around 10% and you said 250 came from occupancy and lower promotions. If we assume that doesn\u2019t happen again, just on a go forward basis, what are the couple of factors that you look at to fee -- can you just go to 7.5 or is that pretty much how we hit the feeling in terms of growth rate and maybe what has to happen in the economy or population or own prices or things like that that can change that, move that needle positive or negative on that number?","Spencer Kirk","First of all, we will push rate on both existing and new customers as hard as we can. We don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. There might be another 100 basis points on occupancy. The overall health of the economy obviously will be a big determinant. But as we look at 2016, as Scott said, our expectation is our results are going to go from phenomenal to maybe just really good. And we\u2019ll have to see how the year transpires. But I don\u2019t see any disruptive element on the horizon with regards to new supply for the next couple of years which I already commented on. And I only see us getting more powerful and potent in the digital world, particularly with our mobile strategy. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest wisely and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to drive optimal performance from these assets.","Ki Bin Kim","Have you seen any notable change in customer move out activity based on the rental rates that you\u2019re pushing through from previous cycle?","Spencer Kirk","No, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Rowe [ph] with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to ask you -- I know you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times that you don\u2019t see new supply as a big issue over the next couple of years. But when you look at -- just sort of basing this on some commentary from some brokers we\u2019ve spoken to that it\u2019s actually harder to get lending for new supply in smaller markets than it is for bigger markets. I was just wondering if you see that at all and maybe just the tenure of lending in general of the space as people try to. I would think there got to be a fair amount of capital but looking to get into this industry and for some reason it\u2019s not able to be put to work and just wondering if you can maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing on the ground level?","Scott Stubbs","From what we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s hard to comment a lot on financing just because we\u2019re not out there looking for it. I think well capitalized developers are going to be able to get loans, obviously better markets, it\u2019s going to be better but it also probably affects your returns. Your returns in New York City are going to be less than your returns in Dallas you would expect. The other thing that\u2019s happening is land prices, I think our pricing some people out of certain markets we have not seen anything substantial out of Southern California, out of San Francisco, out of Seattle, some of these markets where it\u2019s difficult, everybody is competing for the same piece of land. So from our perspective, we are seeing some new construction. It\u2019s more in the markets like Denver, Dallas, Atlanta, South Florida, even some in New York City, but from our perspective, we don\u2019t see it across the whole U.S., we see certain pockets with some. And we do expect it to come with the returns of the properties. But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be a tighter wave of new construction.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then can you just talk about the average length of stay; is that continuing to lengthen out?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s about the same, there might be a very, very slight uptick on the length of stay, but it\u2019s in very stable suite.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Gaurav Mehta","Yes, thank you good afternoon. Just a quick one on the lease-up period. You have a few stores that are in their operations now. I was hoping if you can comment on the impact of technology that you\u2019re seeing on the time it\u2019s taking to lease-up those stores?","Scott Stubbs","So, we are seeing quicker lease-ups at our C of O stores. It\u2019s probably a combination of technology as well as no new supply. In our supplemental package, page 23, we show the details and kind of where the occupancy is for those stores. We are doing tests on our store to see if you can move the needle in terms of marketing spend, in terms of rates, but overall typically, we\u2019re going to go into the market with lower prices and try to be as aggressive as we can to fill them up as quickly as possible.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And following up on the construction financing, is that the only reason you are seeing an increased interest from merchant builders and other developers to bring C of O deals to you guys, the lack of constructing financing or something else going as well?","Scott Stubbs","So with them bringing C of O deals to us, clearly they are getting some type of financing in the interim. I\u2019m guessing most of them have some type of construction loan and then potentially this helps as far as the takeout. The other thing that\u2019s changed in today\u2019s cycle for a lot of these developers is it used to be that they would build the property, they\u2019d open it up, they\u2019d take out a yellow page, they\u2019d operate it themselves. I think with the sophistication now of the larger players, that\u2019s becoming more and more difficult. It\u2019s difficult to compete on the internet for a small operator. Many of them are coming to the big players to have them manage those properties or at least sell them at C of O.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.","John Pawlowski","Thank you. The 19 Harrison Street properties saw outsized acceleration of revenue and NOI growth this quarter, could you provide some color on what drove this and whether anything has changed operationally now that these are wholly-owned?","Scott Stubbs","Nothing is changed operationally; I would tell you it\u2019s just timing on those properties. There is nothing significant that\u2019s changed if I recall right. I think those properties revenue wise are operating very similar to many of our existing properties.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Hughes","Looking at 61 [ph] stores that are added to same-store, you may well increase NOI there by pretty impressive amount this year, I something well ahead of 20% the first nine months. Could you just talk about the contribution from those assets versus the 50 basis points guidance at the beginning of the year, and then maybe looking ahead could we expect the similar boost from those properties that get added next year?","Scott Stubbs","So, if you look at page 18 of our supplemental that actually compares the last year\u2019s 442 pool to this year\u2019s 503. And in the third quarter, they had it 80 basis points to change in pool and then 100 basis points year-to-date. I would tell you that that is a little bit of anomaly. I think that we would expect a small bump from next year\u2019s changing pool but nothing like we\u2019ve seen this year.","Jonathan Hughes","And then lastly kind of a broader question, I am anxious to hear your thoughts about [indiscernible] on-demand storage services in some urban markets like New York, Boston and D.C., do you see these as competitors to your business, or do you see them as complementary where they may actually in rent units facilities you currently own the store there been?","Spencer Kirk","Lots of questions in there Jonathan, [indiscernible] service, it\u2019s obviously something we\u2019re looking at. Right now I\u2019m aware of several dozen players that are all buying to prove this product concept. One of the things that I do know is with over 1300 stores scattered across the U.S., we\u2019re in a really good position to be part of the solution. And this is one where we are keeping our options open, seeing how things kind of shake out. We\u2019ve had numerous discussions and it\u2019s something that is being incubated. Now whether it turns out to be a significant part of -- what happens when people looking for a solution for storage, only time will tell. But I can tell you, it\u2019s not something that we are ignoring, we are very keenly interested in the urban markets, where you have small units in these major markets. And we think that it could have a place, but the piece of this is much like the pick-up and delivery service of years gone by. There is a huge logistical component to it. Real estate is part of the solution but it\u2019s not the entire solution. And we\u2019re going to have to be very thoughtful. And as I said, keep our options open but yes we\u2019ve been exploring it and trying to understand what the implications might mean for our core market. Today, it is de minimis, it is insignificant and it is not impacting our business as our results would indicate it.","Jonathan Hughes","Have any of them approached to you maybe try and team up and come up with a solution or\u2026?","Spencer Kirk","We\u2019re just keeping all options open Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Paul Adornato","Most of my questions have been answered, but I was wondering if you could share with us perhaps what\u2019s on your plate in terms of R&D; what\u2019s kind of net out there? And while we\u2019re on the topic, can you talk about your new mobile app and some of the features there?","Spencer Kirk","So, in terms of R&D, Paul, I\u2019m not at liberty to talk about what we\u2019re cooking in the kitchen, we\u2019ll bring that when we\u2019re prepared. Mobile, it\u2019s really interesting. I think on April 21st of this year where Google changed the algorithm, it\u2019s called Mobilegeddon. I think our team perhaps as much as a year in advance started working on mobile strategy. And the mobile strategy definitely favors those that actually own the real estate, especially when you look at the maps. The Mobilegeddon piece was the algorithmic change at Google, favorite sites that were mobile friendly. And what I can tell is you mobile has become the leading search device that eclipsed desktop and laptop and it\u2019s a core strategic advantage of this Company. I don\u2019t believe that the smaller operators have the resources to throw at the mobile platform what we and the other national storage operators have been able to do. And I think this is once again the internet creating a landscape of the haves and haves not. And that chasm is widening and the rate at which that chasm is widening is accelerating. And I think we\u2019re in the great position with the other storage REITs, a great time to be a large national operator. ","Paul Adornato","And while we\u2019re on the topic what is the cut off or did you consider those four or maybe five public operators as large enough or are some of those $1 billion portfolios large enough to enjoy some of these benefits?","Spencer Kirk","It depends on the company and their commitment to technology. They\u2019re regional players that are very sophisticated and doing a great job, but once again it ultimately comes down to how many dollars you have to spend on your mobile strategy. And size and scale are decided advantage in the allocation.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Todd Thomas","With regard to the exclusive you have in managing new acquisitions for strategic, is that an option like a ROFO where you say yes, we\u2019ll manage the property or is it something that as they acquire, you\u2019re required to manage those properties regardless of where it is and how close it might be to your existing properties or whether or not it\u2019s in markets where you\u2019re concentrated?","Spencer Kirk","We\u2019re going to take them all Todd. And quite frankly the more properties we have in the market, the more power we have in that market. And I would much rather have an asset in close proximity to one of our assets that we control pricing and promotion than having it be in the hands of someone that may not be rational in their behavior.","Todd Thomas","And then just one quick follow-up on the mobile technology. How much of your rental demand is sourced from mobile today and where was that last year?","Spencer Kirk","More than 50% last year was probably 30%. So, the rate of growth is tremendous. And the impact on our business is significant. And we\u2019re really pleased that we\u2019re ahead of the path.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Wes Golladay","Sticking with topics such as the structural barriers and Mobilegeddon, are you seeing developers just growing the talent out and what is the development pool like versus the last cycle?","Spencer Kirk","First of all last cycle on average through to mid-2,000s, Wes, it was more than 2,600 properties per year being put into the marketplace. Today depending on whose number you want to use, we\u2019re 20% 30% of that number. And for us, I think that there is a growing awareness, the smaller operators and would be developers that they have the advantage in the local markets when it comes to connections and maybe getting a deal done but they cannot compete because we are not in the world of yellow pages anymore. We\u2019re in the land of digital real estate. And they are recognizing that don\u2019t have a sophistication over the dollars to even attempt to compete against the REITs. So yes, I think many, many folks out there are throwing into tail and that that is going to continue to accelerate.","Wes Golladay","And then you mentioned Denver, Dallas have been markets for supply on the horizon but all of these markets are economically full. Would you expect the initial round of supply to be absorbed by the pent up demand or is there any markets that concern you with the first round of supply?","Spencer Kirk","I think there was quite a dearth of supply, Wes, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and I think that the supply that\u2019s been put into those markets is largely fixing the pent up problem. So we feel comfortable with the supply issue for the next couple of years, as I\u2019ve said a couple of times today.","Wes Golladay","And then lastly, you guys have a lot good consumer data, the economy appears to be softening a little bit at the margin. Are you seeing anything in your dataset that is at least the yellow flag for you the moment?","Spencer Kirk","Not sir.","Operator","Thank you. I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to CEO, Spencer Kirk, for any further remarks.","Spencer Kirk","We appreciate your interest in Extra Space today and we look forward to next quarter\u2019s call.

Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statement due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business.

The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of the changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.","Joseph Margolis","Thanks, Jeff. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter call and for your interest Extra Space Storage. We have crossed this year\u2019s midpoint and to date, the year is right in line with our expectations and with our guidance with the exception of some uncontrollable expense items. Revenue is on budget and occupancy continues to strong ending the quarter at 94.2%.","We have maintained pricing power during the busy summer leasing season with achieved rates up mid single digits. This led to same-store revenue growth of 4.1%. New supply continues to be at the forefront of most operators and investors minds, and we are certainly focused on it as well.","Our view continues to be the same. We are seeing an impact from new supply in certain submarkets and its impact varies by location. We are benefiting from our highly diversified portfolio across primary and secondary markets. This reduces the impact of individual market volatility. In addition, our best-in-class platform continues to drive high-quality traffic to our stores and our proprietary revenue management systems are optimizing price and promotion to convert that traffic to rentals.","As I mentioned on our last call, our scale and technology advantages become more apparent in periods of elevated supply. We continue to focus on and invest in our platform to maintain this advantage. These advantages reflect a significant growth in our third-party management platform. We added 42 stores in the second quarter and we are approaching 100 stores year-to-date. Between our third-party and JV programs, we now manage 700,stores which continues to be the largest in the business.","We\u2019re happy to report that Inside Self-Storage magazine just named us as the best third-party management company for the seventh year in a row. The acquisitions market continues to be competitive with numerous types of capital seeking exposure to the sector.","We have yet to see any expansion in cap rates despite elevated interest rates and supply. We continue to be selective and disciplined in our acquisition efforts. This year, we are primarily sourced accretive acquisition opportunities through existing relationships, rather than in the open bid auction market.","In the quarter, we invested $274 million through a combination of wholly-owned and joint venture acquisition, which includes the buyout of a JV partners interest in a 14 property portfolio for $204 million, which we highlighted in our first quarter call. Year-to-date, our acquisitions closed or under contract to close in 2018 totaled just end of our annual guidance of $600 million.","Before I turn the time over to Scott, I want to reiterate. Revenue performance year-to-date is solid and exactly as we expected. As we discussed on our last call and as our guidance implies, we knew revenue would be accelerated and elevated discounts would create a headwind in the second and third quarters.","We are pleased with our strong late growth in occupancy, which has allowed us to increase our FFO guidance.","I will now turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. Last night, we reported core FFO for the quarter of $1.15 per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $0.01. The beat was primarily due to stronger than expected tenant reinsurance income. Rental rates to new customers continue to be strong. Throughout the quarter, our achieved rental rate was up approximately 5% to 6% year-over-year.","As expected, and as discussed on our last call, discounts as a percentage of revenue were also up, partially offsetting revenue growth. We anticipate elevated discounting levels to continue in the third quarter. Discounts should taper off later in the year reducing the impact on fourth quarter revenue growth.","Our guidance included outsized expense growth in the first-half of 2018 due to negative expense comps in the first and second quarters of 2017. Same-store expenses were up 4.9% in the second quarter, which was in line with our forecast with the exception of property taxes. We had three properties receive unbudgeted tax increases for 2016, 2017 and 2018 that totaled $872,000. Without the impact of these three stores, expense growth for the quarter would have been 3.5%.","We continue to execute our balance sheet strategy to increase our percentage of unsecured debt and the size of our unencumbered pool and prudently ladder our maturities. During the quarter, we announced a 10-year $300 million private placement, which was funded on July 17. We also negotiated better terms for a number of existing secured loans, which lowered rates, extended maturity date and reduced maturity concentrations in 2020.","Subsequent to the quarter-end, we sold $34 million on our ATM at an average price of $99.75 per share. The decision to access the ATM was based on lower than expected OP unit issuance, as well as last quarter\u2019s increase in acquisitions guidance. We\u2019ve updated our guidance in annual assumptions for 2018.","We raised the bottom-end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to be 3.75% to 4.25%. We\u2019ve increased the top-end and the bottom-end of our same-store expense growth by 50 basis points to 4% to 4.75% due to uncontrollable expenses in the first few quarters. The changes to revenue expense guidance results in unchanged same-store NOI guidance of 3.25% to 4.5%.","We\u2019ve increased our core FFO guidance to be $4.60 to $4.67 per share. In 2018, we anticipate $0.06 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.15 of dilution from C of O stores for a total dilution of $0.21. Our investment in C of O stores and value-add acquisitions continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and generate long-term growth for our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s turn it over to Jeff to start our Q&A.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Scott. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask everyone to keep your initial questions brief. As time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had the opportunity to ask their initial question.","And with that, Valerie, let\u2019s go ahead and start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, good morning. Just hoping we could talk a little bit about supply and your latest expectation for 2019 deliveries versus 2018 and thinking about things on a three-year rolling basis, maybe how 2019, at least, your thoughts now compared to 2016?","Joseph Margolis","Sure. Our supply outlook hasn\u2019t really changed that much from last quarter. We would expect 2019 to be similar to slightly moderating down from 2018 subject, of course, to things getting delayed and being pushed from \u2013 into 2019, which seems to happen a lot in this business, things just don\u2019t deliver on time.","So overall, when you look at national numbers, I would expect a similar to slightly down number. But what\u2019s more important is, where the product is being delivered. And we do see a shift in the markets to where folks are concentrating, less people looking, less if any people looking at markets like Dallas and more people looking to secondary market-to-markets, which haven\u2019t yet been impacted as much by new supply.","Juan Sanabria","Great. And then just on the same-store revenue, how should we expect the trajectory of second-half growth to be? And would you characterize a fourth quarter run rate as a good sort of starting block in terms of thinking about 2019 growth?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So, Juan, it\u2019s Scott. So if you look at our guidance and you look at kind of how we\u2019re looking at the year, I think, our top line revenue growth kind of ignoring discounts for a second here. Our top line revenue growth implies deceleration throughout the year.","So we\u2019ve implied that in our guidance, we\u2019ve talked about that. The impact of discounts are going to be larger in the second and third quarter with that impact moderating into the fourth quarter. So you could potentially see the fourth quarter be slightly higher year-over-year than the third quarter. So that\u2019s kind of the current year. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re ready to give 2019 guidance, but that\u2019s our outlook for the current year.","Juan Sanabria","Could you quantify the drag in the second quarter for \u2013 from the discounting?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. The discount drag in the second quarter was about 40 basis points.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question\u2026","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Juan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks. Hey, guys. Joe, I just wanted to go back to your comments on supply just now about 2019 at this point kind of expectations feel like it could be in line to even slightly down. I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re seeing out there in the market today that, that gives you that confidence that it doesn\u2019t actually ramp up just given that return are still quite good and obviously, fundamentals are holding in there?","Joseph Margolis","So it\u2019s hard to have perfect transparency to 2019 or high-level of confidence as you characterize it. But what we do see is our costs are certainly going up, interest is going up, labor is going up, materials, steel is going up. So you have an increased cost basis and we know projects that are being canceled and not pursued because of cost. And you do have moderating although solid fundamentals.","So I think, between discipline of some of the developers who\u2019ve been in this business for a while and understand the business and lending some discipline from lenders, and I\u2019m not going to say that there\u2019s discipline all the way across the Board.","I think you will have some market forces that moderate development. Certainly, you\u2019ll see that in markets where saturated, right? It\u2019s hard to find \u2013 it is that keep using Dallas as the punching bag. But it\u2019s hard to find a site in North Dallas that makes sense now.","Jeremy Metz","No, that makes sense. But \u2013 and it sounds like lending is at least one of those factors that you\u2019re seeing maybe get a little tougher at this point?","Joseph Margolis","Situationally, I think, there\u2019s a lot of local folks who have their local banks who can get loans, but it\u2019s a \u2013 it is a factor that\u2019s getting tougher.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then just second one for me. I mean, you talked about the advantages the larger players have on revenue management technology front, especially at points in the cycle like we\u2019re in where supply is rising. So, Joe, as you look at your systems today, the results you\u2019re generating, are you happy with where the system is at today or will you continue to put more capital into it? And where do you really see the biggest opportunities for improvement, or what are you most excited about on that front going forward?","Joseph Margolis","So we\u2019re happy with our systems and always never happy with our system. So we\u2019re always seeking to improve, particularly in the world with technology, anytime you standstill, you\u2019re just hoarding duck. So we spend a lot of time and effort trying to improve our models, improve our systems, do many, many different tests to find out how we can maximize revenue, deliver a better product to our customer, and I just think it\u2019s something that we do well and I hope we continue to do well.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks for the time.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Jeremy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Todd Thomas","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. First question just back to the discount drag that you talked about the 40 basis points the same-store revenue in the second quarter. Will that drag in the third quarter be the same or more than it was in the second quarter?","Scott Stubbs","Comparable to slightly higher. You have summer months, we typically don\u2019t discount as months as much and in this quarter, you really have July and August, where last quarter you had May and June, but typically more rentals in July and August.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then, Scott, your comments, so it sounds like same-store revenue growth might trough in the third quarter and then begin to improve sequentially into the fourth quarter just based on your comments. Is that the right read?","Scott Stubbs","That the way we\u2019re looking at it, correct.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then just last question on \u2013 for the third-party management business, how many net additions are you anticipating at year-end? And is this sort of pace of additions to the platform anticipate it to continue in 2019?","Joseph Margolis","So we\u2019re 75 net additions to our third-party management platform through the second quarter, and we expect that pace to continue for the rest of this year. I would not be surprised to see it slowdown in 2019 as about two-thirds of our additions are development. And as development starts to moderate, I would expect, we would feel that in our third-party management platform.","Todd Thomas","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Your line is open. One moment. one moment please. I\u2019m sorry, one moment please. Okay. Our next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. Your line is open.","George Hoglund","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Just one thing looking at the trends in third-party management, just kind of following on that question line. What have you seen recently in terms of canceled contracts whether it\u2019s customers who are exiting to go to another manager or customers internalizing their own management?","Joseph Margolis","We only had one experience with the customer internalizing its own management that was last year when we lost a large portfolio and we talked about that. Part of the business is that, people will sell their properties or have some type of transition and you will occasionally lose property. So we\u2019ve lost six in the first quarter and we lost two in the second quarter, and that\u2019s just part of the business. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any trends increase or a different behavior in terms of owners.","George Hoglund","And those six in the first quarter, two in the second quarter, were all those due to basically property is getting sold and then the new owners looking to switch management, or any of these just people those switching for any other reason?","Joseph Margolis","So we lost one contract for someone switching to another manager. We were not willing to make the fee concessions necessary to retain that contract. And that happens. To date, that has happened very, very occasionally, but when it happens, that\u2019s part of business.","George Hoglund","Okay, thanks. And then also just looking at acquisitions going forward kind of what trends are you seeing in competition for assets in terms of any new sort of players in the market that have new recent inflows of capital they\u2019re looking to put to work?","Joseph Margolis","We continue to see a lot of interest in self-storage investment. I mean, the basic fundamentals of the property type are still very strong with 94% occupancy, positive revenue growth and to the extent, people are concerned about it downturn in the economy. This is an asset class. It performs well in a downturn economy.","So there\u2019s a lot of reasons that people are interested in that in this asset class. For that reason, there\u2019s a lot of different types of money from big private equity funds to more local regional people who put together pools of money and looking to invest in asset classes. And it\u2019s our opinion that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen the expansion in cap rates is that there\u2019s such a demand for the asset class.","George Hoglund","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next lines comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Your line is open.","Smedes Rose","Hi, can you hear me?","Joseph Margolis","Yes.","Smedes Rose","Thanks. Sorry, we\u2019re still learning power phones here apparently. I just wanted to ask you so three. The tax increase on three stores costs you $1 million. So with 800 owned stores and another 200 in JVs and 250 managed, like what \u2013 how do you think about maybe the risk going forward for kind of unbudgeted tax increases? And what\u2019s the risk across your other assets, I guess?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, Smedes, this is Scott. This was actually kind of a unique situation, where a school board challenged the valuation that was put on by the local municipality and obviously had a negative impact on us. That affected 2016, 2017 and 2018. In terms of prior years, the risk on this happening in this situation to other properties is not an issue, it\u2019s the statutes of running that.","We constantly are looking at reassessment. This was one that went against us, it happens occasionally. But I wouldn\u2019t tell you the risk is any greater today than it has been in the past. More often than not, we win appeals and we have these types of surprises.","Smedes Rose","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Smedes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Joe, do you have any sense just based on the \u2013 what you perceive as a more a moderate \u2013 moderating supply growth challenge in 2019? How much of a decrease do you think that\u2019s attributable to rising construction costs?","Joseph Margolis","I don\u2019t \u2013 to the extent we have moderation in 2019. I don\u2019t think I have anyway to kind of allocate the causes between rising construction costs or tighter lending or just the top line going down. So development yields are getting suppressed. I\u2019m not sure I can divide up those different causes.","Eric Frankel","Maybe I can ask that question a little differently. How much overall cost increases are your development partners seeing today versus say a year ago to construct a self-storage facility, excluding land?","Joseph Margolis","So I would tell you that we were hearing about 10% to 15% increases in steel before the tariffs were announced. So we know we have some increases there, labor interest rates. So I think, if you put that all together, you probably have 10% to 15% increases in overall cost, ex land.","Eric Frankel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just a follow-up question. Do you perceive in your budgeting weeks going forward the next foreseeable future wage rates appreciate the same pace it has this year?","Scott Stubbs","So our current year increase, I would tell you, is attributable not so much to wage rate pressure, it\u2019s attributable more to the fact that our benefits saw from outside growth this year. Our health insurance and benefits increased faster than they have in the past.","And then the second thing I would attribute it to is a very tough comp. Last year through two quarters, we were negative 2% on payroll. So if you kind of look at it on a two-year rolling number, it\u2019s pretty much inflationary. Our healthcare has not gone up for several years. So we experience an outsize this year. We hope to be able to control more than inflationary number.","Eric Frankel","Thank you for the explanation.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks.","Joseph Margolis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ronald Kamdem","Hey. Yes, I just had a quick question on San Francisco. Just looking at some of the deceleration this quarter. Just curious if you can maybe provide any color there, and how you guys thinking about the market and maybe the West Coast in general? Thanks.","Joseph Margolis","So our numbers in San Francisco are really driven by San Jose. So San Jose is weaker than San Francisco and Oakland, which are doing better.","Ronald Kamdem","Got it. And then if I can just ask another quick one about acquisitions. Clearly, this year a lot of success being able to source a lot of off-market deals. So maybe if you can just kind of comment on what that pipeline looks like? So is this \u2013 is there a kind of a one, two-year runway where you can continue to kind of source these attractive deals? Thanks.","Joseph Margolis","Our pipeline of off-market opportunities is really hard to predict right, because you never know when these opportunities are going to come up. We know that some of our joint ventures that we have are in either finite life funds or funds that we\u2019ll be seeking exit at some point and we hope to have an opportunity to acquire those assets, but there\u2019s no guarantee.","But what I can tell you is, if history is any guide, if you look back, we\u2019ve been pretty successful year-after-year-after-year in generating a significant portion of our acquisition pipeline from our relationships either on the management side or on the joint venture side or just our relationships with people we\u2019ve done business with for many, many years. And I don\u2019t see any reason why that shouldn\u2019t continue in the future.","Ronald Kamdem","Helpful. Thanks so much.","Joseph Margolis","Thanks, Ron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. I guess, good morning out there still. Just wanted to maybe talk a little bit about customer rate increases. And just how you\u2019re sort of looking at the new customers, folks staying kind of on the short-end of the curve and then the longer state customers. And are you seeing any kind of trends in length of stay or ability to absorb rent increases in the two different buckets of customers?","Joseph Margolis","Yes. Our length of stay, Steve, continues to increase mildly or moderately here. So customers are behaving very similar to way they have in the past. Our existing customer rate increases are still high single digits. We continue to do those on a monthly basis. We have a roll down in rates of between 5% to 10% depending on the time of the year similar to what it\u2019s been in the past. And customers are reacting very, very similar to way they have in the past to rate increases and rates in general.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then, I guess, maybe just circling back on the expense question. I know it\u2019s kind of been asked a bunch of different ways. But as you kind of look into next year and you look at kind of just overall operating expense growth, is there anything that would kind of get you nervous outside of that one-time sort of hit you had here in the second quarter? I mean, do you sort of look at expenses being at a similar rate next year, or do you think things could accelerate because of wages potential, still upward pressure on real estate taxes?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, the two or three areas that we \u2013 I would kind of point you to. One is, I think, you\u2019ll continue to have some pressure on property taxes just with valuations where they are, municipalities reassessing things. So property taxes are always risk.","Our insurance \u2013 our property insurance is going up also. You\u2019ll see an increase in the back-half of this year. We renewed it at the 1st of June, and that\u2019s due to the fact that we\u2019ve actually been kept a very low for several years and with the hurricane year that we had last year it went up. But overall, I think, we hope to keep things inflationary with property taxes probably being the biggest risk and then the current year bump in that insurance.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s it for me.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Steve.","Joseph Margolis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please. We have a question from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Todd Stender","Hi, thanks. Just looking at the investments you made alongside your JV partner, I wanted to compare those to what you would consider. I guess, for your wholly-owned investments, can you go through the five operating stores and maybe how they compare to the seven silo properties that you made alongside the JV partner?","Scott Stubbs","It was actually combined. So it was stores that were in lease up, as well as some stores made a Certificate of Occupancy So the stores that were in lease up have been open between one and two years. So it\u2019s all one joint venture investment.","Todd Stender","What kind of growth \u2013 can you go into some of the economics around that maybe growth rates just to see if a property opening now or whether it\u2019s in lease up? The economics around that growth rates yields expected in the first two years, call it, and then silo property?","Scott Stubbs","In terms of our underwriting assumptions?","Todd Stender","Yes, see where we are in the cycle?","Joseph Margolis","So we\u2019ll \u2013 yes. So we\u2019ll typically underwrite \u2013 all of these stores had a significant portion of lease up. The C of O stores obviously had 100%, the others were lightly occupied, so still had significantly lease up. So we\u2019ll look at the markets. We\u2019ll determine the rates we believe we can achieve based on what we\u2019re achieving in our stores around what\u2019s coming in the way of development what the local economic situation is.","We\u2019ll underwrite those rates. We typically grown at 3%, and we will attach certain discounting to those rates to achieve lease up to economic stabilization. When we underwrite C of O stores, we want to get to an 8, maybe 7.5 to an 8 on stabilization. The yield to us in a joint venture is much higher, it\u2019s in the double digits because of the effect of the joint venture.","Todd Stender","And that would be leverage and third-party management fees?","Joseph Margolis","No. That\u2019s \u2013 those are all unleveraged numbers, but including management fees.","Todd Stender","Okay. And all these properties, are they included in your 42 third-party management additions?","Joseph Margolis","No. When we talk about third-party management stores, we talk just about stores we manage whereas the owner owns 100%.","Todd Stender","Okay.","Joseph Margolis","We also manage our joint venture stores, but we don\u2019t refer to those as managed stores.","Todd Stender","Got it. Thank you.","Joseph Margolis","Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Joe, just wanted to get your sort of views around equity issuance, especially with the furthering of the external growth through the acquisitions that you just talked about. You tapped the ATM, as the stock got to almost $100, raising just over $30 million. Stocks back down to the low-90s still trading at a low 5% implied cap rate. I guess, how do you \u2013 give us some sort of goalposts of how you think about using the ATM and doing equity, especially as the external growth pipeline, which you desire continues to be there to expand?","Joseph Margolis","Yes. So we \u2013 our goal and our strategy is to maintain to be leverage neutral, to maintain leverage neutrality as we grow. So we need \u2013 as we find acquisitions, we need to find ways to capitalize those. And as you point out, as our pipeline grows, our need for capital grows. We will certainly \u2013 and as we did tap our ATM or seek equity when we have a need for it, and we also use other sources of capital, for example, sales proceeds. We\u2019ll have some sales, it is used when we use those capital. So equity certainly, is an option for us and when we have a use for it, we\u2019ll consider it.","Michael Bilerman","Right. But I guess, how do you think about the pricing of that capital? It seems that during the second quarter, even though you had, call it, $300 million to $400 million forward commitment between the acquisition and the developments. You didn\u2019t do it. It wasn\u2019t only until the stock really ratcheted up close to $100. I\u2019m just trying to get your sort of views around how you view the common equity at various prices relative to selling assets?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So from our perspective, as we gave guidance this year, we looked at OP unit issuance. It was coming in a little bit light. Clearly, we want to issue equity when we feel like we\u2019re appropriately priced. This year, we will sell an asset here in the third quarter that is one that\u2019s going to go for a very below market cap rate. It\u2019s a higher and better used situation.","So our issue, we\u2019re up against today is, we\u2019re trying to balance cash on hand with the equity needs. And so at this point, we felt like this was the best way to do it and remain leverage neutral.","Michael Bilerman","And how big is that asset sale just dollar-wise?","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s about $40 million.","Michael Bilerman","And is there any other sales occurring in the back-half of the year that we should be aware of?","Scott Stubbs","That\u2019s the only one under contract.","Michael Bilerman","And you said that will be below market cap rate. So are we talking somewhere in the 3% to 4%, 4% to 5%, 5% to 6%?","Scott Stubbs","So it\u2019s being sold to a non-self storage user and it will be substantially low cap rate.","Michael Bilerman","And when you \u2013 Scott, when you say appropriately valued, I guess, should we view $100 as appropriately valued, or is the current price at $92 million appropriately valued to where you would execute?","Scott Stubbs","I think, it\u2019s time on the table in the range where it is today if we have a place to put it.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Yes, Sorry, guys. Just one quick follow-up. Can you just maybe talk about the business demand that you\u2019re seeing? And has there been any real change in that kind of line? And do you expect that to change in 2019?","Joseph Margolis","We have not seen any change in demand from business customers. We think it\u2019s been very steady for many, many, many years. So we don\u2019t expect to change in 2019. We also and maybe this is different between us and our peers. We like the retail customers better than the business customers. The business customers can drive high bar gains. They\u2019re difficult to raise rents on. And if we can fill our stores to to 94% and maintaining our current percentage of business customers, we\u2019re very happy with.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks, Joe. I appreciate it.","Joseph Margolis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks.","Joseph Margolis","Thank you. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are pleased with our ability to drive rental rates and occupancy in the face of heightened new competition. 2018 is following our expectations. In our diversified portfolio, investment class platform are performing well. We continue to execute our strategy to combine steady property level NOI performance with consistent external growth to produce strong FFO growth per share. Thank you, and I hope everyone enjoys the remainder of this summer.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

My name is Chantelle, and I will be your facilitator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Clint Halverson, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Chantelle. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s first quarter 2013 conference call. In addition to our press release, we\u2019ve also furnished our unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management\u2019s remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business.

The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Good afternoon, everyone. As a participant on the panel earlier this year in New York, I was asked to describe in a single sentence, how I view the self-storage industry for 2013? Being a man of many words, I described my expectations for the year simply as solid.","The first quarter definitely produced very solid results, as FFO was up 39% and we experienced excellent same-store growth. Demand for storage remains strong, new supplies diminimis and our occupancies are at record levels.","Organic growth remains the primary focus for Extra Space. During the quarter we reap the benefits of previous accretive acquisitions. In addition, we benefited from greater economies of scale, resulting from our growing third-party management platform. Our footprint is over 9% larger than one year ago.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the time over to Karl, our Chief Operating Officer.","Karl Haas","Thanks Spence. During the first quarter we had great same-store revenue growth of 7.5%. That\u2019s on top of 6.3% we realized in first quarter last year. We added 62 properties to our same-store pool in 2013, consisting primarily of the 55 stabilize assets that required in 2011. The addition these 62 assets to our same-store pool contributed roughly about 100 basis points to the same-store revenue growth for the quarter.","Rental rates, rental trends remained strong and our square foot occupancy continued at record high levels. Our same-store occupancy ended the quarter at 88.6%, up 2.9% over last year. We still don\u2019t see significant volume of new development in the industry.","With good demand for the product and lack of new supply, we are able to increase street rates 3% to 4% on average for the quarter. We had strong expense control in the first quarter, increases in payroll and property taxes were partially offset by lower utility and advertising expenses. Utilities were lower primarily due to solar panels added in 2011 and 2012. Advertising was lower in Q1 as we finished our elimination of the Yellow Pages.","Net operating income for the quarter was 10.8%, this is especially impressive when you consider the net operating income was up 10.8% in the first quarter of last year. This is even more impressive when you contrast the performance with long-term industry averages that are less than half of the recent levels. Our results continue to be the best I have seen in my 25 years in the business.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Scott Stubbs.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Karl. Earlier today we reported first quarter FFO of $0.46 per share, $0.02 above the high-end of our guidance. This beat can be attributed to better than expected same-store property results, lower G&A and lower interest expense.","During the quarter, we added 55 properties to our management program, growing the managed properties count by over 30%. We also purchased a partner\u2019s interests into flagship assets located in Baltimore and Chicago.","As of today, we have five additional assets under contract for $53.6 million, located in Hawaii, Maryland, North Carolina and Texas. As of the end of the quarter, we had 450 wholly-owned asset, 279 joint venture properties and 236 per sites under management, for total of 965 properties.","During the quarter, we actively managed the balance sheet and we reduced our weighted average interest rates by another 10 basis points. We remain committed to exploring all financing options that have a long-term benefit to our shareholders and that increase the financial flexibility of Extra Space.","This morning we updated our full year 2013 FFO guidance to be between the $1.94 and $2.01 per share. We expect FFO for the second quarter to be between $0.47 and $0.49.","I\u2019ll now turn the time back to Spencer for some closing remarks.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Scott. Our team produced a solid quarter and we look forward to producing solid results for the rest of the year. Now I\u2019d like to open this up with the Q&A session and we\u2019ll Clint start that for us.","Clint Halverson","Thanks Spence. As in the past in order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I\u2019d like to ask that everyone keep your initial question brief and if possible limit it two, if time allows, we\u2019ll address follow-on questions once everyone had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we\u2019ll turn the time over to Chantelle to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of RJ Milligan of Raymond James & Associates. Please proceed.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","Hey. Thanks guys. Good morning. Good afternoon. Question on your same-store revenue expectations for the rest of the year, you guys increase your guidance and I\u2019m curious what you think that mix is going to look like in terms of where is that revenue growth coming from, is it an increase in expectations for street rates, lower discounting, increases to existing customers and maybe if you could just talk about that mix?","Karl Haas","Hi. This is Karl. Yeah. It\u2019s going to be all those things. We anticipate, rate is, we were seeing good ability to hold street rates up, our occupancy is holding nicely, the delta will continue to slightly decrease, because we don\u2019t expect to get, that, the delta is not going to be above 3% and chances are it will continue to declines, so by the end of the year, probably less than 2%. But we\u2019ll continue to have existing customer rate increases, discounts, we\u2019ll see some decrease, probably the decrease will get less and less, because like with occupancy we have squeezed that pretty hard.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","So versus two months ago when you gave 2013 guidance, which one of those levers do you think has more upside versus two months ago?","Karl Haas","Probably the occupancy, but rate also is, we are pleased with the ability to be able to hold our street rates up a little higher than we expected.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. Great. Thanks guys. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Karl Haas","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph of Citi. Please proceed.","Nicholas Joseph - Citi","Thanks. Spencer you mentioned that the new supplies diminimis right now, but could you put some numbers around that in compare to what we\u2019ve seen historically?","Spencer Kirk","The expense of repeating statistics that we\u2019ve talked about time from 2003 through 2007, a five year period, 13,011 self-storage facilities were built in the United States. That\u2019s an average of 2,600 a year. Last numbers that we saw reported by FW Dodge showed 196 total assets either under development or permits being pulled for significant redevelopment. So if you look at 200 versus an average of 2,600 a year its diminimis.","Nicholas Joseph - Citi","And do you expect that pickup in the future or when do you think supply could begin to return?","Spencer Kirk","I do expect it to tick up. I think supply is starting to already show in levels of interest. We just came back from the self-storage show in Philadelphia and there was quite a bit of talk of development and new supply coming.","But this is a property type, it typically takes one to two years to get an entitlement, about nine to 12 months to build and then two to four years to lease up, and even if you open up the spigot fully today, before you had meaningful supply that would be challenging this statement that supply is diminimis today, I think we are one, two, three years out before we see anything that\u2019s pronounced.","Nicholas Joseph - Citi","Great. Thanks.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you, Nicholas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Spencer Kirk","Hi, David.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hey, Karl, question for you the move-in move-out rate or the growth rate seems to have flipped in this quarter versus the fourth quarter. Is that sort of indicative in your mind of increasing strength versus maybe tapering demand or is it just a seasonal pattern from fourth quarter to first quarter?","Karl Haas","I\u2019m not really -- I mean, I haven\u2019t really looked at it that way. But we just continue to focus on the delta to last year. And the reality is we push rates so that\u2019s going to drive rentals down a little bit. But we\u2019re looking at a combination of rate and occupancy to get to the right balance.","And so I really -- I try not to stay too focused on the rentals, I\u2019m looking at more where is my occupancy and how is that compared to prior year and how is that -- and revenue management is driving the rates to try to get the maximum out of the properties. So it\u2019s a little bit more complicated than simply looking at the rentals for the current quarter.","I mean, you could panic if you\u2019re not careful as far as rentals could go down because we could drive rates up because we feel like we\u2019re at or getting closer to the occupancy that we\u2019re striving for.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. My second question is also to do with the gap in pricing between the Internet reservations and the Internet quote versus what you\u2019re giving to the walk-ins and to the callers. And I know, historically, that\u2019s been wider. Has that kept changing at all given the sort of the new strength in the higher occupancy levels? Are you still pricing well above sort of the -- those are the rates?","Scott Stubbs","Our gap is still around 15%. We continue to test it. There might be some -- we definitely feel that there is some properties to our markets where that gap could even be larger and some where it could be smaller. But in general, our gap is still 15%.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. So it\u2019s really asset sort of inventory specific, it sounds like?","Scott Stubbs","Yeah.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Great. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thanks.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital","Hi. Thanks. I am on with Jordan Sadler as well. Just a follow-up question on pricing, I know there are a lot of different ways that you price all of the units. But, Karl, I think you mentioned that asking rents were up 3% to 4% year-over-year on average but I was just wondering, what\u2019s the spread between the rent for tenants that moved out in the quarter versus tenants moving in, in the quarter? Are you replacing vacates with higher or lower rent paying customers at this point?","Karl Haas","Well, if you\u2019re looking specifically at the tenants that are leaving and the tenants that are coming in, there is always going to be a gap because people that have stayed with us, lot of times especially they\u2019ve been here with us for long time. They would have gotten multiple increases. And so -- but we don\u2019t focus on that. What we focus on is what our overall in-place rental rates are versus what our Street rates are? And that gap is -- that was a big problem back in 2008, 2009, that hasn\u2019t been a problem since 2009. And we\u2019re keeping that gap pretty close.","Spencer Kirk","Yeah. This is Spencer. One additional comment, Todd, as you look at the rates and what we\u2019ve achieved in the first quarter, you also need to factor in that our discounts are down more than 10% in the same period. And it\u2019s the rate plus the discount or the elimination of the discount that provides the juice.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. So, what\u2019s the spread today than between the Street rates and the in-line rent for the portfolio?","Spencer Kirk","They are almost right on top of each other within 0% to 2% kind of dependent on when it\u2019s measured.","Scott Stubbs","Well, you got to keep in mind that we can change that really quickly by just pushing the Street rates. And so if you -- you have to look at it kind of over a longer period of time because I\u2019m looking at it, it\u2019s scheduled right now that has for 2013 and in a couple of months, as a percent of over and -- a couple of months, there was a percent down. So, it goes up and down because we are constantly adjusting Street rates. But there is no deep issue there like there was three years ago.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. Understood. And then the second question, I was just wondering if you could give us a little color on the 55 properties added to the third-party management business in the quarter. And I was just wondering, if you could give us a sense for what\u2019s in the pipeline, what you\u2019re seeing for new contracts right now?","Scott Stubbs","The 55 assets, if you look at them -- it\u2019s really primarily made up of three additionals. We did a portfolio of 29 assets that are located throughout the U.S. and another 10 assets located in Texas and then five assets in the Chicago area. Those assets also fit our footprint very well.","They are all assets that we want in the portfolio for some economies of scale. We also get management fees, tenant insurance on those that are not necessarily all assets that we would buy. So, I think it fits our footprint. We\u2019re making money on those and we saw some significant growth in the quarter. As far as the pipeline, it\u2019s more onesie-twosies from here on. We don\u2019t have any significant growth we\u2019re projecting right now.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of UBS. Please proceed.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Hey good morning guys. Just on page 15, with the same-store realized rent per occupied square foot, up about 0.3% year-over-year in Q1. Your broader overall stabilized portfolio had a similar occupancy gain but looking at rent growth, it was more flattish year-over-year.","Can you talk about that in sort of the context about how you are moving rents throughout your whole portfolio? And if your same-store properties saw rent growth, does that mean that the rents declined at the rest of your properties. Was it necessary to go a little easier on rents to maintain or grow occupancy at those properties?","Scott Stubbs","Our revenue management system, Christy, doesn\u2019t look at who owns the properties. It\u2019s going to treat every property the same. So with a sophisticated revenue management system, it\u2019s focusing more on what -- how to maximize the revenue rather than the rate and the occupancy.","So it\u2019s a combination of rate and occupancy and it obviously does not look at all of the portfolio. So I would tell you that that\u2019s -- it\u2019s basically, you\u2019ll get some of that depending on the portfolio and the number of properties within the portfolio. You\u2019d get some discrepancies or differences.","Karl Haas","Chris, this is Karl. I also think we probably have more occupancy opportunity on some of the third-party stuff than on owned. And as a result, you\u2019re going to see a little bit less rate growth because we\u2019re going to be getting probably a little bit more -- looked at it in depth. But my guess would be that it\u2019s more a result -- revenue management is going to be able to push rates more on more highly occupied -- or will be pushing rates more on more highly occupied properties and the owned properties we probably have more occupancy -- a little bit more occupancy there. So that\u2019s probably what\u2019s occurring.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Okay. I guess I\u2019m just looking at, if I just look at the same-store pool versus say just split out the 2005 Prudential JVs. Occupancy is higher on the Pru JVs but the net rents per occupied square foot were down year-over-year. I am just trying to get a sense for what that -- what story is that telling me?","Spencer Kirk","Part of that is a little bit of make-up of the same-store pool. Karl addressed it a little bit in his comments but we had a change in the same-store pool this year where we added 62 assets and 55 of those assets were acquisitions that took place in 2011.","And those assets have really, we would say outperformed kind of the normal historical -- the legacy properties. In addition, there are -- we added eight properties that were coming from our development pipeline. We\u2019ve never changed our same-store definition but we do have a bit of a benefit from those properties in the current year.","Christy McElroy - UBS","If I look at just those 62 properties, what was the year-over-year occupancy change?","Spencer Kirk","If you look at -- the easier way to look at -- well, I don\u2019t know if it is easier. If you look at the 2012 pool of 282 properties, the occupancy change there went up about 200 basis points in the new pool, the 344 assets your occupancy change went up by about 300 basis points, just under 300 basis points. And the majority of that obviously is coming from these assets. I don\u2019t have it specifically related to those assets.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Okay.","Karl Haas","We could look at this. And I am sure Clint could probably get back to you with -- or get out with more information related to those kind of in-depth analysis.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Thank you so much.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Christy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Hey, guys. Spencer, well, you guys should have crushed your prior guidance for the full year just within a couple of short months. So, I\u2019m just curious how you guys thought about when you set your initial guidance, and then how you thought about where you go from here and obviously you picked -- you upped it quite a bit, but just curious sort of your thoughts looking forward on the 6.5 to 8.25 for the year?","Spencer Kirk","Good morning for you, Michael. Great question. As we were looking at guidance for 2013 at the latter part of last year, we did not have perfect clarity, obviously. It\u2019s easy to look back now that a third of the year, come on and say morning is behind us. And with having gone through the low point of the season, the third week of February, Michael, is the slowest time of the year, historically, in self-storage and seasonality.","And having gone through that and seeing what we\u2019ve been able to do with the asking rate see -- having seen what we could do with eliminating discounts. Having taken a look at where we think this business is going to go. Q3 and Q4 in 2013, we were taking a much more conservative approach. And as we\u2019ve looked at how the year is transpiring and unfolding, we would become more confident that the strong solid trends that we\u2019ve been seeing will continue to play out for rest of the year.","And once again, our guidance, it\u2019s our best educated estimate as to what we think we can produce and produce with a high degree of confidence. And with May just being around the corner and our busy season coming upon us, we have firmed up our guidance and said, yeah, we are confident that we can produce this kind of results. So that\u2019s really a recognition that we\u2019ve gone through the toughest part of the year, and now we have better clarity as to what rest of the year will hold for us.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thanks for that. And then second question would be just on the acquisition pace and your thoughts about your $150 million target for the year. How you feel about -- what you\u2019re seeing out there, what you\u2019re able to acquire, how pricing looks, how you feel about your cost of capital today? And how that maybe changes or doesn\u2019t change your appetite for doing acquisitions?","Spencer Kirk","Acquisitions environment are estimated still at $150 million for the year. I think with the two properties that we acquired and the five under contract worth $66.5 million and once again, a third of the year is behind us. So, I would say, we\u2019re reasonably on track for what is or could be expected. What we don\u2019t know is the numerous conversations we\u2019re having how they are going to play out and we are like every other self-storage operator that is publicly traded, we\u2019ve got a nice cost of capital advantage versus the private guys both with debt and equity.","The challenge for us is to be disciplined and focused on accretive acquisitions as we talked about the results of the 55 assets that were purchased in 2011 and 2012, part of our success Michael is because we were disciplined and we went after acquisitions that intellectually and financially made sense in the short term, mid-term and the long-term. And for us, we want to remain disciplined even though we recognized with an implied cap rate with a five handle on it.","That is not the time to get crazy or become irrational because things can and will change. And furthermore, we recognize that a blend between debt and equity is the strategy that this company tends to employee and going out after acquisitions. So, I can say there\u2019s an incredible amount of money chasing too few opportunities. Cap rates have a lot of pressure on them, and Extra Space wants to be selective and bring in those that fit our footprint operationally and also to meet the short-term intermediate and long-term objectives.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay. So with that you are not thinking about going into development the way Public Storage has since you had shut that down and that was sort of a permanent decision even though the acquisition environment is pretty aggressive or heated it sounds like?","Spencer Kirk","Yeah, it\u2019s heated. But still there are opportunities out there. Last year, we did $700 million of acquisitions, Michael and $500 million were off market. And I don\u2019t know what the number will be this year, but I think that there are relationships that we enjoy that say we will participate in the open-market acquisition and we will participate in some off-market acquisition. But we are not developing to underscore that one more time, if I could.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Michael","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please proceed.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question, maybe it is for Karl. So just talk a little bit about the expense growth or lack thereof. I mean, how much of -- I know the business has become more and more technology driven and more driven by all the algorithms that you do on the Internet and I am just wondering how sustainable is a kind of 1% to maybe 2% expense growth figure. And kind of what are you saying on the property tax side that maybe hasn\u2019t come through yet like we are seeing in another real estate sectors right now?","Karl Haas","Well, I don\u2019t think we are seeing the 1% to 2% growth. We are saying that the growth will be higher than that. We continue -- I mean, what we are looking at is year-over-year and so whatever we put in the banks last year as far as that year-over-year and not having the increase, well, then this year we start and we start over again.","We are continuing -- there are certain things that we are continuing to get benefit of that\u2019s going away. Yellow Pages, that\u2019s a big part of the savings that we have this quarter. And as we are almost totally out of it, it\u2019s not going to -- we can\u2019t go to negative growth on it because we are going to have zero growth and zero expenditure. And we will continue to spend more on the Internet, so that\u2019s going to increase.","Our payroll expense as you can see, we are seeing the growth this quarter is a little bit exaggerated because we had a special bonus in there. But payroll expense is going to run 3.5% to 4% growth. The utility, as we continued to invest in the solar panels, we might be able to hold that down and actually have some -- our actual electricity expense I think was down by 10%. But actually natural gas was up by 9%.","So, luckily, we use less natural gas and electricity. So that was a bigger savings. We continue to find things on office and expense that gives us the benefit. But once again, it\u2019s harder and harder. So, I mean, I think our guidance for the rest of the year is more -- not that far from -- we lowered a little bit because we got some benefit in the first quarter.","We are still saying, we\u2019re going to end the year at 2.5% to 3.25% growth and that\u2019s pretty realistic. I mean, there is only so much we can cut. And so we\u2019ve done a great job in the last three or four years and maybe we\u2019ll find something we haven\u2019t discovered, but I don\u2019t what that\u2019s going to be. And as far as property tax, I\u2019ll let Scott talk about that.","Scott Stubbs","We\u2019ve estimated kind of 3% to 4% is what we\u2019ve estimated. We\u2019ve done that for the past several years and it hasn\u2019t necessarily jumped at that rate. But we\u2019re expecting the municipalities to reassess our properties on an annual basis.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Okay. And then just I guess a small question. In terms of like maintenance CapEx across the portfolio, what are you guys budgeting for this year?","Spencer Kirk","I think it\u2019s -- you mean cents per square foot?","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Yeah, if you wanted to give it that way, that\u2019s fine.","Spencer Kirk","Yeah. I think it\u2019s in the range of $0.35. It really varies by property and type and that\u2019s CapEx. Repairs and maintenance runs about the same and it\u2019s been running the same. Our maintenance, I mean this one thing we haven\u2019t done is we\u2019re trying to be careful to spend the money we need to keep our properties at the level that our customers expect. We increased the rents a lot and we need to give that back to them.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Great. Okay. Thanks","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. Karl, first question for you. Can you talk a little bit about street rates, how that progressed throughout the quarter and were you guys ending the quarter up on a year-over-year basis? And also what you would need to see in the industry to give you more confidence in pushing street rates a bit more aggressively, kind of back to the 2006, 2007 levels?","Karl Haas","Yeah, Mike. It\u2019s up and down constantly. And actually in April, we went up little more. But it\u2019s -- we\u2019re constantly and I guess the short answer is I don\u2019t control rates, our revenue management group does and they are constantly tweaking it. So, it is going up and down. I think, Scott, probably has something in front of him that he can tell you by month-by-month if that\u2019s what you are looking for.","Scott Stubbs","Yeah, our rates as far as dollar amount per unit have been pretty flat. But if you look year-over-year, as Karl mentioned, they were 3% to 4% on average for the quarter depending on when you look at that what day, what time because those rates are dynamic and they are moving. They\u2019ve been probably as low as 2% and as high as just over 5%.","Karl Haas","The good thing, Mike is that what we are seeing is we are at a much higher square foot delta than we thought we were going to be and yet being able to hold our rates at the 3% to 4%. It is a good combination and certainly it is reflective of no new supply and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re unique. I think you are going to see our competitors probably will report things probably similar.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Is it your expectation that as occupancy gains in the second half of the year moderate that you\u2019re going to be able to push a bit more on street rates?","Scott Stubbs","We hope.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then my second question just -- Scott, just to go back to your comments, sound a little bit more open than you typically have been on just on the secure debt front, does that suggest you guys are opening doing term loans and moving to more of the balanced financing strategy kind of going forward as oppose to\u2026?","Scott Stubbs","We will say Mike that we are -- we would like to have some optionality. We would like to have -- in a perfect world, we\u2019d like to have a tranche of secured. We\u2019re primarily going to be a secured borrower. But if we had an unsecured tranche or even a preferred tranche, we feel like that will be good for the company. Obviously, it depends on terms of those types of loans and rates.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","So, you are okay with corporate covenants at this point?","Scott Stubbs","We are not looking to do corporate covenants at this point, but it depends on the covenant some things you might consider.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Yeah. Good afternoon. Just going back to Steve\u2019s question with regards to acquisitions, could you talk a little bit about cap rates and what\u2019s your opinion on markets right now for Class A and B assets?","Spencer Kirk","Tayo, its Spencer. Class A and Class B, once again we\u2019ve got to be a little more specific on this. Let me go back to the quality scoring that we use internally, which by the way has a great deal of subjectivity, even internally personality-by-personality here on Extra Space. But there is the quality of the physical asset itself. There is the quality of the market in which that asset is located, and then there is the quality of the location of that asset within the market.","And so if you want to talk a Class A asset in a Class A market with the main and main location, we see cap rates that are in the five range, maybe even some drifting down a little lower. If you want to talk mid-market and the asset in the secondary market, Tayo, you might be high 6s, low 7s. And for us Extra Space has said that we want to try and do our acquisitions with those assets that are in the six and seven range.","We need to have a spread. We need to be intelligent. We need to be taking a long view on this because interest rates can and will change, where you are buying today property performance and other things could be affected and to go in there and acquire just to get large is not part of our strategy. We want to be disciplined. I don\u2019t know if that gives you the color, but we\u2019ve seen stuff starting with a five and going up and above that. But, yeah, that\u2019s the market kind of in the six to seven range.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then second of all, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve got any of your pushback in the first quarter from pushing rent despite consumers generally are paying higher taxes. Were you kind of surprise at that and what does that kind of suggest to you regards to how much you can continue to raise the rents on existing tenants going forward?","Spencer Kirk","What it suggests, Tayo, is that our existing customer rent increase program, which we test and retest continues to persist exactly the results that we have come to expect. The tax increase at the personal level has not to our understanding or analysis had any material impact whatsoever. And we\u2019re going to continue to send out rate increases in that 8% to 9% range, running about 50,000 customers a month. We\u2019ve learned and learned it well long ago that once the product is in storage it is very sticky. There is a great deal of adhesion and people aren\u2019t going to rent a U-Haul truck and take a Saturday morning, and move out for the sake of 8, 9, 10 bucks. It just doesn\u2019t happen. Good economies, bad economies, higher taxes, lower taxes people don\u2019t move out. It\u2019s too much hassle.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Well said. Congratulations on crushing it again this quarter.","Spencer Kirk","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thank you. So speaking of crushing, just looking at the market-by-market numbers on page 18, the Cincinnati Northern Kentucky region has had stellar performance. And as we reflect back on when you first bought those assets, I remember there was a fair amount of skepticism about going into such markets.","So can you just talk a little bit about how your acquired assets over the last, say, two years are performing relative to how you underwrote them? And then secondarily, do you think it\u2019s these kinds of markets where you\u2019re going to see the most accretive opportunities going forward?","Karl Haas","Paula, it\u2019s Karl. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Scott finish. But there are certain acquisitions where going in, we feel like we can have a lot of impact. And Cincinnati was one of those, the prior operator, the things like didn\u2019t take credit cards and had little bit restricted access hours and things like that that we feel going in can have an impact. And then obviously, our -- both our revenue management and our internet applications have also had a significant impact.","We\u2019re a little worried on that portfolio because there\u2019s some rural properties in there that we\u2019re worried that the Internet may not have quite the impact that it does elsewhere. But it\u2019s turned out well and we\u2019ve had that in a number of other acquisitions where queerly we have an advantage.","I mean there is an advantage to being bigger, having better resources and our revenue management group is pretty sophisticated. And I\u2019ll put them up against anybody in the industry but especially local operator. I\u2019ve been in this business 25 years. And my guts tell me we couldn\u2019t do some of the things we do but because of the data, the really smart guy, less smarter than me that are making these decisions. They\u2019re doing things that we look at -- I don\u2019t know about that and it holds. I\u2019ll let Scott maybe add some more color.","Scott Stubbs","As far as the underwriting goes, Paula, we are very consistent in how we underwrite things. So our acquisition groups bring things to our real estate committee. And I would tell you that we don\u2019t miss badly as far as our underwriting goes. I would tell you if anything, it may be slightly conservative. I mean in Cincinnati we didn\u2019t pro forma at this kind of growth. And you\u2019d rather be surprised on the upside.","As far as markets go, we continue to look at all markets. I think obviously that you prefer to buy in New York City and Los Angeles and Washington D.C. but pricing might not make sense. So if there is a market such as Cincinnati that\u2019s still a major metropolitan area and the pricing is very accretive to us, it\u2019s something we\u2019ll look at it if it makes with our footprint.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks Scott and Karl. And Spencer, sort of, a bigger picture question for you just in terms of valuation. I know obviously a lot of folks are talking about the implied cap rates for this sector and relative to historical norms. Given the technology component of its driving performance in this sector, do you think this sector is just permanently re-priced at a lower implied cap rate level?","Spencer Kirk","I would hope that it is permanently re-priced because we have proven -- and when I say we, I try to include the other public operators. We have proven that the Internet is not the great equalizer. It is the great divider and the CASM is not only widened, the rate at which it is widening is accelerating.","And I just think that we as the public operators with national footprint in the sophisticated systems that Karl alluded too, can and should get credit because it is a highly fragmented business. Most of our competitors do not have to wherewithal to begin to do what we do.","And I think that when you put up in the case of Extra Space at 39% FFO growth year-over-year, I would hope that we would be treated more as a growth company unless as just a me-too storage operator with a yellow page ad and some local marketing flyers going out to the local apartment complexes. The world changed and it\u2019s changed permanently.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much.  That\u2019s all I have.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Paula.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Jeremy Metz - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Just going back, you just made a comment about D.C. as a market, and New York and LA where you prefer to buy. But just looking at the market, it looks like it\u2019s underperformed some of your other major markets a little bit. Could you just give us a little color on what\u2019s going on in that market?","Karl Haas","Yeah. This is Karl. I actually happen to be traveling in the D.C. market last week. It\u2019s still a great market and but we pushed it very hard. It was kind of one of the earlier high growth markets and I think in some cases we might have gotten, our revenue management system is very, very good, but it\u2019s not perfect.","And sometimes I think, we kind of have tendency to maybe push it a little bit too hard and that I think is a case where we pushed it a little bit too hard. And also in general there\u2019s, while the rest of the countries feeling really, really good, there\u2019s a lot of concerns in the D.C. market about sequestration and I heard a lot of ad hoc comments about governmental agencies that had units that are moving -- that were going to move in, that didn\u2019t move in or moving out. So there\u2019s a little bit of that going on as well.","But if I had to bet on a market long-term we love the D.C. market and it\u2019s -- the great part of that it is, whereas the suburbs of Cincinnati could have a lot of new properties built some day and may -- and we probably will be faced with that.","The D.C. market it takes -- we just opened a property, our third-party owner just opened a property, they\u2019ve been working on for 10 years and -- in the Gwynn, Virginia. And it\u2019s you go into markets like that and there is not going to be a lot of new competition there, and there are a ton of people with a lot of money and that\u2019s a good formula for us.","Jeremy Metz - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. I appreciated, the color and along that same line. I know you are not looking to sell any assets, but just looking at market like Houston where you know occupancies below 80% and the strong bid for storage assets you mentioned earlier. Are you changing that thinking or I mean would you look at maybe looking to call some of your assets that are either underperforming or older?","Spencer Kirk","Jeremy, it is Spencer. We are trying to build a company, there might be an asset or two that we call, but realistically to Karl\u2019s point, we are trying to invest in our assets to keep them relevant in the market and we will yet be more aggressive in terms of recognizing that as the portfolio ages, we\u2019ve got to invest additional dollars to make sure that they stand competitive in each of these markets in which we are doing business. But no, we are not trying to balance portfolio, we are trying to grow one.","Jeremy Metz - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Spencer Kirk","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky properties, the performance does look strong, but effective rents stick out at just under $7 a foot. I was just wondering is that a function of concessions or I mean can those properties get $9 or $10 rents overtime or is that really just a lower priced market?","And then secondly, I was wondering, you\u2019ve owned these assets now for a little over 18 months. I was just curious where the yield on that portfolio of properties is today, maybe you can remind us where the in place yield was at the time you acquired them in mid-2011?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. I\u2019ll answer part of your question. Scott can talk about the yield. But $6 and $7 is better than $5 and $6, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve grown it, that\u2019s blended rate, in some of these properties are very rural and $6 is a great rate in some of those rural markets. Some of them are making, are in the $9 range. So it\u2019s kind of all over the place but I don\u2019t think we are going to get that total portfolio to $9 anytime soon.","What we\u2019ve been able to do though is the result, there was a lot of occupancy opportunity and you can only go. You are not going to be able to drive the rate tremendously above what the market is, but if you buy a group of properties that are 75% occupied, 80% occupied, you can drive them to 90% or 92%, and that\u2019s a lot of what we\u2019ve been able to do on those properties. Scott?","Scott Stubbs","As far as the yield, we haven\u2019t necessarily broken it out. We can tell you that in the north of an A cap, well, north of that.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital","That\u2019s what it\u2019s yielding today?","Scott Stubbs","If you look at the cap rate and where we bought it, that is correct.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. And then just one last question on guidance, interest expense, it looks like the first quarter annualized would be a little bit below $70 million. You are forecasting $72 million to $73 million. I was just wondering what assumptions that you\u2019re making for the balance of the year that would cause interest expense to increase towards the midpoint of that range?","Scott Stubbs","Timing of some of those loans and as we refinance or put loans on for acquisitions your debt will go up slightly, primarily through acquisition.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Todd.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of UBS. Please proceed.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Hi. Thanks. Just with regard to the 100 basis points added to the revenue growth rate from the 62 properties added to the same-store pool, does that include the impact of tenant insurance revenues on the newly added properties, presumably for the acquisitions that was pretty low when you bought them?","Spencer Kirk","Yeah. But the majority of that increase is actually from rental revenue than from tenant insurance.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Okay. And you talked about discounts and asking rents, how much are you pushing existing customer rents currently?","Spencer Kirk","In the range of 8% to 9%.","Christy McElroy - UBS","8% to 9%, and are all those numbers representative of your overall portfolio or just your same-store properties?","Spencer Kirk","Overall portfolio, we don\u2019t differentiate.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Christy.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Hey, guys. Just a follow up on, Spencer, your comment earlier about the discounts coming down, I think you said they were 10% less, just wondering if you can put a little more color around that. How much juices are left to squeeze out of the discount when and compared to say the top of the last cycle?","And then also is it possible to think about the your rent gain for the quarter year-over-year in terms of the three different buckets, how much came from discounts receipting, how much came from street rates and how much came from your existing customers?","Spencer Kirk","I\u2019ll let Karl take the second half of the question. The first question, Michael is, so our discounts were down more than 10% for the quarter, which we were pleased about. And as we push our occupancies and go through this busy season and everything else, I think you will see that percentage shrinking.","Just don\u2019t know that it\u2019s sustainable, obviously, we could be pleasantly surprised, but I think realistically, the asking rate will be pushed first and foremost, we\u2019ll couple that with the discount and we\u2019ll see what the effective prices that we get on each of the units, but I see that coming down.","Karl Haas","Michael, as far as where the 7% plus rental rate growth came from this quarter, I think that almost half of it came from occupancy. We had almost 300 basis points from occupancy. Rates were 3% to 4% on average up for the quarter.","So, another half of what\u2019s left came from the rate growth, street rate growth, as well as the decrease discount. So, your effective rate that you\u2019re charging incoming tenant then the rest came from existing customer rate increases.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay. And then just a question on Los Angeles, it looks like that\u2019s now the biggest component at least of the wholly-owned stabilized group. It looks like you had sort of above the portfolio average performance this quarter, which I don\u2019t think you had. It was below average in 2012, just curious if you\u2019re seeing a decided turnaround in that region?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. Yeah. It\u2019s -- it suffered for two or three years and now it\u2019s come around. It\u2019s a great market for us. We have very good product there and good location, good quality, but the market has been a struggling market. There is a lot of self-storage there and it\u2019s coming back nicely though.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thanks.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks. Michael.","Operator","At this time, there are no additional questions in the queue and I would like to turn the call back over to Clint Halverson for closing remarks.

We held occupancy through the winter months and ended the quarter with over 92%, 10 basis points ahead of 2017.","The steady demand for our need-based product, together with our ability to capture customers, not only allowed us to maintain occupancy but also gave us pricing power. This pricing power drove same-store revenue growth of 5.2% in the quarter and positions us well heading into the summer leasing season.","We continue to see new supply, which has an impact on performance in certain submarkets. However, our digital marketing platform is doing a great job driving qualified traffic, and our proprietary revenue management systems are optimizing price and promotion to convert the traffic to rentals. Our technological advantage over smaller operators, together with our diversified portfolio, have led to steady performance.","In periods of elevated supply and heightened competition, the advantages held by the larger operators become more apparent, and we see that in the market today.","We continue to have success acquiring properties through off-market transactions. In the quarter, we invested $71 million in 6 acquisitions and completed a $40 million development. All but one of these acquisitions were from existing relationships where we did not have to compete on the open market.","Subsequent to quarter-end, we closed a buyout of a joint venture partner's interest in a 14-property portfolio for $204 million. While the cap rate for the portfolio was at market, the sale resulted in Extra Space realizing an embedded promoted interest in the joint venture of $14 million. After crediting the promoted interest to Extra Space, the effective first year cap rate was approximately 6%. We continue to explore opportunities to enhance shareholder returns through mutually beneficial partnerships.","We also continue to see significant growth in our third-party management platform. In the quarter, we added 41 stores and we expect to add a similar amount in the second quarter. Additions to our third-party platform continue to be a mix of newly constructed and existing properties, bringing high-quality stores into our system as well as additional income. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 672 managed stores, which continues to be the largest in the business.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.09 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.01. The beat was primarily due to better-than-expected property performance and lower-than-anticipated interest expense due to the timing of acquisitions.","As Joe mentioned, our same-store revenue growth was 5.2% for the quarter. This was primarily driven by new customer rate growth, which was up 4% to 5% year-over-year. Discounts were down a percentage of revenue in Q1. However, we project discounts to increase in upcoming quarters as we expect to use them more heavily in the summer months.","Same-store expenses were up 6.9%, which is a significant increase from the low expense levels we have seen in the last several quarters. However, it was not a surprise. Due to a very difficult Q1 2017 expense comp of negative 2%, we expected higher expense growth in the first quarter.","The increases can largely be attributed to property taxes, which, while elevated, were on budget; and outsized snow removal and utility expenses. Snow removal and utility overages were driven by weather events in the Northeast and came in approximately $1 million over budget and $1.1 million over last year's numbers.","We've revised our guidance and annual assumptions for 2018. We raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to 3.5% to 4.25%. We have done the same for the same-store expense growth, which is also revised at 3.5% to 4.25%, resulting in same-store NOI growth of 3.25% to 4.5%.","We also increased our acquisition guidance to $600 million to reflect the JV buyout we just closed. Of the $600 million, $482 million is closed or under contract. The $118 million that is not closed or under contract is projected to close towards the end of the year and won't have a material impact on our earnings.","Seller pricing expectations are still high and we are committed to being disciplined. While we expect additional opportunities throughout the year, we will only transact the prices that will create value for our shareholders even if that means investing less than our guidance.","Our full year core FFO is estimated to be between $4.57 and $4.66 per share. In 2018, we anticipate $0.06 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.15 of dilution from C of O stores for a total dilution of $0.21. Our investments in our C of O stores and value-add acquisitions continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and generate long-term growth for our shareholders.","With that, now let's turn it over to Jeff to start our Q&A.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Scott. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","And with that, Chelsea","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, thanks for the time. I was just hoping you can comment on the strength of demand. Seems like you had more vacates than move-ins this quarter and last quarter. So just curious if you can give broader comments as to what that is and just your view on demand. And how should we think about that, given the fact that your occupancy went up? I'm not sure if it was just the size of the units.","Joe Margolis","So demand continues to be very steady. We don't see any turndown in demand across any of our channels. Our net rentals were actually up in the first quarter, and we're very positive on that in the winter months.","Juan Sanabria","Was there any impact from the weather, though? Because it looked like move-ins versus move-outs were kind of negative, and this is the second quarter in a row.","Joe Margolis","I think if you look at move-ins in the first quarter versus move-outs in the first quarter, you'll see we were positive and very consistent with our 8-year average.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And then just on Street rates. I was just hoping you could give us any color on the net effect of Street rates throughout the first quarter and into April, and how you're seeing things trending.","Scott Stubbs","Yes. During the first quarter, we saw new customers come in at rates that are 4% to 5% above last year, and April continues to be pretty consistent with the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I guess, question on the guidance. I mean, even though you did have a modest raise to the guidance, it seems that the first quarter was well ahead of the full year guidance range. So could you just explain what's -- what factors we should be thinking about in the back half of the year that create some slow in growth?","Joe Margolis","So we project, as Scott mentioned in his remarks, that we're going to have -- we're going to use the discounting tool more in the summer and that will provide a little bit of a drag. We're continuing to face development cycle, new supply, and that affects certain of our properties. That being said, we feel we're putting up good numbers and performing well in the face of the new supply. And we have increasing interest rates, which also be an effect.","Scott Stubbs","Nick, if you look at the big changes in guidance, they're primarily related to interest expense, which obviously increases due to the $200 million acquisition which we financed all with debt. And then, also, we increased interest expense slightly due to a change in the LIBOR curve, which you've seen recently. In addition to that, we had a slight adjustment in our tenant insurance and a couple of other items. But those are the big kind of puts and takes, and then also the benefit of the $200 million acquisition we just did.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then question on supply. What are your thoughts on the supply impact this year and -- versus last year or maybe on a three year moving period? How are you thinking about where we are in the supply cycle? And which markets within your portfolio you think are facing the most competition from a new supply standpoint right now?","Joe Margolis","We're certainly right in the heart of the development cycle and more of our stores are being impacted this year than last year. And the markets that are problematic continue to be some of the markets that we've talked about in the past, New York City, Dallas, we see South Florida. And then we're starting to see markets like Tampa or Portland, Phoenix that we're actually doing very well in now, but we feel there is some supply coming in those markets. Again, and I don't feel like I want to repeat myself, but even in the face of this development cycle, we're coming out of the winter months at 92% occupied -- occupancy with positive rent growth. And we have many markets that we're not facing similar supply challenges. We have a broadly diversified portfolio and we have highly, highly developed proprietary systems that maximize revenue in the face of new competition. So we're not ignoring new supply, we understand what it is, our guidance reflects it, but we're able to operate pretty well in the face of these conditions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open.","Smedes Rose","Just to follow up on that. I wanted to ask you. Do you -- you mentioned that seller pricing hasn't really changed, your expectations are still high. So are facilities transacting? Or are people -- are they just waiting leading and thinking that at some point they'll get the price they want? It just seems surprising that pricing wouldn't have come down somewhat given deceleration that leaps across all of the public companies in terms of same store. And I guess along with that, are you seeing any changes in the availability of capital for developers in terms of either from lenders or our shrinking returns, then changing their thoughts about new development?","Joe Margolis","Smedes, I'm surprised as you are that we haven't seen any increases in cap rates. Certainly, deceleration increasing in interest rates, other factors would make you think there should be some price movement. But I think all of that is offset by just a large, large amount of lots and different types of capital seeking exposure to self-storage space. And deals are transacting and we see lots of capital from large private equity funds to more regional people who just put together a small pool of money, and they're buying self-storage.","On the development side, there are factors that I would expect to slow down the development factor. Construction costs have increased even before the steel tariffs were announced. Steel was up 15%. Construction costs are up. Labor costs are up. Interest rate costs are up. So when you take all of those factors on the cost side and if you do honest underwriting on the revenue side, development yields are starting to shrink. And it's certainly our hope that, that will slow down some of the development that should be taking place right now.","Bennett Rose","Okay. And then when you mentioned -- you bought out your JV partner's interest, which wasn't included in your initial outlook at the 4Q. I mean, so was that something they came to you with? Or was it something you were working but you weren't sure that it would be completed this year? Or just how did that, I guess, change from last report to this one?","Joe Margolis","We were working on it at the last report, but it was not in any way firmed up. We did not know about it earlier -- much earlier than that. This is a single client account of one of our partners that is in somewhat of a drawdown mode and they're liquidating properties to generate cash, and we were able to take advantage of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hoglund with Jefferies. Your line is open.","George Hoglund","Just one question continuing on the capital interest in the space. With all this demand from private equity looking to get in the space, do you think at some point we see them try to go out to one of the public companies to get a larger portfolio? Or why haven't we seen that happen to date?","Joe Margolis","Well, that's hard to comment on other than it's a management-intensive business. And if someone was going to make a play for a large company, they would have to have a way to operate it. And I'm assuming if they're going after a public company that means they're not happy with the current operators, so they have to figure that out. I don't know whether that's -- if that's going to happen or not.","George Hoglund","Okay. And then just on the buying out JVs, do you think there's greater interest from some of your JV partners to liquidate sooner rather than later? Or is there -- are you noticing any change in sort of desire for your partners to remain invested?","Joe Margolis","So we have a variety of partners. Some are with perpetual life open-end funds that may never sell, and others are either closed-end funds or IR-driven or have other incentives, and it's truly a case-by-case basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks. Scott, acquisition volumes were more than double your initial expectations here. You mentioned earlier funding this with debt. I'm sure it's just a rounding issue, but your share count guidance is down 100,000. The stock today that, call it, 12% to 13% premium to consensus NAV. So can you just talk your decision here to fund activity with debt, thoughts around using your equity for currency? And then is this something we should look for if you're able to continue to source additional deals from here?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So our guidance is up from $400 million to $600 million. So we are not quite double. We left the same $50 million in equity in there. We're always looking at the best source of capital. I think that equity is always an option. It's -- for modeling purposes, we used the $50 million and it doesn't really move your ratios much to go from $400 million to $600 million. In terms of your share count, part of that is timing on when those OP units were issued, they pushed towards later in the year.","And again, we're always going to try to use the cheapest cost of capital possible. And equity, if we were to ever issue equity, you'd want to do it when your stock is appropriately valued and you'd want to do it when you have somewhere to put that money to work. We don't look to issue equity just to pay down debt. We feel like equity is more expensive than debt.","Joe Margolis","And overall, we're targeting to remain leverage neutral. So while we'll fund this with debt, we're -- because of our NOI growth, we're maintaining a leverage-neutral position.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. Appreciate that. And then sticking with the acquisitions, you talked about generating a lot of off-market activity here. Can you just kind of give some color on what's driving increased activity maybe relative to some of your initial expectations? I know it's a little hard to forecast acquisitions, but wondering if the activity is a result of sellers today who previously were holding on but maybe just want to completely sell on now given the rising supply are good, but even -- but lower revenue growth expectation at this point.","Joe Margolis","So the -- all of the increase in our expectations is this one transaction, the JV buyout. Other than that, our acquisition volumes are as projected. But we are seeing folks who have built a new self-storage facility. They're somewhere in the lease-up process. And either it's not going as well as the expected or it's not going as well as the bank's expected, or they're nervous about the future and they want to take their chips off the table, we are seeing some of those opportunities. But again, pricing has got to be right for us to transact, Scott.","Scott Stubbs","And if you look at where our acquisitions are weighted this year, excluding this $200 million transaction, there's a lot of C of O deals that we've been working on for the past several years and those are just completing this year and will close this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.","Jonathan Hughes","So looking at the New York same-store pool, revenues there were up almost 4%, but that was down a little bit from the fourth quarter. And I know that's one of the more supply-impacted markets. But could you just talk about what happened there? Was it just new openings or maybe the properties added this year were responsible for the deceleration? Just trying to understand what happened there because I was expecting that to actually accelerate from the fourth quarter.","Joe Margolis","Yes. I'm not sure it was such a change that we can -- one quarter change of that magnitude can -- we can call a trend or point to some big change in the market. We continue to do much better outside of the boroughs. We have about 4% revenue increase outside of the boroughs. And inside the boroughs, we are sub-2%. That being said, we only have eight stores in the boroughs, so it's a very small sample. But we don't see any significant change in the market.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more. The boost to revenue growth from the new same-store assets was about 30 basis points in the quarter. And I think, Scott, you mentioned last call, it should be more like 50 basis points at the start of the year. Just curious if that glide will be a less drastic decline or if there was something in the first quarter that led to that being a little less than you discussed in February?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you, it proceeded pretty similar to what we expected. I think that we expected there to be a boost this year but not as large as last year. I don't recall saying the 50. I think we are expecting it to be closer to where it is today, and then going to zero by the end of the year. So I would tell you, our same-store -- the benefit from change in pool is pretty similar to what we were expecting.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay. I'll hop off, thanks for taking my questions.","Joe Margolis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Rob Simone","Most of my questions have been answered. But just really quickly on the expense growth and the added snow removal and utilities in the Northeast. April was kind of a poor month weather-wise as well. I guess, I'm just wondering how much -- or if any of the guidance raise on expense growth was some carryover of the bad weather in April or whether that was all Q1-related. Just trying to figure out if there's any cushion, so to speak, built in there at all.","Scott Stubbs","No. Our expenses did not change materially in April. Anything that's happened is what we built in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Your line is open","Todd Stender","Hi, thanks. Can we hear more on the portfolio that you acquired subsequent to Q1, where it's located, occupancy and why does it make sense to acquire that? I know the partner was stepping aside, but maybe just thinking about your growth expectations.","Joe Margolis","Sure. So 14 properties in 12 states, very highly diversified across the country. These are properties that we acquired in the Storage USA transaction, so they're older properties. We know them a very well. They're stabilized. As you know, as properties get older, they get a larger proportion of long-term customers, so they just get more and more stable. And we -- acquiring from a JV partner from a management is a very safe transaction for us. We know the assets very well. We know the cash flows. We know if the roof leaks, et cetera, et cetera. We have no transition costs, no branding costs, no broker costs.","We acquired them at a -- we didn't steal the properties in any way, we acquired them in the market cap rate in the mid-5s. But one of the big benefits here is this venture had a very traditional promote structure where, upon liquidation, if the venture received a certain return threshold, any points above that, we got a disproportionate share of those of funds, we got to promote. And now it's $14 million in this case. And that was nowhere on our books and we're unable to access that without this type of transaction. So even without that, this was a good market safe deal for us. But with that, it provided us with some additional benefit.","Todd Stender","Thanks for the color. Do you get that promote? Is that a -- how is that booked? Is that going to show up in Q2? How do you reconcile that?","Joe Margolis","So in effect, it reduces the purchase price. So if the 100% purchase price is $225 million, we don't have to pay for our 5%, nor do we have to pay for the $14 million. So it just reduces cash out of our pockets to buy $225 million worth of real estate.","Todd Stender","Got it. Are you assuming any mortgage debt? And is the rest going on your line?","Joe Margolis","So there was about $89 million worth of debt that we assumed and we're currently considering whether to keep that or extend it or do something with that debt. But as of today, we assume that debt and the rest went on our line.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","I just want to go back to the discounting that you mentioned. Can you talk about what is causing you to try to test the discounting increase, the discounting across your markets? And can you clarify, is this discount higher relative to last year in the second and third quarter or is it more of a sequential trend?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. I would tell you it's an assumption where discounts will be higher in the summer months. And the assumption is, in order to keep rate, we are going to discount more. You really have the option of cutting rates, increasing discounts, increasing marketing spend. And kind of based on our plan this summer, the assumption is we will increase discounts.","Vikram Malhotra","And sorry, the increase again is relative to last year or relative to just -- the way you exited the quarter?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. It's more relative to last year.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just one more. I think big-picture question, and correct me if I'm wrong. I think on the last call, you had indicated stability in revenue likely to tick up in the back half of the year. I'm wondering if that's still your expectation or any signs that you could see certain markets accelerate.","Scott Stubbs","Yes. That is -- continues to be our expectation that, primarily due to the summer month-discounting which is going, which may depress those months a little bit, we'll see acceleration in the back half of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Can you just put a little more color into the discount patterns in terms of like what percentage of customers are receiving it last year versus this year? And when you talk about -- maybe you're using it more in the summer, how does that look like?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So last year in the first quarter, about 82% of our customers coming in the door got discounts compared to 59% in the first quarter of '18. So last year, you're discounting at just over 4% of revenue. This year, you're just under 4% of revenue in the first quarter. During the summer months, you have 60% of customers roughly, in the second and third quarter, getting discounts and was -- and then, call it, just under 4%. We're assuming that will be above 4% and above the 60% of new customers coming in the door and getting discounts. And part of it is also a discount mix. It might be last year you were giving half a month free, now it's a full month free.","Ki Bin Kim","And is there something, just generally speaking, that you're doing with pricing systems or the way you advertise or the way you manage your properties today versus maybe a few years ago? Just because to push rate 4% to 5% with less discounts and holding occupancy is a rare thing.","Joe Margolis","I would tell you that we've had the same goal throughout, which is to maximize revenue, and that we are always testing and trying different things to achieve that goal.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","I'm obviously a little bit new to the company, but I'm trying to reconcile your page 19 showing how the acquired same-store pool versus the new same-store pool. There's about a 40 basis point impact to NOI. If I take a look at your past sups, it looks like the impact should be greater. Can you just clarify what -- how -- can you just clarify how that calculation works? It seems like the impact should be closer to 100 basis points, but just based on what your 2016 wholly owned acquisitions generally looks like, your revenues and expenses for the -- for prior quarters. But I'm hoping you can explain that a little bit further.","Scott Stubbs","Yes. I would tell you, it really depends on the number of stores you're adding to the same-store pool each year and then the mix of those stores. So going from '16 to '17, we added the SmartStop acquisition. It was 122 stores that we had purchased that still had a small amount of rate growth in them and maybe a small amount of lease-up, so last year received a bigger benefit. The stores that moved in from '17 to '18, they were more core stores. So they were acquisitions we had made from some of our joint venture partners, where these stores went back to Storage USA. So just it's the mix of the stores that you're moving in and kind of the upside in those stores. And we've always kept the same definition, but we've also wanted to break out if there is a benefit from the -- some of these types of stores. So this year, it's more just a mix of the stores.","Eric Frankel","Okay thanks nice deal. I'll follow offline, too. One other question, you had referenced earlier in the call how you work on the Certificate of Occupancy years in advance as these developments kind of come through. Have you ever thought about doing some sort of forward equity issuance based on your -- if you think your equity is attractively priced, but you're -- through the C of O deal you have to close maybe 2 or 3 years from now. Have you ever thought about structuring your deal that way?","Scott Stubbs","Always something we're looking at. Any time we consider equity, you'll always look at the forward and what the pros and cons are with that. So","Joe Margolis","Some of the C of O deals we agree to issue OP units for. So in effect that is a forward equity issuance.","Eric Frankel","That is absolutely true. Awesome. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Joe Margolis","Thanks Eric.","Operator","And our next question is from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","Hi guys. Want to know on the markets where there's heavy supply, have you experienced increased term from some of your stickier tenants, the ones that have been with you for multiple years? And if not, have you noticed a major variance in your older assets versus your newer assets in markets where there is heavy supply?","Joe Margolis","So we see very, very few customers gone at -- rent a truck, pick up their stuff and go across the street to the new supply. New supply is more of an effect on your incoming rentals than on people picking up and moving. What was the second part of the question?","Wes Golladay","Yes. So okay, under that logic, would some of your older assets actually fare better in a market where there is heavy supply? Because I assume you'd have a larger component of the mix of tenants there would be those multi-year tenants so they could actually potentially fare better than the newer assets?","Joe Margolis","Yes. Really 2 reasons. One is what you point out, is the mix of tenants. But the other is, frequently, our older assets are an older generation. They are a lot of single-story drive-up units. And much of the new supply are multistory interior climate control. And we have a product that they don't have. The older drive-up is very attractive and some of the new supply can't offer that.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the financing front, the move-up in LIBOR has been pretty sharp. Has that changed your view on potentially terming out more of the debt if we were to get a pullback in the financing of market?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. We're looking to term out debt. We're looking to extend our average loan, the term. We're always looking, obviously, to manage the variable rate debt that we have. So very focused on that today and we are willing to take a little bit of pain today to extend term and make -- take advantage of some of those opportunities.","Operator","And our next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Todd Thomas","Just first question. I was curious if you could give us an update on occupancy, maybe through the end of April here and where that stands year-over-year?","Joe Margolis","Occupancy continues to be pretty steady, with perhaps a slight move in the right direction.","Todd Thomas","So seasonally, it's moving higher. Any comment around where that is sort of on a year-over-year basis?","Scott Stubbs","Very similar to where we ended the quarter.","Todd Thomas","Okay. Got it. And then just following up back to the discounting that you talked about, maybe a little bit of a clarification, I suppose. I think you said that the discounting will be used to maintain rate. Can you just explain that? It sounds like you might be moving asking rents higher to offset the higher discount, so effectively maintaining rates or maybe still increasing rates -- move-in rates. Is that the right read or is there something else that you're suggesting?","Scott Stubbs","I'm not saying that we are looking to increase them significantly more than what we've done in the first quarter, but we feel like we will have to increase discounts going forward in order to maintain that kind of 4% to 5% revenue growth in our new customer rate growth.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And the changes to the discounting policy here over the next several months here, is that expected to be broad-based across the portfolio or will it be concentrated in some of the supply-impacted markets mostly?","Scott Stubbs","It's across the portfolio. But obviously, our highly occupied property might have different discounting policy than one that has less occupancy. So...","Todd Thomas","Sure. And then just lastly, in terms of the comments around new supply, it seems like you're expecting supply. In some of the markets that you mentioned I think Phoenix, Tampa, Portland, you're expecting maybe a little bit of a greater impact today than you have previously. Is that right? And if so, sort of what's changed or given you that indication?","Joe Margolis","That is correct. And as we track -- do our best to track quarter-to-quarter on not only new deliveries but what's in the pipeline in permitting our new construction, we see development moving from markets like Dallas that are saturated to other markets and we then base our projections on what we think is going to happen at those markets. It's hard to be exact because a lot of stuff that is planned doesn't eventually get built. But a good proportion of it does and it impacts our stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","I guess Wes had kind of asked the question on the debt side. But I just was hoping, Scott, you could give a little more detail. You've got to think about two thirds of your debt when you look at the column with the extension expiring between '20 and '22. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about proactively maybe pulling some of that forward to take some of the risk off the table now. Or is that stuff that you just have to kind of wait until the natural expiration? And I guess, how far out on the curve are you willing to go today between 5 and 10 years on debt terms?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So we are actively working with lenders on the -- many of the loans coming due in '19, '20 and '21, we're willing to extend those out to 2025, and we're looking to get the spreads down and then we're trying to work through some of the swap issues. Because many of those loans that come due in 2022 for -- 2020, for instance, have swaps on them. And so we are trying to work through swap issues, extending swaps, getting things reswapped, letting things go variable, trying to work through a balance of that. But the goal, obviously, is to try to lock in some of that rate and extend the term today. And like I said, I think that there are times when we're willing to take a little bit of pain today. So part of our increase in our interest rate today is some of that pain. We are actively negotiating on -- of the 2020 loans that are coming due, if you assume that we exercise the contractual extensions and then do a couple of the refinancing that we're working on today, the amount coming due in 2020 is under $1 billion. So actively working on and actively looking to extend the term and lock-in rate.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And if you had to maybe ballpark sort of the benefit of more likely the pain, what are you sort of looking at in terms of an average increase in rate kind of all-in and between base rate and kind of maybe spreads coming down?","Scott Stubbs","Spreads, if you take a loan that was done 2 or 3 years ago, your spread would've been 1 60 to 1 80 over. Today, the market rate's more 1 40 in terms of a spread. But rates have gone higher on us. So on average, they are going up but it depends really on when we did the loan.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just back on development, Joe, we continue to see, the FTR data isn't really showing much of a letup, and I realize that the data bounces around kind of month-to-month. But just given the private developers continue to make a lot of money on the CO deals and, to our knowledge, there really hasn't been much pain on the development front with these developers. I guess, it sounds like you continue to expect the supply to remain high, although your comments about pricing going up and the yields coming down would suggest maybe that gets dampened. But that just doesn't seem to be showing up in the data just yet. What are we missing?","Joe Margolis","I'm not sure you're missing anything other than it's important to slice the gross data by market. So the fact that the same amount of stores may get delivered in one year or the next year, if they're delivered in different markets, it will have less of an impact, right? If everything keeps getting built in Dallas and Miami, it's going to be a disaster. But it's not the case. People are starting to look elsewhere and build elsewhere. So there's still a lot of development, but it's -- I think it's getting spread more rationally, if you will, across markets. Don't mean to suggest everything is rational, every development that's going in makes sense, but there is some market forces pushing development to where it should be.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And can you think of many examples in the markets that you compete in where developers have actually pulled back or not gone forward with projects because costs sort of became prohibitively expensive or the yields just in pencil? Or is that just not really happening yet?","Joe Margolis","So it's interesting. If you talk to the folks who have been in the business for some period of time who are a little more experienced, they absolutely are canceling projects and pulling back. And the folks you see who are more excited about going forward are maybe more of the newcomers to the markets, to the business.","Operator","And our next question is from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Todd Stender","Just one follow-up. I'm not sure if I missed this. The third-party managed properties, they ramped pretty good. Upwards of about 10% growth, it looks like. Is this a reflection of you've got newly built properties out there where the builder requires it from the lender to have it managed or they just literally need a platform to manage it? Maybe any color there on how you ramped it up so quickly.","Joe Margolis","I think that is one factor, absolutely. A second factor I would tell you is that the performance of the large operators just continues to outpace on a larger and larger basis the smaller operators. And as the market gets tough, even the existing operators realize they need a professional platform. So about 40% of the stores that we're bringing on are existing stores, are not new developments. So I think you're right, and then I think it's also second factor.","Todd Stender","And just a quick follow-up on that. For the existing stores, how often are you in the competitive situation to manage that property?","Joe Margolis","So I would tell you that for folks who we already manage for, almost never. Although we do have some folks we manage for that split between us and [Q]. For new people, they almost always will look at more than one option. And we're not -- we are the high-cost option, right? We're not the cheapest out there. We're the most expensive out there. And as our numbers show, we've been able to compete very, very well based on not how much we charge but how much money we're going to put into the owners' pockets.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.","Joe Margolis","Thank you all for joining us today. 2018 is shaping up as expected, and we anticipate another strong year for Extra Space. We continue to experience solid property level NOI growth and consistent external growth through acquisitions and third-party management. Our investments in people, technology and systems have strengthened our operational platform, and we have had excellent execution throughout the organization, resulting in continued peer outperformance.","I want to thank you all for your interest in Extra Space and participating, and I hope everyone has a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"8756":["Extra Space Storage, Inc.

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Jeff Norman. You may begin.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Towanda. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on a website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review.","Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, May 1, 2019. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.","Joe Margolis","Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and high occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-store NOI growth of 4.8%. This contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth, which was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance.","Performance continues to be steady despite new supply and we are well positioned heading into the summer leasing season. While we are very pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results, our views for the balance of 2019 remain generally unchanged. We still believe 2018 was likely the high watermark for total deliveries, and we expect 2019 deliveries to be only modestly lower.","Further, we expect the total impact on performance from new supply to be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018 due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development. We are seeing this impact in the lease up of our C of O stores. Lease up has slowed from a pace that was well above pro formas in 2015 to '17 to trends that today are more in line with historic norms and with our underwriting.","That being said, our people and our systems are working hard to maximize performance in a challenging operating environment. Our digital marketing platform continues to drive qualified traffic to our stores. We have maintained occupancies above the market averages and MSAs with new supply, but it comes at a cost. Cost-per-click are elevated due to a competitive bidding environment and we are choosing to pull the advertising lever harder in order to ensure web visibility.","In the current environment, large operators, like Extra Space, are best positioned for success on the web. In the quarter, we invested $270 million in acquisitions. We continue to have success acquiring properties through off market transactions. For example, and as we mentioned last quarter, we bought a joint venture partner's interest in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area for $192 million. We continue to explore other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns through mutually beneficial partnerships.","We also continue to see significant growth in our third-party management platform. In the quarter, we added 46 stores, while only 2 stores left the platform both due to property sale. Additions to our third-party platform continue to be a mix of newly constructed and existing properties, bringing high-quality stores into our system as well as additional income. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 805 managed stores with a strong remaining pipeline for the year.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.16 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected same-store property performance and lower-than-anticipated G&A and income tax expenses. We continue to see solid performance in the majority of our markets.","Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved street rate growth. Discounts were also down as a percentage of revenue in Q1, providing a modest tailwind that we don't necessarily expect in future quarters. Our same-store revenue growth includes a change in pool benefit of 30 basis points in the quarter and we anticipate that it will provide a benefit of 15 to 20 basis points for the full year. This quarter, we've added an additional disclosure to our financial supplemental showing a third-year of same-store pool performance. This disclosure should help further reconcile differences in same-store pool definitions in the industry.","Same-store expenses were mixed bag, with increases in property tax and marketing spend, which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense. We expect continued pressure on property tax and marketing expense, but we are comfortable with our ability to operate within our guidance.","We have not made material -- we have not made changes to our annual same-store revenue expense or NOI guidance, which imply moderating revenue growth. As we said in our last call, the moderation will result -- will be a result of increased impact of new supply, along with the difficult comps in markets that have performed well above the portfolio average for multiple years. We've increased our full year core FFO guidance to $4.76 to $4.85 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the first quarter. We also made minor changes to our G&A interest expense, income tax and share count guidance.","Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from our C of O stores, for total dilution of $0.23, which has not changed from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.","With that, let's turn it over to Towanda to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital.","Jeremy Metz","I was wondering if you could discuss the crossover between discounting and marketing. I recognize this is maybe a little dated, but if I look at your discounting trends from your last slide deck and assume those more or less carry through the first quarter, it looks like there's perhaps may be call it a 40 basis point give or take benefit to revenue growth from the lower discounting as a percentage of revenues relative to last year on a dollar basis. It's about equivalent to the increase we're seeing in the marketing spend, which is up 24%. So I'm just wondering, it all gets you to the same place in terms of NOI and earnings, but is there any toggling between those 2 items?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, Jeremy, during the quarter, we didn't have a significant change in our discounting strategy. It was actually impacted a little bit by lower -- the lower number of rentals. So if we had fewer rentals, your discounts are down a little bit. And then we gave a slightly fewer number of discounts to rentals coming in the door, so it wasn't a significant change. In terms of marketing, we did choose to pull the marketing lever as to maintain our market share and to continue to move the needle in terms of rentals.","Joe Margolis","But they're not -- Jeremy, this is Joe. They're not one-to-one correlated, if discounts go up, mark -- marketing goes down and vice versa. They're just 2 of several factors that all interplay together to achieve our goal of maximizing revenue.","Jeremy Metz","All right. And then, Scott, obviously, the balance sheet is in good shape. Your stock is out there hitting all times high, it's well above at least where consensus standing there. How do you think about raising equity here whether to give more active on new investments or even just warehouse in capital for the stuff you have in the pipeline?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. So we -- obviously, it will depend on where we have -- if we have a use for that money. So we've always said we want to remain leverage neutral in terms of our balance sheet and if we have a use for the capital then equity is an option. But how we underwrite a deal doesn't change. How we capitalize a deal could depend on where our stock is trading versus where interest rates are, but it is an option for us.","Jeremy Metz","And maybe just figure that Joe, can you just talk about how active the market is for acquisitions right now and anything notable on the pricing front that you're seeing?","Joe Margolis","Sure. So to date, we've invested $270 million. So we feel that's a good number, we're happy with that, we're happy with the deals that we had. There's not as much activity in the market in the first quarter as there were say in the second half of last year. It's been somewhat quiet. We hope that's seasonal. And the market will pick up. And there's more opportunities either in a broad brokered market, or more importantly, through our relationships, which is where we usually have the most success. And I've seen absolutely no changes in pricing. There is still lots and lots of equity of all different flavors, seeking exposure to storage and that is keeping cap rates where they are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America.","Shirley Wu","Sorry, about that before, handset wasn't working. So my first question is on street rate trends in 1Q of '19. You -- I think, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that it was up. Could you give a little bit of color on to how much that was?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. Our achieved street rates in the first quarter were between 2% and 3% on average for the first -- into new incoming tenants.","Shirley Wu","And how that changed in April?","Scott Stubbs","It's closer to 2%, but it's still solid.","Shirley Wu","Okay. And on the flip side for discounts. You mentioned that you don't expect the discounts being -- coming down as a percentage of revenue to continue. So how do you see concessions kind of trending throughout 2019?","Scott Stubbs","Our guidance and our budgets for the year don't assume any benefit, so flat year-over-year compared to where they were last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color on the performance in the couple of just your larger markets like L.A. and New York, which look to put up pretty, I mean, well more than pretty good, very good results. And I think if I'm remembering right, it sounds like may be in markets like L.A. there were more mature -- you were sort of maybe bumping up against sort of an absolute dollar increase in pricing that you thought you could achieve. So could you just maybe talk about how things are trending there? And maybe you were surprised too in the first quarter?","Joe Margolis","Yes. L.A. continues to perform very well. We are concerned, as you pointed out in these markets, where we've had year-after-year of above inflationary -- significantly above inflationary rent increases, that's not sustainable. But we had a great quarter in L.A. And there's only -- if you look at the L.A. MSA, there's only certain kind of sub-pockets where supply is an issue, but for the most part, supply is not an issue and we're continuing to be able to move rates in a pretty healthy manner.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And then same, I guess, sort of same observation in New York?","Joe Margolis","So the New York MSA, I will tell you, we were surprised. That it did perform better, particularly in Northern New Jersey and Long Island than we anticipated. And in the face of some new supply, particularly in Northern New Jersey. So our systems, our ability to attract customers, part of that a result of increased marketing spend has allowed us to increase revenue at a greater rate than we thought we'd be able to in that market.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And then I just -- last question, I just was going to ask you. Are you seeing any change in behavior of new competitors, whether it's may be in overabundance of supply at least in the near term sort of differences between independent operators versus the larger players? Any sort of the way that they're driving pricing or occupancy?","Joe Margolis","I'm not sure, if it's a change. It is competitive out there. I would tell you, I think, the large operators are more rational in their pricing movements and sometimes the small operators can do things that we would consider ill-advised, but I don't think there's been any significant change.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital.","Todd Thomas","First question. Joe, you know over the last few months, it seems like there was an expectation that there would be some opportunity around some distressed development yields, may be some lease up projects. And you commented that the pace of lease up on some C of Os in your portfolio is slowing. It's now back to historical norms, which is consistent with what you're underwriting. So it doesn't sound so bad. Are you still expecting to see some distress in some opportunity? Or is that not the case may be conditions are improving a little more broadly across the industry relative to your prior expectations?","Joe Margolis","Yes. I hope you didn't take from our comments that conditions are improving across the industry. Obviously, this is a market-by-market business and there are some markets that may be later in the development cycle that are improving, but there's also many markets that the development cycle is hitting full force and will de-accelerate in the future. I'm still hoping for the distress with the disappointment deals. We didn't see them in the first quarter, but I'm still hopeful and anticipate in a challenging environment that those acquisition opportunities will appear.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then, Scott, I know your guidance implies growth slowing throughout the balance of the year and you commented on that a little bit. I may have missed some of the ins and outs here. But right now, growth is heading in the other direction. So maybe you could just provide a little bit of additional color around what's -- what you're expecting to change that trajectory and may be pressure growth a little bit in the portfolio throughout the balance of the year?","Scott Stubbs","Yes. Our first quarter, obviously, was a strong quarter. We had it budgeted, but our first quarter actually exceeded our budget slightly. Throughout the year, we're assuming that it continues to -- the rate of growth continues to decline throughout the year. That's our assumption in our budget. It's impacted heavily by certain markets that have a lot of new supply. Florida is a tough market. And as we look forward, we think that many of these stores continue to slow in terms of their rate of growth, whether it's a same-store pool or a lease up store. So overall, our guidance and our budgets continue to slow. We'd like to get into the second quarter and see where that goes before we change guidance or doing the thing that sort.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And just lastly, I was wondering if you could tell us where occupancy was April 30, what that looked like year-over-year?","Scott Stubbs","At the end of April, our occupancy was up from March by about 40 basis points, but it was slightly -- if you take year-over-year comparison, we were down 20 basis points at the end of the March, it was down 40 basis points at the end of April. So slightly different, but again, within our guidance and no big surprises, April was still a solid month.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alan Wai with Goldman Sachs.","Alan Wai","Guess bit of a follow-up on the last question here. We noticed in the last couple of years that you had a steep 2Q same-store slow down versus the first quarter. I was curious what the mechanics were for this to happen? And do you think this pattern will repeat for the rest of the year?","Scott Stubbs","So Q2 is typically better than Q1. Obviously, it's -- kind of you moving into the leasing season, but it's going to be somewhat a comp year-over-year and how we did the prior year. So that could potentially be what you're seeing a little bit there.","Joe Margolis","I think, last year was primarily discounting.","Scott Stubbs","Correct. And then the other thing is, Q1 typically has more benefit from our change in same-store pool. So Q1, this year, we had 30 basis points in the first quarter and we're estimating for the year that to be 15 to 20, which would assume, by Q4, it's very little benefit.","Alan Wai","That's helpful. You didn't mention in your guidance that you don't expect any benefit attract from discounts. Do think you'll need to reintroduce discounts at some point or do you think the environment for pricing has improved as of late?","Scott Stubbs","No. We continue to use discounts. We -- most new rentals get a discount well over 50% of our new rentals coming in the door are going to get some type of discount.","Alan Wai","Got it. Your peer, PSA has announced a property of tomorrow initiative, which requires a significant investment and will take several years to complete. Just curious, how do you think your portfolio compares with newer generation products currently in the market?","Joe Margolis","I think, we've done a good job of continuing to invest and upgrade our properties to keep them relevant and attractive to customers. And we spend money every year doing that and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Just looking at the California properties that you bought from your JV partner, can you characterize the properties, maybe just look in to the submarkets and maybe share any CapEx that's required? I guess, just to look inside that portfolio.","Joe Margolis","So these were all properties that we built, they're in infill areas, 10 in Los Angeles, 2 in the San Francisco area. They've been -- we own them in partnership for many years with our partner. They've been well maintained. Capital has been spent every year. They've been part of our 7-year rebranding program that we started 3 or 4 years ago. We're about halfway through the portfolio, a little more than that so far. So these are not stores that need a lot of capital. They're great, solid, steady core acquisitions.","Todd Stender","And you've been managing them on a third-party basis, is that right?","Joe Margolis","No. We were about a 95%-5% joint venture partner, but we did manage them. Not on a third-party basis, on a joint venture basis.","Todd Stender","Okay. And then, how about pricing on this? How do you look at pricing? You take out your JV partner, they're obviously stabilized getting market rates. What kind of pricing do you ascribe to this?","Joe Margolis","So on the gross value that was negotiated for the portfolio, the purchase price forward 12-month yield after tax reassessment was sub-5, which is market for these types of assets in markets in California. But we had an embedded promote in the venture of $72.8 million that we couldn't realize without a capital transaction. So putting that promote towards the purchase price, the first year yield after tax reassessment was 6.3.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.","Ronald Kamdem","Just a couple of quick ones from me. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the marketing spend? Meaning, are there any specific markets or regions that really drove the increase spend? And also, I think, you touched on that bid pricing are going up every year. Is there a way to quantify that? Is that high single-digit? Is it double-digit? How should we think about that?","Scott Stubbs","Our spend for the year, our original budgets were 15% increase, which is what we are thinking we are going to need to spend to kind of keep up with the inflationary pay-per-click spend. We have spent greater number higher than that in the first quarter and we're assuming we'll have to spend at an accelerated level throughout the year. It's across the country, the additional spend, but it is probably a little more focused on new supply markets or markets where we're struggling.","Ronald Kamdem","Great. That's helpful. And then, sort of touching back on some of the bigger markets. Just looking at Dallas, we're still seeing a lot of projects in the pipeline. Just curious if you could remind us how you guys are thinking about that and maybe how your assets are positioned versus the new supply coming in?","Joe Margolis","Yes. Dallas is a market that is challenged. And if you look at our supplements and see our revenue growth there, which was less than 1% is below portfolio average. Our stores, the North Dallas area is the most challenged and those are our stores that we're focused most on. In South Dallas and other areas, we're doing slightly better.","Ronald Kamdem","Great. And then the last question I have was just, if you could remind us what the spread between the asking rate and the existing tenant rate was maybe during the quarter and how that's trending in April?","Scott Stubbs","And so, the quarter was actually our worse time of the year. On average, we're mid-single digits in terms of where our ask rates are and our in place rates. The worse time of the year is the winter months. So kind of January, February. The best time of the time is the summer months when they're essentially flat. But on average, it's mid-single-digit. So this is the worse time of the year, so higher than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Toyo Okusanya","You guys typically, you always kind of do very interesting things, trying to figure out the best way to maximize profits between pricing and as well as the volume. Just kind of curious if you could talk a little bit about maybe some of the checks you may have done this quarter or maybe even the last few quarters and that must be telling you about just the elasticity of demand from customers?","Joe Margolis","So I'm happy to say that we continue to do tests every quarter, every month. We're very data-driven shop. We don't make any decisions without having the data analyzed and testing based on that. But not comfortable telling you what are the things we're actually testing.","Toyo Okusanya","Could you tell us anything about what you may be telling you about customer demand or elasticity of demand?","Joe Margolis","So we don't see any significant difference in customer behavior. Demand is steady to increasing the fear that folks have, that millennials weren't going to rent has proven incorrect. Millennials make up a higher percentage of our renters than they do of the population. We see the stickiness, if you will, with the customers once they get in, in the face of rate increases to be the same. So we don't see significant changes in customer behavior.","Toyo Okusanya","Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then anything incrementally you could talk about also in regards to just business demand for Storage?","Joe Margolis","So business demand has been pretty steady for many, many years here. And we don't see any significant increase or decrease in business demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore.","Samir Khanal","Joe, thanks for your view on supply. You talked about '18, which was the high watermark on deliveries but then you continue to see impact from sort of developments kind of the cumulative impact. So you kind of taken those to and generally, I mean, it doesn't have to be for your company, but generally as part of the industry, where do you think the -- that the trough and revenue growth will be, is, I mean, people say, it's '20 but do you think it gets further pushed out into even '21 at this point with all the delivery and the impact of what's come on in the last couple of years?","Joe Margolis","So we don't have perfect transparency into the future. We don't know if development is going to continue its moderating trend that we see. That's what we would expect, given economics of development. But we don't know. We don't know if people with lower yield requirements or higher risk tolerances are going to keep sticking shovels in the ground. So when the inflection point will occur depends on things that we currently don't know.","Samir Khanal","Okay. And just switching gears a little bit on the disposition side. Considering where cap rates are. And it sounds like cap rates are fairly low. And for well stabilized assets, do you consider -- could you consider even may be selling into this market where pricing is favorable?","Joe Margolis","We just closed the disposition of a store in Upstate New York this quarter, I guess, after the quarter it actually closed. And we, every year, we look at our portfolio and look for assets that would make sense to dispose of either outright or into a joint venture to reduce our exposure to those assets or markets, and we'll continue to do so and execute when it makes sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Lumb with Green Street Advisors.","Ryan Lumb","First, appreciate the additional disclosure under older venture to same-store pools. But just one simple question. Can you elaborate on the brief or the small adjustment to G&A expense guidance?","Scott Stubb","Yes. Part of it has to do with just the timeliness of some hires that we had and still we are estimating the majority of that should flow through and then some consulting expenses that did not come to fruition.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.","Jonathan Hughes","Looking at the broader stabilized storage data just to get a larger sample size of your performance in L.A. and San Francisco specifically, it looks like rental growth was flat sequentially but the number of facilities in those pools were down from fourth quarter. Just curious what's going on there? Did you maybe lose some of those third-party managed stores? Because I think the same-store pool was up a little bit.","Joe Margolis","I'd have to go back and look at that, because I'm not sure, we were down in L.A. or San Francisco. We could look at that and get back to you.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess, going on the other coast and New York. And that stabilized pool saw a pretty nice sequential increase in revenue growth. I guess, what was the benefit from the new adds to that same-store pool? Was it similar to the 30 basis point boost to the overall portfolio on same-store revenue growth?","Scott Stubbs","It's really market-by-market and it will depend on how many properties we have in it. So, I mean, a market that only had 10 properties, obviously, when you add 1, it's going to get impacted more versus Los Angeles where you have a larger number of properties and you add 1 it will impact it very little. So it's tough to really give you on a market-by-market basis here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Just a bigger picture. What do you think were the couple of things that positively surprised you during this quarter?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you, discounts being down, I think, were a surprise to us in a positive aspect. I think the fact that some of these markets that have been hit by supply so hard have held on as well as they have. So, for instance, Dallas. And then, the last one is, I think, our payroll was a little lower than we expected, and so we've done some things there to try to get some more efficiencies, but we don't expect that to continue through the year somewhat of a one -- more of a onetime benefit in Q1 than rather an ongoing thing for the year.","Joe Margolis","I think certain markets perform better than we anticipated. Atlanta, certainly performed better than we thought. Some of the broader markets that we thought were going to be impacted either to delays in delivery or otherwise are performing a little better.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And going back to your comments about seeing elevated marketing spend throughout the year. And payroll, like you said, maybe it was onetime benefit in the first quarter and that normalizes higher. How do you make that feel about your same-store expense guidance, especially at the higher end?","Scott Stubbs","So we're still comfortable with our guidance. I think that it will depend a little bit on your marketing spend on where you are in that range.","Ki Bin Kim","All right. And then just last question. You probably that thought I knew that MakeSpace is partnering up with Iron Mountain. Does that change your views at all about the long-term efficacy of value storage companies? I know it's quite early but.","Joe Margolis","It doesn't. I mean, when we look at current pricing for -- to wallet customer using wallet versus storage. It's kind of played out as we expected. It's hard to -- it seems like they have not been able to pay for the logistical piece of that and still make storage an economical choice. Not to say some people aren't going to use it, but it's not competitive with what we have. That being said, we think there is a segment of customers, elderly or whatever who don't want to move their own boxes. And we would expect as our business evolves to be able to offer some type of service to customers who want it.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Joe Margolis, CEO for closing remarks.","Joe Margolis","Thank you everyone for joining us today. As we discussed, we continue to experience solid property level NOI growth despite new supply. We expect that we're going to have a very solid summer season and another strong year for Extra Space. We're off to a good start on the acquisition front, on the external growth front, both through acquisitions and third-party management. And what's most encouraging is that I feel that our teams and our systems are tested mostly during competitive times, they are performing very well and delivering their results for our shareholders. I look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT. Thank you, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Norman, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Extra Space. You may begin.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Shane. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's second quarter 2016 earnings call. In addition to our press release we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business.","These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the Company's latest filings with the SEC which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, Thursday, July 28, 2016. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Hello, everyone. It was another solid quarter for Extra Space. We produced same-store revenue growth of 7.6% primarily from rate. Expenses increased 3.1% which led to NOI growth of 9.4%. Quarter end occupancy was very strong at 94.4%. FFO per share as adjusted grew more than 25% year-over-year.","This is exceptional growth is the result of solid operating performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. These growth components have produced 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth and enabled a second quarter dividend increase of 32%.","Year-to-date we have closed over $0.5 billion in wholly-owned acquisitions, bringing the total property count to 1,412 Extra Space branded stores. Marketed acquisitions continue to be as competitive as we have ever seen. We continue to be disciplined and only transact at levels that are beneficial for our shareholders.","We've been particularly successful sourcing off-market transactions through our joint ventures, third-party and other relationships. We believe that the 630 Extra Space branded stores, which are not wholly-owned, will continue to provide outsized acquisition opportunities.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Spencer. Last night we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.94 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including costs associated with acquisitions and non-cash interest expense, FFO was $0.91 per share for the quarter. Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance which assumes minimal benefit from occupancy and discounts. The change in our same-store pool from 2015 to 2016 positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points for the quarter.","Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Tampa-Saint Pete and most of the state of California, all of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. The slowest markets were Chicago, Denver, Memphis and Washington DC, each of which still had positive revenue growth. Our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop, are performing in line with our estimates and lease up times on our CofO deals are significantly faster than underwriting and our historical norms.","Year-to-date we have closed or have under contract to close $547 million of wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $248 million in joint venture acquisitions closed or under contract. Our investment in these JVs will be $81 million this year. All of these acquisitions are expected to close in 2016. During the quarter we restructured two of our joint ventures to realize the value of our promote. The promote was exchanged for additional ownership in the joint ventures, increasing our equity position by over $40 million.","At this time, we reaffirm our full-year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be $3.59 to $3.66 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average we expect outsized NOI growth.","I will now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Scott. While our unprecedented revenue and NOI growth have moderated, our ability to produce the industry's best FFO growth year-in and year-out has not moderated. This quarter's FFO as adjusted grew 25.3%. This is the result of our multifaceted strategy which includes the industry's leading operating platform, the industry's most successful acquisition program, the industry's largest third-party management platform, the industry's largest and most successful JV program, and a management team that clearly understands that growing FFO is our number one priority. In closing, as we expected, our same-store performance has gone from phenomenal to excellent. And FFO growth is still phenomenal.","Now let's turn the time over to Jeff to start the Q&A session.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Spencer. For our Q&A session we are also joined by Joe Margolis, our Chief Investment Officer. In order to ensure that we have adequate time to address everyone's questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had the opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that we will turn it over to Shane to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Hi, everyone. So I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions regarding the same-store revenue trends, the deceleration from about 9% to 7.5%. So, if I put it in perspective, that 7.5% growth, we get it. I mean it is still better than almost any other REIT out there. But at the same time to decline is bigger than what we have seen from your portfolio in quite some time.","And some of that growth also carries with it just good pricing momentum you have experienced over the past year. And it may not necessarily be reflective of new customer activity today. So the question is what is really happening on the frontlines of new customer activity in terms of just price sensitivity? And what is happening with Street rates year-over-year, promotion usage, things like that?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, Ki Bin, this is Scott. The deceleration from Q1 to Q2 and from last year I would tell you is largely the result of no occupancy delta and not significant discount delta. So, last year we experienced call it 200 to 300 basis points of - we benefited 200 to 300 basis points of occupancy in discount delta. This year that has gone to minimal amounts. Our current street rates and our current achieved rates are still very solid. We are still getting, call it 6% to 8% I think, right. More recently it has been about 7%. So we are still seeing very good street rates and achieved rate growth.","Ki Bin Kim","And so, if I take that into consideration, it sounds like - I mean obviously you had the occupancy benefit loss. But are promotions almost going the other way where it is higher year-over-year?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, I would tell you promotions are moving in line with rate. So in other words, if rates are up 7%, discounts are up 7% also. So, discounts may be up slightly but not significantly at all or not materially. It is moving with rate.","Ki Bin Kim","I guess what I meant was, for new customers moving in - what is the percentage of new customers moving in that are getting a promotion this time around?","Scott Stubbs","So it is between 60% and 65%. And that is not very much above last year. Last year was similar numbers call it low 60%s? And you also have to look not just at the percentage of customers getting the discount, you have to look at what discount they are getting. So it may be they are getting a discount but it is first month half off or something smaller than they received last year.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you, guys.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks Ki Bin.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gwen Clark of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Gwen Clark","Oh! Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","Spencer Kirk","Hi, Gwen.","Gwen Clark","So just a quick question. On the CO pipeline it looks like a chunk of the assets will be wholly-owned while others will be in a JV structure? Can you talk about the decision making process you go through when evaluating these?","Joe Margolis","Sure, this is Joe Margolis. We have set up several programs with local developers where they - in targeted markets they will source CO opportunities for us to review and will, in a programmatic basis, execute a number of those in joint venture in those markets.","Gwen Clark","Okay. And do you have the right of first refusal on the event that the partner would like to exit eventually?","Joe Margolis","Yes. In all of our ventures we have protections on exit so we have the opportunity to purchase. That is a very important tool for us to make sure that we have.","Gwen Clark","Okay, that is helpful. Thank you very much.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Gwen.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Todd Thomas","So a question on new supply, I guess two questions really. One, any changes in the number of completions you are expecting in 2016 and 2017? And then two, you have talked about - we have heard about Chicago, Denver and Houston seeing new supply lead to some relative softness. I am just wondering if there are any other markets on your radar at this point.","Spencer Kirk","Good question, Todd, it is Spencer. First of all, our best estimate for 2016 is 700 properties likely to be delivered. 2017 maybe a little bit more. I think more importantly in the last 2.5 years, if I can just provide a little color. 45 stores came online within a three mile radius of one of our properties and we still delivered outstanding performance. Within that same three mile ring we see an additional 46 properties come online sometime 2016-2017.","So, yes, in some markets there has been a little disruption of new supply in Denver, Austin, San Antonio. We are feeling the effect. But there are other markets where it is not disruptive because there is virtually no new supply. When you think of Northern California and Southern California we are doing phenomenally well. So, while there is supply, the effect has yet to be felt system-wide. And this is one of the beauties of geographic diversification.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then I was just wondering if you are seeing any change at all in existing renters' behavior as it pertains to rent increases. Are you seeing any change in move outs associated with rent increases at all?","Spencer Kirk","No. Existing customer rate increases continue to work beautifully. No change.","Scott Stubbs","The other thing I would add to that, Todd, is customers are actually staying a little bit longer. We are seeing our length of stay increase.","Todd Thomas","Where is that at today?","Scott Stubbs","You are up by about a month from where they were three to five years ago. So closer to 14 months. That is everyone that has moved-in and moved-out versus everyone that is in your property today.","Todd Thomas","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","George Hoglund","Hi, guys. Just looking at the back half of the year and same-store occupancy. I guess last year, the end of 3Q you had 93.6%. And at the end of 4Q it was 92.9%. So I was wondering as you're from today looking towards the back half of the year? Do you think year-over-year occupancy would be relatively flat? Or do you think you might be able to eke out some gains on a year-over-year basis?","Spencer Kirk","At this point we are assuming that it is going to be flat, zero delta from last year.","George Hoglund","Okay, thanks. And then also on some of the markets that had lower performance this quarter relative to the broader portfolio - obviously we just touched on some of it due to new supply. But are there other factors you were seeing that could be characteristic of just certain individual markets that led to weaker performance? For example, like Memphis?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, I would tell you new supply obviously affects it, but also you have got to look at prior year performance. For instance, Chicago today is not doing great for us. A couple years ago and if you look at a 10-year average Chicago has been very strong for us. So I think that you can't continue to raise rates 16% year after year after year. And so, I think that some of these markets just probably have a little bit of fatigue year-over-year and you are coming up against some very tough comps.","George Hoglund","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Just a question on what you are seeing on the West Coast markets. One of the themes from some of your other REIT non-self-storage appears there's been a weakening in demand, maybe slightly weaker job growth in the Bay Area in San Francisco. Anything you are seeing in the data you look at in terms of traffic or anything like that that gives you a picture of what you are seeing on the ground, whether it is staying still strong or any softening?","Scott Stubbs","We have not seen the softening yet. We have seen it from some of the other property types, we have heard talk about it on their calls and whatnot. But as of today those markets are still very strong for us.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, great. And just a bigger picture question in terms of competition, full service providers. Can you give us any sense of what kind of market share those players may have in some of the top markets like in New York or San Francisco? And any views on potential disruption of that technology or that business viability at this point?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, Juan, it is Spencer. Number one, for the full service valet, concierge, whatever you want to call it, we would say their market share today, to the best of our knowledge, in any market is de minimis. And for this Company we don't believe it is a viable business model.","Juan Sanabria","And why is that? Is it just the cost of transportation or what makes you so confident?","Spencer Kirk","Well, we have studied it extensively. We have looked at the mechanics of what it really takes to provide that full service on demand at a price point that is competitive. And I think, Juan, the fact that none of the large storage REITs made any announcement that they are getting into this ought to be a pretty good indicator that they don't see the dollars out there as well. There have been a lot of potential disruptors that have announced themselves in the past that would cause pain to the storage industry. And for whatever reason it just has not materialized. We still think that storage offers the best value for a customer.","And any time you try to put two people in a truck and transport it across the George Washington Bridge and do so at a cost-effective price point, we can't get there mathematically or economically.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you very much.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Juan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks. Spencer, just a couple of questions. If you go back to the beginning of the year and just remind us, has your supply outlook for the number of facilities coming on this year, has that - I think it may be a little bit increased from what you initially thought or is that the same at around 700? It seems to me that it has gone up but maybe I am remembering it wrong.","Spencer Kirk","I think I gave a range, I don't remember, I would have to look at the transcript, but\u2026","Smedes Rose","I mean I guess my question is do you feel like facilities under construction are just opening faster or is there more, are you guys discovering more on the margin? It seems like overall based on commentary from private participants as well that the pace of supply is starting to increase after many years of having a lot of gating issues. I mean is that something that you would agree with or not?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. I think there is more talk, there is more action and there is more supply which is why if you go to one of my prior questions, it doesn't matter if 700 properties or 800 properties or being built or 1,000 properties are being built. What matters is if those properties are built right across the street or next-door or within one or two miles of your property that you are currently operating. And as I indicated, over a 2.5 year period we only identified 45 properties in our entire portfolio within a three mile ring.","And, Smedes, if you think about a three mile ring in one of the boroughs of New York or downtown San Francisco, your trade area isn't three miles. We were generous on the 45 property count. Your trade area might be a mile or less in a dense metropolitan area. And if you think about 46 properties that we have identified that are permitted and\/or in some stage of construction to come out of the ground in 2016 or 2017 also within that three mile ring, yes, there is competition.","Properties are being built. The question is, when will we feel the impact? And today the impact has been localized to a few specific markets and there are many markets where it is not felt at all. So, we are going to have to wait and see how it plays out. But, yes, there is supply and it is coming. The question is, when will the impact be felt system-wide?","Smedes Rose","Okay, that is helpful. I just wanted to ask you too, as you look at acquisition opportunities, are you seeing any particular difference between kind of primary markets and smaller secondary markets in terms are pricing or maybe that relative quality of portfolios?","Joe Margolis","This is Joe again. Yes, there is a premium for secondary tertiary markets that I think is getting squeezed as people are unable to place their money into primary markets than all of a sudden Raleigh looks good. And there is probably also a premium in terms of quality.","Smedes Rose","Okay. So I mean given that against that background would you be interested in selling, you sold some I saw in the quarter I think. But would you be interested in selling more against that improving pricing in secondary markets?","Joe Margolis","Our sales are driven by our view - one of two things, our view of future growth opportunities, if we feel that there is a market that future growth is not going to be as robust as alternative places we could put that money. And secondly, where we have management inefficiencies. Maybe we bought a portfolio and there is a property that is in a remote area. We don't have sufficient scale to bring the full force of our management machine to - we will put that on a sales list.","Smedes Rose","Okay, that is helpful. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Smedes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of UBS. Sir, your line is now open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys. Scott, you touched on this a little earlier, but I guess I kind of wanted to ask it a little differently. If I go back to the last call you talked about tweaking your model to focus more on occupancy heading into the peak leasing season. Obviously occupancy is still very good at over 93%m especially relative to historical levels. But I think your expectations were for 75 to 100 basis points of occupancy growth this year. So I was just wondering if you could give us some color on maybe what happened here given that it doesn't really sound like it was a supply issue.","Scott Stubbs","Yes, so I mean our models obviously are always going to focus on maximizing revenue. And when we looked at the models early in the year and the end of last year and estimated where the model would take us, we estimated that we would have more occupancy benefit than we have had. The model has taken more rate and not pushed as much towards occupancy. There are certain markets where we have maybe tweaked the model a little bit, in markets such as Denver where we have seen some softening of occupancy.","A couple of other markets where we've seen supply we have had to do the manual inputs into the model rather than - just because things were going on within that submarket or that overall market that the model - it is impossible for the model to read.","Jeremy Metz","Okay, and maybe just sticking with the specific markets, can you just give us a little color on what is going on in Boston and Washington DC? Particularly Boston it seemed like revenue growth decelerated quite a bit. So I don't know if that is maybe just the tougher calms you alluded to earlier there.","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you Boston is one that is up against tougher comps. We have seen some construction but not significant amounts of construction. Boston was a very strong market for us last year. And Washington DC is another market that has never been great. I wouldn't tell you it decelerated significantly, it has been steady.","Jeremy Metz","Okay, and then just one quick one on the expense side. I am guessing it was small, but did you get a benefit this quarter from lower snow cost in the quarter?","Scott Stubbs","We actually had snow costs slightly above where we had estimated. So we had a late storm and then it is timing of some invoices and things like that. We had made some accruals, but our snow was slightly higher than what we were estimating.","Jeremy Metz","All right, thanks.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Jeremy.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. So just going back to rate and particularly just Street rates, you talked obviously about this quarter rate being the primary driver, in then back half no real change in occupancy year-over-year. So just mechanically and maybe strategically in the fourth and the first quarter as we move ahead, how should we think about your ability to push Street rates relative to a year ago, but also just relative to the overall rate?","Really the question being, could we - is this 7% rate growth that you are seeing, could it be tough to do that in sort of 4Q-1Q when you just naturally pull back on rate?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you, Vikram, over time I think it is going to be difficult. Whether that is 4Q or Q1, I don't know. I think it is going to depend a little bit on the strength of markets. But I think things will at some point revert more to the historical norm. I think that is just going to be natural. That is the beauty of a diversified portfolio, some markets will be stronger than others. You have seen some markets revert more to that historical norm already and others are lagging.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just on payroll, I guess your costs were fine. One of your peers had slightly higher cost. I am just wondering as the supply comes on or you have seen at least in certain markets supply come on, any pick up in attrition, maybe managers saying there are other opportunities and just broadly what are you seeing for wages?","Scott Stubbs","Our payroll and our turnover is very similar to prior years and we are not seeing a lot of pressure on our wages. There's been some discussion about minimum wage and it has not become an issue for us just based on where we pay our managers today already.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Vikram.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Wes Golladay","Thank you. Looking at moderating trends, what do you think the new normal I guess 5 to 10-year growth rate is? What is a at trend growth rate that you guys will eventually get to?","Spencer Kirk","So, Wes, it is Spencer. Let me give you just a little performance. You have got revenue expenses, I am going to focus on NOI, because that is really where the rubber meets the road. Over the last 10 years the simple average for NOI growth for the entire sector has been 5.3%. For Extra Space during that same 10-year period it has been 6.7%. The fact that we just posted 9.4% ought to tell you that even with some moderation we are still way above any historical norm. And I don't see us falling off a cliff by any stretch.","Storage, if you go back to 1998 when I started with the Company, was used by about 6% of the U.S. population. Today that number is more than 9% of the U.S. population. One of the questions is, does that top out at 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%? I don't know, but I think that at the end of the day we are in a really good position to maximize revenue.","And as I tried to state in my closing comments, look, NOI is only one contributor to our overall FFO performance. You look at joint ventures, the most successful acquisition program in the industry and all the other elements that I enumerated which I am not going to repeat, they all contribute to what we are trying to do and that is grow FFO. And we have got multiple levers that we are pulling to produce the industry's best FFO growth year in and year out.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thank you for that. And then looking at Atlanta, that market has been doing fantastic for six quarters in a row. Anything special going on there? Is it just new I guess properties entering the comp pool or is it just a very good market?","Scott Stubbs","It is just a good market for us. I think again, it is the cyclical nature of it. I think Atlanta is doing really well today. I think next year it could slow a little.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Wes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Burke of Green Street Advisors. Sir, your line is now open.","Ryan Burke","Thank you. To try and encapsulate some of the comments that you have already made from the perspective of moderating growth. Would you say that you are more concerned looking forward about potential changes in consumer demand or are you more concerned about the impact of new supply call it 12 to 24 months out.","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you it is probably - I think supply will have some impact but I think also it is somewhat the fatigue within a market. At some point you can't continue to push rates at 9%.","Ryan Burke","Okay. And you are still acquiring in scale, you had a big increase in additions to your CofO development pipeline this quarter. Does a trend towards moderating NOI growth change your outlook for external growth, acquisitions and\/or development looking out beyond 2016?","Joe Margolis","So we have been successful in keeping up our acquisition pace primarily through off-market transactions and transactions we are able to generate through our management plus or joint venture pipeline.","Pricing on the open market, for some of the reasons you mentioned, is difficult for us to get our minds around in general. But we still think that these other avenues of growth are going to be available to us and will continue.","Ryan Burke","Thanks, Joe. One last quick one. Are there any discernible trends in terms of why I would call it smaller owners are selling, particularly in your third-party managed asset pool?","Joe Margolis","Prices are good particularly in the stores we manage. We have been able to take their NOI up to very attractive levels. And it is a good time to be a seller.","Ryan Burke","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo Sir, your line is now open.","Todd Stender","Thanks guys. Just looking at revenue management, can you share some of the specifics that revenue management was telling you in Q2, just as far as pushing rate, potentially the expense of occupancy?","And as you look at the second half of the year, we're right now at peak season. Anything you can share from the past and the future about what revenue management is kind of pointing to right now?","Spencer Kirk","So, Todd, it is Spencer. As you look at our revenue management algorithm which has 56 different inputs, the whole philosophical underpinning is not about rate or occupancy, it is about maximizing revenue for a particular unit size code and a particular property, based on what we know about those elements that are under consideration. So it is not rate, it is not occupancy, it is revenue.","Todd Stender","That is helpful. Thank you, Spencer. How about - we got an update in June at NAREIT about SmartStop. Any trends you can share, any updates? And then when does that hit the same-store pool?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. I would tell you in terms of trends in the updated NAREIT I would tell you it continues to be ahead in revenues and behind on expenses. So when we said it is performing within our expectations that is in terms of NOI.","So revenues are better, expenses are higher. The majority of those expenses are timing. We probably spent more earlier on R&M and on some of the office supplies, repair and maintenance type supplies than we originally estimated. And we hope to recover some of those throughout the year. But overall revenues are strong. And then in terms of same-store pool, it will go in next year, January 2017.","Todd Stender","Okay, thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato of BMO Capital. Sir, your line is now open.","Paul Adornato","Thanks. One source of confusion among analysts and investors I think is just getting consistency in terms of the number of new stores opening, the supply pipeline. And I know that you guys, I believe, have been trying to square and come up with either some sort of cooperative view or some third party sources. I was wondering if you could provide an update on those efforts.","Spencer Kirk","So, Paul, it is Spencer. Just a couple of observations. Number one, we do triangulate to the best of our ability using broker data, our own external field observations, the hardware vendors' data and just what we hear from other sources to come up with an estimate.","And when we talked about the 700 properties being built in the United States at this time, you have to recognize there are 14 states we don't even do business in. And back to my earlier comment, it really doesn't matter what the number is, it just matters what the number of properties are that are being built within your competitive trade ring, whether it is 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles.","And I don't know how as an industry at this point we provide something that all analysts can triangulate on, but I think each of the individual public companies have generally been guiding toward what is coming up out of the ground that is within the trade area, because if it is not in the trade area it doesn't matter.","Paul Adornato","Got it. Thanks, thanks for that color. Appreciate it.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Sir, your line is now open","Jonathan Hughes","Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. I know you mentioned earlier that SmartStop was I think ahead of revenues and behind on expenses. But could you give us an update on maybe where occupancy is today?","Scott Stubbs","I actually don't have that right in front of me, but I know it has been trending in line with our estimates.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay. And then, Scott, you mentioned occupancy is now expected to be flat for the year. As tenants are getting stickier and use of storage becomes adopted by more people, do you think occupancy could surpass maybe 95% in the next several years? And is that 95% the max or are you at max occupancy right now in terms of the same-store pool?","Scott Stubbs","Our philosophy and our understanding is we think that we are approaching max occupancy. And the reason being is it takes time for units to turn. They typically sit vacant for a certain number of days before the new renter moves in. They don't necessarily pass each other in the hall as one is moving out and the next is moving in.","And that comes from a lot of factors whether it is demand or whether that is our reservation policy at the time, where we allow someone to reserve a unit for maybe 7 days or 14 days depending on the occupancy of that unit. And then that reservation may or may not turn into a rental. So, at some point you are theoretically full, we have estimated that to be around 95%, 96%. So, 95%, is it possible? Yes. Right now we are not estimating we will hit it this year.","Jonathan Hughes","Okay, thank you for the color. Appreciate it.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.","Sir, your line is now open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just in terms of the acquisition pipeline, I understand you guys are looking at a lot and being more disciplined about what you want to buy. But can you kind of just maybe help frame maybe kind of what is on the market either actively or maybe quietly? And just try and help us kind of think through how much pricing I guess has changed over the last year or so on terms of cap rates?","Spencer Kirk","There is a good amount of product on the market. I would say that a lot of it is of lesser quality. We think cap rates have compressed a little bit this year, maybe 25 or 50 basis points. Clearly there is a big premium for portfolios, we saw that in the large portfolio transaction that was previously announced by one of our peers. And it is just - it is a competitive landscape. The secret of self-storage is out and there is a lot of money chasing it.","Steve Sakwa","Right. So I guess, Spencer, just if pricing is getting harder or more expensive on each deal, does that mean that kind of return hurdles have to come down in order for you to make these deals [tensile]? Are you willing to just accept kind of lower IRRs today than you were say a year or two ago? Or are you just able to squeeze more out of the portfolios and get better growth in order to maintain those high unlevered IRRs?","Spencer Kirk","I think I would answer yes to most of your questions [with that], Steve. The fact of the matter is the market is red-hot and for Extra Space, looking at 630 assets that are not wholly owned that are in our system to us is a meaningful acquisition pipeline that we can go after for years to come.","And I believe that every market travels in cycles. And although things might be extremely competitive today, that necessarily won't be the case in future years. So for us, we are going to continue to use a multi-pronged approach to growing this Company. And I have talked about several growth levers that we are employing to make sure that we deliver the industry's best result.","Scott Stubbs","Steve, I would maybe at one other possibility to kind of your realm of possibilities there and that is the deal doesn't actually sell. At some point pricing will get to that point if it continues to not meet people's IRR hurdles and their return hurdles. It is possible things don't transact.","Joe Margolis","And I guess lastly, as was previously mentioned, you have seen us do a few more transactions in a JV structure because we get a premium return through that structure, which helps kind of bridge the gap between market pricing and the return that we are trying to get for our shareholders.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks. That is it for me.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Sir, your line is now open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Just a couple quick ones here. In regards to the properties where you do have new supply competing with you, I think you said 45 properties within a 3 mile radius. When you look at the dynamics of what you can to with pricing and those types of markets where there is more supply coming, how do Street rates or promotions or a combination of compare to what you said earlier about achieving about a 7% Street rate with relatively flat promotions? When you look at those micro markets how much does it differ?","Scott Stubbs","So it obviously it differs by market by property. If you look at where we compete with brand-new properties that are opening, I will give you a couple of examples. We had one up in Harlem where we had a property open by one of our peers, a large property that filled up quickly. Our properties still grew at almost 10% that year.","Now, that is not to say it couldn't have growing at 15%, but we still had a very solid growth. We have had another property or two where for a year's time we had flat or slightly negative growth, but we haven't seen them fall off the map by any sense here.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay and just a quick question on your balance sheet. You have about 22% floating rate debt given the interest rate environment. Any thoughts on maybe changing that?","Scott Stubbs","So, we are pretty happy with where we are. We don't see it going up significantly. But if you look at the markets historically at least recently the bets on variable-rate debt have been right. And we feel like it is at a point that is good for our shareholders as well as prudent.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thanks again.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Ki Bin.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of George Hoglund of Jefferies. Sir your line is now open.","George Hoglund","So, you had mentioned earlier that one of the biggest headwinds is the renter fatigue. And I guess when you look at - I guess that would be for the same-store portfolio. When you look at what is in the non-same-store portfolio, I guess including SmartStop, do you view a large difference in terms of how much renter fatigue is in that non-same-store portfolio? I guess that is part one.","And then part two is I guess for new properties that come on line from the CofO deals, obviously no renter fatigue in a new property. But do you see sort of more I guess rent growth potential going forward with these newly opened properties?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you in terms of properties we buy that were not managed as well as CofO properties there is more runway. Typically these properties are at lower rates than our properties, so we have the ability to push them for longer. And typically in a CofO store we open at a rate that is below market and so we have the ability to push rates longer because it takes them a little bit of time to get them up to Street rates or what are normal market rates.","Spencer Kirk","George, it is Spencer. There is one other thing on this renter fatigue. I wouldn't take it too far because more than 50% of our customers walking in the door have never used self-storage ever. So they don't even know what they are up against. So it is the more mature properties where you have got a lot of really long-term tenants that you might start to feel it.","George Hoglund","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Jeff Norman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Nova. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company\u2019s business.","These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the Company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, Wednesday, August 2, 2017. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter and we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year. In the quarter, we saw a healthy demand and steady rental volume which outpaced that of second quarter 2016. We maintained our same-store occupancy gap and ended the quarter of 94.4%, 70 basis points ahead of where we were in 2016. We were also able to grow street rates, which together with our occupancy gains increased same-store revenue 5.2%.","We demonstrated great expense control with a 1.1% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 7.7%. We also saw growth outside of our same-store pool, which contributed to an increase of 16% in FFO per share as adjusted. All of our markets show positive revenue growth with the exception of Houston, which was effectively flat. The markets in the western states continue to perform particularly well, many with revenue growth in high single-digits. Out top MSAs have been affected differently by the current development cycle and we believe that we continue to benefit from our highly diversified portfolio. ","In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party management platform, bringing the total additions to 54 for the year. These managed stores provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, efficiencies that come from scale, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities. ","We recently held our 2017 Partner\u2019s Conference in Park City, Utah where over 150 partners joined us for two days of meetings. This is the best turnout in our history and our managed pipeline for the next six months is the largest it has ever been. ","However, we were recently informed that one of our partners Strategic Storage Trust formerly known as SmartStop has decided to internalize management and its 94 stores will be leaving Extra Space\u2019s system effective October 1. ","Although loss of these stores is unfortunate we have over 100 properties scheduled to be added in the back half of 2017 the majority of which are in higher rent per square foot markets than the managed SmartStop properties.","For example, we added an 11-store portfolio in New York City just last week. We remain enthusiastic about our third-party management platform and expect it to continue to be a valuable part of our growth strategy.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thank you, Joe. Last night we ported FFO as adjusted of $1.09 per share exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.03, the beat was the result of property performance, tenant reinsurance and management fees. Repairs and maintenance, payroll and insurance have been lower than expected and contributed to the expense fee. ","We also incurred a one-time $6 million loss related to the write-down on three parcels of land, two of which are under contract for sale. ","Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 94.4% a 70-basis point year-over-year increase. While occupancy is just one driver of revenue, we are encouraged by the strong rental activity and peak occupancy levels we\u2019re seeing this summer.","We were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single-digits during the quarter and discounts while up year-over-year remain at levels below historical norms. We continue our existing customer rent increase program without changes.","During the quarter, we did not access our ATM. Acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. We also completed a 10-year $300 million private placement at 3.95%. The notes have a delay drop feature and they will be issued on August 24. The private placement proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions, loan maturities and to pay down revolving balances. These notes help us achieve our goals of increasing our average debt term, our fixed rate debt ratio and the size of our unsecured pool.","Based on the performance year-to-date we raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 5%. We lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.75% to 2.5% as a result our annual NOI guidance increased to 4.75% to 6%.","We reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million comprised of $325 million in wholly on stores and $200 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments with approximately $75 million in capital that would be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $200 million is currently close under agreement. We are in discussions on several other acquisitions opportunities and our guidance assumes the remaining $200 million will close late in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.","As a result of the Q2 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO\u2019s adjusted guidance to $4.25 to $4.32 per share. This includes the Q4 impact of losing the managed SmartStop stores. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value added acquisitions for a total of $0.15.","I\u2019ll now turn the time back over to Joe.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Scott. Coming into 2017 we received many questions related to demand, new supply, external growth and our ability to increase revenue and FFO. We are more than half way through 2017 and to a very large extent our predictions related to these topics have been accurate.","First, demand has been steady, stable demand has led to positive growth in rates, rentals and occupancy resulting in solid revenue growth. The rate of our revenue growth is moderated since the beginning of the year and as our guidance implies, will moderate further in the second half of the year.","However, our systems have proved adept at adjusting rate, occupancy discounts in marketing spend to maximize revenue in the current environment. Despite headwinds in difficult comps, we still expect stores to produce some of the best revenue growth among REITs and we expect to lead the pack in this sector.","Second, new supply while present, has been manageable so far, several markets have felt the impact of new development while others have remained relatively immune. Most markets continue to see revenue growth and our performance continues to be solid due to our diversified portfolio.","Construction pipelines have been pushed back as projects are taking longer to get done and the fallout of projects and planning remained significant. ","Third, we will have both challenges and opportunities related to external growth. Pricing for marketed acquisitions remains at elevated levels, sales volume is down significantly and we have not seen sufficient long-term value to increase our bids to meet seller expectations.","Most acquisitions have come from existing relationships rather than on the open market. However, our prediction that we could see an increase in demand for third party management has come to fruition and we expect our pipeline to remain robust.","Finally, we continue to produce outsized FFO growth. Our sector leading same store performance together with accretive acquisitions, tenant insurance, third party management and an efficient balance sheet have resulted in another strong quarter of FFO as adjusted growth of 16%. We are focused on being responsible stewards of our shareholders capital and providing the best long-term return on that capital in this sector.","Let\u2019s now turn the time over to Jeff to start the question-and-answer session.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Joe. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows we will address following questions, once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","And with that, we\u2019ll turn it over to Nova to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Juan Sanabria","Hi good morning. I was just hoping if you guys could speak to what your thoughts are on the slowdown that\u2019s baked into the second half guidance for same-store revenues and how we should think about that into \u201818? And if you could also as part of that give us any sense of how July is trending particularly with one of your larger peers commenting about cutting rate significantly? ","Joe Margolis","Okay, I hope I can remember all those questions. So not really prepared to talk about \u201818, the slowdown for the second half of the year is partially due to a lessening time which is impact of the prior year's acquisitions as we discussed. So, we get a greater benefit from our acquisition, our 2015 acquisitions earlier in the year and the later year and secondly it is just a slowdown in revenue growth in the market.","July is generally a continuation of what we\u2019ve seen in the year. There is nothing significant to report in change in July. And what was the last, am I missing one question there?","Juan Sanabria ","No, I think you got it, have you changed your guidance for SmartStop while we\u2019re on that topic in terms of the contribution in the same-store revenues for the year?","Joe Margolis","No, our guidance always implied or predicted that we would have the greatest impact in the first quarter and if that impact would diminish as the year went on to when by the end of the year we expected that portfolio to be performing at or around portfolio averages.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And then just one follow-up on the same-store expense obviously a big top versus the first half implied. If you could just give us some sense of what\u2019s driving that and the visibility into those expense increases implied by guidance?","Scott Stubbs","So, we don\u2019t see a big expense increase in the third or fourth quarter. It\u2019s more a comparison to last year. So last year during the third quarter our expenses grew at about 1.5% we are expecting those to grow more normalized rates with property taxes growing 5% to 6% and payroll growing more than inflationary. ","In addition, in the fourth quarter last year we saw expected decrease by about 2%. So, year-over-year that\u2019s why it\u2019s looking like expenses in the third and fourth quarter elevated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta","So, I was wondering in terms of markets, are there any markets that are ahead of your initial \u201817 guidance and any markets that are behind?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you that I think California continues to probably exceed expectations. In terms of markets being behind, I don\u2019t think we are surprised by any of the markets. I would tell you it\u2019s somewhat the benefit of the diversified portfolio as one market goes up and other typical goes down.","Joe Margolis","Maybe a market that\u2019s underperforming first guidance for us would be New York City.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And I guess as a follow up in terms of renewals are you seeing any push back from your existing tenants from any of your markets?","Joe Margolis","No. There\u2019s really been no changes in customer behavior with respect to the response to our rate increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Hey. Good morning, guys. Can you talk about your customer acquisition cost, it seems like your market expenses really low concerning you built occupancy and then to bolt on to that, will you see any reallocation of the platform cost from the SmartStop JV, for the JV management go to the consolidated, when will they leave the system later in the year?","Joe Margolis","So, our marketing spend is just one tool we used to maximize revenue, the others tools being rate discount and occupancy. And when we believe it\u2019s been beneficial to maximize revenue to increase marketing spend we will do so. I would not be surprised to see us use this lever sometime in the second half of the year, we feel we need to, but we\u2019ve been able to achieve the results we\u2019ve achieved while staying on budgeting in marketing so far. And could you\u2026","Scott Stubbs","SmartStop, so in terms of the SmartStop cost and the losing those stores we have 100 stores coming on in the next six months, so we expect those stores to absorb some of that or be able to allocate the stores across the new stores. In addition, we have some termination fees, associated with these properties that should help soften the blow in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gwen Clark of Evercore.","Gwen Clark","Hi. Good afternoon. Can you give us some update on the 30-property portfolio that you guys have on the market?","Joe Margolis","Sure, we\u2019re making good progress on the recapitalization of the 36 properties that we had on the market. We\u2019ve selected a joint venture partner and we\u2019re on to the next stage of documenting the deal and we\u2019ll be happy to provide all the details once it closes. We expect it to close prior to the end of the year.","Gwen Clark","And can you just talk about the use of the proceeds and whether you think the pricing on assets you\u2019ve purchased would essentially be equal or better than what you\u2019re selling?","Joe Margolis","Yeah. We expect to use the proceeds to fund acquisitions and our goal is to purchase higher quality, better located, higher long-term returning properties.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. So just wanted to follow up on a question related to one of your peers indicating they would seriously cut rate in the rest of the summer months. So, I\u2019m trying to get a sense how -- can you give some maybe anecdote color or just from a strategic perspective, how would you directly respond to rates being simply cut by peers that are located close to your properties and maybe just as some of the new supply is coming on, tactically what are you doing to kind of pull customers to your facilities?","Joe Margolis","So, our revenue management systems are designed to react to what\u2019s going on in the market and what is happening at an individual property and it\u2019s possible that a competitor could cut rate significantly and have very minimal impact on us because of other factors. But if it does have an impact, our systems will respond and maximize the revenue at that store.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just going back on the expenses, what specifically changed around some repairs and maintenance and labor cost that sort of some budget you saw the numbers negative for the first two quarters. I am just trying to understand what changed. ","Scott Stubbs","So, they are some controllable and some uncontrollable. So, we had a very mild snow winter and that helped us on our repair and he maintenance, and we also tightened our belts a little bit. We went and renegotiated all our landscape contracts, about 9% reduction in landscape cost without any change in service. We took a good hard look knowing this would be a tough year and we are able to find some savings. ","Joe Margolis","On the payroll side, we have normalized hours for our stores as we have created efficiencies for our site managers whether it\u2019s through the systems and the ability to attract customers in different areas we have normalized those hours across all properties.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. So, we should expect that the benefit on those two-line items should continue in the back half.","Joe Margolis","To a lesser degree we started much of the payroll change in end of the summer early fall last year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund of Jefferies.","George Hoglund ","Hey. Good morning guys. So just first on the Strategic Storage Trust are internalizing, was their decision just purely by they had reached critical mass, where it made sense to internalize? And then are there any other sort of large portfolios of assets under third party management where we could see that happen to someone else?","Joe Margolis","Yes, we think told by Strategic that this was a decision to internal management based on their internal business goals have nothing to do with performance or dissatisfaction with us in any way.","We had two other owners that we managed large portfolios with. We have the same risk with those portfolios because SmartStop had an operating platform before we purchased their portfolio. They kept many of those resources in place. The other large portfolios we manage, well they don\u2019t have any operational management experience or history. So, I'll be very surprised that we\u2019re in a position to do this. ","George Hoglund","Okay. And then just one thing on pricing, has there been any divergence during the course of the year in terms of internet rate and walk-in rate?","Scott Stubbs","Year-over-year you may see some variability but in current year it has not changed significantly. But we are moving those all the time and when I say by year-over-year is maybe last year the difference was 5% this year is 15% so year-over-year it looks different. But remember the difficulty when it comes to our revenues at the stores and our pricing on the stores in the current year is we\u2019re coming off two of the best years we\u2019ve ever seen in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of UBS. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. So, supply has been one of the bigger topics for this sector lately. One of your peers talked about supply likely peaking this year as far as impacted in another I think [ph] it\u2019s next year. Wondering which side of the coin you chose?","Joe Margolis","Respectfully I think it\u2019s not a very hopeful question, right. The gross numbers of 600 to 800 this year and next year, it really doesn\u2019t matter, it hopefully gets delivered in December this year or January next year. So, the gross amount of supply across the country is sort of interesting but this is very much a micro market business. And what we\u2019re very focused on trying to understand is, what\u2019s happening in the markets where our stores are and how do we react to maximize revenue. That being said, I think the peak impact that\u2019s what's you're looking for, I think the impact will be greater next year than this year, because you have the cumulative effect of things that we delivered in \u201817 as well as in \u201818.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then on the second half of the year. Could you just tell us what your expectation is for occupancy, just the year-over-year delta in the third and fourth quarter?","Scott Stubbs","So, it\u2019s lessening, so the SmartStop stores, they come up to the average, it will lessen, so by the end of the year it is negligible. We expect these SmartStop stores and the other 2015 acquisitions to be performing at our current portfolio level by the end of the year and so there is a moderate benefit throughout the year but by the end of the year flat.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Market.","Todd Thomas","Hi. Good morning. First not sure if I missed this, but can you comment on occupancy at the end of July and where that stood year-over-year?","Joe Margolis","We would tell you that occupancy continues to hold and July is not performing significantly different than the rest of the quarter, the rest of the year.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then in terms of asking rents, you maintained higher asking rents throughout the portfolio year-over-year, which you mentioned and others are seeing asking rents, decrease year-over-year at this point in the cycle. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything that you can speak to that might explain that difference?","Joe Margolis","Well, it could be different companies are using a different mix of rent than the other factors to get to revenue. It could be individual market exposure and it could be properties within that market that are more or less affected by new construction or better or worse located.","Todd Thomas","Okay. Do you expect to be able to maintain higher year-over-year asking rents, in the back half of the year, just given the slowdown that you mentioned?","Joe Margolis","We would like to be able to do that, if that is the way to maximize revenue and if we need to lower rate to increase occupancy or not spend as much on discount and other things. Whatever the right formula is for a particular market or property to maximize revenue, that\u2019s what we will pursue.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And just one quick last one also a follow-up. Just about public storages expected rent cuts in some markets, which they mentioned as of last Thursday I believe. I\u2019m not clear, I\u2019m not sure I heard whether or not you are seeing that decrease in rents in any markets and what the magnitude of those cuts may be if you could comment on that?","Joe Margolis","It is a property-by-property analysis and we\u2019ll see public storage or someone else do something that will cause us to react because if the effect on our property or we will see public storage or someone else do something that has absolutely no effect on our store and we are still able to operate it the way we want to. It really depends on the individual situation of the property.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. ","Todd Stender","Hi thanks. Joe, I think in your opening remarks you mentioned landing a third-party management contract with a New York City operator. Can you give more details on that and who it is and where they are located?","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s Tuck-It-Away stores and they are in New York and they are in Burroughs of New York.","Todd Stender","And they will be re-branded extra space just like the rest of the properties?","Joe Margolis","They were re-branded last Wednesday all the signs went up Wednesday and Thursday and they will be operated under the Extra Space platform just like all the other stores in our system.","Todd Stender ","Okay, thanks. And just looking at acquisition volumes, your guidance is saying 300 million, I wanted to see what\u2019s in that number, if you just look at your straight acquisitions, if I have my numbers right here about 115 million of stuff that\u2019s either closed or going to close which suggests a pretty good ramp for the rest of the year, are those deals included in that, what else is in there?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, so it\u2019s 325 for wholly owned acquisitions and we see those deals are included in there if they are wholly-owned. We have a number of things in process that we hope come to fruition. And if we are able to do that and meet our guidance, that will be a good thing. But if we can\u2019t -- we are not going to buy things just to meet guidance. And if we don\u2019t meet our guidance it\u2019s not going to have any effect on our performance or our ability to hit guidance this year.","So, we left that number out partially based on what we are working and in hope we make it. But again, we are going to find things which is in the best interest of our shareholders not meet some guidance number we put out there.","Scott Stubbs","One another point of clarification Todd, the 325 wholly owned we have also have 75 million of JV investment to total the 400 million and of that JV investment most of that is identified. So, the 75 million plus the 115 million you referred to is kind of what\u2019s either identified or closed to-date.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim ","Thanks, and good morning out there. I am not sure if I missed this but did you comment on the street rate growth you experienced in the quarter and maybe in July?","Scott Stubbs","So, street rate year-to-date have been up 3% to 5% -- just over 5%. The actual achieved rates are going to be lower than that. Our achieved rate year-to-date have been 0% to 3% and I am getting a range because it really depends on what specials we are running, what tests we are doing but achieved rates have been our street rates but our street rates continue to be in that 3% to 5% year-over-year.","Ki Bin Kim ","And how that\u2019s trended in July, same or towards the lower?","Scott Stubbs","No significant changes in July to-date in terms of operations. ","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And for argument sake, if the achieve rate remains at 0% for the foreseeable future and there is no change to the [indiscernible] customer rate increase program in terms of increased frequency or acceptance rate. How long does it take for things or revenues to follow suite and get close to that 0% number? And just trying to get a sense of the wind down of the contribution program if how long it helps?","Joe Margolis","Yeah. Just to make sure I understand the question, are you asking how long our current achieved rates to take the flow through to become our rent growth in the future?","Ki Bin Kim","Yeah, and assuming if there is no change in changing the ECRI program.","Joe Margolis","Yeah. So, first of all I mean things have changed, it\u2019s hard to really make that assumption we have a lot of variables, things are changing all the time. I would tell you things will flow through in four to eight quarters. You know at some point your rates today become your rates in the future, but one point I would clarify is achieved rates have been better than zero.","Ki Bin Kim","Yeah, I know that, that was a theoretical question. And do you know what percent of proposed impacted by new supply in the way you guys look at it?","Joe Margolis","In terms of new supply, I would tell you that if you look at our revenues, about two thirds of our revenues come from markets that have somewhat elevated supply, but then I would tell you, you need to be very careful on assuming the two thirds of our properties have a new supply and new competitors. For instance, in Dallas, Dallas is the market that has elevated supply but our properties in South Dallas are almost unaffected. So, it\u2019s very, very difficult to give you that number and have it be meaningful just because of the impact to supply and the assumptions people then take from there.","Operator","And we have a follow up from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Thanks for the time. Just hoping you guys could comment a little bit more on where you see cap rates, you know deals are down but kind of what the spread is and just commentary on cap rates where you see them for prime and kind of the secondary markets?","Joe Margolis","Yeah, sure as you point out sales volumes are down significantly and we see a number of deals just get taken off the market because the spread is too wide. So, we have fewer data points. I would also point out that most of what we see on the market is of lesser quality even in terms of quality of markets. Then we would like so, it\u2019s difficult to compare those cap rates to previous cap rates which might has been better quality product. ","That being said we don\u2019t see a significant expansion of cap rates. There is still a lot of equity chasing this product type, fundamentals are still very good. Things are highly occupied and rent growth is going in the right direction. So, I think all that capital is supporting prices then there might be some modest increase in cap rates, but it\u2019s really hard to pin down.","Juan Sanabria","Okay and then you noted that supply was going to be or has been pushed back in delays and starts and fallouts as well as the potential future developments. Any numbers around that or any markets in particular that stand out in terms of first half versus second half spread down versus your initial expectations that what would be delivered?","Joe Margolis","Yeah, I could tell you a couple of data points, I don\u2019t know if it will give you your full answer, but we currently have a little over 350 development properties in our management plus pipeline and that number has grown a little bit but has always been a pretty significant number. And the fallout rate we see on those properties is about half. So that maybe an over inflated number because the public storages of the world don\u2019t ask us [indiscernible] their developments but that\u2019s a good data point.","I would also tell you that markets are in different stages of the development cycle. So, we look at Chicago and we are tracking 78 projects in Chicago, the majority of them have already been delivered and the pipeline is getting smaller. And you compare that to Miami where many more in the development process that have been delivered. And so, we kind of look at markets that way and feel that in some markets like Miami more of the impact is coming where a market like Chicago hopefully were past the great point of impact. We are actually seeing that in our numbers as well.","Juan Sanabria ","Was that 50% fallout similar to last year?","Scott Stubbs","Yes.","Juan Sanabria ","Okay. And then just one last question for me. You guys talked about demand being steady to up. Any numbers around that in terms of where the call volumes or any way to get a sense of the robustness of that?","Scott Stubbs","Without giving numbers, I would tell you we are citing that from our rental volume, our web searches and our call center volume.","Operator","And our next follow-up comes from the line of Gwen Clark of Evercore.","Gwen Clark","Hi, guys. I\u2019ve two quick ones. First, what percentage of your first half FFO came from the SmartStop contracts? And then also in the guidance when you considered changing the same-store pool, you referenced 50 basis points from SmartStop, is that in the updated guidance also?","Joe Margolis","So, make sure I understand your question. You are asking what percentage of our -- or how many cents of FFO in the first half came from the SmartStop management contract?","Gwen Clark","Yes, then that income, I assume it\u2019s really small.","Scott Stubbs","It\u2019s small and we have never broken it out after that level in terms of the exact profitability for management business and we prefer not to.","I am sorry the second question is?","Joe Margolis","And I guess I also say, at the risk of repeating ourselves, we have sufficient stores that we will be putting on line in the second half to replace all of the SmartStop stores. So, we are not going to take a step backwards, obviously we would rather not lose the SmartStop store and our growth would be greater but we are not going to take a step backwards.","Gwen Clark","Okay and then for the guidance the 50 basis points from SmartStop acquisition, is that still in the updated range?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, so SmartStop it\u2019s not just SmartStop but the 2015 acquisitions continue to benefit. At the start of the year was 110 basis points in revenue. This quarter it was 90 and we assume that will continue to go down and below [ph] for an average of 50 to 75 basis points for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citigroup.","Smedes Rose ","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask you on the development side. Are you seeing any change in the availability of capital or hearing anything in terms of bank's willingness to lend in the space now?","Joe Margolis","I think availability of debt capital is a constraint on development now and obviously strong well capitalized developers can get loans and we see local banks still in some of the cap curve [ph] but absolutely we see I think that capital is a constraint.","Smedes Rose ","Okay. And then I just -- thank you. I wanted to ask you on your management platform just as a reminder, when someone does join is there a minimum period that they have to -- that they sign a contract for or can they just kind of give a months' notice or how does that exit process work?","Joe Margolis","So, people can leave our management platform anytime because they want to internalize management like the first situation or they want to sell it, but there is a termination fee that amortizes over time and compensates us for someone meeting before the term of the contract is over.","Smedes Rose ","Okay. Thank you. And the termination fees would be included in your guidance through the back half of the year or for the fourth quarter right now?","Joe Margolis","Yes. The termination fees we expect to receive from strategic is included in our guidance.","Operator","And we have a follow up from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Just a couple of quick ones here. Is there anything inherently you\u2019re doing differently versus peers that\u2019s allowing you to keep a little bit more of an elevated things [ph] of revenue run rate? And because you\u2019re decelerating at a slower pace, so just curious if you can provide any commentary around that?","Joe Margolis","Yeah. I hope so and we certainly wouldn\u2019t discuss it on a conference call.","Ki Bin Kim","Yeah, don\u2019t want you to [indiscernible] but I just want to see [indiscernible] get your thoughts on it. ","But a second question, it seems like one of the hitting continence of storage is the bays loss and inventory term. So, when you actually find out a customer has left and the days it takes to release it, has there been any noticeable change in that? Does it stick over the past couple of years?","Joe Margolis","No, I mean it\u2019s markedly different during times of the year maybe going from 30 days average in the winter months to closer to 15 in the summer, but it\u2019s been very consistent.","Operator","And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time I would like to turn the call back to Joe Margolis, CEO, for closing remarks.","Joe Margolis","I want to thank everyone for their participation and interest in Extra Space and I hope everyone has a good day. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the call. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."],"8543":["Extra Space Storage, Inc.

My name is Glenn and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I will now like to turn the conference over to your host for today Mr. Clint Halverson. Please proceed sir.","Clint Halverson","Thank you, Glenn. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's third quarter 2013 conference call. In addition to our press release, we've furnished unaudited, supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.","Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, Tuesday, October 29, 2013.","The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk "," ","Good afternoon. The self storage industry finds itself in a great operating environment. New supply remains low and customer demand remains stable, occupancies are at historically high levels and discounting is at record lows. While these are certainly buoyant times for storage operators we are not complacent and we continue to leverage our sophisticated platform and unique structure to produce double digit FFO growth. Excluding one time acquisition related charges our year-over-year FFO growth was up 21% for the quarter. ","Since our IPO in 2004 we have grown our footprint by over 700%, we hit a significant milestone as we finished the quarter with over 1,000 Extra Space branded properties. We continue to be disciplined and creative in our approach to acquiring properties both in the open market and in the off market. Year-to-date we have purchased 30 assets for over 290 million and we have an additional 40 assets under contract for over 240 million. ","In addition year-to-date we have also added 72 branded assets to our management program for a total of 253 managed assets. Our growth is due in large part to a long history of building and cultivating mutually beneficial relationships. We will continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities to increase shareholder value. ","I will now turn the time over to Karl.","Karl Haas ","Thanks Spence. Third quarter occupancy remained at record high levels. We ended the quarter at 90.6% up 1.7% over last year, street rates were up around 3% during the quarter, discounts to new customers were down by 12%. As a result we had same store revenue growth of 7.8% for the quarter. We saw expenses trending towards more normalized levels; increases were due to growth in payroll, insurance, repairs and maintenance expenses.","Net operating income for the quarter was 9.7% and we are on track to have one of our best years ever. With that I will turn it over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs ","Thanks, Karl. Last night we reported FFO of $0.46 per share, which includes a non-recurring expense of $0.08 from the extinguishment of debt on All Aboard transaction. Also included in FFO was a one time benefit of $0.02 from recent debt modifications. Adjusting for these one-time events FFO was $0.52 per share. FFO as adjusted was $0.57 per share when you adjust for the one time benefit from the debt modification we ended at $0.55 per share.","We had another good quarter for acquisitions. During the quarter we purchased 22 assets for $215 million located in Arizona and California. 20 of the properties acquired were from the All Aboard transaction in California. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed on two additional properties for $18 million located in Georgia and North Carolina.","As of today, we have an additional 40 assets under contract for just over $241 million. It is anticipated that these acquisitions will close by year end. Based on our acquisition activity and our operational performance we have increased our full year 2013 FFO guidance to be from $1.95 to $1.97 per share.","This estimate includes non-cash interest expense, acquisition related cost and onetime charges. When adjusted for this items FFO is estimated to be from 2.09 to 2.11 for the full year. I'll now turn the time back to Spencer for some closing remarks. ","Spencer Kirk ","Thanks Scott. I want to recognize the efforts of all of our hard working employees that collectively generated this quarter's outstanding results. We are committed to keeping our focus on the operational excellence in the growth of Extra Space. I'd now like to turn the time over to Clint to start Q&A.","Clint Halverson ","","Thanks Spence. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s question. I'd simply ask that everyone keep your initial questions limited to two, if time allows, we'll address follow on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions. With that we'd like to turn it over Glen to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","","Hey guys. Sure seems like everything is going well for you guys. Can you talk about new supply as maybe a potential chink in the armor looking forward in terms of the industry outlook? ","Spencer Kirk ","Good afternoon Michael, it's Spencer. It's really interesting I went to the SSA trade show in Las Vegas and development of course was a very hot topic. But if I could say alright, this was the actual conversation, how many of you folks have actually gone down to Home Depot and bought a shovel. Well the audience have people saying they\u2019re getting the development game narrowed pretty dramatically. And then when you asked the follow up question, alright those of you that did buy a shovel how many of you have actually stuck it in mother Earth and turned over some dirt, and it further narrowed. So I think there is an awful lot of interest Michael. I would say there is not so much action. Here and there we are seeing development starts, but as we\u2019ve said on many, many calls right now to our best guesstimate the new supply that is scheduled or has been contemplated or is actually under construction today does not even approximate the amount of supply necessary to keep up with the population increase. ","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thanks Spencer. That\u2019s helpful. I would be curious also to get your take on just the transaction market. It seems like cap rates continue to go down and values continue to go up. So just curious any thoughts you have on that and sort of your ability to operate within that construct and be creative and disciplined as you've said. And it looks like you tapped maybe the Harrison Street JV to buy that back. Can you just talk a little bit about those things?","Spencer Kirk ","Yes. We are creative, we are leveraging relationships both in the open market. We want to be competitive as well as in the off market transactions and once again this quarter we did an off market transaction that was favorable.","For us there is a compression of cap rates, our goal as a company is to remain disciplined. If you said where is the core transactional range for what we're doing at Extra Space I\u2019d call it between the 6 and the 7. There might be a property or two where you end up in the high 5s conversely you might end up in the mid 7s, but the core transactional volume we're doing is in the 6 to 7 range and we want to make sure that the transactions we do are accretive. And so far we have been very disciplined in making sure that that is the end result.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","","Thanks guys.","Spencer Kirk","","Thanks Michael.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shahzeb Zakaria with Macquarie. Please proceed.","Shahzeb Zakaria - Macquarie","Thank you for taking my question. It seems like you guys raised your 4Q guidance by - for FFO per share by about $0.015, was that impacted at all by the increased acquisitions? And if so, are you able to quantify that?","Spencer Kirk","The acquisition volume increased so it went up, quantifying it, it went up by $100 million at, it\u2019s probably $0.01 to $0.02 in there and then your property performance also went up. So I am trying to understand how you came up with your $0.015. I would tell you the accretive acquisitions are going to be one to two pennies in the current year.","Shahzeb Zakaria - Macquarie","Got it. And just one follow-up, so at a media there in New York you guys disclosed that August was the best August that you have ever had in the company\u2019s history. Did that momentum carry into September as well? How does September compare with the past Septembers and if you could also give us an update on October that would be great?","Scott Stubbs","","Yeah. This is Scott. August was actually our best in terms of rentals that we've ever seen as far as the eight year running history that we have. September was on the lower end of that. So part of it was where the weekends fell and then October is right back into the norm. So our rentals and vacates continue at the norm more or towards the upper-end in terms of rentals and vacates.","Shahzeb Zakaria - Macquarie","Got it. That is helpful, guys. Thank you so much.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Shahzeb.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line David Toti with Cantor. Please proceed.","David Toti - Cantor","","Hey, guys.","Spencer Kirk","","Hey David.","David Toti - Cantor","Karl, a question for you, absolute rent growth appeared to accelerate in the quarter obviously on improved occupancy levels and market demand. What\u2019s your, I guess first of all, what were the dynamics in the quarter that sort of comprised that growth and what\u2019s your expectation going forward relative to where you\u2019re seeing the most pricing strength either in place rentals or with the street rates?","Karl Hass","In my view we are basically seeing just a continuation of what we\u2019ve had in the last two years. And rentals are strong, we really we\u2019re seeing occupancy hold always stronger than we expected, but our revenue management system really drives everything. And we set some general guidance for it, but it\u2019s going to adjust rates, adjust discounts and how aggressive we are on the web, how much money we are spending on the web. All of it comes together to generate what we think is going to generate the best results and we see that working.","And I know everybody likes to talk about [rates here][ph], but let\u2019s talk about the rentals and vacates. The problem is if rentals go up and vacates go up, you really haven\u2019t, it really hasn\u2019t done you that much good. We focus on the occupancy delta and as we ended the quarter at 1.7 and over the last year and I can tell you beginning of the year we did not expect to be at that level. So the market is strong where we are seeing some real strength, our rates probably aren\u2019t as strong as far as the delta to prior year as we would like, but some of that has to do with, we are getting really aggressive in reducing discounting. And so discounting and do we really care if we are going to get seven whatever percent, 7.4%, 7.6% and 7.8% revenue growth, do we care if it\u2019s coming from lower discounts or higher rates? Not really, as long as we are getting to our maximum number.","David Toti - Cantor","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Scott, I just have a question for you. There are a couple of one-time items in the quarter unusual for you guys especially related to capital structure. What are some of the near-term goals in your mind for the company in the next couple of quarters relative to keeping the balance sheet in check with your external growth activities? And secondarily, are there some goals about further reducing leverage or recasting or re-terming some of that existing debt on top of what you have already done?","Scott Stubbs","Yeah, David, first of all I\u2019d tell you, I think our leverage is appropriate. I think that we are at a level that is sustainable going forward. I think our goal during this last couple of years has been to set ourselves up for future growth. We want to make sure that our capital stack is diversified. We would like to have, in the past we\u2019ve been a 100% secured, we would like to maybe add a little bit of diversity in there and have a little bit more unsecured.","So our main goal here is to reduce the interest expense as much as possible your average interest rate and also set us up for the ability to grow. We want to make sure there are leverages that are in position where we have the ability to grow and where we have the ability to roll our debt. I mean the last thing we want to do is be back in 2008 or 2009 where many companies had loans that were cross collateralized or they had all their debt coming due at once, so we\u2019ve tried to layer our debt and make sure we are ready to grow in the future.","David Toti - Cantor","Okay. Thanks for the detail today.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, David.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed.","Nick Joseph - Citi","Great, thanks. It's actually Nick Joseph here with Michael. Going back to the transaction market, what was the blended cap rate on the acquisitions in the quarter and for the additional properties under contract?","Scott Stubbs","This is Scott. On average we would tell you it's between 6% and 7% and then the same is true for the transactions that we're anticipating closing. Just maybe one point of clarification to Shahzeb\u2019s question earlier on how much accretion or additional FFO is being generated by the additional acquisitions. That is without acquisition cost. Our acquisition cost we anticipate to be 1% of whatever we buy. And so we continue to buy things in an accretive price, but pricings become more aggressive.","Nick Joseph - Citi","Great, thanks. And then I appreciate your comments on potential new supply and if that supply does come where would you expect it to deliver first?","Spencer Kirk","This is Spencer, Nick. I think realistically you are going to see new supply coming where land costs are not as challenging, I think in the Class A markets. Of course everybody wants to get in there, but the barriers to entry are very high and most of the development that has ever been done in this business has been done by the smaller operators, the mom and pops, not the REITs. So you're going to get a lot of supply I think initially coming in secondary and tertiary markets. I think it's going to be much more muted in the core markets.","Nick Joseph - Citi","Great, thanks.","Spencer Kirk","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Hi. Thanks guys. I know you won't engage in ground up development on your own, but what's kind of your comfort level teaming up with the developer whether it would be a joint venture or through financing new construction?","Spencer Kirk","Todd, good afternoon, this is Spencer. We are looking at JV development opportunities potentially. Once again, it\u2019s got to be a really good fit. It\u2019s got to be in markets that are nice operational overlay to where we're currently doing business. And number three it needs to meet our criteria of what we called the 3 Cs of a partnership. We need partners that have character that we can trust that have integrity. We need partners that have capacity. We get literally dozens and dozens of inquiries of people who want to do a development and have Extra Space fund all of it, take all of the financial risk and they participate at the end with some advantageous split to them having taken no risk, we're not interested in that, we need people really stand shoulder-to-shoulder.","And number three we need competency. We are not interested in a homebuilder saying I am thinking about doing some storage, we need someone that\u2019s got a proven track record. So you take character, capacity and competency that narrows down the field. You take the operational footprint, it further narrows it. And in a few selected cases you may in the future see some JV development, but it\u2019s going to be limited.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Thank you for the color, Spencer. But and just a yield requirement or a premium over acquisition cap rates. Is there a set basis point number that you need to achieve?","Spencer Kirk","There is and I can tell you it\u2019s going to depend on the market, but I think somewhere between 250 and 350 basis points is probably a reasonable range for us to say this makes sense. Once again, it\u2019s market dependent and there could be a little variation of that.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","","Sure. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Jordan Sadler here with me as well. First question, I just wanted to circle back to the discounting, and I was just wondering if you can talk about maybe where we are in the spectrum of sort of reducing discounts and concessions and also maybe even refining your marketing and advertising spend. I guess, if we just think sort of broadly about your tenant acquisition cost overall, maybe you can help us understand or quantify sort of how much room there still as to reduce tenant acquisition cost at this point?","Karl Haas","This is Karl. I don\u2019t really focus on tenant acquisition cost per say, I guess in the what we do on the internet is driven by [thriving] demand determining where we want the demand and going after it and making sure that we\u2019re effectively spending the money that we've decided that we wanted to go to it.","As far as the discounting, it\u2019s really relatively simple and that we've always operated with thresholds at which discounts go away and we actually in certain times a year in busy season we raise these thresholds. So we even give less away and within the rise and occupancy gets at all of our sites, we\u2019re just giving away a lot less. It\u2019s a hard thing to break. I will tell you our biggest problem has been just that our managers or sir used to having discounts and everywhere and everybody in the industry has vendors up saying one month free.","And the nice part is right now we\u2019ll always have something probably in almost every site offering one month free, but it\u2019s getting less and less and then we are refining how we identify the units that are available for discount. We used just had it every unit type would sit by itself, but now we actually [bucketize] into and we started that in the middle of this year and what we found is that even it\u2019s had a more positive impact on our discounting. So we still think we have some runway on reduced discounting and if and I am not saying we will, but if our occupancy went higher we\u2019d probably even see less discounts.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","So what percent of the customers, I guess the 43,000 rentals that you had in the same store during the quarter, how many of those renters received the discount and what was the value of those discounts in the quarter?","Karl Haas","","I don\u2019t have that right in front of me, it\u2019s less, I know it\u2019s less than in the prior quarter. We\u2019ve been trending down every quarter and discounts, I focus more on discounts as a percentage of our rental income and that was running anywhere up to about 6% to 6.5%, now it\u2019s down to the low 5s and almost in the 4s.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And if I could one last one, I just noticed in the same store expense detail the tenant insurance expenses were up about 90%, this is only $500,000 or so, but can you just talk about what that increase was?","Scott Stubbs","","Yeah, it\u2019s really couple of things Todd. Last year the expenses were slightly below an average run rate. So last year\u2019s number was a little bit low. And then in the current quarter, we had buyers at two of our. So it increased the amount of payouts to those properties. So a low quarter last year and higher quarter for the two specific buyers.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinksky with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael Salinksky - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon, guys. Just going back to pricing, you talked about what you\u2019re paying for assets, but can you talk about the market in general, what you see in the last call at 90 days and how that compares in terms of these transactions in the market overall?","Spencer Kirk","It is tough for us to give you real cap rates and what other people are paying. We know that we are not getting many of the marketed deals. When people quote cap rates often they are backwards looking, sometimes they are forward looking, do they include a management fee, do they not, property tax has been adjusted. So in our mind, whenever we quote a cap rate we want to focus on year one. We would tell you that any deal that has been marketed we have not been overly successful. We\u2019ve been able to get one or two deals, but we definitely are getting majority. So we would tell you that we are off by as much as 10% on pricing.","Michael Salinksky - RBC Capital Markets","I appreciate your color there. And second for Karl. I appreciate the color on the discounting and street rate growth, but as you look at the market today, I mean is the market keeping pace with you, when you look at some of the smaller operators in terms of reducing discounts pushing street rates or are you guys basically pulling the market at this point?","Karl Haas","No, I think others are doing the same thing. I don\u2019t know about the real smaller local operators, the advantage that we have as we have so much information and I think will be control what goes on at the properties a little bit tighter than a lot of local operators, but I think our public peers are pretty much doing the same that we're doing.","Michael Salinksky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that's helpful. And then finally just a touch back on the development, just as a bridge gap for that, would you guys look at being mezzanine partner on something like that and buying it out once it's completed, being kind of a financing source. So would have to be just kind of (inaudible) joint venture. ","Karl Haas","CFO deals Michael are something would consider. You\u2019ve taken the construction risk out of the equation, now you are up to lease-up risk, and Extra Space has a good track record of leasing up assets, it's something we know, it's something we're comfortable with. And yeah, a CFO deal would consider it.","Spencer Kirk","When you say mezzanine, I guess it depends a bit on what do you mean that, would we be a lender on development? Yeah, we would consider that. I think that if it didn't significantly, if it wasn't a real risky deal, yes we would consider it, but we would do CFO deals for sure. ","Michael Salinksky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Appreciate the color guys. Thank you ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Two questions guys. First is on acquisition funding for the Q4 pending acquisition, what's the game plan there?","Spencer Kirk","So we have announced about $535 million in acquisitions. We did a $250 million exchangeable earlier this year as part of the yellow board $200 million transaction. We did about a $100 in OP. So we have more than enough capacity on our lines of credit to get those acquisitions done. ","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay. Second question is on pricing power and we have seen over the last couple of months a significantly more challenging consumer environment, I probably used the word lousy with retailers from the low end of the spectrum to the high end of the spectrum putting up flatter sales within the mall REITs put up flat sales. So it would seem to me that the consumer is telling us something here that there are a little spend for a lack of a better word. So I guess in that kind of a context, I am curious how you guys think about pricing power in the storage industry going forward when it\u2019s clear that retailers are struggling on that perspective?","Karl Haas","It\u2019s Karl. I think the difference is a very large portion of our customer base needs it. It\u2019s not -- they\u2019re not out there just shopping, going to the mall and having to stop in, feeling flush with cash and buying stuff at just kind of leisure. So much of what we get or people that have an event in their life and they need some storage and a lot of who\u2019ve never used it, we still are -- statistics still tell us that 50% of the people that come in rent from us never used it before. They come in, they don\u2019t know what it costs and so it\u2019s really a matter of what everybody is charging.","And our occupancy is high, our discounts are down and so all of us are going to, are pushing rates more. And I think until the new supply comes in and we have to worry about where the demand is going to come from, the pi stands the same and if anything the larger operators are taking a bigger piece of the pi. And so I think it bodes well until that dynamic of new supply coming on happens, we're going to be in a pretty good position to be able to give more for what we have.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","","Okay. And last question, you guys have obviously been aggressive on the acquisition front over half a billion this year. Can you talk about your disposition strategy, given where cap rates have fallen to why not take the opportunity to start pruning out some of the lower performers in the portfolio here?","Spencer Kirk","Yeah. Ross, it\u2019s Spencer. That's nothing we look at. A lot of the properties that we have fall under a couple of considerations, when you talk about dispositions. Number one, can you even dispose of them because of the financing that\u2019s on them, I think CMBS. Second question, all right if you dispose this asset in a certain market, you just change the denominator over which you are fixed expenses get spread. We are not in a huge hurry to dispose of a lot of assets. We\u2019re building a company, we\u2019re building a platform, we\u2019re building a brand. And you might see a few and I am talking single digits cycle out of our system, but this is not something we are aggressively pursuing.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","Spencer Kirk ","","Thanks Ross.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line RJ Milligan with Raymond James & Associates. Please proceed.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","Hey good afternoon. Guys we've seen a lot of activity over the past couple of quarters. In terms of acquisitions we've seen several large portfolios get snatched up. And based on what you are seeing come into market and I guess sellers\u2019 pricing expectations, do you think that pace of acquisitions have we seen over the past two quarters are sustainable? Do you think we\u2019ll see an acceleration or deceleration what are your thoughts there?","Spencer Kirk ","No one knows RJ, what the future is going to hold. I was out touring and looking at some properties and having a couple of discussions with brokers and next with our own internal analysis. Obviously the higher, the more willing the sellers are going to become. And I personally offer my opinion, I think through 2014 you will see a pace that is at least comparable to what you have seen in 2013, but I will also put a caveat that the larger asset pools for larger portfolios are becoming more and more scares, there just aren\u2019t that many $200 million, $300 million, $400 million, $500 million portfolios hanging out there. And I think if there would be any trendings would be towards the same acquisition volume if not more, but perhaps smaller portfolios not larger ones coming to the marketplace. And only time will prove whether this opinion is correct or incorrect.","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And Spencer can you talk about any negotiations or what do you think the opportunity set is to continue to buy out joint venture partners?","Spencer Kirk ","","What we want to do is when our partners approach us, be in a position to transact. We want to work to produce the very best result we are not going to go to them and try to break apart a perfectly functional partnership. We are incline to meeting the need of our JV partners and having them come to us at the appropriate time, which is part of the reason why it\u2019s difficult for Extra Space to prognosticate what the acquisition activity level will be in a given year because we are not actively prospecting our JV partners. We are waiting for them signal that it\u2019s time for them to redeploy capital and at that point we want to be the first and only call because we have treated them well and that formula seems to be working to our advantage. ","RJ Milligan - Raymond James & Associates","All right, thanks, guys.","Spencer Kirk ","Thanks.","Clint Halverson ","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed. Your line is now open. And your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Karl, a couple of questions for you. Can you update us on what the tenant insurance penetration rate is in the overall portfolio?","Karl Haas ","Yeah. It is around 69%.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. And how is the average length of stay trending between your individual customer base and the commercial business customer base?","Spencer Kirk ","No real change. We really have not seen that move highly off and that is whole now. Everything we have been doing really going back to 2008.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Karl, this is your last earnings call?","Karl Haas ","It depends what the first quarter of 2014.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Fair enough. And Spencer, just a bigger picture question for you. Do you think the -- I mean obviously the self storage stocks have had a tremendous run here. Do you think the current valuations are adequately pricing in the growth potential?","Spencer Kirk ","I will say I am very comfortable where Extra Space is priced, that demotic I just pull up that there is limited supply, but there has been a tendency of the internet. We have not very sophisticated revenue management program that Karl talked about this is optimized pricing. And all of the results that the public companies have posted in the storage sector have been in spite of a crappy economy. If the economy continues to heal, we just see further upside. So for me I'm optimistic about the future and I think that the larger publicly traded companies are going to continue to produce decent results. ","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks, Spencer. ","Spencer Kirk ","Thanks Paula.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Hi it's Jordan Sadler with Todd. Curious about sort of the range of street rate increases you have seen across your markets. I think the blended number you said was 3% year-over-year. But what sort of like the high and a low point, I mean and I came more about the high point actually?","Karl Haas ","Probably, I don't think we have any markets where street rates are much above that 5% above the prior year. And the low point is probably around 2% to 2.5%, it's strange but the DC markets, ball from a DC market is one that probably stands out as one that hits me is being where we've had our harder time pushing rates. Obviously not surprisingly Boston and going up into the Silicon Valley, those are doing better. ","","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. It's interesting. So as you would describe it I mean I guess economic conditions, but it's also it seems like prevailing economic conditions just sort of having added it driving the markets that have better street rate upside, is that fair?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, not surprising.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then could you give us a little bit more color on the assets that are under contract, I mean markets, I didn\u2019t catch, maybe occupancies?","Karl Haas","With that many assets it\u2019s really pretty diverse as far as the markets, I mean they go from Hawaii to Florida. And as far as occupancy we have 19 where we're buying at a joint venture partner that\u2019s very similar to ours. And then we have a few other managed ones that are very similar. But I believe it\u2019s 20 states. And so it\u2019s a pretty diverse spread there.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly on the most recent third-party deals, the terms of those deals similar to previous deals consistent any change?","Spencer Kirk","No change, we have not had offer different management fee structures or anything else we have held through to the program. The integrity of the program is very important to us and our success is because of our previous track record and we're very excited about the upside in this program as we go forward.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Do you see risk to that business at all and is it getting more competitive from a pricing standpoint?","Spencer Kirk","Yes. The competition is keenly aware and there are pricing pressures and other factors, but as we look at what we are able to offer a mom and pop or an operator of few assets. I think we have a compelling proposition that says we are competitive. We produce an outstanding result and we know how to work exceptionally well with partners. Unlike any other publicly traded pair, this company has about 50% of the assets under the Extra Space brand that are either only partially owned or non-owned. And we for 15 years have structured our systems and our business and our management team around an ability to work and play well in a partnership. And I think our track record speaks for itself. So I think we are in a good position to not only continue the growth that we have experienced so far, but perhaps even see an acceleration in the growth rate.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","That's helpful. Thank you.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Jordan.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Hi guys. Curious on your comments, I think Karl made them earlier that the year-over-year occupancy gap has been sustained at a higher level than you would have thought at the beginning of the year. I\u2019m just curious as you think about how you go about maximizing revenues whether the high occupancy rates that you\u2019ve achieved and the Public Storage has achieved, does that make you re-think where your occupancy could end up peeking, is there more room for this year-over-year gap to continue same where it is even as we head into next year?","Karl Haas","This is Karl.","Spencer Kirk","Yes.","Karl Haas","We are, I think we\u2019re constantly are re-thinking it and we don\u2019t know what the right answer is, perfect answer, I don\u2019t know. And I guess if anybody should know we would have as many as good as chance as anybody to know what the right answer is. It\u2019s hard for us to believe that 94% and 95% is what we would be shooting for. It seems to be working for Public Storage, but they operate a little bit differently. And we see it\u2019s a combination of less discounts and certainly at 95% you\u2019d even be giving away less discounts, so that\u2019s a plus. But the ability to push rates as hard as maybe we would like to push we are getting away getting that high for us. So we are higher than we thought. We originally were thinking we\u2019d probably peak out at 88, 87, 88, now we are peaking out at 91 and averaging more like 90 instead of 89 or 87. So it could go higher. As I said, our system drives it and about the only thing we do is we give some general guidelines to revenue management and we don\u2019t want to see occupancy drop dramatically, but if they determine that where we are right now is the right level to maximize revenue or if our systems do then you will see that delta go down some. But I can\u2019t rule out that it wouldn\u2019t, we couldn\u2019t be here a year from now and be a point to point and a half to two points higher.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors"," ","Okay. Thanks for that. And then it sounds like, Spencer, if the economy were to get on a better footing you would continue to foresee an even stronger demand picture for storage with limited supply so it almost seems like sky is the limit potentially in terms of pricing power and rent growth, is that a fair interpretation?","Karl Haas","I am not going to say that sky is the limit Michael, but I will say that I for one would not suggest that the best stages are behind Extra Space, the best stages are ahead of Extra Space.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. You have several JVs that are not in the promote yet, and so the first question, are those based on just at the level of NOI or is that IRR based which might be negative appraisals and given where CapEx have gone, are we getting closer such a time for some of the larger JVs that you manage to promote?","Spencer Kirk","Those all have preferred IRRs, so in other words they need to hit a preferred return and what happen with many of those joint ventures is we bought them as part of the story just say acquisition. And then between that time and today, you went through a pretty major recession. So those haven\u2019t been up to the original projections, but they are doing very well nonetheless.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Could you comment on how close we could be or?","Spencer Kirk","It varies by JV and the IRR is very dependent on whether or not the JV, whether or not the fund allows debt or no debt, so it\u2019s going to vary by JV, and so I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable commenting today.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, that\u2019s fine. Your CFO, Scott Stubbs, had already. Your same store expenses still fairly low from year-over-year growth rate standpoint, but (inaudible) a little bit. And it seems like from other regions associated that are close to a lot of these have previously report a higher expenses and such a royalty taxes going forward. Is it a or at this more, slightly more elevated level from the estimated low level long term run rate?","Spencer Kirk","So the same-store expenses, we would tell you are high for the quarter partly because you had a negative same-store comparison last year. So this year actually looks probably worst than it would, if it was against a normal year. We would tell you that getting back more to normal run rates and they should continue to grow more at the rate of inflation. ","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And just last quick question, what is your average new tenant length of stay and how got you changed that on the past couple of year? And I know typically companies will talk about the average tenant duration, but what are the average new tenants today, how long do you think?","Spencer Kirk","Ki Bin, I don't have the exact number in front of me, but it's around 12.6 months and it's picked up just slightly year over year.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter call and for your interest Extra Space Storage. 2018 is playing out as we expected as we move into the last couple of months of the year. Revenue, NOI and FFO growth are all start remained within guidance and expectations. Occupancy continues to be strong ending the quarter at 93.9%, 20 basis points above 2017\u2019s mark. This is especially encouraging, because last year\u2019s quarter end occupancy benefited from the hurricanes.","We continue to have solid rate growth, which was partially offset by increased but expected discounts, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 3.2%. The year-over-year impact from discounts should taper off in the fourth quarter. And we project higher same-store revenue growth.","External growth was also strong in the quarter. We continue to be selective and disciplined in our acquisition efforts, but have been able to find acquisitions with acceptable risk adjusted returns, primarily through existing relationships. By year end, we expect to have acquired over $1 billion in properties with Extra Space investing approximately $600 million. Between acquisitions and third-party management contracts, we have added 140 stores through the quarter. We have more than 500 third-party properties and a total of 734 stores, including joint ventures.","Our report related to new supply remains generally unchanged. We are seeing an impact from new supply in certain sub-markets, and its impact varies by location. New stars appear to be down in many MSAs already saturated with new development and activity is migrating to markets where there may be a better yield. We continue to see delays in deliveries and see many proposed projects being abandoned. Our highly diversified portfolio, while certainly not immune to the effects of new supply, reduces volatility. And our sophisticated platform is better prepared to respond to competition than ever before.","At this time last year, we were reporting the impact hurricanes had on our customers, our employees and our properties. Unfortunately, the Southeast experienced severe weather again, but I am happy to report that our portfolio was relatively unscathed. We did not have any material disruption with customers or employees, and damage to our properties was minimal.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. ","Scott Stubbs ","Thanks, Joe, and happy Halloween, everyone. Last night, we reported core FFO for the quarter of $1.20 per share. Rental rates to new customers continue to be solid. Throughout the quarter, our achieve rental rate was up approximately 3% to 4% year-over-year. As expected and as discussed on our last call, discounts as a percentage of revenue were also up, partially offsetting revenue growth.","As Joe mentioned, we anticipate the impact from discounts to decrease in the fourth quarter, resulting in an increase in same-store revenue growth. We saw expense growth normalize in the third quarter, and we were successful in minimizing increases in our controllable expenses. Property taxes, while elevated, were in line with our expectations. The increase in insurance premiums was not a surprise due to the elevated level of property claims caused by last year's hurricane.","We also chose to invest more in marketing in the quarter, allowing us to grow rates and keep our stores full heading into the fall and winter. We continue to execute our leverage neutral balance sheet strategy. During the quarter, we increased the percentage of unsecured debt and the size of our unencumbered pool and further laddered our maturities. We're also in the process of increasing and extending our credit facility. In the quarter, we sold $34 million on or ATM at an average price for $99.75 per share. We also disposed off one property in California for $40.7 million. The property was sold at a below market cap rate for an alternative use and we anticipate the reinvested proceeds will produce a significantly higher yield.","This store as well as three other stores with large expansions or redevelopment projects were removed from our same store pool, consistent with our guide -- with our same store definition, changing our total same store number to 783 properties. We\u2019ve updated our guidance and annual assumptions for 2018. Our same store revenue guidance remains unchanged. We\u2019ve increased the bottom end of our same store expense growth by 25 basis points. We\u2019ve tightened same store NOI guidance by 25 basis points at both the top and bottom end of the range with the midpoint unchanged. We increased our core FFO guidance by $0.50 at the midpoint. FFO guidance includes $0.06 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.14 of dilution from C of O stores for total dilution of $0.20. The lease-up of these properties continues to exceed underwriting expectations as a portfolio and will generate long-term growth for our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s turn the call back over to Jeff to start our Q&A.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Scott. In order to ensure that we\u2019ve adequate time to address everyone's questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial question.","With that, Lisa, we will start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. I have first question that\u2019s coming from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Joe, on the supply front in your opening remarks, you mentioned delays and deliveries and some projects being abandoned, but you also noted no change to your expectations. So just trying to reconcile those. Because it sounds like some of the items you\u2019re pointing to would lead to arguably feeling better about the supply outlook for next year if there are deals starting to fall out?","Joe Margolis","So I think generally our view is unchanged that we\u2019re in a supply cycle, a development cycle and that it\u2019s having impact on our operations in stores. There\u2019s some new supply being added and there's some falling out. But I would say last quarter, I was asked about 2019 and I said that we -- subject to what is scheduled for 2018 getting pushed into 2019, I said we thought 2019 would be flat to moderately down in new deliveries.","Now based on the data we have now and what we're seeing, I would say 2019 is going to be down. So, we are seeing a slowing in the development cycle and -- but it's not a material change. I mean, we\u2019re still going to have impact on our operations from new supply in 2019. You have the cumulative effect of what's being delivered but I do see the delivery slowing.","Jeremy Metz","And can you tie that into maybe just some of your bigger measures in terms of where you maybe see supply pressures getting worse even just from deliveries of ones where you maybe see it abating more than others and feel more better?","Joe Margolis","So the Florida markets, I think are going to get worse before they get better. We\u2019ve seen the acceleration in Dallas, Portland, I think it's going to get worse; Washington DC, it may get worse; Chicago is a market that\u2019s on the other end of the spectrum where we\u2019re seeing some improvement.","Jeremy Metz","Last one for me. Scott, you mentioned the achieved rates holding in that mid-single-digit range. I think you said 3% to 4% this quarter. Discounting has been a drag, which you noted. So if you factor all that in, where are your net effective rates and how has that been trending?","Scott Stubbs","So our achieved rates for the quarter were 3% to 4%. If you look at the impact of discounts in the quarter, discounts decreased our revenue by about 80 basis points in the quarter. So without discounts, our revenue would have been -- had discussed been flat year-over-year, our revenue would have been 80 basis points higher.","Operator","Next question is coming from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Todd Thomas","Scott, Joe, your comments about the discounts being lower year-over-year in the fourth quarter and revenue growth being higher. It seems like the comps overall beginning in late 3Q the hurricanes last year and over the next couple quarters, would be a little bit more difficult. I understand the discounting dynamic. But I was just hoping you could provide some additional context around that comment and maybe provide some insight around some of those factors heading into 2019?","Joe Margolis","Yes. So the discounting strategy is just part of our overall revenue maximization strategy. So discounts are the lever that we have chosen to pull this year. And the difference this year versus last year is last year, we did not discount as heavily in the third quarter. So during the summer months of last year, our discounts were low. This year they were high as we chose to keep rate and use discount. So it was more of a comparable from last year than a change in what we\u2019re doing overall.","So, we expect this year\u2019s discounts pretty comparable to last year. So a portion of that 80 basis points that we\u2019re -- we saw discounts impact our revenue by about 80 basis points this last quarter. We expect to a big portion of that to not be there in the fourth quarter. So while overall revenue -- year-over-year or sequentially continues to get tougher, revenue -- the rate of growth slows the impact of discounts less than in the fourth quarter.","Todd Thomas","And then how should we think about that? So you\u2019re anticipating your model shows revenue growth being higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter here. Any insight into how we should think about 2019 just in terms of maybe setting expectations?","Joe Margolis","So, obviously we\u2019re not ready to give 2019 guidance, we\u2019ll give that on the first quarter. I think with the supply cycle, we expect things to continue to moderate. But I don\u2019t think that we expect things to go negative by any mean. So we\u2019ll give our guidance in first quarter of this next year.","Todd Thomas","And just last question for me, the decrease in net tenant insurance income, I don\u2019t know if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But was that attributable to the hurricane expenses or is that something else? And how much expense that's not non-recurring, what was in that number? ","JoeMargolis","It actually was not attributable to the hurricanes. We had some claims from the hurricanes but not significantly higher. It was primarily due to some water claims from the tough weather during the winter months of this past year.","Todd Thomas","And how much was that in the quarter?","JoeMargolis","In the quarter, we were $1 million to $2 million high, and some of that was -- some of those claims were made late processed late. So while they happened in the winter months, they didn't get processed or adjusted until third quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore. Your line is open.","Samir Khanal","Scott or Joe, I guess, where do you stand on your views on property taxes for '19 based on where you sit today? I mean, you had -- if I look at your numbers, you had higher taxes, especially in the first half of this year and primarily in 2Q. So if that doesn't repeat, comps could be easier, may be better NOI growth and especially in the first half of '19. It feels like with some of the other companies in our coverage universe, these onetime items of higher taxes, they say it's one-time but then they continue to repeat. So, I want to get your view as we think about '19 growth here?","Scott Stubbs","So certain states are pretty fixed in property tax growth. I mean California is relatively fixed. Other states like Texas or Florida reassess quite frequently and are quite aggressive. As those values approach what things are trading for, they typically slow in their reassessments. So, I think property taxes are potentially your biggest risk on expenses and potentially the biggest benefit in expenses as year-over-year comps become easier or as some of these states flow down in their reassessment.","Samir Khanal","And I guess my second question is just looking at your debt maturity, I know you've got roughly $300 million of debt that's maturing between now and in '19. How should we think about that piece? How will you address that?","Scott Stubbs","We'll continue to do more unsecured debts as we move things forward in '19. If you look at it with extensions, it's actually pretty low in terms of the amount of maturities we have. So we'll extend a portion of that and then we'll continue to fund things with primarily unsecured debt as we move more towards an unsecured balance sheet. ","Operator","Next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Your line is open.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask you just for the fourth quarter a year ago. Do you have a sense as to -- was there any impact, lingering impact of higher occupancies due to the hurricanes and maybe what you think what we should be adjusting for this year? And then my second question, I just wanted to ask you on the acquisitions front if you're seeing any changes in pricing and the private market just given the upper bias in interest rates? And if you're not yet, do you have a sense of how long that takes to follow through?","Scott Stubbs","Smedes, I'll address the Florida Houston question and then Joe will take the acquisitions one. Florida really provided no benefit for us last year in terms of upside from the hurricanes. What we saw is lot of people moved in, most of those people moved in the first month free and then moved out 30 days later. Houston was a little bit different. Houston we saw a fairly benefit. Our occupancy jumped quite quickly. But Houston is less than 2% of our portfolio. So I wouldn\u2019t tell you it\u2019s going to impact it significantly.","And if you look at our occupancy overall as a portfolio at the end of the third quarter, we are 20 basis points ahead of where we were last year. Even though a market like Houston is 400 basis points behind in our occupancy, Florida is actually slightly behind as of the end of September. Florida will come back in October in terms of occupancy. But we expect Houston to be a tough comp for the year, but a small percentage of our income.","JoeMargolis","Smedes, on the acquisition question. We really have not seen any material change in pricing. We have not seen cap rates increasing. Although, you would expect them to as interest rates go up. I guess as interest rates started to go up, lenders tightened spreads a little bit that made up the difference. But that can't go on forever. So, if there are several rate increases next year, at some point, you would expect cap rates to react but we haven\u2019t seen it yet.","Smedes Rose","So I mean do you guys remain primarily focused I guess on your third-party managed as a potential pipeline of acquisitions, or I guess where do you stand on external growth at this point?","JoeMargolis","So little over 80% of the $1 billion of acquisitions gross that we\u2019ll do this year came from relationships, either joint venture partners or third-party management of relationships, we\u2019ve had less than a fifth that were brokered deals where we\u2019re competing in the market. And I think that's going to continue. We find very few situations where we can be the high bidder in a brokered situation and we're very lucky and fortunate to have these great relationships and some are proprietary pipeline that allows us to continue our external growth.","Operator","Next question is from Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Jonathan Hughes","Joe, just wanted to clarify what you said earlier when you mentioned seeing new supply activity, migrating to markets with better yields. Are those secondary tertiary markets you are talking about, or suburbs and primary markets?","JoeMargolis","I would say secondary tertiary markets. A lot of suburbs are primary market I think of the secondary markets too. So, I would include all of those. But moving out of the main downtown or primary suburbs or excerpts of the maiden markets and moving to these other secondary type markets.","Jonathan Hughes ","And then going back to Smedes's question about external growth, your percentage of assets or acquisitions bought out of the third party platform, you said 80% are already managed that was maybe 30% a few years ago. And it get underwriting perfect on those assets. So lower risk. But the strength of your platform is pretty impressive. And why not try to go out and buy more non-managed stores with more operational upside? I mean of course, assuming you can buy them. I am just looking at the integration of these third-party assets -- third-party managed properties into your same store pool going forward and the growth that\u2019s going to be lower in the future, because there is not much upside. Is that a fair assessment?","JoeMargolis","For the most part, yes. So, not all of that 80% were manage. Some of it is truly from relationships we have with people and we don\u2019t actually manage the properties at the time. Secondly, we\u2019ve been buying this year more than ever before many of these stores in joint ventures, which even though they are maximized from a management standpoint because we do manage them, we do get outsized returns, because we\u2019re not investing 100% of the capital but we get a management fee, we get the insurance proceeds and we have the opportunity to earn or promote.","In a perfect world, I would love to buy more from the mom and pops and from under managed properties and get them more juice out of the deals, but I want to pay for it. So, we\u2019ll do that when the pricing is right. And when the pricing isn\u2019t right, we need to remain disciplined and patient.","Jonathan Hughes ","And then just one more and I\u2019ll jump off. But could you just maybe give us details on the yields on the operating store acquisition this quarter scheduled to close by year-end? I know you said transactions market hasn\u2019t seen any change but curious what you paid for those couple stores? Thanks.","JoeMargolis","So the stores were in different stages of stabilization with the Fort Lauderdale store was fully stabilized and the other stores we underwrote between 10 and 22 months to get the stabilization. So they\u2019re not -- so the initial yield was not always the stabilized yield. But if you average them all together, first year was in the low 5s and stabilized was in the mid-6s.","Jonathan Hughes ","And maybe what was the stabilized yield on the Lauderdale acquisition if that one was fully occupied?","JoeMargolis","6.5\u2026","Operator","The next question is coming from Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Joe, could you comment a little bit on the cause of some of the supply decreases or the drops in attentive starts?","JoeMargolis","So one thing is that, there is better information out there in the market today now than there was a couple years ago, there is some third-party providers that are doing a pretty good job of putting together information. So when a developer or an equity source or bank is looking at a proposal to build the next door in North Dallas, it\u2019s fairly easy to see there\u2019s a lot there already. And that may not be the smartest thing to build the next store in North Dallas.","Secondly, costs are up; interest rates are up, we talked about that; land pricing is up; labor is certainly up; material is up. So you have an increased cost. And then the other side, you have moderating operating projections. If someone honestly underwrites a deal, they\u2019re not going to underwrite 8% rent growth. And so a few that you have increased costs and moderating projections that squeezes your development yield. And then you have lenders that are somewhat more cautious where you have a little bit more difficulty getting loans. So I think all those factors make it harder these days to stick the next shovel in the ground.","Eric Frankel","Is it fair to say that a lot of developers were underwriting a lease up time of say two years, three years or is it most, which is maybe common a couple of years. But that's turned out to be what has historically been a three to five year range?","JoeMargolis","I don\u2019t know if it was lease up time or rate. But in general, developers are optimists and they will create a pro forma that has an aggressive lease up rate and aggressive lease up time period, and an aggressive unit mix too, which is what we frequently see where the unit mix is meant to maximize revenue, but may not actually work in the market. And the equity providers and the lenders and the operators, the manager's job to try to make sure that developer has an realistic pro forma and if that can get financed then the deal typically goes forward. And if not, sometimes it gets put on the shelf.","Eric Frankel","Just another developing financing related question, I think when you're public peers as take on the strategy of underwriting a construction mezzanine loan business. Whereas, I think what you and some of your peers, do more of the certificate of occupancy type acquisitions, those are available. Would you consider being in the lending business as well if it led to more investment opportunities?","JoeMargolis","So we do not wanted to be in the lending business for development. And the primary reason for that is because if you make a loan, you have to be willing to own that project. And we don't want to own a brokered development deal where we have to continue development take the project to completion, there's obviously already problems, that's not a risk we're willing to take. We are willing to make loans on completed buildings that we want managed and to be willing to own.","Operator","Next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Tayo Okusanya","My first question has to do with the comment made earlier about discounts declining in 4Q. I'm just again wondering how the confidence level you have in that just given some of the supply issues that are still out there, why you wouldn't keep discounts and to try to maximize revenue?","Scott Stubbs","So, I don't think we're necessarily cutting back on discounts. It's more a comp issue. So, we will discount in October, November, December, but the difference is as we also discounted last year in October, November, December. So just seasonally, you typically have more discounts in the fall winter than you do in the summer whereas this year, we increase our discounts in the summer month. So our strategy year-over-year is much more similar this year.","Tayo Okusanya","And then the second question. Just given your meaningful exposure to L.A., as well as San Francisco and some of the talks happening around prop 13, potentially hitting the ballot in 2020. Just wondering what you're hearing about that, what you're thinking about that? And if you've done any homework about what impact that could have on EXR?","Scott Stubbs","So obviously we recognize that it as a risk. Some of our properties are legacy properties that we've owned for quite a while that have just had the 3% raises every year. We have done some math. It's pretty simple math where you\u2019re basically comparing what you're paying in taxes today compared to if they were assessed at full value. We understand what that is. Clearly, it's an impact. It will depend a little bit on; one, if it gets passed; and then two, how they phase that in. So, very difficult to really comment on the impact at this point, but it's a risk we\u2019re monitoring. I think the Self Storage Association is aware of that. I think that there you'll probably see some lobbying efforts around that.","Tayo Okusanya","Is there anything you\u2019ve done in regards just the worst case analysis like if at all shows up straightaway?","Scott Stubbs","We have, but it\u2019s probably not something we would want to disclose on the call today.","Operator","The next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","I just want to go back to the $0.20 dilution this year from acquisitions and C of O deals. Will those be still dilutive next year? I know you might have some more roll in, but just for this comp set here. Will you get to, I guess, a no dilution point next year? And has there been any change in stabilization of C of O deals as far as timing goes?","JoeMargolis","So we\u2019ll continue to add C of O deals, you can see that in our supplement. So, as the value-add and C\/O deals that are causing that $0.20 lease-up, we'll have others added into the pool.","Scott Stubbs","And it depends a little bit on what stage they\u2019re at in terms of their lease-up. So a property they opened fourth quarter of this year, clearly, will be dilutive next year. And acquisition that we bought that was 70% full and we bought it in January of this year, it likely is not dilutive next year. So overall, I would tell you, part of that $0.20 continues into next year but it's a different pool, a different group.","Wes Golladay","And then what is still the typical underwriting and what I'd recall before was up to three years, but they were stabilizing maybe one to one-and-a-half-years. Has that changed at all?","JoeMargolis","So we are underwriting C\/O deals between 36 and 42 months to achieve economic stabilization, depending on the size of the property in the market that it's in. And we\u2019re currently doing maybe slightly better than 36 months, maybe 30 to 36 months to get the economic stabilization and we\u2019re getting to occupancy stabilization earlier than that.","Operator","Next question comes from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Todd Stender","Probably for Joe just around that your last thoughts there on the C of O and lease-up duration, I wanted to just get a sense of how you're incorporating maybe potentially higher risk in your underwriting assumptions. It just depends on -- it's being acquired within a joint venture wholly owned. Are your yield expectations upfront coming up? Is leverage assumed for these portfolio deals coming up? I just want to get some color maybe -- you\u2019re going to expect a little more yield upfront, because the NOI strain going forward might slowdown. Just getting a sense of the risk there?","JoeMargolis","So we -- everything needs to make sense on an unleveraged basis. We underwrite on an unleveraged basis. And if it doesn\u2019t make sense, we don't try to do the deal by adding leverage to it. So that\u2019s an easy answer. We\u2019ve been underwriting pretty consistently at 90% occupancy, 36 to 42 months lease-up and 3% rental rate growth. And some of those -- given where you see our current occupancy and revenue rate growth, some of those maybe conservative numbers. But that\u2019s -- we feel that\u2019s the right way to underwrite these deals.","Our target stabilized yield on C of O deal is and has been for some time 8%, plus and minus, if someone brings us one in a great location and bear temporary market where we take a little less? Yes, probably and a little more another markets; but that\u2019s our target yield that we think compensates us for taking the dilution during the lease-up period; and we bring in joint venture partners; so we can stay within our dilution target and we don\u2019t have too much dilution; so we can de-risk these deals; so, we\u2019re doing more of them and spreading our equity out further; and so we can enhance our returns.","Todd Stender","And then lastly, the Menlo Park property sold, you got a huge gain but it\u2019s also high barrier very affluent market. Is that just an offer you couldn\u2019t refuse?","JoeMargolis","So we sold that to in adjacent corporate -- large corporation that wanted the property for an alternative use and we sold around a three cap. So we can take those dollars even though, it\u2019s probably impossible to build storage in Menlo Park, we can take those dollars and double the yield from them like reinvesting them, which we have done through reverse 1031 exchange. So every property is for sale if someone offers us enough money.","Operator","Next question is from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Juan Sanabria","So I just wanted to touch back on supply? Do you have a sense of what percentage of your portfolio is going to be exposed to that three year rolling supplier '19 versus what that number is in '18, and if that delta is going to be a greater percentage and to what extent?","JoeMargolis","So let\u2019s start by looking at '18. About a third of our portfolio moved -- of our own portfolio of 841 stores, will be facing new supply in 2018. But of those stores, almost half of them had not yet been delivered. So, some of those are under construction. So they will be delivered, but there\u2019ll be pushed into 2019. And others are under the proposed list. So they may or may not be delivered. Under -- in 2019, that number is less than half of that, of what we\u2019ve identified. So that\u2019s where we see the drop off into 2019. Did I answer your question? ","Juan Sanabria","Yes. When you say less than half, so 15% if \u201918, is that fair? ","JoeMargolis","14%...","Juan Sanabria","But do you have a sense of what that is on a three year rolling window, not necessarily new deliveries -- three year rolling window of deliveries. Is that more or less? ","JoeMargolis","So it actually goes up. The three year rolling goes up by 9%, because you're dropping off 2016, which was a relatively small number and adding the 2019, which is while a smaller number than 2018, a bigger number than 2016.","Juan Sanabria","And that's up 9% to what or from what base? Just to be get sense of the total portfolio exposed on three year basis?","JoeMargolis","So, a three year ending in 2018, is probably close to 50%. And then you're closer to 60% in the three year ending in 2019. Is that the right question?","Juan Sanabria","Yes sir. Thank you very much, that was perfect. And then just on from a same-store perspective. How should we think about the benefit of the new stores being added next year to pull and relative to the benefit you've had this year, which is come down as the year is gone?","Scott Stubbs","So we haven't completed the 2019 budgets. But I think the majority to benefit will come from C of O stores that are moving into that pool and less from acquisitions. I think that -- I would tell you it's going to be somewhat minimal. It's a big enough same-store pool and you're not bringing that many properties in that the number is not going to be that significant.","Juan Sanabria","And one last question for me. So you said that the concessions were about any an 80 basis points drag to the third quarter same-store revenues. And you've described the fourth quarter given an easier comp has not been an issue. Does that mean that that 80 point delta goes away to zero in terms of a drag on a year-over-year basis?","Scott Stubbs","Not sure it goes to zero, but a significant portion of it goes away.","Operator","There are no remaining questions. I would like to turn the call back over for further remarks.","Joe Margolis","Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our platform and our team's ability to continue to drive rental rates and occupancy. We have always invested in our platform, our portfolio and our people and it is paying dividends in the current competitive environment. 2018 is following our expectations and our diversified portfolio is performing well. We're excited about our outsized external growth as we enhance our size, scale and brand. We thank you for your interest in and support of Extra Space Storage.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Jeff Norman, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Mark. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 conference call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.","Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business.

The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Hello everyone. 2014 was another outstanding year for Extra Space. We reached record high occupancies, drove rates, controlled our expenses, and produced exceptional results. For the year, same-store revenue growth was 7.5% and NOI growth was 9.5%. Occupancy ended the year at a record 91.4%, up 190 basis points. Most importantly, FFO as adjusted increased 23.7%.","Despite heightened competition for properties on the open market, we closed $531 million in acquisitions during 2014. We are off to a solid start in 2015 with $271 million in stabilized and lease up stores closed or under contract. In addition, we have $56 million in certificate of occupancy stores that will be completed and purchased in 2015.","I will now turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Spencer. Last night, we reported FFO of $0.62 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.52 per share for the year. Excluding costs associated with acquisitions, non-cash interest and a loss related to a fire, FFO as adjusted was $0.68 per share for the year and $2.61 per share for the year, which was at the high end of our guidance.","We had a busy fourth quarter, acquiring 19 stores for $164 million. Of the 19 stores, 15 were sourced from our third party managed pool. Our relationships with our partners continue to provide an advantage in our acquisitions. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired three stores for $42 million and have 28 stabilized and lease up stores under contract for $229 million for a total of $271 million. These acquisitions should close by the end of the second quarter.","Additionally, we have another 13 stores under contract that we will acquire upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. The total purchase price of the stores is $138 million, of which $56 million is expected to close in 2015.","Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2015. Our new same store pool will increase by 61 to 503 stores. We expect the change in same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth, which we will further detail with our Q1 results.","Our full-year 2015 FFO guidance is from $2.85 to $2.94 per share. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $2.89 to $2.98 per share. This includes $0.03 of dilution from our 2014 and 2015 certificate of occupancy acquisitions.","Our guidance also includes acquisitions that currently operate below our portfolio average. We anticipate the stores will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. This limits year one accretion and is part of a long term strategy to leverage our operating expertise and to maximize shareholder return.","I will now turn the time back to Spencer.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks, Scott. In 2015, we acknowledge that going up against the comps of 2014 will be difficult. As we have said many times, this level of year over year performance is not realistic to expect, nor is it sustainable. Our results rolled back from the extraordinary to really good.","That being said, I\u2019m confident of three things. First, this supply will not be an issue in 2015. Second, we will continue to drive higher value customers to our stores and maximize revenue through rate and discount optimization. Third, Extra Space will deliver another year of double-digit FFO growth, an impressive accomplishment in the real estate sector.","Let\u2019s now turn the time back to Jeff to start the Q&A session.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limit it to two. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everybody has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we will turn it over to Mark to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas","Just first question on acquisitions. I was just wondering what caused the owners of the 15 properties that EXR acquired from third party managers to sell, was this one portfolio or portfolio owned by one individual or entity or was it a number of individual sellers and what was the motivation there.","Spencer Kirk","We had two small portfolios, one with five properties and one with four, both transactions the seller wanted to get done by the end of the year.","Todd Thomas","And then just in terms of funding capacity for these acquisitions sort of what's under contract and what you see in the pipeline here. Balance sheet is in good shape from a leverage standpoint, but you have over $200 million of maturities and the acquisition pipeline left to fund. So what's the plan to handle that throughout the year? And also along those lines, just curious you've commented in the past about migrating toward an investment grade rating, what are your thoughts there?","Spencer Kirk","So our guidance this year of $500 million in acquisitions assumes between $75 million and $100 million of shares being issued. Those would primarily be operating partnership units is our guess. The rest will be funded with debt. As far as refinancing the debt, we don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be a problem at all, it\u2019s actually CMBS debt, the $200 million of it comes due in August and we will prepay it as soon as June. It's the earliest prepayment window that we have and we estimate we should get a pretty good decrease in rate with that. As far as migrating the balance sheet to more investment grade, our plan this year is to potentially do some unsecured bank debt is really the plan this year.","Todd Thomas","Okay, but in terms of the $200 million of CMBS debt, your expectation is that you'll refinance that?","Spencer Kirk","We will refinance it, correct, bank debt, not CMBS. And it will likely be a combination of secured and unsecured bank debt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citi.","Smedes Rose","Hi, it's Smedes. It looks like the number of C of O deals is accelerating in your pipeline and I was just wondering do you feel comfortable that you can keep dilution at still to 2% to 3% or are you willing to let that move up a little bit as these deals increase?","Spencer Kirk","We do like C of O deals, we also like being disciplined in that range of 2% to 3% is something that we are going to try and operate in. We\u2019re not really interested in having a lot of drag on our earnings going forward. One way that we can address this is with a JV partner to help deal with the dilution, obviously we get the management fees, the tenant insurance, we increase our platform so we get economies of scale and a JV partner is in fact already involved in what we are doing. We\u2019ve got three properties with a JV right now. So we are going to manage the dilution.","Smedes Rose","And then you mentioned in 2015 there's no new supply, it's not an issue. But to what year or when do you think it does become more of an issue? It seems like on the last call there was from Public Storage, they mentioned that there is a lot more coming out of the ground maybe than people realize. I'm just curious your thoughts around that.","Spencer Kirk","So there are a lot of opinions on this, I can\u2019t speak to the prior call. What I can tell you is as I travel the country and as we go out and clearly our folks in the field, we talk with brokers, we meet with vendors, we talk with developers, we meet with local operators, there is interest in new supply, there is more talk I believe than action. I do believe that supply is coming, but it needs to be kept into perspective.","My personal opinion is there might be 300 to 500 properties under construction in the US and that today is not even keeping pace with the population increase. So there is interest, there is a lot of talk, but land prices are higher, the difficulty of getting entitlements is not getting any more favorable and most people that are out there are recognizing that they\u2019re going to have to align themselves with larger operator to compete on the Internet. When you do that, you\u2019re going to be paying management fees, giving up some of the tenant insurance income, then the return on that is likely to go down. So it\u2019s not as compelling.","Last point I might add, if you say Public Storage has got $400 million under construction, the other REITs combined maybe have another $400 million under construction, call it $800 million, you might have 100 properties being produced by the REITs. And we are in the best position to capitalize on the return versus risk profile. So I think it\u2019s muted, we\u2019ll have to see how 2016 and 2017 shape up. But 2015, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross Nussbaum","Two questions. First is on the balance sheet. You guys have about $845 million of variable rate debt, which I think is about 35% of your total debt load, which is on the higher side in the REIT industry. Do you guys have any plans to \u2013 you talked about doing that bank debt; is the game plan to repay the floating rate debt? Do you have any plans to put some swaps on, term this debt out? Can you talk about that variable rate exposure?","Spencer Kirk","For the end of the year, we finished at 35%, right around 35%. And it\u2019s actually slightly higher depending on where your lines of credit are. So that the end of the quarter, when we had some lines that were partially drawn, it caused it to be slightly higher. What we are doing today is we\u2019re looking to \u2013 the debt we are putting on, we\u2019re fixing, whereas we allowed a certain portion to go variable over the last two years and we will fix a large percentage of that going forward or the new loans coming on. So we don\u2019t see it going any higher, the percentage of variable rate debt.","Ross Nussbaum","But you're not actively going to push it materially lower?","Spencer Kirk","We will manage it and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily going to be materially lower, it probably depends little bit on how you define material. I think it\u2019s going to be plus or minus 10%, I mean, you might go to 25% variable rate.","Ross Nussbaum","The other question I had is just conceptually on rate growth. I'm wondering in terms of realized rate growth, based on what you're seeing competitively and what potentially the supply pipeline could be as we look maybe a year or 18 months ahead, is it realistic to think that rate growth can get much better than call it the 5%-ish somewhere in the 5%s? And that's kind of where things are going to settle out or is there any reason to believe it can be better than that?","Spencer Kirk","I think that you\u2019ve seen the last few years be really as good as self-storage is \u2013 industry has ever experienced. And the rate growth has been in that 4% to 5% range with some of us experiencing gains in occupancy. So I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to get significantly better, especially with new supply coming.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Spencer, you talked about this a little bit in the beginning opening remarks, but in regards to your 7% same-store NOI guidance for 2015, how much does the same-store pool changing impact that number?","Spencer Kirk","We don\u2019t know exactly yet, Ki Bin. We\u2019re going to guesstimate may be 50 basis points.","Ki Bin Kim","And second question, if the market, going back to street rate, if the market doesn't increase, the market rents street rates don't increase this year, let's say it's flat year-over-year, how much embedded rent growth or how much embedded same-store revenue growth can your portfolio produce given the trend in higher street rates we've experienced in the past couple years and the trend in lower promotions? So without any new market rent growth what could the organic growth of this current portfolio be?","Spencer Kirk","For 2015, just kind of maybe giving you a little bit bigger picture, we are estimating rate growth to be 4% to 5% with occupancy being 1.5% and then our existing customer adding maybe another 50 basis points. So if you strip out the 4% to 5%, you\u2019re talking 2% growth. But we do anticipate that you will have rate growth in 2015.","Scott Stubbs","One of the interesting things, Ki Bin, is our strategy in the [indiscernible] not be aggressive on rate and actually hold occupancy. If you look at what happened in the fourth quarter, instead of occupancy going down, we did a decent job and as we look at what\u2019s happening in the first quarter, occupancy certainly is holding. So we are already seeing some strength in pricing power and although that is a scenario that could play out, I\u2019m skeptical that it would. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Ryan Burke from Green Street Advisors.","Ryan Burke","Spencer, I'm curious what impact lower gas prices have on the mindset of the storage consumer? Have you seen any changes in your customers' decision-making patterns and have you made any specific operational adjustments as the price of gas has come down?","Spencer Kirk","No, no and no. So I\u2019m not trying to be smart, Ryan, the answer is this. There are numerous demand drivers for self storage. The best thing that I can tell you is overall consumer confidence and overall health of our economy is best for our business, but to selectively drive it down to one single element like gas prices, we can\u2019t measure it, we can\u2019t track it and we don\u2019t know.","Ryan Burke","So likely a positive impact, just extremely difficult, probably impossible to quantify?","Spencer Kirk","Yes.","Ryan Burke","Okay. Second question, you've often talked about the fact that you're building a company, you're not shrinking a company so therefore, dispositions haven't made much sense in the past. Is there a point where cap rates get so low that you become more inclined to sell assets, particularly with the amount of external growth that you have on the pipeline?","Spencer Kirk","This is a difficult question for us so basically because when you think of wholly owned assets, partially owned assets, i.e. JV, and non-owned assets, meaning the managed assets and third party relationships, when you start selling assets that might be wholly owned in a particular market, obviously you are giving up some revenue and income and you might be redeploying it not to your advantage, because you might be selling at 6.5% or 7% and then to having redeployed it something less than that in another market. But the biggest problem for us or challenge rather is the operational efficiency in those markets where we have meaningful mass and momentum. And to further repeat our efficiency and economies of scale by getting out of markets we economically have not figured out how to do that. There may be a few in the periphery, but in the main, because of our unique structure, it\u2019s difficult to dispose and not have some adverse economic impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies.","George Hoglund","Just wanted to check on the acquisition environment and check if there's any sort of larger portfolios out there that you guys are seeing?","Spencer Kirk","George, one of the things that I think most of the REITs would talk about is over the course of last several years, there\u2019s been a fair amount of acquisition activity. I think we\u2019ve all done quite well. I think it\u2019s also important to note that a lot of low hanging fruit has already been plucked. So as we think about large portfolios out there, might be available in 2015, there is talk, there are rumors, but I\u2019m not aware of anything substantive today that would cause us to change our guidance.","George Hoglund","And then also in terms of the competitive landscape, are you seeing any change from the smaller competitors in terms of them getting better on terms of an internet marketing perspective or from an operating perspective?","Spencer Kirk","I think they are migrating in terms of sophistication, I will say generally that well, everybody has now got a website up that works in the world of desktop, laptop, the move to mobile has been so rapid that I think once again many of the smaller operators are disadvantaged because they can\u2019t create platforms that optimize all of the different mobile applications and hardware platforms out there. And I think that\u2019s the large publicly traded REITs that continue to have an advantage as the market continues to evolve on the technology front. It takes a lot of manpower, it takes a lot of resources and I generally don\u2019t believe it\u2019s something that you can just farm out to some smaller less well capitalized group to optimize what is happening with the ascendancy of the mobile device.","George Hoglund","And then just one small little bit, on the $1.7 million of property casualty losses in Q4, can you just provide some color on that?","Spencer Kirk","We had a fire at one of our properties in Venice, California, we are self-insured on a portion of it and that represents the net amount that it will cost us to rebuild a portion of that property.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Stender or Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Just to get back to the 13 C of O deals under contract, can you go through the range of IRRs for that group? And can you describe how the return profiles for the three facilities that are going into a JV different from the others?","Scott Stubbs","So the three properties that are going into the JV are ones that we took to our JV partner and had them \u2013 we\u2019re going to take more and more to them, but they were some of the ones that came in a little bit later. We had some already going when we established the joint venture. So those did not go to the joint venture. Going forward, we are taking the majority of those to the JV partner. As far as the range of IRRs and unlevered IRR is going to be high single digits.","Todd Stender","And for you to send or give investment opportunities to the JV, is that an obligation you're under or these just don't fit your return hurdles?","Scott Stubbs","We have a commitment to supply to them a certain amount as far as volume.","Todd Stender","And then just from a bigger picture perspective, what's your appetite for expanding outside of the top 25 MSAs? I guess as you look out over the next couple of years, evaluate acquisition candidates and some of the markets that you just have really steered clear of maybe in the past, how do you think about broadening your universe?","Spencer Kirk","I think our appetite is reasonable. I\u2019ve said several times we are not going to get to 2000 properties by being in Los Angeles and New York. We have to get outside of the top 25 MSAs. Top 50 MSAs sounds very appealing to us, I think that\u2019s been proven with another company and I think it\u2019s a strategy that can work well for Extra Space going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky","Scott, you went through a good detail on the revenue components there driving that. Can you give us just the same kind of break out of what's driving the pressure on expenses in 2015 relative to 2014?","Scott Stubbs","Our biggest expense increase in 2015 is going to relate primarily to property taxes. In our same store pool, we are budgeting a 5% increase in property taxes and roughly a third of our expenses Q property taxes. So by giving a range that we did, it\u2019s really property taxes with some lower inflationary increases on payroll and some other items.","Michael Salinsky","Then just as my second question, just going back to the pickup in activity in the fourth quarter and then year-to-date. Has there been any change in underwriting standards? And then, just looking at the growth rates being underwritten in your IRR analysis, 12 to 18 months ago versus currently, has that changed as you progress later in the cycle and you have supply on the horizon?","Scott Stubbs","I think the acquisition market is very competitive today. I think that obviously all the REITs are buying, I think you\u2019re seeing other types of capital chasing self storage. It\u2019s caused cap rates to come down. We want to be as disciplined as possible and provide the best return to our shareholders and one of the areas we\u2019ve looked at obviously is certificate of occupancy.","The other area we\u2019ve tried to focus on is assets that are maybe underperforming our current standard today, so maybe a property on average is 75% and we have properties in the same market that are low 90s. That\u2019s something that\u2019s interesting to us. And so we might be going to be a little bit more aggressive on a year one cap rate for that property, because in year two, year three, it\u2019s really going to provide a pop and a benefit to the shareholders. So year one we might be willing to go in with very little accretion, which is something I talked about in my opening comments as far as something we are focusing on.","Michael Salinsky","So just in that note then, what was the going in cap rate on that properties purchased in the fourth quarter and then under contract versus where do you expect those to stabilize?","Scott Stubbs","I think it really varies quite a bit. If you look for instance at 2015, we are targeting a stabilized cap rate on a property that\u2019s stabilized our standards of being 6% to 6.5% cap year one. That\u2019s where the management fee and with our expenses. Certificate of occupancy deals are going to be zeros, they\u2019re dilutive actually in year one. We also are looking at a portfolio, a group of properties that might be a 3 to 5 cap in year one, because they\u2019re not stabilized, maybe there are occupancies 30% to 40%, maybe it\u2019s 70%. So we\u2019re doing a blend of all of them, so it\u2019s difficult to really say exactly what the cap rate was on one particular acquisition.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato from BMO Capital Markets.","Paul Adornato","Just wanted to follow-up on, Spencer on your development comments, I think you said that you've thought that there were maybe 300 to 500 storage properties being developed right now in the US with the REITs accounting for about 100 of those. So what's the source of development capital for the rest of those?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s a variety of sources, it\u2019s the small local storage operator that\u2019s decided that they want to finally expand from 1 to 2 stores, you\u2019ve got private equity investing in some of these forays into the self storage market. I can specifically pinpoint any one source, all I can say is because of the outperformance of the self storage sector year over year over year, there\u2019s been a spotlight on self storage and everybody has an interest in getting into the game. It\u2019s just a lot more difficult than most people imagine and their return profile as I spoke to earlier is less favorable than in years gone by. So the 300 to 500 number is my best guess of what will come out of the ground and open in 2015. There might be additional properties that are being contemplated or being worked on or entitled or whatever, but my comment is I just don\u2019t see it being a factor in 2015. It\u2019s below the natural population increase.","Paul Adornato","Okay. And I guess related to that, how many C of O deals do you see or are shown to you for every one that you do?","Spencer Kirk","That\u2019s hard to quantify, because that\u2019s a pretty good screening process, but I would say at least 10 to 15.","Paul Adornato","Okay. So is it fair to say that most of what's being built has been shown to at least one of the big operators?","Spencer Kirk","Not necessarily. I would say in core markets we see a lot of those, maybe in some of the tertiary markets, we don\u2019t see everything that\u2019s coming to market. But in New York City, I think we\u2019re aware of a lot or most of them, and in Dallas we see a lot of them, but if you start getting into Wichita, Kansas, places like that, you might not see everything.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon of D.A. Davidson.","Paula Poskon","Spencer, you have long said that you thought operational consolidation would lead ownership consolidation and the acquisition activity out of the third party management pool of assets seems to be proving that true. Is that happening in line with the speed of your expectations? Is it happening faster or slower than you thought? And what do you think is the biggest emphasis driving sellers to market? Is it the low cap rates? Is it just the natural generational estate planning? What do you think is the biggest driver?","Spencer Kirk","So being an impatient person, it\u2019s not going at the rate that I would like, but I have to say in terms of where we are, I think the Extra Space is doing very well. And what I mean is we have produced record results for these third-party customers. And the question that they often ask is if I sell you my asset, where am I possibly going to reinvest to get this kind of return? So there\u2019s little reluctance right now. Nonetheless, first generation entrepreneurs getting a little bit older and thinking about a state planning is a primary driver.","Number two, our OP unit transactions are compelling, not for everybody, but for a good slot of the population that we have relationships with because it provides tax-deferred transaction, it allows for them to get dividend and it also allows them to hopefully share some appreciation in the stock price. And those three items have spoken very well to a number of operators, but not everyone. So as we look forward, I think that growing our third party management platform goes right back to the strategic reason why we entered into it in the first place and that is it\u2019s an off-market acquisition pipeline and we proved again in Q4 that it adds real value to our shareholders.","Paula Poskon","And just one final follow-up on the third party platform, how important is it that you maintain your branding strategy? That you insist third party assets coming into your management platform rebrand to the Extra Space?","Spencer Kirk","That\u2019s important, it\u2019s a key focal point, we reject many opportunities when we have a hot discussion with an owner, who isn\u2019t willing to put the CapEx dollars and to bring it up to our standard. And we walk away from far more deals than we actually bring in just because of the desire to have a consistency across wholly owned, partially owned, and non-owned assets. We\u2019re trying to build a brand and we try doing for brand standards, but when we\u2019re not underwriting the check sometimes there\u2019s a little push back, but coming in we have set a proper expectation that if you\u2019re going to be on our system, there is a standard and we expect you to meet it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Mesbaum of UBS.","Jeremy Metz","Hi guys, it's Jeremy on with Ross. I just had a quick follow-up on the CO deals. I was just wondering what you guys are seeing or at least what is being brought to you whether you're going forward or rejecting it. Are these existing projects that are already shovel ready or are you seeing developers locking up land rights with the hope of a retake out?","Scott Stubbs","We\u2019re seeing probably more of the second one there, many of these don\u2019t even have the land under contract, it\u2019s an LOI or it\u2019s a concept, just to see if it\u2019s something that works for us, that will bounce it up, occasionally we will see someone bring it to us that it\u2019s actually entitled and ready to go, but that is actually more of the exception.","Jeremy Metz","And then the only second one, and sorry if I missed this, but just wondering what went on in Colorado? It seemed like you lost close to 600 basis points of occupancy there and saw some revenue declines?","Scott Stubbs","I think in our stabilized properties, I wouldn\u2019t say, so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s in addition of a managed property or managed pool properties. We\u2019ll take that offline, Jeremy.","Jeremy Metz","Yes, okay. I know it's a small market. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Just a couple quick follow-ups. I know you guys talked about your longer term variable rate debt percentage that you're comfortable with. But that is not just higher in self-storage REITs but kind of all REITs and just given where we are in the interest rate environment why not just take that down to pretty close to zero, excluding the line of credit, right?","Spencer Kirk","We are looking at some, Ki Bin. In fact, we are looking at even doing some forward swaps on some of the stuff that\u2019s out two and three years. So we\u2019re not necessarily looking to be more aggressive, but we do think it is prudent to have some exposure to the variable rate interest market and I think that those who have had exposure over the last few years have won on that one. So we recognize that we\u2019re likely in a rising interest rate environment, but we do think it\u2019s prudent to have a combination of both.","Ki Bin Kim","And in terms of the C of O deals, especially the ones that are supposed to be within the JV structure, it seems like you have a 10% equity stake in those deals, smaller dollars and nominally. Do these deals come with a right of first refusal or some kind of contractual clause where you could take that 10% ownership up to 100% at a certain points in time? Because otherwise, why even bother with a 10% equity stake given the size of your company?","Spencer Kirk","We do have rights that allow us to take that from 10% to 100%, but it\u2019s not time-based, it is basically when we come to that agreement or when our JV partner is looking to move out of this self storage industry or show some returns, so we do have an opportunity to take that to 100% and we agree it is a lot of work for 10% and that\u2019s why we have done probably more on balance sheet and less JV.","Ki Bin Kim","And when you say at an agreement is that a market price appraisal based pricing trigger or is it already kind of stipulated today at what kind of multiple you'd be willing to pay as certain cash flow in the future?","Spencer Kirk","It\u2019s not based on a multiple or cash flow today, it\u2019s going to be more market and its more of a buy\/sell within a JV that\u2019s built into the operating agreement. The other thing that it does for us by doing joint ventures is it also refreshes our portfolio, we are bringing new properties into the portfolio, so from a branding that type of thing it obviously really helps to have new properties in the portfolio.","Operator","I would now like to hand the call over to Spencer Kirk for closing remarks.","Spencer Kirk","Thank you everyone for the interest in Extra Space today.

We kicked off 2017 with the solid first quarter and fundamentals remain positive. We gained occupancy, grew street rates, and increase same-store revenue by 5.8%. We demonstrated great expense control with the 2% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 9.2% and FFO per share as adjusted increased by 20%.","We saw positive year-over-year revenue growth in all MSAs. We also saw acceleration of revenue growth in several MSAs, including Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We are enjoying the benefits of a well balanced diversified portfolio, operational scale and the ability to achieve outsized growth from storage added to our platform.","We continue to be disciplined on the acquisition front. And we are committed to transact only a prices we will provide long-term value for our shareholders. During the quarter, we added two wholly-owned stores and two joint venture stores, for a total investment of $28 million.","In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party platform and we have a robust pipeline of additional stores, which we will manage under the Extra Space brand. These managed stores will provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities.","Importantly, we are starting to see a more balance mix of development and existing stores and our managed to our pipeline.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Joe. Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $0.04. Revenues were in line with expectations and the beat was primarily driven by property operating expenses. Property taxes and payroll were lower than expected and utilities and snow removal were below budget due to mild winter.","Our 2017 same-store pool increased 168 stores for a total of 732. A change in the same-store pool added 110 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter and we expect to benefit from the changing pool average 50 basis points over the year.","Same-store NOI benefited 220 basis points from the changing pool during the quarter. Beginning January 1, 2017, we have elected to exclude revenue and expenses related to tenant reinsurance from our same-store numbers. This quarter we are presenting the impact of this change in our Q1 supplemental financial information, which shows the results of our 2016 and 2017 same-store pools with and without tenant reinsurance.","Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 92.2% with an 80 basis point year-over-year increase. We are \u2013 we were able to push our rates to new customers approximately 3% to 4% during the quarter. We experience positive net rentals each month and continue to see steady demand.","In the first quarter, we do not access our ATM. Acquisitions along maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. At quarter end, we\u2019ve drawn $300 million on the term loans with $350 million in remaining term debt available. The revolving portion of the credit facility had a balance of $337 million with $163 million available.","Subsequent to quarter end, we swapped $300 million from fixed to variable \u2013 from variable rate to fixed rate debt on a five-year term tranche. We reaffirm our annual same-store revenue guidance of 4% to 5% due to the Q1 expense beat we are lowering our annual expense guidance to 2.25% to 3.25%. As a result, we are increasing our annual NOI guidance to 4.25% to 5.75%.","We also reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million. The mix is change slightly and now includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores and $190 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments, with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space, approximately $150 million is currently closed or identified.","Our guidance assumes the remaining unidentified acquisitions were closed in the third and fourth quarter. As a result of the Q1 beat, we\u2019re increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.21 to $4.29 per share. Our guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value added acquisitions for a total $0.15.","I\u2019ll now turn the time back to Joe.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, Scott. We have a solid first quarter with growth in rates, rentals and occupancy. And we are well positioned heading into our busy season. Revenue de-acceleration from our core assets continues to flatten. We\u2019re seeing great performance from value added acquisitions as they are integrated onto our platform.","We expect moderation in the back half of the year. We still expect stores to produce some of the best revenue growth in real estate sector. We continue to monitor new supply in key markets to analyze its impact on our performance and to adjust operations that affected stores to minimize impact.","While certain stores in markets have felt the impact of new development, it has not prevented or some experiencing positive revenue growth. Also, we are seeing re-acceleration of revenue growth in some markets, including some that we\u2019re on the front end of the development cycle.","And efficient to maximizing same-store operating performance, we continue to utilize other tools that enhance FFO. We are focused on building our third party management portfolio and pursuing high yielding redevelopment and expansion opportunities at our existing stores. Such efforts together with our solid operations should be to another strong year of FFO growth.","Let\u2019s now turn the time over to Jeff, to start the Q&A session.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Joe. In order to ensure, we have adequate time to address everyone\u2019s questions. I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows we will address following questions, once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we\u2019ll turn it over to James to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Your question please.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks. Joe, just interested and you mentioned re-acceleration of trends in some markets where development was kind of on the front end of the cycle. Could you maybe talk about, which market specifically you\u2019re seeing re-acceleration in.","Joe Margolis","I think the best example of that is Chicago, where we had a difficult time last year and we\u2019re starting to come off of the floor there. Denver is another one maybe not to the extent of Chicago. And I would just caution you up. We\u2019re not saying it\u2019s a hockey stick, but we\u2019re saying we\u2019re moving in the right direction.","Smedes Rose","Okay, great. And then I just wanted to ask you quickly, you had mentioned on the last call that the visibility into 2018 supply was difficult to get good feel for. And I\u2019m just wondering a few months more into the here. Do you have a better feel for where supply might end up in 2018?","Joe Margolis","I think that\u2019s a very difficult question, I mean, storage as a property type is very a short delivery cycle. You can build these stores relatively quickly. And we\u2019re continuing to see a significant up to 60% fall out rate in the development projects that are in our management plus pipeline. And that is unsatisfactory [indiscernible] this is I think that we do believe that there\u2019s not great visibility into next year.","Michael Bilerman","Joe, would you \u2013 it\u2019s Michael Bilerman [Citigroup] speaking. How do you think about PSA will talk about what the public REITs are doing and extrapolate that based on the public market shares \u2013 share in the industry. So they would take the 5.2%, 5.3%, that\u2019s being developed by the public REIT. Take 13% and say there\u2019s 45 million, 46million square feet of development. I guess, how would you look at it overall. Do you think that over underestimate source an accurate estimate of the demand of supply that\u2019s coming online?","Joe Margolis","I\u2019ve great respect for Ron in Public Storage, but I don\u2019t know the assumption that the percentage that the publics are developing versus the overall market will give you an accurate REIT.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Smedes. Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Your question please.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, good morning. I was just hoping you could comment on street rate growth trends during the quarter and into the second quarter, and if there was any significant variance between the same-store pool last year and this year, where you included smart stuff.","Scott Stubbs","Yes, this is Scott. I would tell you the street rates grew at \u2013 street and achieved rates grew at 3% to 4% in the quarter that continues in April. And I would tell you the SmartStop rates are actually \u2013 probably slightly lower than that, as we continue to gain occupancy at those properties. But it\u2019s been steady at 3% to 4%.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, great. And then, what should we think of is driving the deceleration in the SmartStop contribution that you said you\u2019re holding the 50 basis point contribution in same-store revenue for the year. Is that just \u2013 is that filling up the stores and having kind of less low hanging fruit.","Scott Stubbs","Tougher comps, you coming up against that \u2013 it was already performing fairly well in the back half of last year and is this year compares to the back half of last year those comps get tougher.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, if I can squeeze in one last quick one, you talked about a 60% fall out on new developments on your platform. Any sense of what that was historically.","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s ticked up slightly, but I wouldn\u2019t put too much [indiscernible] it\u2019s been pretty steady between 40% and 60% over the last year.","Juan Sanabria","Thanks.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Juan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. Your question please.","George Hoglund","Hey, guys. Just in terms of how you\u2019re looking at acquisitions for the rest of the year. And what would have to happen to sort of change acquisition volume, I mean obviously a better stock price would help. But in terms of kind of where pricing is today where your stock is, how much of a delta is there between, where pricing is and where would have to be to get you guys to get more active.","Joe Margolis","We\u2019re not pricing acquisitions on our stock price on any particular day. Our stock price is going to go up or down I have no idea, why our stock price goes up and down. And we\u2019re trying to find acquisitions to produce long-term value for our shareholders without kind of comparing it to spot pricing of our stock. What we\u2019re looking and hoping to happens, so we can acquire more properties to back end of the year is that cap rates expect and sellers\u2019 expectations for pricing come more in line with what we\u2019re willing to pay for properties.","George Hoglund","And any sort of general sense kind of ballpark sort of on a cap rate basis ROE 50 bps, 100 bps away or how far.","Joe Margolis","Yes, I think that\u2019s a probably pretty, pretty fair range.","George Hoglund","Okay, thanks.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Burke with Green Street Advisors. Sir, your question please.","Ryan Burke","Thank you. Joe, was I correct and hearing you in your prepared remarks referencing that you\u2019re seeing a more balance and mix of development and stabilize properties in the managed pipeline.","Joe Margolis","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Ryan Burke","Would you might just elaborate a little bit further just to explain what you mean and why it\u2019s important notable.","Joe Margolis","So in 2016, the vast majority of projects that we signed up for the people were enquiring about to have us manage these stores form new development. And now we\u2019re starting to see more existing owners I think as go and get a little tougher realize the need professional management. And we\u2019re having more and more discussions with existing owners. 40% of the properties we brought on in the first quarter were existing properties.","And that\u2019s important because when you bring an existing property on. We start making money right away, because it\u2019s fall. And our fee is a percentage of revenue and when you bring on developing property, it\u2019s not as profitable until you can lease it up.","Ryan Burke","Okay, makes sense. Thank you. There has been some talk a smaller developers potentially becoming a little bit uneasy about the operating environment and potentially looking to sell, actually sooner than they otherwise would have. Are you guys seeing that?","Joe Margolis","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing enough to that to call that a trend.","Ryan Burke","Okay. Last question, any update on the potential disposition portfolio.","Joe Margolis","Sure. So to be clear we\u2019re looking to recapitalize a portfolio to sell majority interest in it or transfer to JV in which we would own in minority interest, keep it under the Extra Space platform. We are undergoing a process, we\u2019ve collected first round bids and we\u2019re in a process. And we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll talk more about it when we\u2019re done.","Ryan Burke","Okay, are you able to provide any color about the likelihood of that being a new JV partner versus an existing partner.","Joe Margolis","We really can\u2019t say until we know where we end up.","Ryan Burke","Understood, thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital. Your question please.","Todd Thomas","Hi, Thanks. First question, around this time last year there are some softness in demand set in around the start of the peak leasing season. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment on how the beginning of the peak season has been so far here, and if you\u2019re doing anything differently this year having observed that softness last year.","Joe Margolis","So this year versus last year I would tell you, this year has been steady so far. Last year we were probably a little bit more aggressive on pricing. And year-over-year we were not spending extra on the Internet, our year-over-year marketing cost last year actually went down and this year we\u2019re spending more and budgets are little bit higher. So that potentially lower prices, higher marketing spend is yield \u2013 it\u2019s a good yield for us this year.","Todd Thomas","Okay, but you\u2019re not seeing market pricing or any increasing competition necessarily create softness so far this point in the beginning of the peak leasing season.","Scott Stubbs","Year-to-date we have not, our rentals or demand has been steady to slightly up and our rates are still 3% to 4% above where they were last year. So we classify that as a solid year.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then just following up on the impact from SmartStop portfolio. So it\u2019s sound like you\u2019re expecting the year-over-year contribution to be fairly muted by year-end, so essentially no benefit. Is that the right read and is that what\u2019s embedded in guidance.","Scott Stubbs","That is correct and that is what is embedded in guidance.","Todd Thomas","Okay, thank you.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gwen Clark with Evercore ISI. Your question please.","Gwen Clark","Hi, can you guys give us a rundown of how your largest markets there in relative to expectations, and whether they were any surprises in the quarter.","Joe Margolis","So, first thing I would tell you is our markets \u2013 in our supplementals, we disclose two things, we disclose our same-store and then also our mature pool. And I think that there\u2019s a little noise in both of those disclosures in the supplements in the SmartStop has been added to both of those pools as well as the larger Dallas acquisition which we did last year.","So a few of those markets could potentially be overstated as a result of adding those properties. I would tell you Los Angeles continues to do well. Sacramento to lesser degree continues to do well, it\u2019s a good growth for \u2013 now this is under the third year, I would tell you we would probably expect that to tail off it\u2019s been 15% plus for a long period of time. Boston is not doing as well, but it has bounced back some. And then Houston and Dallas continue to slide a little bit.","Gwen Clark","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just one quick follow up on topic of California, have you seen any signs of suppliers going to pop up in the larger metro areas that you are in.","Joe Margolis","So we\u2019re very focused on South Orange County, Irvine company is very aggressively building we\u2019re managing those stores that we known, but there is a good amount of supply coming there. San Jose and San Diego are the two markets we\u2019re looking at.","Gwen Clark","You mean in terms of supply coming on or you\u2019re looking to build\u2026","Joe Margolis","No, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry to be, I\u2019m clear. San Jose and San Diego are to markets that there is some supply coming on and we\u2019re looking that and trying to understand it.","Gwen Clark","Okay, thanks for clarifying. Thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Gwen.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Hughes with Raymond James. Your question please.","Jon Hughes","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Same-store revenues were up 4% in the overall New York same-store pool. But could you tell us what the revenue growth was in the 61 assets that are in old same-store pool.","Joe Margolis","Our New York market did not see a huge benefit or huge difference between the two pools. So it was slightly less in the old same-store pool. We have seen the difference between New York, northern New Jersey, and the Boroughs. The Boroughs are not doing as well, but we do not have as much exposure to the Boroughs. So we may not have enough exposure for to be good sample size. But we are seeing slower growth in the Boroughs and better growth in northern New Jersey and Long Island.","Jon Hughes","Okay. Thank you, appreciate that. And then why would vacate activity so favorable during the quarter. I\u2019m just curious to know if same-store rentals and vacates were materially different across the old same-store pool and the 170 assets added this year.","Joe Margolis","Yes, your hard part I would tell you is you\u2019re always comparing to the prior year and it depends a little bit on what happened last year. But I think that I wouldn\u2019t focus too much on year-over-year, but we did have a mild winter this year, but last winter was not terrible either so.","Jon Hughes","Right, okay fair enough. Just one more quick one, I\u2019m sorry if I missed it earlier. But can you give us an update on occupancy today or the most recent number you have?","Joe Margolis","It\u2019s not that different from where we ended the quarter in terms of year-over-year.","Jon Hughes","Okay, that\u2019s it for me, thanks.","Operator","Thank you","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you, just on the expense side, could you maybe just highlight if there\u2019re any one time items and particularly property taxes what are your expectations for the balance of the year.","Joe Margolis","Yes, if you look at the first quarter and how we performed quarter versus our budget. I would tell you our property taxes came in lower than we expected. Our property taxes beat our budgets by about $1.2 million and about \u2013 over just over half of that was a result of either appeals that where we were had favorable outcomes for adjustment to exit in accruals on the SmartStop and the other assured portfolios with properties in Texas and Illinois. When we bought the properties we used property tax consultants to accrue on those for the first year and year and a half now. And in those two states report on a lag when we got the final bills we ended up reversing accruals return to about a $0.5 million.","So we would tell you that those are benefit that we don\u2019t expect to see throughout the year. We also had some benefit from payroll versus our budget, but we think we\u2019re still early in the year and it\u2019s probably a little bit too early to see whether or not that\u2019s going to continue throughout the year.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, thanks and then just a bigger picture question on this revenue growth as you look out. If I\u2019m correct the last year you mentioned your view was that trends will decelerate, but well sort of trend towards long-term average. Your long-term average revenue growth, if I\u2019m not correct over 10 year basis about 4.9%, and your co-pool is probably growing around in the high force. What are your expectations as you look out over the next few quarters. Are you sort of now trending at that long-term number and you expect it to be there. Or could there be, if there likelihood up for their deceleration.","Joe Margolis","So I think our guidance implies that you decelerate some more through the year. But we think it\u2019s still going to be in that 4% to 5% for the range and depending on where you are in that range, you could go below that or you could stay at the 4% to 5% range depending on where you\u2019re estimating we\u2019re going to end the year.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joe Margolis","Thanks, Vikram.","Operator","Thank you. We have a follow up question form Todd Thomas with Key Banc Capital Markets. Your question please.","Todd Thomas","Yes, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the mix of projects in the third party management portfolio. So you noted you\u2019re seeing more operating assets in the pipeline there. Is the interest from developers down or is the overall pipeline up with the incremental demand just coming from existing owners.","Scott Stubbs","About a year ago we had 150 properties in pipeline. And we have about 300 in the pipeline now. So both the pipeline has increased and the mix \u2013 the percentage of existing in the pipeline has increased.","Todd Thomas","And when you talk about it as a pipeline that\u2019s those are future potential third party management contracts that you\u2019re discussing terms and hoping to land right.","Scott Stubbs","Yes, so it\u2019s potential and that we\u2019re not going to get all of them, but we also know we\u2019re going to continue to add to the pipeline.","Todd Thomas","Sure. And then, do you have any sense in talking to the operators of the existing assets, exactly what it is. That\u2019s causing them to turn to third party managers now, I mean what is it that they\u2019re seeing out there that\u2019s becoming a little bit more challenging in a sense.","Joe Margolis","So we\u2019re experiencing revenue de-acceleration in our portfolio and we know that folks who don\u2019t have our platform and our systems are less able to deal with the tougher market. And I think that has maintaining performance gets harder more and more individual operators will turn to professional management.","Todd Thomas","Okay","Scott Stubbs","Todd, I would add that coming out the two best years, I mean for the last two years they were feeling pretty good about operations and didn\u2019t feel like they needed any help. There is being slow they may look for help.","Todd Thomas","Got it. And then just lastly you mentioned the potential opportunity for redevelopment and expansions in that. That will become an increasing focused for the company. How big is that opportunity in terms of dollars and also the potential increase in rentable square feet and what\u2019s the timeframe that you\u2019re thinking about in order to extract that value.","Joe Margolis","Sure, good question. So, historically we\u2019re always targeted $30 million to $40 million of kind of value added activity. And now we\u2019ve take it some of our acquisition resources and focused on our existing portfolio. We have about 55 projects in the pipeline now, somewhere from financial underwriting to feasibility, to pre-construction and couple of under construction.","About $175 million worth of projects, double-digit returns, and we\u2019ll continue to try to push more projects into that pipeline. The difficult question answers timing, because many of these involved getting some type of entitlements and its difficult to predict how long that will taking all the different jurisdictions.","Todd Thomas","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m not showing any further question at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Margolis for closing remarks.","Joe Margolis","I want to thank everyone for their time today for their interest in Extra Space. And we look forward to catching up at NAREIT. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"8755":["Extra Space Storage, Inc.

And welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Extra Space Storage Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Norman. You may begin.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Michelle. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's fourth quarter and year-end 2018 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website.","Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statement due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements combined in the company's latest filings with the SEC which we encourage our listeners to review.

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year end call. It was great to have so many of you here last month for our Investor Day and we appreciate your interest in, and support of Extra Space Storage.","2018 was another solid year, same-store revenue was in line with expectations. Our diversified portfolio and best-in-class platform are maintaining very high occupancies while producing positive rate growth despite a challenging environment with new supply in many markets. Expenses were also generally in line with expectations with the exception of a couple of uncontrollable expenses which hit in the first half of the year. Our team stepped up and did a great job with controllable expenses, especially in the last two quarters and found ways to offset some of the expense growth through savings and efficiencies.","Our same-store NOI grew 4% for the year despite a challenging operating environment. Same-store NOI was enhanced by our strong external growth from third-party management and off-market acquisitions resulting in core FFO growth of 6.6% which was above the high-end of our annual guidance.","Looking forward to 2019 many of the themes are similar to 2018. We continue to see new supply delivered in many markets. The rate of deliveries has started to slow, and while we still believe new openings in 2019 will be lower than in 2018, we expect the impact of new supply to be greater due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development. These concerns are the same concerns we discussed on our call a year ago. However, there are also some encouraging themes from last year that will continue into 2019.","First, the economy continues to be healthy. Second, we are in a need based industry with steady demand and solid fundamentals. Third, concerns about declining use of storage due to millenials, disruptive new businesses or otherwise are proving to be ill-founded [ph]. And fourth, large operators continue to have a significant technology advantage over most of the industry. As a result, occupancy remains very strong and we have positive rate growth in most markets. We have a geographically diverse portfolio and a platform built to drive traffic to our stores, our website and our call centers. In short, Extra Space is well prepared to navigate today's competitive landscape.","The challenges presented by new supply also continue to bring us opportunities. In 2018, we added 153 stores to our third-party platform and continue to have a robust pipeline for 2019. We invested $580 million in acquisitions, $145 million of which was invested in certificate of occupancy or development fields. We were successful at finding accretive acquisition opportunities to our partners and other relationships before they were exposed to the broader market. 84% of all 2018 acquisition volume was completed through off-market transactions. This off-market acquisition trend has continued into 2019 as we recently completed the buyout of one of our joint venture partners in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay area; these are well located purpose-filled properties that we developed ourselves in the early 2000 in top-tier in-field markets with true barriers to entry.","Extra Space realized a $72.8 million promote in the joint venture through the transaction which was applied to the purchase price. While 2019 will not be without it's challenges, we are making the necessary investments to strengthen our platform and support our growth while maintaining operational excellence in the current environment.","I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Joe, and hello everyone. Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.22 per share and our core FFO for the year was $4.67 per share ahead of our guidance. The peak was primarily due to property performance and G&A savings. Core FFO includes a $0.02 adjustment for the write-off of deferred financing cost related to the prepayment of notes payable to trust. We continue to evolve our balance sheet which has never been stronger.","During the quarter we amended our credit facility, accessed our ATM, and increased our unencumbered pool which now stands at $5.6 billion. These efforts are part of our goal to further diversify our capital structure, latter [ph] our maturities, and minimize our average interest rate while extending the average term. This will ensure that we continue to have capacity to fund future growth through multiple sources of capital.","Last night we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2019; our new same-store pool increased by 38 stores to a total of 821. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 2% to 3% in 2019. As Joe mentioned, we believe the impact from new supply will be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018. The level of this impact will depend on the timing of deliveries and the speed of absorption in impacted markets, specifically the major Florida and Texas markets.","Our guidance also assumes some revenue growth moderation in markets, not heavily impacted by new supply. This is due to multiple years of outsized growth resulting in tough comps. Same-store expense growth is expected to increase 3.75% to 4.75%. The increase in expenses is primarily driven by outsized growth in property taxes and marketing spend. Our revenue and expense guidance results in NOI growth of 1.25% to 2.75%.","Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.73 to $4.83 per share. In 2019 we anticipate total dilution of $0.23 from value-add and C of O acquisitions, up $0.03 from 2018. We recognize that short-term headwinds, this causes to our core FFO growth rate but believe the investment in these lease-up stores continues to improve the quality of the portfolio and generates long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, let's turn it over to Jeff to start our Q & A.","Jeff Norman","Thanks, Scott. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone's question. I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows, we'll address follow-on questions once everyone has had the opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, let's turn over to Michelle to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Specter [ph] of Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, guys, this is Shirley Wu [ph] with Jeff Specter. So thanks for the actual call our supply. I think of previous earnings calls you've mentioned that the percentage of a portfolio being affected by the new supply would be around 60% and 90%. Has that changed and what do you think 2020 is going to look like?","Jeff Norman","So our view of 2019 has not changed. The only thing that's changed on the ground is a certain number of developments that we expect to be delivered in 2018. We're in fact delayed and now will be delivered in 2019. But we expect the same thing to happen in 2019 in some of the properties that are scheduled to be delivered late in 2019 will, in fact, be delayed and not delivered until 2020. So our view continues to be that deliveries will be higher in 2018 than in 2019, although peak impact is in 2019 because of accumulative affect. As to 2020 and our views frankly, it's all subject to the trend continuing of decreasing new developments if in fact, people start putting more shovels in the ground then we could be wrong and you know we just have to wait and see what happens.","Unidentified Analyst","All right so could you talk about chief street rates 4Q and maybe how that's going to look in 1Q of 2019 as well?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, Shirley, our street rate in the fourth quarter were -- this is our achieved street rate, we achieve street rates that we're in the low single digits. And that it was about 2% in January.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets","Jeremy Metz","Did you mention the drag from discounting it all. I know last quarter's about an 80 basis points drag or supposed to update a little bit here and fourth quarter. What was it?","Scott Stubbs","So in the fourth quarter there was really no drag or no benefit from discounts it was flat and our guidance for 2019 is since the same; no benefit or direct.","Jeremy Metz","So if we combine that you know with the 2% effective rate you have just mentioned here, it obviously takes a while to roll through same store but as we think where you're at today and where you're Guidance is, that 2.5% midpoint for revenue assuming you are actually going negative on that effective runs and it sounds like January is holding but are you seeing any sort of signs already maybe in February of some slowing that's making you more cautious?","Scott Stubbs","February is not significantly different than January and I think guidance all depends on where you are in that range.","Jeremy Metz","Okay and then just one last one Joe, at the investor day you touched on the new bridge financing program you started. Can you just give an update on where that stands today? What sort of activity you're seeing out there and how much capital allocation are you putting in the budget here for 2019?","Joe Margolis","Sure, Jeremy, I'd be happy to. For those of you who weren't at investor day, we started -- initiated a new bridge lending program. The goals which is to expand our management platform to form additional relationships across the industry because we found through management parts and other activities we do that those relationships frequently turned out to produce acquisitions or other benefits and to fill what we perceive as a capital void in the market and make some money by lending to non-stabilized stores. We will not be leading to development stores. We don't want to have to take over a half-finished development but we believe there is an opportunity to land on stores that are not yet stabilized. We're just starting this program, we've made a couple loans, we have a few in the hopper, we're getting very good reception in the marketplace. But we are just beginning. We're going to walk before we run. We're going to see how the market reacts to this and I would not expect it to be a significant capital allocation in 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronald [ph] of Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Just following up on same-store expenses. I think you mentioned outside property taxes and marketing spend. Just curious if you can find more details? How does that -- how does the growth rate compare for those versus 2018 and if there's any markets or any kind of a one-time thing that's really driving this outside nature of these expenses?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, our property tax budgets for 2019 assume about 4.5% increase year-over-year. We continue to see pressure across multiple markets, so it's actually down slightly from 2018 but continues to be higher than inflation. 2019 marketing spend is about 11% in -- is what we budgeted which is up from our annual run rate of 2018 and that comes from a couple of things. One is just overall inflation from you know more people bidding on using you know the search engines and that's driving the cost of the bids up as well as you know we're going to supply cycle and wanting to make sure that we stay top of mind in people's buying decisions.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. And then just a quick one on development. Maybe could you just comment versus 3, 6, 9 months ago, have you seen any incremental sign from developers whether a deal compression, whether it's projects taking longer to lease up. Any incremental color on slowing that supply pipeline?","Joe Margolis","I think we are seeing the factors you described. Yield compression, increased costs and just an awareness that many markets are over-built or fully built and some more caution. So we are seeing a hold back in new supply in some areas, new developments in some areas but there still are people who have either more optimistic views or lower yield requirements that are still trying to go forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And the last one for me is; just I noticed in the release that Miami was added to markets lagging in Philly was dying as the market that are performing. Can you just -- maybe a little bit more color on what's going on there? Is there anything to know there?","Joe Margolis","I think that's directly related to new supply. Miami has had a very large influx of new development that is acting performance and we haven't seen the same thing in Philadelphia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. ","Smedes Rose","Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you, did sequential decline in curated occupancy from 3Q to 4Q will split steeper than what we've seen in several years now? Did that surprise you at all can you maybe provide a little more color on the -- I guess the case over the course of the quarter?","Scott Stubbs","First of all, I would tell you I think sometimes people focus too much on rentals and vacates you know I think if you look at our year end occupancy, it was quite strong. maybe slightly stronger at the end of the third quarter but again the goal here obviously is to maximize revenue you'll see it plus, you know plus or minus 10, 15, 20, 30 basis points depending on the month, depending on the quarter. But I don't think the fourth quarter played out significantly different than what we were expecting and we felt like we had a -- you know strong ending to the quarter of the year.","Smedes Rose","Okay, you were looking for that level of kind of sequential decline and that wasn't a surprise at all.","Scott Stubbs","Not necessarily decline but on an annual basis we were expecting no benefit from occupancy and that's largely where we ended up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors.","Eric Frankel","I just want to go back to the same-store calculations. The news confirms or you said that it's a 15 basis points; can you just confirm the number of stores that can be added in the same-store pool?","Joe Margolis","We're adding, so our current pool is 783 and the new pool goes to 821, so an add of 38.","Eric Frankel","And the average occupancy for the -- roughly, I guess 440 or so stores, is that significantly lower or same as what you currently have?","Joe Margolis","It's pretty much the same, very close to being right on top of each other.","Eric Frankel","And then, I know you -- question is regarding your cap allocation guidance here and the investments you have under contract in what you're hoping to close. But it seems like you're 70% of the way there essentially in terms of what you have under the contract are closed and what you're guided to; that seems somewhat conservative. Maybe you could provide a little more color on how you're thinking? I guess you have roughly $160 million of deal that you have in -- gone under contract or closed now but it's kind of based on your guidance. Any reason why that shouldn't be higher just kind of given all the trends that you're referring to?","Joe Margolis","The only thing I could say is, it's very difficult for us to predict when we're going to have opportunities to transact on an off-market basis. And as I said earlier, that's really where we are able to be successful. So, we could talk to the brokers, and we can understand the pipeline and what we think is coming forward but we know we're not going to be very successful there. So is it possible that we exceed our guidance and buy more, absolutely, but creative opportunities are available and good deals, we have a balance sheet and capital flexibility to execute on those transitions. So I hope we do exceed our guidance in 2019 like we did in 2018 but we're not banking them.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","When rent growth slows, is it driven more by changing distribution channels or lower street [ph] rates?","Joe Margolis","The street rates are really what's going to drive your rent growth. I mean our current -- your current street rates, your current achieved rate at some point flows through and becomes your rental rate growth, and so street rates are going to probably be more influential than anything.","Wes Golladay","And then going back to that 3-year rolling supply, when do you see that peaking and do you expect a gradual decline or a sharp decline, or how should we look at that going forward?","Joe Margolis","So we believe that 2018 was the peak delivery year and we expect to gradual decline and that's fully caveated by -- we don't know what people are going to do in terms of picking up development; we're looking at current trends and assuming that they continue. But if -- for whatever reason, a bunch of people go capital into development and start putting shovels in the ground where they shouldn't, then we could be wrong.","Wes Golladay","And then, maybe going back to Keithman's [ph] question about the developers not hitting the returns; are there certain markets where you see maybe in the next year or two you can have an opportunistic fund and take advantage of some of this?","Joe Margolis","I think that is likely, I think there are going to be opportunities to purchase projects that are not hitting pro forma or not doing as well as a lender would like or an equity partner would like. And our acquisition guys are fully focused on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Just to go back to the $0.23 dilution expected from C of O and value add; have you guys separated those two on how much do you scribe to those two buckets, each if you have?","Joe Margolis","It's about $0.16 from C of O's and about $0.07 from lease-up properties.","Todd Stender","It could be a pretty good source of upside to earnings, you've got 12 of the 17 projected openings I guess; opening in the first half of the year but I also want to see potential offsetting that. Have you tapped the ATM already in January\/February just because you've acquired so much -- just seeing where your capital is coming from?","Joe Margolis","Well, we used the ATM in the fourth quarter and in the current quarter we've not. Yes, correct, third and fourth quarter of last year we used the ATM.","Todd Stender","And then just finally, excluding the 12 assets you've described in California that you've already gotten, where are the other locations? I know you've had a couple of C of O deals that are wholly-owned, that you've acquired already in the first quarter, where are those in markets?","Joe Margolis","[Indiscernible], Louisville, Kentucky and many on Pennsylvania. Should we just call [ph] -- posted one in Brooklyn too last week; was that last week again?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, we had several little close. We have three little close in -- well, two in Brooklyn, one in Queens. And then also Massachusetts, Merrill Lynch, so they are kind of throughout the country.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","A couple of questions. The first one is the 2% increase in street rates that you guys have discussed, is that net of concessions or is that without concessions?","Joe Margolis","It is not net of concessions, that is just we have achieved great as the average, some of this pain [ph], no matter which channel they come from. This can say discounts year-over-year, there is no change.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay, so that's the first thing. Then I'm going back to a question I was asked earlier on not getting a lot of push back from in place tenants on rent increases. But I was just curious, the guidance contemplates a slower rate of rent increases going forward because of supply or no?","Jeff Norman","No. We really don't believe supply impacts are our ability to increase rents to tenants when appropriate.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay, that's helpful. And then could you help us understand what the mark-to-market is in the portfolio? Like today, if a tenant moves out average rents are X versus if a tenant moves into probably moving on average at this particular rent?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, if you look at our employees rents and compare those to our cheap rents so what people rented at when they come in the door on average for the year, it is mid-single digit so call it 5% that is considerably higher in the offseason so right now it's you know call it double digits and then it goes to zero in the summer months so depending on the time of the year we typically you know our rates are typically higher in the summer when more people are moving in and lower in the offseason with fewer people are moving so that rolled down is higher in the colder months and I would tell you to be careful to assume that's the role down on everybody because you have many people that moved in a move right back out and so they are at very close to what the street rate is.","Operator","There are no further questions I will turn the call back over to Joe Margolis CEO for any closing remarks.","Joe Margolis","Thank you, everyone, for your joining us today. We expect another great year in 2019 despite the challenges we're all aware of and we've all discussed. We operate the resilience sector; our demand is needs based. We're able to achieve high occupancies in positive rate growth and we have significant external growth opportunities. We continue to invest heavily in technology. Our digital marketing in revenue management systems continue to evolve and improve. But none of this would be possible without our people. We have an incredible deep team of dedicated, motivated, engaged employees who live our values every day and are driving our performance and I want to recognize their contributions to our efforts and our success.

Please go ahead.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2015 conference call.

Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Spencer Kirk, Chief Executive Officer.","Spencer Kirk","Hello, everyone. 2015 was a record breaking year. We executed at a high level and produced outstanding results despite difficult comps. For the fourth quarter same-store revenue growth was 9.3%, NOI growth was 11.9%, year-end occupancy was 92.9% and FFO as adjusted grew 29%, this marks 21 consecutive quarters of double digit increases. We delivered these exceptional same store operating results while expanding our physical real estate and digital real estate footprint by 24%. In 2015, we added 259 stores to our platform and our year end EXR branded store count was 1,347. For the year we closed on 1.8 billion in acquisitions, seller expectations are high and we expect pricing to remain competitive in 2016. However, we're finding accretive acquisitions including off market transactions and we're off to a solid start in 2016. ","I\u2019d now like to turn this time over to Scott.","Scott Stubbs","Thanks, Spence. Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.87 per share meeting the high end of our guidance. Including costs associated with acquisitions and non-cash interest, FFO was $0.38 per share for the quarter. This was below our Q4 guidance due to additional transaction related costs. We paid 16 million in SmartStop transactional cost, 8 million for SmartStop\u2019s investment bankers and 8 million severance expenses. These costs were expenses on our books rather than on SmartStop\u2019s in essence we paid SmartStop\u2019s transactional costs with SmartStop\u2019s working capital. These costs were included in our original purchase price estimates and had no effect on the transaction on a net-net basis.","For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.13 per share meeting the high end of our guidance. Including acquisition and non-cash interest cost FFO was $2.58 per share. Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers, increased occupancy and lower discounts. Our top performing markets were California, Colorado and Florida. Our worse performing markets still grew at 4% to 5% and out platform continues to maximize results. We had a busy quarter on the acquisition front, adding 131 stores to 1.4 billion. The majority of these stores were part of the SmartStop acquisition which are performing in line with our underwriting expectations.","Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2016. Our new same-store pool increased by 61 properties for a total of 564, we expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points. For 2016, our acquisition guidance of 600 million refers only to our wholly-owned stores. The impact of our JV acquisitions is captured in our equity and earnings. Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.65 to $3.73 per share. 2016 FFO guidance is $3.57 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate of occupancy acquisitions. Our guidance also includes 2015 acquisitions that as anticipated will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they're performing at our portfolio average, they should produce an additional $0.10 per share.","I'll now turn the time back to Spencer for some closing remarks.","Spencer Kirk","Thanks Scott. We expect 2016 to look much like 2015. Demand is steady, new supply while present, is still muted and our advantage on the Internet continues to grow. However in 2015, increases in occupancy and reductions in discounts contributed approximately 300 basis points to revenue. This year we expect occupancy gains of approximately 100 basis points and little to no additional benefit from discount reductions. I congratulate our team on the significant growth and the strong performance in 2015. It has resulted in Extra Space been included in the S&P 500. We're pleased to be recognized as a top tier REIT and a member of this fine group of companies.","Now let\u2019s turn the time back to Jeff to start the Q&A session.","Jeff Norman","Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyone's questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.","With that, we will turn it over to Jonathon to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please.","Todd Thomas","Just first question on occupancy, there was a much more muted seasonality impact at the end of the year, only a 30 basis point decrease from the average occupancy in the fourth quarter. I am assuming that was a pretty conscious effort. But what levers did you pull on to keep occupancy at 92.9% at the end of the year?","Spencer Kirk","So, we continue to advertise out there. So I think the one of the things we made a conscious effort of is we spent some pay per click dollars as well as maximizing our SEO spend. We continue to try to make sure that we maintain occupancy in the slow season so we're ready to push rates as we move into the busy season.","Todd Thomas","Are you able to share your occupancy through today and where that was year-over-year perhaps?","Spencer Kirk","We're not giving exact numbers, it hasn't changed significantly.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And just a follow-up then on Houston, with regard to occupancy there, it actually fell rather sharply. It was higher year-over-year last quarter, but was lower this quarter by 120 basis points and it is now one of the few markets in the portfolio where occupancy is lower. What is your read on Houston and are you operating in Houston any differently than you operate in any of your other markets?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, so Houston is overall Todd, 2% of our total portfolio. This is the beauty of a broadly diversified and geographically dispersed portfolio. And yes there is softness in Houston. And we have not done anything differently, operationally on our interactive marketing efforts or our revenue management specifically to try and address something that is just part of the economic softness in that part of the country. So, we're going to continue to do everything we can without being operational in our behaviour. We've got a platform, we've got a system and we are letting the system run based on the laws of supply and demand.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Toti from BB&T Capital Markets.","David Toti","I just have two questions on rent growth. And Spencer, I think you mentioned a revenue forecast for the year. You are assuming little discount burn-off and about 100 basis points of occupancy. Can you share what your rent assumptions are embedded within that revenue forecast?","Spencer Kirk","So, if you look at our revenue forecast David, the majority of that is actually going to come from rate, you're going to get about 100 basis points from occupancy and the rest is all rate, so we think that we'll continue to be able to push rates in the mid to high single digits and hopefully we continue to see strength through the summer months here.","David Toti","And then a follow-up to -- a follow-up to that question, in assets where you have occupancy in the mid-90s or higher, and you have some limited inventory, what is a typical rent strategy in those types of assets? Do you push rent to dislocate tenants to create more inventory what -- how do you guys approach that situation?","Spencer Kirk","We push rate as hard as we think is prudent for the market and for the data that we have for a particular property and the unit size codes that are in demand. Part of the beauty of our platform is that data is probably our single most valuable asset and if you look at 800,000 plus units that we have information on, we're going to push rate as hard as we can. Obviously, we don't want to dislodge customers but where we have existing customer rate increases being benefited by lofty street rates, yes, we can get pretty aggressive both with new customers walking in the door as well as the existing customer and our system is going to be try to optimize the revenue for any particular size code.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz from USB. Your question please.","Jeremy Metz","Hi guys I am on with Ross here. I was just wondering if you could talk about what you're budgeting for SmartStop in 2016 in terms of the revenue growth and how that breaks down between occupancy and rents?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, so we're hoping to have their occupancy be at similar rates to what we have in our occupancy by the end of the rental season or by the end of the summer. You're going to do that first by making sure the rates relatively low. But overall for an annual growth rate, it's high single digits.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then just on one of the potential JVs you mentioned in the press release it looks like all those assets are developments in New York you would buy at CO. So I am just wondering if you can walk us through your thinking there and thoughts on current supply already underway in the market. And then in terms of the JV, is your partner the actual developer or just the financial partner?","Scott Stubbs","So, it's actually just a financial partner, it's an institutional partner, so it's one we're excited do more business with to do -- have more investment with. We like the New York City market, New York City the boroughs have low per square foot penetration as far as your square feet per population and we're excited to have additional product in a market that has great demographics and high rent per square foot.","Jeremy Metz","And is there a chance you could increase your -- yes?","Spencer Kirk","It's Spencer, if I could just put a vital color on JVs, number one JVs help us with the dilution part of the equation on earnings, number two, it increases our return and in answer of part two of your question, new supply generally throughout the country I think that's the question you're getting at, it's still muted. And my own personal number is total number of properties delivered new assets in the United States in 2016, 600.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund from Jefferies. Your question please.","George Hoglund","Yes, I was wondering if you could just, one, comment on expenses in Chicago that were up pretty significantly.","Spencer Kirk","It is property tax reassessments, for Illinois is very aggressive on an annual basis and some of those we'll appeal.","George Hoglund","Okay. And then when you think about the guidance range in terms of what is most likely to push you towards the higher end of the guidance range or could even -- what would be the outlier that would push you above the range? What factors do you think are most likely?","Spencer Kirk","I\u2019d give you two items, one would be of property taxes coming lower than we are originally budgeting, we're budgeting them close to 6% I think it was 5.8 for our budget on same-stores this year. And then second of all, if rates hold better than expected through the summer months.","George Hoglund","And then I guess just one more. In terms of -- you talked about occupancy, you had mentioned it earlier, that it was about the same or unchanged wasthat versus the year end or is that on year-over-year basis?","Spencer Kirk","Versus year-end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Your question please.","Smedes Rose","You mentioned that some of the acquisitions made in 2015 can drive an additional $0.10 to make it up to your company wide portfolio metrics. Can you talk about maybe some of the dilution I guess that is embedded in your guidance for this year from the 2014 or so CofO properties coming online?","Spencer Kirk","So the dilution is actually primarily from the \u201915 and \u201916 acquisitions and you've got about $0.05 in those properties. So from a growth perspective you got $0.05 from CofO and another $0.10 from properties that we've purchased considering them to be value-add opportunities.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And then could you just remind us when you were calculating your adjusted FFO, how do you treat the convertible notes in terms of...?","Spencer Kirk","The non-cash portion we take out as an adjustment and then the other adjustment is the transaction cost for acquisitions. So, those are really our only two adjustments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your question, please.","Ki Bin Kim","Could you just give a quick update on where your street rates were this quarter or in January, whichever one you prefer, year-over-year? And in terms of tying that into your same-store revenue guidance, it sounds like 600 basis points comes from rate. Is that pretty equivalent to street rate growth? So to get to 600 basis points of revenue growth from rate does that equal 6% street rate growth for next -- for this year?","Spencer Kirk","Yes, a couple of things, just of note here, first of all, they're high single-digits year-over-year. December versus last December but again that could depend on what you did last December with your rates. So, we would caution people always to look at it on average. So, we can continue to raise rates but then the other thing that's important is what is our actually achieved rate because everyone doesn't comment and pay street rate, you have some Internet specials things like that. So, you also need to book at what our achieved rate is versus our street rates but overall, they continue to grow and again as I mentioned earlier majority of our growth this year is going to come from our rate increases.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And I think the high-single-digit year-over-year increase in street rates in December is -- it sounds mostly noticeably better than last December year over year. If this holds up as we get into summer leasing season, is it reasonable to expect that year-over-year increase in street rates to be more than that 8%-ish number that you posted last summer?","Spencer Kirk","You know what Ki Bin, it all depends on how our busy season transpires, we're walking into our prime season with a record occupancy and we're going to push rates as hard as we can but certainly not out of the realm of possibility but I think we're pretty mature to offer any kind of prognostication as to what's going to happen, give us another 90 or 100 days and let us kind of see how things are starting to transpire and I think we can add some color, it is too early.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jenna Gallagher from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.","Jenna Gallagher","Can you provide some detail on where the stores you bought year to date and the acquisitions you are targeting in \u201916 are located? Whether you are trying to increase scale in the SmartStop markets or just generally for the portfolio wide?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you, they are more in our core markets, we're not necessarily trying to add in some of the one off markets where SmartStop is I think that we're buying them wherever we can buy them and make it the best pricing possible.","Spencer Kirk","The one thing that I'd add to this and I said this many times, we're not going to get to 3,000 properties by being in Los Angeles and New York, we're going to have a broad national platform and as we talked about some of these markets that are experiencing a little softness, we also have markets that are performing at levels that are unprecedented and geographically diversified portfolio is best and I think a rational strategy of say look, we can't predict winners and losers over the long haul, virtually every market will cycle that I'm aware of, we want to be probably diversified and geographically dispersed so that we can capitalize on what this self storage business has to offer and that is best-in-class performance amongst any real estate class.","Jenna Gallagher","And then just kind of your thoughts on funding the acquisitions and any guidance for dispositions this year?","Scott Stubbs","Yes, first of all the funding of our acquisitions included in our share count and in our equity estimates we have about $225 million to fund the $600 million in acquisition, so 225 million of equity or OP unit issuance.","Jenna Gallagher","And any dispositions?","Scott Stubbs","And then in terms of dispositions we continue to look at the bottom part of our portfolio, right now we're looking at $25 million or less in dispositions that are -- we have a few properties listed right now but it's a small portion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Sir your question, please.","Landon Park","Hi, guys, this is Landon on for Vikram. Just wanted to touch on Chicago, I know it has been sort of one of the weaker markets this year for you guys. And we have heard from some private operators that there is quite a few pockets of supply cropping up there. Is that sort of impacting that market or on the revenue side what do you think is driving the weakness?","Scott Stubbs","There is new supply Landon, there are pockets of development around the county, you start to think about parts of Texas, parts of Florida, Chicago obviously, yes there is some development going on and it's going to have an impact but overall if you look at the entire country, 600 of assets plus or minus coming online this year is barely keeping up with the population increase of this country in terms of new supply that needs to be added, so back to my earlier comment being in a bunch of markets with an operating platform that optimizes performance is our strategy and if one market is up another might be down and Chicago right is feeling softness and we are okay with it, it's not what we want, but it's not causing us to have a good night's rest, we're able to just rest well with that portfolio that's producing outstanding results.","Landon Park","So, is the weakness there -- you think it is largely attributable to new supply?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you a portion of it is new supply, a portion of it is the overall health of the economy there. And I think there is new supply and in our markets we've seen probably outsized supply growth.","Landon Park","Okay. And just more broadly on supply, how quickly do you think that that supply could ramp over the next few years with fairly quick build times in the industry?","Scott Stubbs","[Technical Difficulty] and the credit requirements to obtain a loan are tight, entitlements are still very-very difficult to get generally around the country and although there will be initial supply I still maintain it slightly to be muted and I don't expect a hockey stick for the aforementioned reasons. So I think the operating environment continues to look favourable for the next couple of years. And as we progress down the road, we get better clarity and we'll speak to it.","Landon Park","And then just one last one on the reinsurance income, how much of the increase year-over-year is going to come from higher penetration at SmartStop? And how do you see the penetration of that portfolio sort of trending over the next few years?","Scott Stubbs","I would tell you it's going to come -- part of it's going to come from the increase in that but the overall our penetration is low to mid 70s and it's going to be tough to push it much more than that. So you are going to continue to add to our tenant insurance income through acquisition and through addition of management properties primarily.","Landon Park","And just remind me, what was SmartStop at when you close the deal?","Scott Stubbs","I think their penetration wasn't that different, I think it was a little bit more in the rate and kind of what the dollar amounts they were insuring.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Your question please.","Jonathan Hughes","Just to touch on Landon's question. I was hoping you could kind of give some similar commentary on maybe the same-store revenue growth in your DC portfolio. Is that being impacted by new supply at all or maybe weaker job growth?","Scott Stubbs","We have not seen outsized growth in new supply in DC, but I think that probably has to do more with the overall health there, it was also one of the markets that held up better during the downturns than some of the others, so if you look at a 10-year average or a 5-year average I am not sure it's that different than some of the other markets.","Jonathan Hughes","And then turning to the SEO deals that were added to the pipeline, are most of these projects with developers you have had prior relationships with or are they new entrants to the storage development market?","Scott Stubbs","Some of them we have had relationships with in the past and I would say none of them are new entrants to self storage. They're all experienced self storage developers.","Jonathan Hughes","And then what are the yields on those deals versus stabilized cap rates?","Scott Stubbs","So, obviously when you get into a CofO deal Jonathan, your yield is zero and so what we do is look at the market, and we like to generally see about 150 basis points spread between that new opportunity and what a fully stabilized asset would be trading in that market. So it depends, depends on the market.","Jonathan Hughes","And then that 150, I mean has that compressed significantly over the past six months or is it pretty much stable?","Scott Stubbs","It's pretty stable over the last six months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Burk from Green Street Advisors. Your question please.","Ryan Burk","Net rents on the properties that you will roll into the same-store pool this year, about 20% below the average for the 2015 same-store pool, just curious if you expect to fully close that gap, obviously not in 2016 much but over time?","Scott Stubbs","So you're saying that properties that are moving from the non-same-store to the same-store in \u201916 what will we do? I think a portion of that is not just at the price below but also it's a function of what markets they are in. I mean from our perspective we're looking at more what the lift has changed between the 2 same-store pools, so in my earlier comment I mentioned it was going to add 50 basis points. Part of that is coming from the properties that are below market rents in certain markets but you can't only just look at that because some of them maybe in a different market with a lower per square foot rent.","Ryan Burk","Acquisition volume has been strong across the sector it has been very strong for you so far this year. Is there any evidence that the smaller private operators are starting to become more willing sellers? And what is your general outlook for portfolios that may be coming to market?","Scott Stubbs","So I think as there has been some cap rate compression over the last few years Ryan I think yes, there are a number of folks out there that are saying -- I don't know that it's going to get any better than it is today, I\u2019d probably ought to take a look at selling this single asset or this portfolio, we're obviously out in the market looking at everything that is out there, I can't tell you that there's any next big SmartStop hanging out there in the wings for us to go to capture in 2016, what I can tell you, is we're going to participate in the open market and do so in a disciplined fashion and we're also going to be going after all of the off market stuff because we have got a wonderful relationship with hundreds of operators. Who at this point may decide or elect to sell and let's see how the next 10 months play out. So, we think open market and off market, we're off to a good start and we expect to have a decent year in 2016 but I can predict another home run hit like a SmartStop in 2016 because, there isn't anything right now on the table.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.","Wes Golladay","First off congrats on the S&P 500 add. Looking at SmartStop, what is your forecast for expense growth for that portfolio this year?","Scott Stubbs","So, in terms of expense growth, we actually didn't model it at all in terms of what they had in their expenses at versus ours, we actually just modelled it entirely based on what our expense structure is, so we took what our payroll structure is, we took the pro forma property tax adjustments all of that so, I couldn't even comment on what the growth would be in expenses.","Wes Golladay","And then looking at the 600 facilities coming online in 2016, how much of that is competitive for your portfolio? And do you see any markets where supply will meaningfully overwhelm demand?","Scott Stubbs","I think a portion of those are obviously competitive to us. I would tell you that, I don't see a single market where it's going to overwhelm demand I think you're seeing more construction in Texas and in Florida in Chicago, some of the markets where it's typically and historically a little bit easier to build and get things entitled.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from the line of George Hoglund from Jefferies. Your question, please.","George Hoglund","Just one additional question, on the past few months have you seen any change in appetite from JV partners in terms of how much they want to buy or have you seen new JV partners looking to enter into the space?","Scott Stubbs","I would say, George that for the last two years there's been a fair amount of interest from various would be participants wanting to get into self storage I think, self storage has proven itself as a excellent investment and whether it's private equity or institutional investors, there is a lot of demand, there's lot of inquiry to trend put it into the last 90 days or last six months I think would not be fair I will just say that we are frequently getting calls, as I'm sure the other major operators are saying, hi, I'd like to participate with you can we do something together. And I don't think that that's going to change because storage is a really good asset class. So, nothing out of the ordinary in the last quarter or two quarters, I'd just say there's been a constant level of inquiries and interest expressed over the last couple of years.","George Hoglund","And then just on cap rates on acquisitions, what are you seeing on stabilized properties for some of the stuff you have been doing year to-date?","Scott Stubbs","We'll typically stabilize a property mid 6s but that's not necessarily a forward-looking year one cap, sometimes we will take some opportunities to buy a property that maybe has lower occupancy or is in the lease up phase, so I would tell you cap rates are all over and it's going to be market by market. In the secondary markets, you might get something in the 7s but if you want to buy something in New York City, you're not going to buy in the set 6s even.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from Key Bank Capital Markets. Your question, please. ","Todd Thomas","So in the past you have said that you would tolerate about 3% FFO dilution from CofO and development deals. In 2016 sounds like you are expecting about $0.15 overall, so $0.05 I think, Scott, you said from CofO deals and $0.10 from development and lease up deals. So that is a little over 4% at the midpoint of guidance and you are taking up your exposure to CofO deals. Has your tolerance to for FFO dilution changed at all or is there anything in terms of risk that you are willing to tolerate more at this point?","Scott Stubbs","I'm not sure it's changed at all Todd if you look at our 2015 acquisitions, obviously that is heavily weighted towards one large acquisition and so we viewed that as an opportunity and so we were willing to take a risk on more of a one-time thing there.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then just lastly, taxes associated with the REITs, TRS, the assumption there is about $17 million for the year, so about $0.13 per share. In the past there have been various initiatives to drive that back down, any thoughts about reducing that expense? And assuming that the TRS' tax expense does continue to grow does it cause you to think differently about how you operate the portfolio or run the business in any way?","Scott Stubbs","I'd tell you, we continue to look for opportunities to save taxes in the TRS, we've done solar we have looked at making sure that the TRS is paying its fair share in terms of acquisition costs from making sure that they reimburse the REIT for access to these customers. So I would tell you our strategy is going to be to continue to be aggressive, but I think there are benefits from having a TRS and having insurance captive, so we'll continue to look for opportunities and ways to maximize our return.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI Group. Your question please.","Steve Sakwa","Spencer, I was just wondering as we are getting sort of deeper into the economic cycle here, and you guys are doing more CofO deals, how do you just sort of think about the risk of the lease up on the developments? And are you guys sort of changing your underwriting at all or getting more conservative as you kind of analyze these different projects around the country?","Spencer Kirk","I would say Steve that is we're thinking about CofO deals philosophically first of all we have to recognize that historically or compared to the historical lease up time we're running about 1.5 the time that it takes to show up a property. Now, there are always outliers on that, but for us whether you're looking at the economic cycle as being steady or even decelerating, what I can tell you is that the life changing events that caused people to use storage, happened in good economies and bad economies and we're not underwriting anything differently on lease up in 2016 or even 2017 then what we would say we're doing better than we have historically done and the Internet is the game changer that's allowing us to drive more traffic at the proper price point to our properties and we were able to go forward and we're going to continually refine that process so that we maximize performance. And maximizing performance is, fill it up as fast as you can in an economic fashion to optimize revenue.","Steve Sakwa","So, not to put words in your mouth, but if you knew a recession was coming you really wouldn't do much differently?","Spencer Kirk","That is correct. We never actually changed our underwriting to be more aggressive when things were leasing up faster.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Spencer Kirk, CEO.","Spencer Kirk","We appreciate your interest in Extra Space today and we look forward to the next quarter\u2019s call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."]}}
