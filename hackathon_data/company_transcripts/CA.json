Please direct your attention to the forward-looking statement on the screen at this time. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Please welcome Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Kelsey Turcotte.","Kelsey Turcotte","Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you very much for coming. We know many of you are hitting the tail end of the really busy earnings season. So we appreciate your leaving your desk and coming here to join us this afternoon and we appreciate your support of the company.","What we wanted to cover this afternoon, here's the high-level agenda. We're going to start with Rich Beckert, he's going to give you a review of our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal '13 results and give you our financial guidance for 2014. Then Mike will come up and talk a little bit about his game plan for the coming year and give his view on some of the announcements we made this afternoon.","And then Rich will come back and give you some of the details from a financial perspective that underline our 2014 guidance and we will then turn it over for Q&A. We're hoping to accomplish all of this by about 6:00 and then we invite those who have time to stay to join us for a cocktail. You'll have this opportunity to talk to both Rich and to Mike and to, again, have the opportunity to see some of the technology that you'll hear us talk about this afternoon.","My one favor to ask of you, for those of you who have cellphones, if you could just put them on silence, we'd really appreciate that. And without any further ado, I'd like to invite Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer, to speak with you.","Richard J. Beckert","Thank you, Kelsey. Hello, everyone. So let's just jump right into the fiscal year '13 overview. So a couple of things. We had a tough economic undercurrent for the full year and we had a low renewal portfolio for the year and we also had, especially the first half, we changed around a lot of the sales force. By changing around the sales force, it was disruptive in the first half but we actually have more sales people on the ground now starting FY '14 than we did a year ago and that's a positive. Even though we had that headwind, we were able to expand our non-GAAP margin by 2 points to 36%. So we -- and you will see when Mike talks, we have made a lot of progress in restructuring ourselves and we feel pretty good about what we were able to do with our expense control.","With that said, we still had difficulty selling outside the renewal cycle and you'll see in Q4, we also still had sporadic success. We were okay in Q3, and I would tell you, we were only okay in Q4 in the emerging geographies. So both North America and EMEA had sporadic success depending on the regions.","We were also able, though, through all of this to increase what I would consider a leading edge capital allocation, by buying back 500 million shares -- $500 million rather and delivering on $1 per share dividend. So if you look at the results, you can see that we were down minus 2%, we have a 3% headwind going into next year on our revenue backlog. You can also see though, we had a pretty good -- compared to our revised guidance, strong EPS, up 15% year-over-year inside of that there's 5% to a one-time tax benefit that we were able to get from the IRS. You back that out at 10%, we were at the high-end of guidance and cash flow came in exactly where we had anticipated and as we've been seeing all year, we had a strong Q4 last year, we had a strong Q3 this year, so this is exactly where we thought we would be. We're very selective as to how and what type of transactions we do as far as single installment payments. So we're content with where that landed for the year.","Q4, Q4 top line continued to be something of a struggle in certain parts of the world. I would say we are making progress if you see pipeline and things like that are building, but with the macro economy, we still saw some transactions that fell out of the quarter into fiscal year '14. We're working our way down, though, to our ability to control cost. You can see a $0.68, it's actually pretty healthy, there's $0.11 inside of that number though for tax, but even still, it's a pretty healthy number on retracting revenues.","So let's -- some color and I would tell you it's -- 2 different things are going on, the renewal portfolio behaved exactly how we had anticipated. So what you see is the renewal portfolio was a little bit better than we had said. We thought it would be about 10%, we had 1 large transaction with the federal government that allowed us to actually grow this quarter, that's the first time we've seen growth in multiple quarters. You also see the renewal yields in the low 90s, which is about where we really want it. And you can see that the Mainframe capacity, which is something that gives us a tailwind, was flat for the quarter. So you're starting to see the benefit of the Mainframe for us.","The flip side to that is what I just alluded to earlier. It's the standalone transactions outside of renewal performed poorly in certain parts of the world, but I would say that what the good news is, we had strength in certain product lines and we continue to see certain product lines and build momentum. Mike will get up and talk to about a lot of the progress that we've made and we feel pretty good going forward. So let me just talk about the segments.","Inside the segments, what do you see? You see the Mainframe behaving basically how we thought it would be. The minus 1% in the quarter, if you look to the prior quarter, you remember that is the hard compare year-over-year, so the full year is down, although normalized, it's about where we thought it would -- should land. You can see the expansion of the margin in the quarter. You can then move down to Enterprise Solutions. Enterprise Solutions is a different story. Now this is the slowing down of the flywheel by not selling inside or outside of the renewal, you can see in the quarter we were down to minus 6%, although we did an okay job of controlling cost and we were able to expand our margin year-over-year for the full year, you can see that we're not satisfied with the results we have top line statement in ES segment.","Services performed again as anticipated. The expansion of the margin there is really just timing of cost, so we always anticipate our margin should be in the mid-single digits. So what does that mean for fiscal year '14 guidance? And there's a lot going on here. So as we talk through this, I'll come back up later on and I'll layer it in more detail, but you'll see, first of all, the minus 3% revenue in constant currency for the current period is minus 3%. So we're plus or minus around that. We expand to 36% and the reason why I say expand to 36% even though it's flat year-over-year, is there is about 1 point last year of the benefit that we were able to receive from IP transaction that we had. So when you look at the other operations, we're continuing to streamline ourselves to have 36% coming out of the operations.","The non-GAAP diluted earnings and the GAAP diluted earnings, there's a little bit of a change going forward and there's -- and I'll walk you through that on the next slide and you can see it'll flow down through CFFO and the only other point I want to make on this slide is that we just were told today by the IRS that we also will win a favorable settlement for some back years. It will be a one-time thing. It's not reflecting here because they haven't -- only told us that we won the settlement. They didn't tell us how much we won. So when we know what that is, will reflect, it might be at the soonest, by the time we file the K on Friday if not, it will be a subsequent event on 8-K. That being said, our CFFO looks like it's down substantially year-over-year, but there's a story behind that.","Here's what it is. First thing that we're going to talk about is our cap dev, this will be the last year that we have 100% of our business going through to the cap dev. Mike will get up and talk about a lot of the things we're working on with Agile development and what you'll see is, as we move to Agile, we're going to have much, much less going to the balance sheet. So it's really a statement of it going from CFFO to CFFI.","The one-time charge you see in taxes, we've been able to streamline our methodology in taxes so that historically, and I'll show you a slide on that, we would pay some of our portion of our cash taxes the following year. In fiscal '14, we will pay our fiscal '13 taxes that we had due plus all our fiscal '14 taxes. So it's a one-time event. And the last part that Mike and I will both share is the rebalancing. So we're rebalancing between people and facilities and it's a one-time event. If you were to put those back into '14, our cash would actually grow and if we put '15 up here, just so people see over time, we have a low single-digit growth rate.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael P. Gregoire","Thanks, Rich. Well, good afternoon, and I welcome you as well to taking time out of your day. I know it's a crazy earnings season and a lot is going on in our industry, in particular, but in general. Today oddly enough is my fourth month anniversary. I started on the 7th of January. So I'm absolutely 4 months into this job and I want to share with you my observations and the process that I use to help understand CA and take a look at where CA is and where I think it fits into the marketplace and the areas where I think we can improve and the areas where I think we can grow.","So the first thing I did when I came to CA is I wanted to focus on 3 specific areas to learn the company. First, talking to customers. I've talked to our largest customers, I've talked to customers that have a very small footprint with us. I talked to customers that are small in the $200 million to $300 million range. I talked to customers in multiple countries and I was really trying to understand what do they think of our sales deployment model? What do they think of our account team? What do they think of our products? What do they think about us as a differentiating company? Do they look upon us as just a Mainframe company? Do they understand the products that we have? And what problems do they have today that they need solved that they don't really see a good partner with? And then lastly is how do you think of CA in the context of that partnership? And got an awful lot of feedback.","Secondly, I spent an incredible amount of time with our products groups and I'll walk you through some of my learnings in those product groups, but the real question I was asking is how do we differentiate? Why CA, from a product perspective? How do we build products? How do we acquire criteria for building products? And how do we look at products that are not currently built and should be built 18 and 24 months out? And what is our innovation curve within the company?","And then lastly the employees. CA is a company that has a very strong culture and I wanted to embrace that culture, understand the culture, understand the parts of that culture that make the company great, understand the parts of that culture that might be dated or artifacts of the past and get in the way of growth. Part of that culture is our sales culture. We have a very strong sales culture in this company. I wanted to understand what they thought of our products, what they thought of our customers, what they thought is required to do business faster and what do they do? Are they helpers? Are they achievers? And where is the mix? And what's the ratio of quota-carrying people to people that help sell?","This took all 4 months and it's been an extraordinary learning curve for me. I still feel I have a lot to learn, but a few things that I can take away of being here for 4 months. This is a company that has an awful lot of assets and an awful lot of potential. This is a company that knows more about managing infrastructure, applications and security than any other company. But it begs the question, why does it have such a hard time growing?","When you take a look and ask 3 fundamental questions, it helps you understand the context of CA and the ability for it to grow. First of all, embracing new models. We have an extraordinarily enviable customer base. Are we taking advantage of that customer base and being able to move them off of older products onto new releases? Are we truly being a differentiated partner giving them new technologies? These are areas that you have to answer that question. The answer to that question is absolutely, you should be able to do that. Secondly, innovation. How do we think about innovation? How do we put innovation into our products, how do we develop? Are we using modern software techniques? Do we understand Software-as-a-Service? Do we understand the cloud? Do we understand hybrid clouds? Do we know what big data is? Do we have an opinion on mobility? Do we have an opinion on modern user interfaces? Do we understand the expectation of consumer driven applications? These are all things that has to be wielded into our innovation engine and has to be into all of our products. And lastly, is new customers. This is an area that has been a very difficult struggle for CA, this selling new and existing products to net new customers.","When you start peeling back the layers of the onion, trying to answer these questions, it really shows the true potential of this company, if we're willing to make some fundamental changes in how we operate. Now the 3 things that I've been driving with the executive management team and the staff -- and I have to tell you, I've got 0 resistance in the company, as I've been driving these themes, is innovation, execution and speed. And I want to talk about what all 3 of these things mean to CA and this is our mantra going forward.","Innovation is building highly differentiated products and acquiring products and then adding our own organic engineering to it. It's not enough for us to just buy a product, stick it into the sales engine or try to cram it into a renewal. You have to have a vision of what you're going to do with that acquisition and what do you intrinsically go to add to it. Buying something nowadays and think you're going to run it better and engineer it better, I think that's a fool's errand. Most of these companies, they innovate pretty fast. And if you take a look how they're run, there might be some improvements in operations, but not enough to make the acquisition worthwhile. You have got to have a vision of what you're going to do with that and it comes down to having organic engineering. This is going to be a big focus for our company. We will be known as a great engineering company.","Execution is really simple to say difficult to do, but fundamentally, it's saying what you're going to do and then doing it. This is an area where we have some room to improve for sure. There's a lot of things that we say we're going to do and then our ability to follow through on it becomes muted for a variety of reasons, but at the end of the day, nobody cares. If you say you're going to do something, we have to have the reputation for making it happen.","And then speed is not just about going faster. It's more about critical thinking to decide what to do and being the first to get there before another company does it or waiting for some other organization in the company to do it for you. This is an area where I think we have a lot of overhead and that overhead sometimes gets in the way and it just stops people from doing what they should be doing anyway.","These are 3 things that I've been talking to the staff over and over again. I've done a Town Hall in pretty much all of our European offices, as well as our North American offices and I talked to them as directly as I am talking to you and when they think about it they say, \"Yes, you know what, I think I can do a little bit more in innovation. Yes, there are a lot of reasons why I say I can't do what I said I was going to do and I should probably work through that a little bit crisper.\" And then when it comes to speed, there's not a single person I've ever met in CA that doesn't think we should be able to go faster. So these are the things thematically that we're driving in the company that I think are extraordinarily important and they have to do with the culture of the company. I don't see any resistance by any of the people that I've met, that these are important and that they're willing to put some effort into making it happen.","Rich mentioned today that we've taken a rebalancing action that doesn't show up in our GAAP financials and I want to walk you through what this is because at the end of the day, this is always an extraordinarily difficult thing to do, but it is absolutely necessary if we're going to grow. Now we did it in 2 areas, we did it with people and we did it with locations. On the people side of it, we took a big whack at sales and took a lot of non-quota-carrying expense out of sales. It's about $100 million. This is shadow, overlay groups and groups that, for sure, added some value, but they didn't add enough value to merit the expense, coupled with how we're going to build product as we're going forward. I expect the sales force to know the products better and these products have to be easier to use, easier to implement and easier to sell. So part of the sales efficiency is going to come on the backs of building better and easier to use and sell and implement products.","When it comes to R&D, we're doing R&D in 81 locations, too many. Rich said we've adopted the Agile development methodology. If you are a student of the Agile development methodology, it's smaller teams, higher impact, taking requirements very close to the customer, iterating quickly, putting it through test environments and into production. That methodology does not suit itself very well to large geographic dispersions between the development team and the communication has to be robust. So we're centering our key development areas into the locations that we think has the absolute best talent and we're also doing the same thing with support. Our support locations, we'll be based on 6 hubs on a global basis, these are hubs where we think we can get the right kind of skilled people, as well as we like the cost -- the cost basis for these folks.","Now the only reason to do this is, number 1, is we need to take advantage of some skill that we currently don't have in the company as we're building net new products and marketing those products and selling those products. Number 2, it goes back to my theme of innovation, execution and speed. Taking people that are not adding enough value or in overhead positions that don't provide the kind of support we need to sell more software and build more software. And then lastly, is streamlining our development process. These are the reasons why we're doing these actions and at the end, it's positioning us to save capital to invest in net new products and adjacencies. In a development organization, it's about a $50 million switch from older products to new horizon products and Rich will show you where that shows up in the graph he has in this presentation.","Now one of the things that occurs to me and I'm sure it occurs to you, is we spent an awful lot of money on development. We spent about $600 million and it was very difficult for me to understand where are the products that drive growth for that spend. And when you take a look at our development organization and where we spend money and how we spend it, I think that there's room for improvement.","We spend an awful lot of money on maintenance products that are very old. Some of them are tired and we haven't done a good enough job of building differentiation into these maintenance release to encourage customers to move to the new release. This is going to be a big multi-year focus of ours is to get customers on to the newest releases and the only way that they're going to get on to these new releases if these new releases have high differentiation. We need to be able to make that happen.","Coupled with that, we need to have a much higher track record in when we're building new, differentiated applications. We have built a number of different skunk works projects that never made it to market and it's great to be experimenting but that experimenting needs to be done in the context of a strategy and you shouldn't get so far along that you spend so much that you don't -- you can't bring that product to market. That happens far too often and we're going to stop that. We're going to invest in very specific areas with very specific business cases and have very specific targets for what these products should be able to do.","And how we build has to change. Taking the Agile methodology and using it in a waterfall-type tool set is not going to be helpful. The world is moving to SaaS and what I mean by SaaS is not necessarily cloud. That's quite a big misunderstanding in our industry. Just because you're build in SaaS, does not necessarily mean that you're deploying it in a private cloud or a public cloud. Building it in SaaS is a way of building an application. We're going to build using a SaaS platform where we can implement behind the customer's firewall, in our private cloud or in a hybrid cloud or with a managed service provider.","The ability for a customer to have the flexibility to move that application to wherever they want without hiring an army of consultants, I think is going to be a big differentiator for us. Some of our customers are not going to want to operate in a cloud, but we shouldn't take away our ability to do great engineering using the SaaS platform. The thing I like about SaaS platforms is it forces you to break up your user interface, your database and your application logic. So as new technologies come on board, you can swap them out without having to reinstall the whole application. It obscures all of the complexity about implementation. At the end of the day, nobody wants to spend $100,000 on a software, subscription or license and spend $600,000 or $700,000 implementing it. Those days are gone. We need to be more thoughtful on how we build these products with the eye that the cost of ownership, the total cost of ownership has to come down. SaaS is a methodology for making that happen and this is where customers are spending their money. Now not all of our applications will make it to SaaS, but all of our net new applications will be on the SaaS-first platform that we build ourselves.","We're going to invest in 5 key business areas and these are very focused with the strategy tied tightly to them so that when we're taking a look at net new innovation where we're spending our dollars, we're going to have an idea of how does this help with renewals? How does this help customers get off of older releases and what's net new and highly differentiated that we can charge more for or at a net new SKU that we can sell into an existing customer or how do we compete against point develop -- point providers.","The 5 areas we're going to invest in is Mainframe, IT Business Management, Security, Application Delivery and Service Assurance. Net new products will be built on our own platform. You'll see some of those products that have been built on that platform that are behind the wall here and I'll walk you through each one of these business units and give you a feel for the growth that I see, where we differentiate and a little bit of a peak into what I think the future of these products are going to be.","Now the Mainframe, not a high-growth area. This is an environment that's going to be flat plus or minus 1%, I think everybody knows that. This is an area though that is extraordinarily important to us for a variety of reasons. First of all, we have a huge customer base and a huge profit engine coming out of our Mainframe business. We are one of the few companies that are still innovating on the Mainframe. One of the applications you can see out there is Chorus. Chorus is a Java built application that runs on the Mainframe and it abstracts a lot of the complexity of managing mainframes, whether that be reindexing a DB2 database to starting a job on a different Mainframe server, it's all graphically driven. It's point and click, it's something that if you just came out of computer science school and you got to work for a large financial firm and you didn't understand how to use a 3270 Mainframe screen, you'd be able to figure your way around that application.","We are going to continue to invest in the Mainframe. It's an important market for us and it's a high differentiator with our customers. At the end of the day, that's where the trust is built with a lot of our customers. They trust us on the Mainframe, they trust us and distribute it, they'll trust us with these new applications that we're building for the cloud. Doing a great job in being able to drive value on the Mainframe is critical to us to being able to do a great job on some of the other product areas that we're focused on.","The next area is IT Business Management. This is one where we're coming at it from a position of strength. I'm sure many of you are familiar with our Clarity product. We are the market leader in enterprise portfolio management and we're trying to take it to a new level. Why do customers want to buy this today? Why do customers want to buy this in the future? First of all, we're the only company that can deliver this in our private cloud or behind the firewall. So it's going into the theme that I talked about, giving a customer the ability to run this application where they want to. They could have us running it or they can run it.","Secondly, we're continuing to invest and innovate in this area. One of the products that you'll see out there is the playbook we have, the Clarity playbook. So if you're a CIO, you can have all of your portfolio projects and look at it on your iPod -- iPad, be able to see who's behind schedule? Who's on schedule? How much are you spending? Hit the screen, be able to drop down to find out who's working on it. What is the utilization of the consultants that are spending time on it, these are the things that a CIO's thinking about all day everyday. And they used to have to be in their office, connected to their secure network and that's the only way that they could find us, find out this information. Having that on their iPad and being able to be in whatever geographic location they are with a modern graphical user interface, is something that nobody else can provide. Secondly, this is an application that I think sells well to net new customers. Reducing the total cost of ownership of this application, giving them a modern user interface, allows us to sell to net new customers and then also reignites the customer base.","Also in this line of business is our Nimsoft Service Desk. Once again, this is an application that's out there, I would encourage you to take a look at it. I think it's the most competitive user interface for a Service Desk on the market. This is an area where we have had to make some improvements in our ability to have an easy to use Facebook social-like user experience and when we show this to customers, we think that this is a product that's going to sell extraordinarily well.","Now what does CA have that nobody else has? We have scale and we have a big product portfolio. Tying some of our products together, uniquely differentiates us against point providers and this is a perfect example. Taking the Nimsoft Service Desk and providing all those help-desk tickets, extracting that and putting it on the Clarity playbook. So if you're a CIO, not only can you see the financial performance of your organization with an iPad, you can click down and find out where are the applications having trouble, how many tickets are in this particular application, who's working on it, what's my service level look like? Nobody else can do that. These are the kinds of things that I think we need to be doing a better job at and we're capable of doing it, we just need to focus. Tying the unique things that CA has, that nobody else has and putting them together and this is a business unit where it's growing at 9%. It's an area where we can do better and this is an area where this is a great product and it just doesn't see the light of day as much as it should.","Security and enterprise mobility. I mean it's not lost on anybody in this room how important security is, but security is changing. Right now, the identity is becoming the new perimeter to the security infrastructure and when you take a look what CA's done -- we're the pioneer in identity and Access Management, our CloudMinder product, once again, this is product that's available in the market today. You can take a look at it when you go out for a cocktail outside, this is a product that's used by hundreds of financial institutions. It can work in the cloud. It can work on on-premise and it's an application that really protects and ensures that the person that is accessing the application is really the person you think they are.","Now we've even taken that a step further, because we're going to continue investing in this business. You've seen that we bought Layer 7. It's not just people connecting up to your infrastructure and application, it's other machines and those are the machines do that through APIs, Layer 7 is the best security API tool on the market and this is a perfect example of you just can't buy great technology and expect to put it through the channel and everything's going to work out well. When we bought that company, we've put a bunch of engineering dollars in and around it to make sure that we can extend it, that we can continue to differentiate, not just in 2014, 2015, 2016, we think that this is a big player that's going to reignite a lot of the applications that we have in our security portfolio and it also solves a huge customer issue, which is the bring your own data -- sorry, bring your own device. Having your own device into the office environment is going to happen. It's happening today. There's billions of these devices that are going to be out there over the next 5 years, how are they all going to be managed? We've already done that before with PC, securing them and making sure applications are on there. We launched an application for a mobile device management at CA World and this again is a net new SKU for us. It's an area that we have brand permission to work in and it's a unique application in the marketplace and we've got a multi-year roadmap that we see extending that across the platform, using security as one of the fundamental tenets of managing these devices.","Application delivery. This is another area that is our fastest growing as a percentage of growth area and it's one where we have a multi-year lead on anything that's in the competition. This is primarily our ITKO product, which is Service Virtualization for the layman. If you're an application developer, one of the biggest problems you have is being able to test your application. 90% of all testing's done manually and it's not done very well. This is an application where you can test in a virtualized environment all the inputs coming in to your application, all the outputs. You can mimic different operating systems. You can mimic different networks. It's all done virtually and simulated. Nobody else has this technology and then we've taken it 1 step further with our purchase of Nolio. This is managing the life cycle. So now that you've built an application, how do you take it from your development environment to your test environment, to your integration test environment and finally into production?","70% of the issues that happen in data centers is because that life cycle management is broken by human error. This automates it. Once again, we're not thinking about point products, we're thinking of how do we tie ITKO into life cycle management of an application we bought with organic engineering, wrapping it together, adding real value. Once again, highly differentiated.","Service Assurance. This is our biggest business unit. It's really the crux of our distributed technologies. When it comes to the Mainframe, that's the biggest business unit we have. Next is Service Assurance. This is an area that is highly competitive. This is an area where we have some unique strengths and we're going to be working very hard to highly differentiate in this area, because we have things that nobody else has. First of all, we have Nimsoft Monitor, which is -- can be operated both in the cloud, our private cloud, or can be operated behind the firewall, which is exactly how we want to be deploying these applications. It's got a great interface. This is an application that can be sold to smaller companies but it also fits in to our IM 2.0 platform, which is the most comprehensive infrastructure, application and network management system on the planet.","We're managing hundreds of thousands of devices for some of the largest companies in the world and this is a great opportunity to module-ize these applications so you don't have to have the CA sales force trying to sell the big $50 million deal where you're either going to get it or you're not going to get it. You're able to buy the parts of your infrastructure that you want to manage. If you want to manage applications, you can do that with Nimsoft. You want to -- or, sorry, devices, you can do that with Nimsoft. If you want manage your network, we have a network product that can manage your network. If you want to manage the content on your network, if you want to manage devices, all of these are being module-ized and wrapped up into a user interface, called IM 2.0 -- Infrastructure Management 2.0, and this is something that is highly differentiated. There is nobody that can manage applications, devices and networks as well as CA does. Once again, a great market for us to be in and a great way for us to differentiate.","Now one of the things that's pretty obvious, you can have great products that are highly differentiated and we're not anywhere near where I think we should be, but how do you get those products to market? When I took a look at CA and how many sales professionals we have and how much we spend, I think we can do it more efficiently. At the very high end of the market, these are customers that we have a long-term relationship with that spend tens of millions of dollars with and have been with us for an awful long time. That's one model. And at the lower end of the market is an area where it's very good for our partners and our channels, but our cost structure and some of our products don't fit that very well. Those are pretty easy to decipher. It's the stuff in the middle that I think gets a little cloudy.","Let me walk you through what we've done. When I inspected the sales force and started pulling contracts and started talking to customers, what I found is at the very high end of the market, that model works very well for CA and it's appreciated by customers, but it's expensive. It's difficult, it's complex. We're talking about global companies with black belt procurement teams, with sophisticated CIOs and literally, hundreds of applications and hundreds of contracts merged into an enterprise license agreement. In the world I came from, with PeopleSoft and Taleo, these kind of renewals were not handled, for the most part, by sales professionals. 80% of these transactions were handled by a team that was managing a contract and you're working on plus or minus 5% on a renewal every 3 years. CA, that's upside down. 80% of these contracts are highly negotiated, difficult to understand. It takes a partner to dance. You're dealing with a procurement person, you're dealing with outside consultants, it's very complex.","At that high end of the market, it's going to be expensive for us to sell. It's going to be complex, I don't see that changing in the short term. But one of the things I noticed is that works really well for the biggest customers, but that model has permeated pretty much across the whole infrastructure in CA in different shapes or forms and what happens is the sales professional spends too much time on the renewal and then the renewal comes up because it's an event and then we take products that we should be able to charge more for and they get crammed into the renewal. We're not going to do that going forward. If you're a sales professional and you're not working on those biggest accounts, the way you're getting paid is going to be on selling net new products to existing customers or expanding products that we currently have at existing customers and working the comp plan so that happens outside of the renewal cycle.","How are we going to do this? Well first of all, my first hire here is someone I've worked with for 12 years. He managed sales ops at JD Edwards, PeopleSoft and Taleo. So he's got 8 years of experience in building comp plans and sales deployment models for one of the largest on-demand companies. So he intimately understands what a SaaS model looks like, which is kind of where we're going and what are the pros and cons of that. He also understands these very large, complex renewals and how you should pay -- consult -- and pay a sales force on it and he also understands how you have to be able to structure yourself to grow.","We are in the process of making this transition. We're not going to go all the way there in 2014. The last thing I want to do right now is upset the apple cart and make a huge transition in our sales organization. We did that last year. Some of it worked out well, some of it not so well. If you take a look at what we're doing this year, we're doing as little as we can to touch customers and we're trying to strip out the infrastructure and get people focused on the areas that are most important going forward.","Now when we come out of a customer base, this large customer base, we're starting to look more like a normal software company, where on the right-hand side here, you have the median touch renewals, this is where primarily it's going to be a renewal person that's handling renewal and the sales executive is going to get paid nothing or very little for helping that renewal go by, making that renewal happen. Secondly, we're putting a lot more discipline into the process where you can't sell some of these net new products that are highly differentiated and just jam them into a renewal.","I was on the West Coast last week and this is a dance that we're going to have to play, but it has to start somewhere. It was large financial institution, they want to buy ITKO. Their development team is convinced that it's the right thing to do and it's sitting on the CIO's desk. I go see the CIO. I mean this is a large, multinational billion-dollar company. And he takes the meeting with me and he's got a renewal that's due in December. Renewal team is already starting to work the renewal, helping them understand how much did they use, how much are they going use, how much -- are we going to be asking more. And the procurement guy is telling them to sit on the ITKO purchase because he wants to wrap it in the renewal.","I told him, I said, \"Look, here's the problem I have and you and I are going to have this problem because I got it across the globe. Your procurement guy is telling you not to buy this because you want to cram it into the renewal because you think you're going to get a better deal. I'm telling you right now, you're not going to get a better deal. Because this sales person right here is not getting paid if this thing goes into the renewal.\" We can't do that. It has to start somewhere and it's going to take some time. It's cultural in our company, but we have to unwind it. ITKO is one of the most valuable pieces of software out there. We have a 2-year head start on anybody else. Give that and put it into the renewal where it's discounted at 60%, 70%, 80% doesn't make sense to me. We have to be able to sell those products outside their renewal cycle. We're not very good at it. We don't have the muscle memory to make it happen, but we're starting and we're spending a lot of time and we're trying to adjust the comp plans to make that behavior habit. We're just not there yet, it's going to take some time.","Now when you think about sales, there's been a lot of attention spent on the CA sales force. Some of it is warranted, some of it is a lack of understanding and I got to tell you, from my our own personal view, I went in there with a different perception of our sales force. And over time, I haven't been there long enough that I can be corrupted or swayed. I've been there long enough that I have to understand. My desire to upset that apple cart and change our customer relationships is very low. We did that in Q1 of last year. I want to be more evolutionary than revolutionary with this sales force. But when I take a look at it, we have other things to change that will help our sales force become more efficient.","This company has been selling for 37 years to the biggest companies in the world. About 600 companies generate the majority of our company's revenue. When you're dealing with 600 companies, you know all of those companies, you've bought them a steak, they've been to CA world, you know what they're buying. You know why they're buying it. You know the people in the organization, you understand the power structure, you know how procurement works, you know all that. And that works great, but now you're trying to grow. There's really only 2 ways to grow, either you're building more highly differentiated products so you can sell to those 600 customers, or you have to get net new customers. I want to do both. I want to sell new products to those 600 customers. I won't stop doing that, but we need to sell more net new customers. We are not good at it.","Part of it is marketing. People do not understand the power of this company. For a number of years we've never really spent any money on marketing. If I take a look at the budgets over the last several years, the marketing budget, compared to what you'd see across the board, it's miniscule. They don't understand this company, they don't understand what we stand for. They don't think we're a cloud company. They think we're a Mainframe company. They don't understand our power and security. They don't understand what we're doing in dev ops. They don't understand what we're doing in mobility. We have to change that. So part of that $100 million that we took out of sales, I'm going to take some of that and spend it on brand, understanding the CA brand.","Secondly, when you're only selling to 600 customers, you're not as focused on modern lead generation. The company I came from, I couldn't afford sales people. I couldn't deploy a sales resource unless I knew there's a high probability they are willing to buy. And how did we do that? We used modern marketing tools and lead generation, where if you went to our website, we knew exactly what product you looked at. You can download our product. Because it was a SaaS model, I knew exactly what you're doing with that product and you're starting doing anything sophisticated, and I saw that you went on our website. I could afford to deploy a sales rep and go after that as a competitive bid.","We don't have any of those tools in our company. We're going to have them. We're going to take advantage of all of the modern lead generation, management tools you have. We are early days, but this is going to help our sales force be much more effective. It's going to help our sales force be much more efficient.","New models. The days of putting 20 or 30 beautiful PowerPoints and getting a customer to give you millions of dollars, they are done. They are over. You have to be able to do try and buy. You go to our website today, there's not a single piece of software you can download and try, that's got to change. It has to change with our development teams. It has to change with our marketing team. It has to change with our website. And it has to be adopted and understood by our sales professionals. This is going to happen whether we like it or not. We need to be able to embrace it and I think that our software is highly differentiated and it will start to become more user-friendly and force it to be easier to implement over time if there's an opportunity to do try and buy.","Nobody likes -- if you're running a software company, the last thing in the world you want to do is a proof of concept in try and buy. Unfortunately that's how customers want to deal with it. We need to deal with it that way. We're going to do that. It's going to take us most of the year to get there. You should see 1 or 2 products up by the end of the year. We should be able to go to our website, be able to download the software, try it and buy it. And then if you want the more sophisticated features, that's when we would drop in our sales professional and start working out an agreement that would match your needs.","And then product differentiation. I can't stress this enough. We have got to be the leader in all of the products from a differentiation point of view and we can do that in multiple different ways. We have assets that nobody else has. When it comes to scale, nobody has built scale like we have. When it comes to security, nobody has handled security environments like we have. When it comes to global distribution, global distribution is extraordinarily difficult to build, it's very expensive and it takes years. We've put in place. We have to take advantage of it.","So I think that we are in a position, if we do these things and we do these things well and we do them all day everyday, you're going to see a change in CA. You all understand how our model works. It's going to take time, but we're absolutely committed to it. And how I'd end is the mantra of our company: We are all about innovation, execution and speed.","And with that, I'll let Rich come up here and tell you about 2014.","Richard J. Beckert","Okay. So I'm going to try to tie together the innovation, speed, execution, into the financials and I think you'll start to really see the passion that Mike brings and it's kind of amazing what we've been able to get done over the last 4 months here.","So let's start with innovation. We've moved about 10% of our H1, our core business, into H2 and H3. Well, how did we do that? We continued on the path -- if you look at a normal product life cycle and we have certain criteria for growth rates, if whether or not a customer or a product was growing fast enough, then we would pare down that spending, move it over to some areas where we had potential hyper growth. We've also, as you can see on the Mainframe, we think that's pretty well-balanced right now for what it delivers. So if you look sort of in the middle, a little bit above the profit line, we worked on that, we were able to move 10% of the development spend to different areas to really accelerate into the adjacent and other businesses. You can also see where Nolio, and eventually, we'll have Layer 7 will also fit it into that.","Mike talked about the sales. Inside of the sales, I think this is an important number. We've moved -- removed $100 million out of the sales spend in fiscal year '14. So what we did do is we reinvested some of that back into marketing, which will allow us to increase our pipeline generation. You can also see from the bottom of the slide, when we talked about what we did last year, we had 3 different segments. We've collapsed 2 of those segments down for very deliberate reasons. It allowed us to move the management around, put them back out into the field, this allowed us to generate more quota carriers year-over-year again. It also allowed us, as we go forward, that the specialist coverage we were able to change. This is going to continue as Mike says, part of our evolution that we have going on in the sales and marketing areas.","What do we have to execute on? As you can look here, this is the first year we're out of the trough. So '13 was the trough year. We're now into '14 and beyond. Those following years will be higher than '13 from a renewal standpoint. So we need to have the renewals continue to do what they've been doing, which is make sure the attach rates are correct, make sure we're doing that in an efficient and effective way.","Why does it matter? Why does it impact this year's revenue and guidance though is important to see. It is -- this is the timing of when the contracts are due. Contracts can get done sooner than that, but if left to all timing out upon their expiration date, it's severely back-end loaded.","We also have 1 large customer inside of that number and to a degree that CA and that customer decide to do that sooner because it's mutually benefit, you could see that move forward. We would let you guys know if that happens.","But what this says is by Q4, our revenue backlog and our billings backlog will have turned around, the current piece of revenue billings and the current piece of the backlogs. That's the first time you'll see the flywheel now accelerating as opposed to decelerating. And as we've all seen that happen over the last 6 to 8 quarters, it will now pick up by Q4. It's an important point.","Mike talked about what we did with development. What you see here is the 6 main hubs. It's important that we have the 6 main hubs because from the slide that I showed earlier with a life cycle and the consolidation of sites, it allows us now to move a substantial amount of our development into what on this chart would be future R&D projects, as opposed to the maintenance part of our business. Again, that allows us to drive better quality, faster to market and it will also -- allows us to rehire and remix into specific sites. So it's a win-win overall.","Was the other part of speed with that is Agile. Agile though, from a financial standpoint, says I'm now doing something different. The waterfall method, which has been around forever since FASB 86 came out back in '86, which I helped implement back then, you can actually see where feasibility and design happens, it would have gone to the balance sheet, it would've been capitalized. In the Agile, by definition, the teams are smaller, they're into those sprints and feasibility and design really doesn't happen until you have a full working model at the bottom. So therefore, all that capitalized development -- it's still the same amount of development, it just goes to current period. So therefore, it doesn't affect free cash flow but it does affect CFFO, because now it's now going to go to investment.","Very important, we think because of the speed of our products coming out of the marketplace, the quality of the products we have and our ability to interact with our customers and getting feedback from customers is all going to be leveraged on our ability to do that. It's all part of why we did the consolidation of the sites and it's pretty impressive that we did it in 4 months here.","What does that mean now -- from a P&L standpoint? The top bar of the 652, that's total development, gross development being spent. The green shaded area, that was the amount that was going to the balance sheet. That's the amount that is no longer will be in CFFO. There's a very thin slither that you see in '14 and '15. That's the projects that were already in the waterfall method we're going to continue to allow those to flow out over time. By the time we get to '16, there will not be anymore projects that are in the waterfall method. So it will all flow. Gross will equal net in essence, so you can see that overall development being spent, the 14% EBITAR that we've talked about before, we feel that's balanced.","The bottom part of the slide shows what was going on. You can see it now going away and there actually is a tiny little sliver there in '15, but you can see the amortization, which is now slowly going to -- and it will accelerate, because we won't put anything more on over time, so the point where we will have nothing left on the balance sheet for our own internally developed code.","So what does that mean, when we did all these rebalancing? It allows us to improve the effectiveness of our sales coverage. As I said, we're going to extend -- even more people out in the field. It will increase the velocity of the development team and we think we will have better quality and a better time to market with that. And from the G&A functions, we were able to continue to rebalance our business, become more and more effective. From the benefits of course, we'll have a better lead gen coming out of the marketing team. We will be able to have our sales expense and the E to R will continue to have that work in a direction that we want to see it coming down. We told you, we had to move another point or 2, you saw us do that this year. So it's a big movement and that allowed us then to get to market faster, we believe.","Now from a timing of this, so for people who have models, it says there's $150 million worth of GAAP, $100 million of that will hit this year, that says $50 million of that will hit in the following years, as we close out sites in some locations, as people take that long to leave. Of the $100 million, 1\/2 of that will be in Q1. So it's just so people understand.","Talk about cash tax impact now. As I said, we changed our methodology. It allowed us now to be more predictable. So as we changed the methodology and our ability now to, in essence, have our tax rate and then pay our taxes, you'll see all that happen in the same year. What you see in '14 is the prior year catch up as we change methodology. It's a big number, right? So that's why you saw that dip. When you normalize that back out, you'll see our overall tax rate is about the same. So it's not really -- it's a timing of cash, it's not a tax rate issue.","Cash flow, the chart I started with earlier. I thought it was important to now show it again. I think it takes a little more sense. You can see the cap dev moves to CFI. You can see the one-time tax change. You can see the rebalancing, how that impacts us. So if you normalize those in '14, we'd actually be in line and what you'll see that we also think that over time, we'll have our low single-digit CAGR continue in cash.","I just thought this chart would be helpful. It shows free cash flow versus CFFO and you just can see the cap dev going away over time. It also shows, though, from a free cash flow stand point, that we are showing growth over time.","So what is our uses of cash? We have a very strong balance sheet, with $2.8 billion and $1.3 billion worth of debt and a BBB+ rating. We have 38% of our cash is in the United States. That's enough to pay the dividend. It's enough for us to do our buyback. We're very comfortable with that. It's enough for us to, on average and if you remember last year was a light year of acquisitions, to do between $300 million and $500 million at any point in time, if we so choose. And then it allows us to return $1 per share dividend and also continue our buyback that we started last year at $500 million, which is what's left to time out.","And with that, I'll invite Mike back up to do Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Michael P. Gregoire","Thanks, Rich. So I think Kelsey is going to bring a microphone. There's one here and -- if we need be. And we'll try to answer as many questions as we can.","Unknown Analyst","I just had a question on timing. It sounded like, Rich, you were saying that a lot of it's already been done. Can you just clarify in terms of what has been done and what hasn't been done?","Richard J. Beckert","Done on what way? Be more specific.","Unknown Analyst","When you said facility consolidation, the restructurings in terms of people, it sounded like you were talking like it had -- everything had already been done.","Richard J. Beckert","The announcement today will start -- the people, that will happen over time. The facilities will happen after the people exit those facilities. So you have a portion of that gets -- happens in Q1. That's why I said half of that, of the $100 million that will happen this year, $50 million of that in round numbers is in Q1, the rest of it, you have to vacate the sites in order to receive the rest of that. And in some locations around the world, you have to -- it takes much longer to work through work councils and whatnot. So they'll fall out of the year.","Unknown Analyst","So over the 2-year period, you're guiding CFFO roughly flat. Does that mean the growth impact of all the initiatives will take even longer, maybe '16, '17 et cetera.","Richard J. Beckert","So we're not giving FY '15 guidance, so let's start with that. What we were showing, though, was that the impact that we have from the actions were a 1-year phenomenon. That if you can put those next in '15, those will continue to grow. To a degree, our sales and all those type of things continue on top of that, you'll see benefit from there.","Unknown Analyst","That's assuming flat revenue or flat bookings over that 2-year period.","Richard J. Beckert","Close to that.","Unknown Analyst","And the second question is, post the transition, what do you think the right level of leverage the business can hold?","Michael P. Gregoire","What do you mean by leverage?","Richard J. Beckert","Yes, what do you mean by leverage?","Unknown Analyst","Debt.","Richard J. Beckert","We like where our balance sheet is right now. We like the rating that we have. And so, as I said earlier, we have enough cash in the U.S. so that therefore, the 38% allows us to do our buyback, it allows us to do the dividend and allows us to do the acquisitions that we think we need. So there's not really a reason for us to go out into the debt market at this time.","Unknown Analyst","Mike, a quick question on products. You mentioned advanced analytics and also social and mobile. Should we be thinking of those -- that functionality being embedded in all net new products.","Michael P. Gregoire","Yes, well, on the social mobile thing, I think that's table stakes nowadays, I mean, to put an application out and not have a notion that people are going to want to use it from an Android or an IOS device. I mean, I think the horse has left the barn on that one. So anything new coming out, will have that notion involved in it. On the analytics piece, there's parts of it I think we understand pretty well and there's parts that I we think we should be very careful about and we'll do a wait and see. On analytics, we'll be managing Hadoop applications, and Hadoop servers. Yes, I mean, we do that today. I don't think that, that's a big stretch for us. But an area where I think we can do more and we're launching a product, 9.5 of APM where we have analytics built into the APM engine so you know what, we're collecting all these log file data. And it's not like we'd spelunk does, we collect this in the real-time. And being able to drop that into our analytics server and do correlation of what's happening in your network or in your application and giving you real-time alerts on trend analysis and heuristics, that's launching in APM 9.5, which I believe is this quarter. So we are adopting the big data analytics engines in the products that makes sense, in areas where we are still experimenting. We hired -- since I've been year, I've hired 6 data scientists and I've got them doing some work because I don't know what the value of this data is but to your point, one of the things -- when I was at Taleo, we kept all of the employment information, all the salary information and we're -- before we got bought by Oracle, we're talking to some of the big data firms, asking us if they can buy the data from us. Because what they're trying to do is predict the employment number. And as we started collecting all of this data, we realized that, that data has value and if we can get people to understand it, that might be a new growth engine for us. But this is a perfect example of 6 people doing that and trying to find out how it works out, that's worth the investment. Having 60 people working on it for 1.5 years that thinks it's going to work out, I'm not for that.","Unknown Analyst","And if I could, a follow-up, your presentation on renewals. This is the real question...","Michael P. Gregoire","You gave me the softball to warm me up. All right, bring it on.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, pretty much. You knew that. So how much, in that pyramid of your customers, what -- roughly what percentage are in that sort of high-end. And totally understand and respect that they're very sophisticated contracts, you have contracts that are $100 million. Yet, some of that are hundreds of millions. Those are -- that's not going to just renew automatically, I totally understand that, but how much of your -- roughly, how much of your business is that kind of a contract.","Michael P. Gregoire","Too much.","Richard J. Beckert","It's never too much, as long as it's that kind of business.","Michael P. Gregoire","The issue there is twofold. It's a big number in dollars. It's not a big number in customer relationships and to the point I was making before, it's a natural extension that -- in a premise, that was just wrong. It works well here, so let's do it here. When you take a look at the economics -- and once again, it's changing. If you take a look at what those contracts look like, they're all bespoke. When you buy from Salesforce.com, when you buy from Concur, when you buy from Taleo, it's on our paper. When you buy it from CA, every contract is -- it's a workout session and we need to work through the best way of engaging contractually, product-wise and that's going to take a little bit of time. But to your point, the evolution of the company will be to get the renewals into a -- in a perfect world, I'd like the renewals in 1 group, they only get paid on the renewal and the renewal has very little fluctuation from subscription to subscription. That is a direction. We're not going to get there in 2014 but everything that we're doing is moving towards that model and I'm more than happy to tell you a year from now, how far we progressed on that model.","Richard J. Beckert","I also think, just to add to that, the lower end transactions, the renewals, which is probably 3 quarters of them are actually only handled by about 50 people worldwide, that is renewal only. So it's not as if we throw the -- as Mike's focused on the upper triangle, there are hundreds each quarter that are done by a very small team that are on a very low quota-type of thought process.","Unknown Analyst","But the point is not so much the people, the cost of that doing that, but it's the issue of allocation of revenue upon the renewal when I know there's a renewal person and a new person, they report in a matrix fashion, but to a first level sales manager and they all report to George Fischer. And let's say -- I mean there's so much room for allocation issues, for bad practices.","Richard J. Beckert","Not really, because they go below a certain renewal yield, which is why you see a...","Unknown Analyst","Okay, but let's say they were going to renew at 100% and then they renew at 90% and then -- and that 10% is allocated to new business. That 10% of renewal you could've had, that somebody's getting a higher commission on than if you didn't know it doesn't happen?","Michael P. Gregoire","Well, I can't say what happened in the past, in the -- what's happening now is we are -- we're on a diet. We're weaning ourselves off it. It is very difficult. You will not make your quota. If that's your mode of operation in our company, you will not make your quota. The odds of you making that are so stacked against you that I think it might even be...","Richard J. Beckert","It doesn't have the same weighting, that's what I was going to tell you. That first 10% doesn't have the same weighting.","Michael P. Gregoire","It could be mathematically impossible, John [ph], for that to happen in the 2014 playing season. But to my point, is I don't think that's even aggressive enough. I just think it's reckless to change those customer relationships and I also feel that I don't understand the machinery well enough to make an educated guess. I've got people working on it and my -- I've already started 2015 yesterday, or I think it was yesterday, and I've put up on the board, no commissions for renewals. That's my starting argument. I won't get there, but that's where I'm starting negotiation.","Unknown Analyst","I appreciate that. And by the way, the first question was -- I really wanted to ask that one too.","Michael P. Gregoire","Sure you did.","Unknown Analyst","Mike, thanks for going through the distributed part of the portfolio and going through the details over there. Now when you look at your product portfolio, are there certain product lines that you think you need to completely shut down or get out of to drive longer term growth. And if you do, what is your timeline for that.","Michael P. Gregoire","Yes, I mean, once again, it's very -- I don't have a history in the company. And I do believe that I've got an objective view today. Over time, that objectivity will get tainted, but when I take a look at products and I take a look at budgets, I want to give money to the products that have growth. I want to streamline products that are good, but they're not going to grow. And then there's a cadre of products that just don't make sense in our portfolio. And that's an area where we'll probably look for a better home for those products. We're not going to leave customers stranded. That's not in the CA culture. That's not the way I want to operate. I think it would hurt the rest of the business. But you're absolutely correct, we can't be everything to everybody and over 37 years, we've made a couple of strategic plays that just didn't work out the way we want them to and that's life in the big city, to continue to invest and pretend that those products are going to be what we once thought they were going to be. You should stare that down and deal with it and take the money that we're going to invest in that product that's not going to get us to where we really want to go and put it into ITKO. Put it into Clarity playbook. Put it into the Nimsoft monitor. Put it into IM 2.0. These are areas where we can really aggressively spend those R&D dollars and get a disproportionate return because the innovation and differentiation is high plus the customers want those products.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. How big of a force was [indiscernible]","Michael P. Gregoire","We haven't really broken it out.","Richard J. Beckert","So I think the way I would look at -- to answer your question, we've already removed 10% of the portfolio in the development and allowed us to then put it into newer, faster growing markets. We have another subset of that market. We're happy with -- the customer and the growth might be very slow, but we need to move from 7 releases that we have in the field to the -- and minus 1 and minus 2, that'll free up more money. But as Mike said, we're not going to leave people behind. Then you get to what just doesn't fit at all into our portfolio anymore and we have a subset of those that we're out working on and that's what Jacob's team does. We're going to do that in a smart and intelligent way. We don't need to fire sale things. That's how I would answer that question.","Kelsey Turcotte","We have a question from the webcast. They'd like a little color on your view on the renewal yield on an ongoing basis, on the portfolio.","Richard J. Beckert","So how do you feel about the renewal yield? Is that the question?","Kelsey Turcotte","Yes, a little color on your view on the renewal yield on the upcoming year and the expected larger renewal portfolio.","Richard J. Beckert","I think over the last year, starting probably in Q2 of the last year going forward, we had a lot of focus on what's the yield, making sure kind of back to the point you had asked, John [ph], are we making sure so that we inspect transactions over a certain dollar amount, every one of them and a lot more detail than I think you probably think, as far as how much of that is allowed to be -- there's not as much movement. And that's not controlled by necessarily, the sales team that makes those decisions. That being said, it should stay right around in the 90% range plus or minus a little depending on the quarter. The only anomalies to that, and we point those out, is usually if someone in the early 2006, '07 or '08, way overbought because they thought they were going to do acquisitions and we saw that in some of the financial institutions. Those were the types that all of a sudden pull down any one quarter to an unusual 82, 83, 84. In general, especially on the Mainframe, we're not seeing, at the high-end, we're seeing decent growth of capacity. It doesn't necessarily mean it will quantifies into dollars. But that platform is alive and well. And the number of customers that are falling off the bottom are very small. And I would tell you, we happen to be at the same conference when we heard IBM speak. They're seeing actually, believe it or not, growth, in Mainframes in some of the emerging markets. China is probably the best example of that. We are just starting to get into that marketplace. And we always have to draft them, remember. So as we they move in to parts of Africa as well, we'll draft there. From the Enterprise Solutions side, that's really where I think is we're making the right choices and accelerating what we're bringing to market. That will take pressure out of us having to discount more prices. We can deliver more releases sooner. That's how I would answer it.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Michael Turits. A question regarding this questioning about, decision you both talked about of support for back versions of products. So first, is there any target for how much actually can be saved by going to a smaller number of products, versions of products that are supported historically. And how can you really do that effectively with, let's say, just a carrot of producing better stuff versus really forcing people to take it off. And what's the risk behind it getting -- forcing people to get off.","Richard J. Beckert","Yes, there's a target. No, we're not telling you the target, Michael. But that being...","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Worth a try.","Richard J. Beckert","Yes, I know. It's okay. But that being said, we have a whole team and I think, actually, that's the only thing we didn't really talk in a lot of detail on. When Mike came, we have a team going across all the disciplines, looking at those products, because if you're a normal product manager, you're looking at the newest best thing. And so there's a subset of people now that are looking at how do we help migrate these customers forward and that might mean you have to actually develop the bridges for them and then you can then sunset that old release. And there's a whole effort we have going on. We learned from one of our other products that we have been pretty successful with and that's being led in the development side.","Michael P. Gregoire","Coupled with that is a lot of these products came through acquisition and part of the acquisition methodology that we put in place, I worked with Jacob on that, is I want to have a perspective before we buy the asset. How does it fit within the portfolio and if it's a similar product, where we're just buying the customer and the revenue stream? What is the plan to deal with that? One of our great examples is work on the Mainframe is work at load automation. We have 10 products in the market. This team that Rich talked about has gone through systematically and concluded that we can get that down to 3. We can't get it less than 3. The volume of customers on those 3 products is so significant and the complexity of those particular products are such that there's no automated way that we could write automated scripts to make that happen. But the 7 that are currently out there, if we work with the customers and help them, sometimes offering carrots, we can get down to 3 and managing 3 is better than managing 10. And I think that there's multiple of those in my short tenure here that I think we can make happen.","Unknown Analyst","I think a lot of shareholders would like to translate what you've described into how to think about growth in revenues, margins and cash flow going forward. And especially with the accounting changes, I think there's a lot of, like, confusion. I just want to confirm a few things. Maybe you can help me think about that. The first is, I think I heard you say that you're taking out $100 million, which is almost over 200 basis points of the sales cost this year in what is apparently the early stages of a change in your sales force that you're not going to do it all at once. You're going to reinvest even half of that is pretty good. I think I heard you say that you're spending enough on R&D, so all the things that you're changing won't increase the aggregate spend, it's just the mix shift. Because I wasn't sure about that, is that correct?","Michael P. Gregoire","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","And then the third thing, I think, and this is more a technical question is that you're guiding the flat margins year-over-year. So again, the year 1 of your transition, but there's this big accounting change. Does that mean that you're really expanding margins, like -- are you taking like $160 million hit in the P&L year-over-year?","Richard J. Beckert","No, because from the -- from a GAAP standpoint, yes, but non-GAAP. No, because it comes out.","Unknown Analyst","Non-GAAP. So why are margins flat then year-on-year?","Richard J. Beckert","Because our revenues are down even though we're containing costs. Our total absolute revenue in absolute numbers are down year-over-year.","Unknown Analyst","So then can you help me -- just the final question is, how to think about what you're doing, the cost you're taking out, the reenergizing of your revenue growth. Help us think about the next 3 or 4 years, what are you going to grow and what are you going to do with margins.","Richard J. Beckert","We're not going to give you forward-looking guidance, which I think is sort of what you're asking. But I think you should think of it in a different way, Justin [ph], everything that Mike described and hopefully what I've described, you see us positioned very well. So once the top line comes back around, you really can start to leverage things like our development and our go-to-market and I think what you'll see coming out of the marketing side with better pipeline, which means quicker sales on the development side, you're going to see more releases sooner. And I think Mike's an expert in driving that kind of behavior. So we feel good about that. We had some -- maybe talk about some of the things that we announced at CA World, I don't know if you had a chance to go. We have a lot of things coming up that have re-leveled the playing field for us in areas that maybe we weren't -- were a little bit behind. So part of that standalone transaction when you have a hot product is a lot easier. So you'll see some of that, too. I don't know if you'd add anything to that.","Michael P. Gregoire","Rich is spot on. We're just not in a position right now where you can give multi-year guidance. I've been here 4 months. We've done some pretty dramatic things. Taking a $100 million out of sales, reenergizing the product development teams, moving $50 million of costs from older products to net new growth engines and those products will take a year for us to build. So it's really having an eye towards, what are you going to have in 2015 and '16 that's going to drive revenue down the road rather than looking for the next acquisition, trying to jam that into a renewal. I mean I want to get out of that business and into the highly innovative, very customer-centric, client-focused business and we're just not in a position right now where we can give that 2015, 2016 guidance. But hopefully from what you see here today, and the direction and if you step outside and touch and feel those products, they're real products that are in the market today that you can buy, they're highly differentiated. I think the future looks a lot brighter for CA going forward than it has perhaps in the last couple of years and then I think the slide that I'd like you to talk about, Rich, is the renewal trough. 2013 was a very awkward year for the company and we are getting some of the benefit of just being at a better renewal season that will show growth in future years.","Richard J. Beckert","So if you look at that slide and I'm sure somebody will put your rulers out to see what percent is actually in Q4. It's a disproportionate percentage, which all of that revenue will show up in the following year that's attached.","Unknown Analyst","Is that renewal portfolio grow again in the next year as well?","Richard J. Beckert","We're not going to give you guys that kind of guidance, but what I can tell you, for the next several years, it will all be higher than '13.","Kelsey Turcotte","Just one point of clarification, on the non-GAAP operating margin. For those of you looking at your models, last year, we had a one-time benefit from the IP transaction in the first quarter. So when you're looking from an organic basis this year versus last year, even with the headwind in revenue, we are seeing expansion from an organic perspective in the non-GAAP operating margin. So I think there's a model that probably needs to be updated when you look at that.","Unknown Analyst","Two questions. I think, Mike, first for you and welcome aboard, get a chance to spend some time with you. You're looking forward in the long-term, making some major changes in the sales relationship separating, it sounds like the ELA renewals from the net new product sales. Should we be thinking about this that over time, this will basically detach that event that occurs on ELA renewals, where you're attaching these additional sales, which will mean that some products, it will be more transactional-based, some coming in earlier, some coming in later but less tied to the renewal itself.","Michael P. Gregoire","I'd love to get there if we could, but once again, I said you have to have a dance partner that wants to play that game with you and I don't want to speak out of both sides of my mouth, but we use that renewal as an event for our own purposes and so do customers. And we're going to have to play that dance and what I want to do is get away from this behavior is our renewal's coming up and every salesperson that's selling a particular product tries to jump and get their product into that renewal. And what happens is it's not a popular thing and the sales force cringes every time I say this. And I'm going to say it again, because I want them to cringe because I don't like the behavior, is it's like going to 7-year-olds in a soccer game. The ball goes in the corner and you see everybody go to that corner and the whole field is left empty. You watch a professional soccer game, people play positions. We can't have everybody migrate to an event in our company because it's going down, because that means that there's all these net new customers that we're not focusing on. And so what I'd like to see the behavior is if we have a renewal going on and there's a product that makes sense to be sold and we're going to hold the line on the value of that product, I have no issue with that happening in the context of our renewal but I want that a conscious decision that's being made by us. But because that's going to happen, I don't want to advocate our responsibility to sell those products to other customers, as well as into the renewal cycle. And this is feedback that I've directly heard from customers is how come I only see you and your account team 6 months before a renewal? I mean I want us to be intimate with these customers and understand what their buying patterns are, what the problems they have and how our portfolio of maps up against that. Now we will bump into situations where the customer's going to hold off buying because they're going to try to take these products into an ELA and I can't say that that's not going to happen and that is no fault of our sales force. I'm just saying that we default to that more often than I would like and you've been here a lot longer than I, Rich, I know you've been trying to police and monitor this. Maybe you can provide a little color on that?","Richard J. Beckert","I would say, what we really want to make sure, in the final year of that renewal, that's one thing but in year 2 or a 3-year renewal, we really want those guys selling outside, and as Mike said, touching those customers all the time. And I thought that was a perfect example. Here we are in Q1 trying to put ITKO in which we know the IT side wants and that could potentially get elongated all the way out to Q4. And so that's sort of the behavior that we're trying to curtail.","Unknown Analyst","Quick question, Rich. Mainframe revenue has been trending down. I mean, year-over-year it's down. So the chart you're showing is that Mainframe up slightly 1%. So flat on it...","Richard J. Beckert","Gartner's.","Unknown Analyst","You say Gartner's rather than specifically your expectation of where it will trend.","Richard J. Beckert","I think Mike said earlier, it's going to be flat plus or minus 1. Clearly, the way the -- you've got to view the market, you have IBM, then us, then BMC, Compuware and then 30% of the market is leery with single-product family companies, which has all been announced over the last couple of days. Clearly that puts us in a very good position. We are investing heavily. We're coming out with new products and other people aren't. So we think we're going to get market expansion over time anyway because we're -- I think we're viewed technologically as one of the leaders still in that space. And then as I said earlier, when we look at the financial institutions and a lot of these other big manufacturing companies and how they're leveraging that business, I think people forget every iPad that's in here and if you swipe a credit card on one of those little cubes on your phone, at some little stand, the back end of that is the Mainframe. So people forget all of these mobile devices, that's great for us. So I think there's a lot of transactions that are going to continue to happen and they are still world-class at doing that. That's probably how I'd answer that question. Will that market move up and down? It absolutely does move up and down. So -- but I think plus or minus 1 is kind of what we think.","Kelsey Turcotte","And Rich, I think you pointed out that the previous year, we had a one-time event in Mainframe in the third quarter. So that's a little bit of the sort of year-over-year disparity in the composition of the Mainframe revenue. Do we have any other questions?","Unknown Analyst","I have 2 for you, Rich. On Slide 33, Rich, you showed that when the bookings are scheduled to come in, assuming they came in on the expiration of the contract. But can you just tell us, I know you don't know when they're going to come in, but can you talk to us a little bit about your experience historically when they normally come in. And then historically, like over time, but also more recently the macro environment is kind of funky. And -- just give us a little bit of information about...","Richard J. Beckert","Unfortunately it's one of those that depends. And the reason why I say that is if the customer's budgetary year is December 31 and they have the budget in December versus our Q4, which would be their Q1. That's the reason why they would want to do that event earlier. So sometimes you see them come in sooner. Sometimes you see it come in later. The other thing that we might drive at for a different reason if we see our ability to line up with one of our competitors and take up potentially more of their products by lining up our ELA on top of their ELA. Then that allows that vendor to have more leverage over them and so we'll accelerate as opposed to -- those are probably the 2 biggest, other than that John, if you were to kind of look at the norm clearly, the whole economy has caused people not to do a big buy ahead. I mean we saw that happened several years ago and I think that trend's continued and so that was my point before. They are still growing MIPS but there's a lot of price pressure on the extra capacity as an example. And you'll see that they're buying our distributed products but they're not going to go buy a lot more. We've actually had somewhat surprised us, we're willing to buy outside of a renewal at a premium rather than have to sit there and commit to that because they couldn't get their finance teams to agree to that. They were uncertain on their business, had nothing to do with our product set.","Unknown Analyst","And just a quick follow-up, I just want to make sure I understood your answer to one of [indiscernible] questions about the impact of non-GAAP EPS of this change in the capitalized software development. So you're going to be expensing most of R&D at this point, whereas before, you capitalized more of that. So that will show up right on the income statement. And then the amount that you -- that is right now on the balance on the balance sheet, that will amortized -- still be in expense in -- will that still be in non-GAAP expenses?","Richard J. Beckert","So the cap dev will -- we actually will have, in the supplemental, if you guys all looked at the supplemental, we were laying those out for you and you can actually step through that and you'll be able to see exactly how much per quarter is coming in and out of each one of those. So it's literally there. I don't know if you have your supplemental on your deck.","Unknown Analyst","I just want to make sure, in the non-GAAP number, because I'm thinking about the guidance, there's certainly the expense in there.","Richard J. Beckert","They're both excluded, in non-GAAP going forward, is in GAAP, then you'll be able to then back out or put it in, depending on how your model works, right.","Unknown Analyst","I'm sorry, what both...","Richard J. Beckert","Cap dev, because you have now -- you have your capitalized development that would have gone. So we actually went back and re-did last year for you and then you can see it going forward. So we're providing, in essence, from an apples-to-apples. And just to be clear, John [ph], amortization goes away. It really will decelerate in about 3 years and then it becomes noise in year 4 and 5. That little tiny bit that you saw goes on for several years, but it gets very small, very quickly.","Kelsey Turcotte","So I think that's it. Mike, do you want to...","Michael P. Gregoire","Great. Well, first of all, thank you very much for coming. We're really excited about some of the things we're doing on the product side. We're absolutely committed to making our go-to-market as efficient as possible, trying to drive our customer relationships as tightly as possible as well. And I'm going to be sticking around here for a little while with Rich and we're happy to answer some questions over the cocktail hour.","But if you can, please go take a look at some of these products. As I said, I've been here for 4 months. I'm absolutely blown away by some of the innovation this company has and I want you to see it because I think that's part of the recipe for making CA grow. Thank you very much."],"4464":["CA, Inc.

Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kieran McGrath, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Kieran will offer some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll open up the call for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Thursday, May 11, 2017, over the telephone and the Internet.

Please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Gregoire","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us.","I am very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we\u2019ve seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with solid momentum. Our strong fourth quarter performance enabled us to deliver most metrics at the high end of our full year guidance ranges. In fiscal 2017, we achieved total revenue growth for the first time since fiscal 2012. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. Now we are positioning CA for our next phase, which we believe will accelerate our growth trajectory over time.","Turning to our Q4 results. Our revenue, new sales, EPS and CFFO were at or above our expectations. The highlight was the strength we saw in new sales across both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe segments. In ES, healthy new sales growth was broad-based and was particularly robust across API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery portfolio, with exceptionally strong results in our test data management business.","In Mainframe, new sales grew meaningfully. It is not surprising that capacity sales declined from the year ago period given where we are in the hardware refresh cycle. But our Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter demonstrates how well customers are embracing our new innovations on the platform. In the quarter, strength in Mainframe new sales was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery or DCD, as well as Mainframe Operational Intelligence or MOI.","Overall, our Q4 performance was driven by the great execution of our Platinum sales team. They did a very good job of capitalizing on a large renewal portfolio. Results from our North America Platinum and Public Sector teams were particularly strong. The renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 90s, inline with our longer term target, and new sales were up dramatically. Our Named and Growth, or partner-led sales organizations also delivered healthy double-digit new sales growth in the quarter. I am pleased to report that the integration of our Automic acquisition is progressing well. And, we enthusiastically welcome Veracode to the team. We are really excited about the quality of the products and most importantly the quality of the people at both Automic and Veracode. These strategically important acquisitions substantially strengthen the growing portion of our ES portfolio.","For the full year, we delivered results broadly at the higher end of our guidance ranges. Revenue, EPS and CFFO were above the mid-point of the guidance ranges we provided for the full year. Operating margin came inline and reflects the absorption of acquisition related expenses associated with Automic and Veracode. Notably, for the full year, our ES revenue grew organically, which is a marked improvement over prior years. Our Mainframe segment delivered consistently solid performance through the year. For the year, Mainframe performed at the better end of our expectations. We believe our relative outperformance can be attributed to a few things.","Our Mainframe business unit was an early adopter of the Agile methodology. This has resulted in the completion of nearly 40 releases in the past year with zero defects. This level of product quality is important to all customers, but is most important to our customers running mission critical applications. CA continues to invest meaningfully in the mainframe platform. We believe we offer a broader, more innovative, and cost competitive portfolio of solutions. We are also able to leverage our ES development as well as recent acquisitions to provide unique integrations and truly cross platform solutions that help customers solve complex challenges.","Our broad, solutions-based portfolio enables us to provide customers with compelling, cost competitive offerings. For example, one of the largest retailers in the United States made the decision to partner with us to support its retail, corporate systems, credit cards and dotcom property. Our portfolio of innovative solutions is enabling them to simplify their IT environment, narrow their supplier base, and reduce their cost. In conjunction with our partners and our customers\u2019 IT operations team, we are helping to deliver a seamless migration to seven key CA solutions in less than 90 days.","Looking ahead, we believe our partnership with IBM on IBM Cloud Managed Services on z Systems, commonly referred to as zCloud, provides us with a great opportunity to help customers realize the benefit of the cloud while running mission critical, security rich mainframe workloads. This partnership enables CA to provide value to customers that have smaller MIPS consumption where the fixed costs of running a mainframe platform is challenging. It also gives the option to larger customers to move CapEx to OpEx by turning mainframe capacity into a service, similar to AWS or Azure. These dynamics have the potential to enable CA to capture incremental market segment share over time.","When I look at our business overall, I can confidently say that we are in a good place. We are in a great businesses and we have absolutely improved our execution. In this industry, we can never rest on last quarter\u2019s performance. But when I pause for a moment and look back at the work our teams have done, we have made outstanding progress. First and foremost, CA was recently named one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies in 2017 by Ethisphere Institute. This is the second year in a row that CA has received this honor, which recognizes companies that lead with integrity and align principles with action. We at CA take great pride in this recognition that we believe is a reflection of the culture and priorities we have cultivated over the last few years.","I\u2019m also pleased that our heightened focus on customer success is reflected in the significant improvement we\u2019re seeing in our NPS or Net Promoter Score. This is a standardized measure of customers\u2019 willingness to recommend our products to other potential customers. In fiscal 2017, our NPS scores across both our ES and Mainframe segments moved up considerably. The spirit of innovation within CA is alive and well. Throughout the organization, our teams understand that organic innovation is critical and is at the heart of our strategy.","The budding success of our CA Accelerator, which is our internal VC like technology incubator, is certainly helping. In this framework, successful ideas become solutions and begin to build momentum with customers. The objective for these innovations is to exit the CA Accelerator into the product organization. The first graduate from the CA Accelerator to the CPO organization is a common analytics engine that can be utilized by both Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions segment. Companywide, CA was granted 186 patents in FY '17, up from 157 in the prior year.","Meanwhile, the product portfolio continues to improve. Our products are becoming easier to install, upgrade and manage. And we are pleased to report that our solutions continue to earn recognition from major industry analysts. For example, in Q4 CA was named a Leader by Gartner in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Governance and Administration. We are listening to our customers. This is resulting in improved NPS scores, better products and more efficient business practices. We are furthering our commitment to deliver solutions in a way customers increasingly prefer to buy. We\u2019re working to accelerate the velocity of products like Agile Central and Blazemeter.","Looking ahead, we are optimizing our internal processes to build, sell, and monetize our subscription based products more systematically, with higher velocity and with greater efficiency. This includes building out a common set of best practices, metrics, and business architecture across our SaaS solutions. Similarly, we are optimizing the way in which we go to market. As mentioned last quarter, we\u2019ve observed that our largest Named accounts have preferences and behaviors much like our Platinum customers. At the same time, the investments we\u2019ve made in our partner channel and our digital sales over the past few years has started to gain momentum. This allows us to now reduce the complexity of our customer stratification.","Going forward, we are migrating the Platinum, Named and Growth nomenclature towards two sales groups, Enterprise and Commercial. This aligns with our growing portfolio of next generation software solutions, and it aligns with how our existing and prospective customers transact. The Enterprise sales team will encompass what has been known as Platinum, in addition to the largest 30% or so of the Named sales group. We believe this will enable us to drive deeper penetration in our largest Fortune 2000 opportunities. The Commercial sales group will absorb the smaller Named customers and will be entirely served by digital sales and partners.","We believe this will enable us to cost effectively serve a much broader set of potential customers globally. Ultimately, we expect this to propel a lower cost, higher velocity go to market strategy for CA over time. This is an exciting time at CA. This industry is moving quickly and so are we. We\u2019ve made incredible progress and as we look toward the next phase of this company\u2019s evolution, in many ways we are just getting started. As we enter FY'18 and beyond, we are pivoting to enter our next phase as a company that delivers sustainable, long-term growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you.","Kieran McGrath","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I\u2019m going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","As Mike had previously mentioned, we were very pleased with our sales execution in the fourth quarter. Q4 total new sales increased in the low 40s, while renewals increased in the low 50s. As we have stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis, due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Automic contributed approximately mid-single digits to total new sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 renewal yield was in the low 90s, in line with our longer term expectations.","In Q4, new sales in all regions were up as reported and in constant currency except EMEA, where new sales were flat as reported and up in constant currency, including the contribution from the Automic acquisition. Within our segments, Q4 Mainframe new sales increased in the low 40s, despite lower capacity sales which likely reflects the timing of the hardware cycle. Mainframe new sales performance was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operational Intelligence.","Q4 Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 40s and mid 40s in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, the strong performance in this segment was driven by products like API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery products, all of which saw meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis. Automic contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth in the quarter. For the full year, total new sales were up approximately 10%, with Enterprise Solutions new sales up high single digits and Mainframe Solutions new sales up in the mid teens.","Acquisitions contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth and mid-single digits to total new sales growth for the full year. Even without acquisitions, total new sales would have grown for the full year. Our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2017 was up in the mid-teens, and our renewal yield was in the low 90s in each of the four quarters.","Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.01 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5% as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, and Services was down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Automic contributed 2 points as reported and 3 points in constant currency to total revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter. More specifically, Automic contributed approximately 6 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 4 points to Services revenue in the quarter.","For the full year, total revenue was $4.04 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 results include one quarter of inorganic contribution from our 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, in addition to our more recent acquisition of Automic. Fiscal 2017 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5%, Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 1%, and Services revenue was down 8% as reported and down 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points to total revenue growth for the full year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 3 points to Services revenue for the full year.","Total revenue backlog increased 11% as reported, and 12% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported, and 6% in constant currency, inclusive of Automic and Veracode. As we\u2019ve said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow with more consistency as we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield.","Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 21%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, in line with our expectations. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 59% for Mainframe Solutions and 1% for Enterprise Solutions. As typical, our Q4 margins were lower. In addition to higher seasonal expenses, an increased level of commissions paid from higher new sales generated in the period negatively impacted Mainframe Solutions segment operating margin in Q4. Enterprise solutions operating margins, which are typically seasonally lower in Q4, were also adversely impacted by non-recurring expenses related to our acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. In addition, segment margin was impacted by increased level of commission expense commensurate with new sales growth. Services margin was negative 3%.","As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, as our product portfolio has evolved and our solutions are becoming easier to install and to manage, fewer services are required. This has resulted in contraction of this structurally lower margin segment. Our fourth quarter segment margin reflects the continuation of our actions to better align the cost structure with our expected Services revenue run rate going forward. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter were approximately 21% and 25%, respectively. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 7%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, down 10% as reported and down 12% in constant currency.","For the full year, our GAAP operating margin was 28%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Fiscal 2017 segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions, and breakeven for Services. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year was $1.85, up 4% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.48, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency.","Q4 CFFO was $419 million, down 11%. CFFO in the quarter was impacted by the GSA settlement. We paid $49 million inclusive of legal fees in the quarter, to settle a longstanding matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government as previously announced. Single installment cash collections were $176 million in the quarter, up $46 million from the year-ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.04 billion, flat as reported and up 3% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations due to a higher level of single installment cash collections.","Separately, we issued $850 million in investment grade bonds, primarily to fund our acquisition of Veracode. We issued a five-year $500 million tranche at 3.6% and a 10-year $350 million tranche at 4.7%. We are very pleased with the terms and are comfortable with the tenor of our corporate debt. We ended Q4 with approximately $157 million in net debt. During the quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. Due to the acquisition of Veracode and the bond offering, we did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to resume our share repurchases in the near-term with the intention to generally at least offset dilution. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization.","Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31st, 2017. It includes the impact of the Veracode acquisition and includes the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes in March. No additional material acquisitions are assumed. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 3% as reported and to increase 3% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.12 billion to $4.17 billion. This guidance contemplates our expectation that the overall mainframe market will decline in the low single digits over the medium term, consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past.","We expect full year GAAP operating margin between 26% to 27% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 10% to 7% as reported, and to decrease 8% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.72. This includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense associated with our March 2017 bond offering.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 5% to 3% as reported and to decrease 4% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40. Again, this includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense from our bond offering, mentioned previously. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion. The incremental interest expense from the bond offering impacts CFFO by approximately $33 million.","Our cash flow from operations guidance includes our adoption of ASU 2016-09, titled Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting. The adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 requires us to present taxes paid in connection with employee stock within cash flows from financing activities, rather than payments within cash flows from operations. The adoption of this accounting standard will be presented retrospectively and is not expected to impact the year-over-year percentage change.","With regard to Q1, please keep in mind that we renewed a large system integrator in the June quarter of fiscal 2017. This creates a very difficult year-over-year compare that will be particularly evident in our Q1 renewal bookings and new sales. Additionally, the impact from the acquisitions and related integration expenses will be most impactful in the first two quarters of the year, particularly in Q1. For the full year, we expect the size of the portfolio to be renewed to be down in the high teens compared to the year ago period. Even excluding the impact of the large SI we renewed in Q1 last year, our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2018 is back-end loaded. We expect this to heavily influence the linearity of bookings throughout the year.","To provide an update on ASC 606, the upcoming revenue recognition standard, as you will see in our 10-K filing tomorrow, we expect this change in the revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our reported financial statements. Specifically, we expect that the point in time rather than ratable recognition of license revenue will increase the variability in our quarterly reported results. However, we do not expect that the change in standard will significantly impact the way in which we recognize revenue from maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. And we do not expect it will meaningfully impact customer billings or cash collections from customer billings. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASC 606 on cash tax payments.","In general, we do not expect the economic value of our transactions to change as a result of ASC 606. We plan to adopt ASC 606 in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we are continuing to evaluate the transition method we will use. As we work through the changes coming with ASC 606, we are also exploring ways in which we can improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business.","In summary, we are pleased with our performance in Q4 where we met or exceeded our expectations across most financial metrics. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of sustainable growth. With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Raimo Lenschow","Two if I may. First of all, Mike, can you talk a little bit about when you see a new sales perform better than renewals. That\u2019s my first and I have one quick follow up then.","Michael Gregoire","Sure. Well, thank you, Raimo. Actually for FY '17, if you exclude the mainframe capacity, new sales growth exceeded the growth in the renewal portfolio. And given our improved product portfolio, we believe new sales should be significantly better than the renewal portfolio this year in FY '18. I think that statement should be true on an organic basis as well.","Raimo Lenschow","Okay. Perfect. Really that sounds like you have turned a corner. And can I talk about the -- you mentioned the changes in the sales organization. I mean it's like enterprise commercial kind of seems to make a lot of sense. How much disruption should we get? Should we kind of expect from that or is it kind of all done and can you talk through that a little bit?","Michael Gregoire","Yes. I expect no disruption in it. The people who are covering accounts are covering the same accounts. We have moved some of the smaller accounts what we call commercial. And this has been something we have been working at for a couple of years as we have tried to improve the commercial segment. We finally felt coming out of Q3, Q4 performance that they were mature enough, had enough process and experience where they could service those customers. That coupled with the portfolio, as you know we have been rapidly moving towards more SaaS solution. Try and buy, lend and extend. Those solutions lend themselves well in those sales. And then strategically, as we know that our enterprise portfolio will relatively midterm, exceed the mainframe portfolio, we have to take into consideration our cost structure on sales and try to use a very expense sales force at a segment of the market that could easily be served by a broader sales force, is in the best interest for CA, both tactically and strategically.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matt Hedberg","Automic did a lot better than I think you guys had thought. I am curious, Mike, what drove that outperformance. Was it conservative assumptions or was it just a lot of broad net new sales that you saw in the quarter.","Michael Gregoire","Yes. I think it's a couple of things. First, a lot of net new [raw] [ph] sales couple with the fact it was their year-end, so their sales professionals have been working on deals and that all came together at the end of their quarter. And the secondly, customers that were evaluating multiple providers, the strength of the CA brand and ability to service customers on a global basis as well as the ability to link other products into their portfolio, gave then a strategic view into what the future could look like as they try to automate their whole infrastructure.","So I think it was a combination of those three things that gave a little bit of up performance but I definitely want to hand off a lot of congratulations to the Automic team. They really went after the quarter with a lot of gusto.","Matt Hedberg","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then Kieran, I am curious on 606. It sounds like we will see more tomorrow. I am curious though, can you provide a little bit more color on potentially the impact to reported revenue. I guess the license component. Anything you can kind of help us out with a little bit more color on that.","Kieran McGrath","I think, Matt, it's a little premature on that for me to start giving specifics on it. But as you can well expect, we are a business that has been very primarily ratable, very small amount of upfront revenue, you can see that within the SFO accounts that we have. So converting the license content which is obviously quite material in both the ES and mainframe business. We will add volatility in any one given quarter. We think it's more than [indiscernible] over time. The length of time, maybe somewhat debatable but I think that\u2019s what we are in the process of really sizing here. And what we are looking at -- are really looking for metrics that we will be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity in the business as we move through time. That said, when we pull back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect the cash markup from this, we don\u2019t see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to or contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business and we don\u2019t think it's right to go and impact the customers with changes that are being driven by accounting. And from what we can see right now, we don\u2019t think that true, fundamental economics are going to change although license in any given period will be more volatile.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John DiFucci","So guys, bookings were very strong. Even if you normalize for duration, I think bookings were up something in the double digits. Mike, you mentioned the strong renewals and strong lease sales and you also doubled the number of large deals. So I guess I have two questions. One, and I know your deals, like we try to model when they are supposed to renew. And I know that gets missed around a lot. So I am just curious, were there more deals that were signed early, more than normal. I know that happens every quarter. Did that happen this quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like your catching of new business to renewals is working really well and that\u2019s great. So how is progress in signing new deals outside of a renewal cycle, whether it's with existing customers or new customers?","Michael Gregoire","Sure. Well, first, we didn\u2019t naturally pull any deals forward in Q4, so that was pretty much standard practice, nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost everyone of our products either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our top eight new focus products. So those products are very attractive to our customer and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know, and having great products being sold in to, with those renewals. It was bigger than we probably anticipated but I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solution that how the solutions work together.","We also had uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is lend and expand. So you are going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we have ever had for net new clients. The size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the lend and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well?","Kieran McGrath","Just one other point. So, John, if you recall, in prior quarters we had advised that we thought the renewal portfolio for this year was going to be up in the high teens. In fact, we kind of [indiscernible] rounding, we actually ended up in the mid-teens. So I think that\u2019s pretty clear evidence that we really didn\u2019t see any unnatural pull forward of any significant amount of deals that we hadn't been forecasting. So that\u2019s clear. I think, Mike, you hit it right on the head, we are starting to see, especially with a lot of our SaaS businesses, we are seeing something like Blazemeter here, which is all done to digital sales. Just the volume is really exploding from that side of the business at once again is a very, relatively smaller price point.","Michael Gregoire","Is that helpful, John?","John DiFucci","Yes. That\u2019s really helpful, guys. And just one, I guess follow up, Mike. So is that part of what's giving you the confidence, from the first question, from Raimo's question about the new sales this year is just volume of some of the try to buy, try before you buy or lend and expand type strategy.","Michael Gregoire","Yes. Of that end, we have put four products, net new organic products in the market that generated over $50 million in sales in relatively short period of time. I have four new SaaS products that come out in the next, that are all organically built. That is right in the confines of our strategy, making our portfolio work a little bit closer together. So it's a combination of good sales execution and really strong products that seems to be coming together for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Due to no response we will go to the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Obviously, you got a stronger quarter about new sales and renewals and I appreciate the commentary that you guys gave on the renewal portfolio. Just wanted to dig into those. First, Mike, just in terms of the renewal rates that\u2019s you are seeing from a dollar perspective on the renewal side. Any sort of change, up or down, that you note there? And then also you mentioned that the renewals portfolio will be down this coming year and more backend loaded. I wonder if you can give us some more color in terms of just the waiting there for first half, second half.","Michael Gregoire","Sure. The renewal rate was pretty much the same that we have seen quarter-over-quarter. So no new changes there. Kieran has got his finger tightly on the pulse of the backlog and how the renewals are working, so I will let him answer that question.","Kieran McGrath","Sure. So as we think about, obviously we have our -- in the first quarter of this year, we have a pretty big difficult compare against a deal we had with an outsourcer in the first quarter of last year. So that\u2019s going to really make the renewals on the new sales a very difficult compare in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, I mean that starts to flatten out and even be up a little bit in the last part of the year. So for the whole of the year, as I said in my script, we are going to be down on a year-over-year basis in the high teens.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits","Two questions regarding acquisition. One, Mike, obviously this has been a very aggressive couple of years in terms of the dollar amount and [indiscernible]. 12 of the 300 million to 500 million bogie. So maybe if you could tell me how you are feeling at this point in terms of the -- next couple of years.","Michael Gregoire","Sure. Michael, you are breaking up a little bit. I think you are just saying how are we feeling now?","Kieran McGrath","I think you were asking about acquisitions, Michael.","Michael Turits","Yes. Sorry, headset malfunction there. Yes, acquisition were above, obviously $1.5 billion to $2 billion in last couple of years, above the $300 million to $500 million bogie, thoughts on the pace going forward?","Michael Gregoire","Sure. If I had my way in the world, what I would love to do is digest these acquisitions that we made. We are very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work and I have always preferred, given my choice to do smaller acquisitions, in the $50 million to $80 million range, that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products the scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engines. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t get to chose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example. That was a two year quoting period and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode which we have been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in a relatively near time frame to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity at properties like that, it's a price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute.","Now having said that, I think that our view on value is probably going to get a little tougher because we don\u2019t feel we need to be out in the market. Now if something that was extraordinary was to come along, we would like the flexibility to go ahead and do that. But right now, I would like to digest what we have and just keep our eyes wide open for small tuck-ins that fit our strategy and hope that nothing material hits the market that we are really interested in.","Michael Turits","Okay. And then you guys gave lots of help to us in terms of doing organic calculations. So really appreciate that. Just one, I don\u2019t think you necessarily gave on the current revenue backlog which I believe is up 6% constant currency. Was that roughly five points from acquisition, because obviously that\u2019s being going positive, something we are trying to closely monitor?","Michael Gregoire","Yes. So of the six points of constant currency, about half of it, three points was related to Veracode which as you know we closed on the absolute last day of the quarter and then Automic. And then the other portion, the other half was related to just the timing of the renewal portfolio that comes due here in fiscal '18, as well as the Q4 new sales.","Michael Turits","So you are saying it's three points only from acquisitions that\u2019s inorganic in that\u2019s six points.","Michael Gregoire","That\u2019s correct.","Michael Turits","Okay. Thanks. I guess, if I squeeze one in. So does that feel though, I mean you said there is some timing. I mean this has been a big deal to talk about, one you felt like that was turning up in a sustainable way. So are those timing issues suggesting that that is not the turn or you think it might be?","Michael Gregoire","You know I like to hit it straight down the middle with you guys. When the number was flat or slightly negative, I kept reminding you that as the renewal portfolio, there was a lot up for renewal in fiscal '17, that that would influence, in a negative way, the current backlog and similarly as we have a lot of activity stretching out over time, it kind of goes the other way. All that said, I am very happy where we ended the quarter from a position perspective on the revenue backlog.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Daniel Greenfield","Daniel Greenfield on for Kirk. Two quick questions. Mike, can you provide just a bit more color on the improvement in sales execution this quarter and just kind of why you believe that can continue into FY '18? And then Kieran, can you just remind us of the assumed impact from Automic and Veracode on revenue guidance for FY '18? And are you going to call out the contribution from these deals individually going forward or just the total impact on revenue and profitability? Thanks.","Michael Gregoire","Well, with respect to sales execution, I think it comes down to having great products in a business model that sales professionals understand and a marketing team that has done a much much better job being able to articulate not only the strategy of our company and each one of our segments, but how the products work as a single product focus, as well as how those products work together. So when we are talking to customers, they might only want to buy one product but they can see the vision of how these products work together. Continuous delivery, for example. You can buy just one product in continuous delivery but if you think about how you are going to evolve your digital footprint over time and build net new innovations and get up to market quickly, you can see as you are own internal processes improve, how CA products that work together with little to no integration cost, will streamline your ability to turn yourself into a software company.","So we kind of call this whole package together. The software factory and as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers are starting to envision their business in the context of being a software company and we kind of fit the mould really well there. So it's not any one thing. It's great sales execution supported by great product with a marketing team that\u2019s really helping tell, a much broader, more sophisticated story. And Kieran, maybe you can answer the backlog question.","Kieran McGrath","Yes. So we are to report the acquisitions in total, as we always do. You will be give a clear view of what the acquisitive versus organic contribution is on both the new sales and a revenue perspective. Right now, we are giving guidance for three to four points for the year. We think the acquisitions are going to be roughly worth about 4 points. The reason I am hedging a little bit is I only closed Veracode on the 31st. We have to do the valuation work and the whole of new impairment. While that work has to be done as we go through time, but we clearly call out the acquisitive nature in aggregate for both of those.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.","Abhey Lamba","Good execution there. So, Mike, when we are looking at your organic revenue growth this year, how sustainable is it in fiscal '18? I understand you made comments that we should see new sales growth better than your renewal, but your renewals are going to be declining in the high teens, the portfolio is going to be declining in the high teens. So are we modeling the new sales to grow on an organic basis in fiscal '18?","Michael Gregoire","Yes. I think when we take a look at new sales, we have more wind in our sales then we had in the past, especially on the organic piece. A lot of our new sales are land and expand and coming out of Q3 and Q4 with a lot of land deals, that gives us an opportunity to expand and that will all show up as organic. And with a lot of a new product introductions that we have coupled with this notion of getting these products to work together, we become much more competitive against single product companies, as we are starting to tell our story because at the end of the day, most of these companies are not thinking about just one product or solve one problem, they are trying to orchestrate a digital re-mastering of their business. And in order to do that, you are going to need multiple products, very few companies have multiple products that can work together as well as having those products in their portfolio. So we feel somewhat bullish that we are going to be able to get the organic growth engine moving and have that growing consistently. Kieran, maybe you would like to add to that based on some of the numbers you have been monitoring.","Kieran McGrath","So I guess, first of all, as you are probably aware, we don\u2019t normally usually guide on new sales as we go forward. However, as Mike has been describing, we think about organic performance, ES revenue actually grew organically in fiscal '17 by two points. The mainframe was down a point. So overall our product revenue was actually flat in '17 with mainframe down a point, and ES up two points. So we look forward to time here. Obviously, we expect the mainframe market is declining in the low single digits to continue our planning at that level of planning, but we would expect to move to a time here that ES will continue to exhibit organic growth.","Abhey Lamba","Got it. Thanks, Kieran. Absolutely, that's very helpful. Thanks for the additional color. Kieran, you talked about the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption. Can you quantify the impact on your cash flows in your guidance? Thanks.","Kieran McGrath","No. Because we are going to actually doing it retrospectively, there will be no changes in the year to year. It's a relatively small amount to begin with but we are going to restate '17 and '18, so there won't be any impact on year to year.","Abhey Lamba","So what will your fiscal '17 cash flow be in that accounting method?","Kieran McGrath","Honestly, I don\u2019t have it in front of me here right now. It's about $30 million. Yes. So my guys are telling me here, it's about $30 million.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","So I guess two questions. One similar to what Michael asked you on the revenue backlog. I think the billings backlog may have benefitted as well from the acquisition. Could you quantify what the impact was there from, I guess, Veracode and Automic.","Kieran McGrath","Right. So from an organic perspective, on the constant currency perspective in total, we are up 9%. The acquisitions contributed about two points to that 9%.","Walter Pritchard","And what about on the short-term?","Kieran McGrath","I am sorry, that was the short term number I was saying. The current is growing nine points, two points of that is related to the acquisitions.","Walter Pritchard","Okay. Great. And then just on, it looks like execution pretty much across the board was pretty good. The one area that I saw in the script, you said that Europe was up, I guess new business was up but you have the benefit I think of Automic, which is probably more biased to Europe. Was there execution issue or anything going on in Europe or was this just kind of normal quarter to quarter volatility in terms of your performance over there.","Michael Gregoire","Normal, mid-single digit Q4 sales growth in Europe. Automic was a large driver of the new sales growth but I think we haven't seen anything that was other than ordinary. I think we really like the southern region, both France and some of the south did better than what we expected.","Walter Pritchard","Okay. Got it. And then Kieran, are you going to disclose, I guess for Q4, what the non-recurring and to the extent it happens in Q1, what's the non-recurring related expenses were from the two acquisitions? I think those are in your OpEx.","Kieran McGrath","So I won't be disclosing specifics. I guess what I would say is that we did have some onetime deal related costs that took place in Q4. As we move into fiscal '18, what we will really be seeing is the impact of both the deferred revenue impairment, the acquisition integration cost, and quite frankly, the Veracode business that we purchased is a business that\u2019s losing money at this point in time. So for the year, we think it's going to be impactful to us. But most of that impact, quite frankly, in the first half of the year and more specifically in the first quarter, but I would say the one time transaction related deal costs are behind us and large and what we are really dealing with now are integration costs, deferred revenue impairment and just the normal business run.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Gregoire, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.","Michael Gregoire","Great. Well, thanks again for joining us this evening. I would like to leave you with a few partying comments. We definitely had a great Q4. We are really pleased with our execution and we are entering fiscal 2018 with solid momentum. That said, please keep in mind that the large system integrator renewal we signed in Q1 last year creates a very difficult compare in Q1 fiscal 2018. And that our recent acquisitions will be most impactful to our operating margins in the first half of fiscal; 2018, particularly in Q1, just as Kieran said. We have made some excellent progress over the last several years building a solid foundation from which we can grow. I am optimistic and I look forward to fiscal 2018 and beyond. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

You may begin.","Jonathan Doros","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks, and then we\u2019ll open the call up for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Wednesday, October 22 over the telephone and the Internet.

Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our third quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on December 15, 2014. Before I turn the call over, I\u2019d like to highlight that for modeling purposes, our year-over-year currency headwind on revenue guidance is expected to be roughly 1%.","So with that let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael P. Gregoire","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter performance demonstrates continued progress in executing against our strategy. Total second quarter new sales accelerated to mid single digit growth year-over-year from flat year-over-year performance in the first quarter. I am pleased to see within these sales, enterprise solutions of new sales grew in the low teens year-over-year compared with mid single digit growth year-over-year last quarter. A strong indicator of both the value of our product offerings and the continued traction of our new sales execution model.","Furthermore, we again delivered solid performance with respect to our renewals and maintained disciplined operating expense management. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us to achieve our medium-term goal of low single-digit revenue growth, I believe we are clearly gaining traction.","We have a very strong market opportunity, a set of offerings that will help our customers seize the potential of the Application Economy where software and application development have become the core of our customer\u2019s business strategy. Moreover, the speed and quality at which the business line demands new applications is increasing exponentially. CA Technologies is well positioned as a heterogeneous partner for many enterprises as they plan, develop, manage and secure these applications across platforms.","Let me provide a more detailed update on each component of our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution, and increase our velocity. First, in product development, we are focused not only on organically developed solutions in our three core product pillars of management cloud, DevOps, and security, but we are also ensuring that we develop software in the most efficient manner with our customers\u2019 needs in mind. Over the last few months, we continued to improve our efficiency within development by shifting more resources to higher ROI opportunities and better position us to achieve our medium-term targets.","Within our product strategy, Management Cloud is an area where we are developing and delivering differentiated solutions. With the explosion of IT assets across the enterprise and into the cloud, the management of IT assets is crucial to our customers\u2019 success. Our Management Cloud solutions enable our customers to transform IT from a cost center to a business enabler.","Last quarter, we discussed the launch of our cloud service management solution, which we believe has the best speed to value in the market today. During Q2, we witnessed some initial success with numerous wins, including a seven figure deal with TriZetto, a world-class healthcare IT solutions and services provider. I am also encouraged by the product road map the team has planned for Cloud Service Management, and I look forward to updating you as we gain further traction with this product.","I\u2019d also like to highlight our API management business, which demonstrated strong performance during the quarter both with new clients and within our traditional customer base. During the second quarter our API management new sales more than doubled year-over-year and exceeded our internal plans.","APIs are becoming the next generation middleware of how applications securely connect both within a company\u2019s private cloud as well as in the public cloud. For example, a large UK financial services integrator signed a multi-million dollar transaction to leverage our API management solution to build a cloud based mobile platform that allows third party financial service offerings, such as mortgage and insurance.","Our API Management Solutions continue to gain mindshare. For example, in the Forrester API Management Solutions wave released this past September, CA\u2019s API management solution was once again cited as a leader. The API management market is evolving beyond its traditional use case, and we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of this.","To further accelerate our work in this space, we created a distinct API team with a dedicated executive leader. Another area which we are developing and delivering differentiated solutions is DevOps, one of the largest market opportunities. Software applications are on the front lines, with consumers and employees expecting and demanding a flawless and constantly improving experience.","Speed to market and quality performance of applications with a DevOps approach are table stakes. Specifically, DevOps is a methodology that structures collaboration between the development group and operations to accelerate software and application delivery. This is the future of enterprise software development, and we are focusing our investment to drive leadership in this space. We have a complete portfolio of solutions and expertise across the entire application lifecycle spanning the virtualization of development environments, automating the application release cycle, and monitoring the applications as well as the underlying infrastructure. We do all of this while continuously sharing those analytics throughout the delivery cycle.","Service virtualization is a major component of a successful DevOps approach to software development. Our service virtualization solution\u2019s performance this quarter was driven by numerous large follow-on wins from previous smaller proof of concepts or departmental transactions. To that point, awareness and evangelizing the rapid ROI benefits from service virtualization is a driving factor in future adoption. As demonstrated this quarter, our strategy is to land with a smaller deal and prove the value to the customer before attempting a large enterprise-wide sale. To further develop awareness around service virtualization, we will be launching a freemium offering of the solution at CA World.","Another essential piece of DevOps is understanding mobile environments. As I said earlier, we live in an application economy. From retail banking to reading the news, everything is connected by mobile based applications. In this app-driven world, your customers are far more likely to connect with your brand through a software application than a live person. Now the ultimate priority becomes delivering a superior user experience. At CA World in November, you will hear us highlight the first component of our mobile DevOps solution that provides mobile application performance analytics. This is a new organically developed product. We already have several customers in beta, and we are excited about the opportunity.","Our major goals within DevOps and throughout all of development include making our products easy to deploy and use, and having well-articulated product roadmaps. A further example of this is our Application Performance Management Solution.","Our team improved the product functionality, resulting in easier configurations for our new applications and a better overall user experience. We are already seeing the positive impact, as our APM new sales increased year-over-year. In addition, during Q2, we closed a multimillion dollar win at one of the world\u2019s largest consumer entertainment enterprises.","Our APM solution beat out AppDynamics, New Relic, and Compuware to monitor the end to end experience of their on-line gaming platform. At CA World we will further highlight our APM product strategy, which we\u2019ll build upon our current success with enhancements such as support for new software development languages and improved end to end mobile transaction monitoring.","Finally, let\u2019s touch on our security solutions. In today\u2019s interconnected digital world, a company\u2019s brand can be promoted with a 140-character endorsement and equally tarnished within seconds with a malicious breach. The days of only protecting the perimeter keeping people out are over. Today it\u2019s about identity management, and creating a secure, but frictionless environment where end users feel confident and unobstructed to conduct business. Our identity management suite of solutions authenticates and controls access to the world\u2019s most sensitive data. This is an area where I believe with the right brand positioning and marketing we can meaningfully accelerate our growth.","Turning now to the second component of our strategy, I\u2019ll walk you through how we are improving market awareness and sales execution. There are two major areas of focus in our marketing strategy: brand awareness and demand generation. First, brand awareness. As I said earlier, in a digital world your brand is an extension of the service quality you deliver, not only for our customers, but also for CA. As our new Business Rewritten by Software campaign rolls out, we are using modern analytic and measurement tools to understand our customers and prospects needs more effectively. Furthermore, at CA World, you will see customers such as Facebook, Nike, and Samsung join our executives on stage to discuss how CA\u2019s software enables them to gain a competitive advantage.","Now, onto demand generation. Getting our technology in the hands of end users is critical to delivering the kind of buying experience prospects and customers need, want and expect. Freemium and try and buy offerings are important components of modern demand generation. Our freemium infrastructure management Snap offering continued to gain traction as a demand generation engine, with successful conversions to our commercial offering.","In addition, with only a quarter under its belt, the trial version of Cloud Service Management influenced several sales during the quarter. I am also excited about the opportunities created by the freemium service virtualization offering that I mentioned earlier, as well as other try and buy offerings that are planned over the next 12 months.","Our sales execution during the quarter was mixed by both geo and customer segmentation. North America overall performed in line with our expectations. In light of a challenging macro environment in EMEA, our performance in that region was encouraging. EMEA enterprise solutions new sales grew year-over-year and we are seeing signs of continued improvement in sales outside of our platinum accounts.","For example, we had a win with a large French airline that faced a competitive challenge to increase the speed and stability of application updates to their new mobile booking system. Traditional means of software testing couldn\u2019t meet the businesses line\u2019s requirements, but our service virtualization solution successfully shortened the testing cycles and improved performance readiness.","Our Latin American performance was below expectations, mainly due to continued macro related headwinds in Brazil. However, we did not see evidence of competitive losses.","From a sales segmentation basis, our platinum accounts again exhibited solid performance overall, with healthy attach rates of new sales to renewals. Our named and growth accounts are making progress as demonstrated by the improvement in that team\u2019s close rates and pipelines. For example, during the quarter, we closed a seven figure API management deal with a large U.S. based insurer that previously was not a large account for CA.","The account team nurtured the relationship and effected a transaction that is a key component of this company\u2019s customer facing mobile strategy. There are ample opportunities to further expand this relationship and for this customer to become a platinum account. This transaction is a prime example of why it\u2019s important to have a hard line separation between our platinum accounts and our named and growth teams. I am encouraged by the progress the named and growth teams are making improving sales participation rates and increasing the quality of the transactions in the pipeline.","Finally, I will touch on velocity. When you are in a dynamic industry such as software, human capital is an asset, which propels your company towards achieving its goals. The stronger the talent, the faster you hit your objectives. Accordingly, I am a strong believer that A players hire A players. Over the last year, we have upgraded the talent not only at the executive level, but also elevated the leadership acumen throughout our major business units, sales, and other support functions. Combined with the depth of talent that exists across CA, and our renewed focus on organic development, we have a strong team focused on clear goals.","On balance, we made good progress this quarter on multiple fronts. We will continue to step up our pace and look to drive the type of meaningful progress needed to build the modern and even more competitive software company. Our customers require deep expertise and integrated solutions to help them navigate an increasingly complex, software-driven business environment. CA is well positioned in this space and we are seeing strong signs that our messaging and software are gaining traction with customers.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you.","Richard Beckert","","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I\u2019m going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. As many of you are aware, the dollar has strengthened substantially during the last quarter against most major currencies. During Q2, currency had a negative 1% impact on total revenue, from the time we provided guidance last quarter.","Our Q2 total revenue was $1.08 billion and was down 3%, mainframe was down 3%, enterprise solutions declined 2%, and services declined 8%. On an as reported basis, Q2 renewals were down approximately low 20s, which was in line with our expectations. Our renewal bookings increased and decreased year-over-year and can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. The renewal yield during the quarter was in the low 90s. We continue to expect fiscal 2015 renewals to be down high-single digits year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2014, and flat year-over-year excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q3 of fiscal 2014. We expect Q3 renewals to be down year-over-year, but up year-over-year in Q4.","Despite renewal bookings being down year-over-year, our Q2 as reported total new product and capacity sales were up mid-single digits. As Mike stated, our new sales growth year-over-year benefited from a healthy attach rate to renewals, sales to platinum accounts outside of the renewal opportunity, and initial progress selling into our named and growth accounts. In our mainframe segment, mainframe new sales including new product and capacity were down in the low 20s, as reported, but in line with historical mainframe renewal attach rates. Our mainframe new product sales and capacity growth can vary on a quarterly basis. We expect our mainframe revenue growth to be flat to down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.","Enterprise solutions\u2019 new product sales were up low teens, as reported. I am encouraged by our enterprise solutions performance. However, we are maintaining modest expectations for enterprise solution\u2019s full-year growth, given tougher second half year-over-year compares and an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment. Services revenue during the quarter decreased 8%. The primary driver of the decline is due to as deemphasizing non-core government services subcontracting engagements as they are not directly related to our software sales. We\u2019re refocusing on services engagements that drive new product sales. As we outlined last quarter, we currently expect professional services revenue to decrease more than total revenue during fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.","Current revenue backlog was down 1% and in line with our expectations. As I have said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90\u2019s renewal rate.","Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 40% and GAAP operating margin was 30%. Our segment operating margin was 62% for mainframe solutions, 13% for enterprise solutions, and 2% for services. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 30% and our GAAP tax rate was 24%. Our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, down 22% year-over-year. The decrease in our non-GAAP EPS is mainly driven by a lower non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.53, down 4% year-over-year. Our Q2 CFFO was $66 million. Single installment cash payments were $167 million and up year-over-year. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.29 billion in net cash. During the second quarter, we paid $111 million in dividends. During Q3, we will pay off $500 million of senior notes due in December 2014.","Turning to guidance, updated guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2014. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full-year revenue guidance of approximately 1% as of September 30th rates. Total revenue is still expected to be in a range of negative 2% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.27 billion to $4.33 billion.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 20% to minus 18% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 21% to minus 19%. This reflects an approximate 20% headwind from taxes returning to its historical rate in fiscal 2015. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.47.","GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is still expected to be in the range of minus 12% to minus 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.73 to $1.80. Cash flow from operations is still expected to increase 5% to 12% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.01 billion to $1.08 billion, which includes an approximate $70 million cash outflow related to our fiscal 2014 rebalancing program.","Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlining this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 30%. We expect a full-year GAAP operating margin of 27%, a decrease of one point from previous guidance, and we still expect a full-year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. In addition to normal operating expense seasonality, we expect an incremental spend related to CA World to occur in our third quarter.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 436 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 440 million shares.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Jonathan, and we will take your questions.","Jonathan Doros","Thank you, Rich. As the operator is polling for questions, I would like to inform you that during our fiscal Q3, CA Technologies will be presenting at the UBS, NASDAQ, Credit Suisse, and Barclays Technology conferences. In addition, mark your calendars for CA World in Las Vegas on November 9 through the 12. We will be hosting an investor track at CA World on Monday November 10. Please visit investor.ca.com for additional information about registration. In the interest of time, please limit yourself to two questions. All right, operator please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Stefan Putyera \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys, this is Stefan in for Raimo. Thanks for taking my question. First, it\u2019s nice to see another quarter of solid new sales performance in enterprise solution. Can you guys provide a little bit more color on what drove performance in that segment this quarter?","Michael P. Gregoire","Yes. Thank you, Stefan. It\u2019s Mike. I would put it into a couple of different categories, but relatively broad. First of all, from a sales perspective, the sales model that we adopted last April, what we\u2019re doing a hard line separation between our largest customers in the platinum and growth is definitely paying off because the sales professionals in those different groups are very well aware and trained in the specifics of the products that we\u2019re trying to sell.","Coupled with that, we\u2019ve been very specific of what products we sell to what markets. So I think that segmentation and the ability of that sales force to deeply understand those products and be specialist have made them more competitive.","Secondly, I think the portfolio of products that we\u2019re bringing into market have really improved and we see products that are growing on an average I have four or five of our fastest growing products growing at north of 20%. We have a couple of products that we just introduced into the market relatively a short-time ago that are in the 80% to 100% growth. So when it comes down to it, sales people that really understand the markets that they\u2019re competing and really understand their customers coupled with products that are highly differentiated. I would say that that slide we have a starting to move for us and the more that we focused on that and continue to replicate that I think the more predictable our results will be with respect to consisting growth over time.","Stefan Putyera \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Got it. And then, if I could sneak in one more on the SaaS products specifically, you\u2019ve talked about that portfolio doing well and it\u2019s nice to see the number of products there on quickly extending. Can you talk a little bit about what the customer adoption has been to those offerings and kind of how we should think about portfolio evolving over in the next couple of quarters?","Michael P. Gregoire","We have 11 SaaS products in the market today, some of them are relatively new, the newest one being Cloud Service management which has really only been in the market for a relatively short period of time. But if you take a look at it just as last quarter, very sophisticated customer, TriZetto had a multi \u2013 had a seven figure deal with us. And we\u2019re continuing to see that pipeline grow, which is driven by the fact that it\u2019s a try and buy play.","Much like we did with Nimsoft Monitor Snap, we have almost 10,000 downloads of Nimsoft Monitor Snap, which is once again driven multiple seven figure deals or smaller deals, but as they get $200,000 and $250,000 deal in place and they start buying more capacity, it drives down our cost of sale and also shows up in the overall sales picture. So we\u2019re continuing to drive all of these products, but more importantly even on the perpetual side of the house, the way we build our products in a pure agile fashion is taking into consideration of the best attributes of building SaaS products and making sure those attributes are built into our perpetual products.","So we\u2019re seeing the benefits of SaaS engineering driven across all of ESTG. And our mainframe group is also equally confident in the agile development, when you see their scrums they have customers from all over the world participating in their scrums. And I\u2019d say that the mainframe team is equally if not the best agile performance engineering team we\u2019ve got in the company.","Stefan Putyera \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Got it. And then if I just could sneak in on more. On the professional services on site, can you guys \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I missed this on the prepared remarks before, can you talk a little bit about what is happening in that specific segment and why we\u2019re expecting it to be down more this year?","Michael P. Gregoire","Yes, I think that falls into once again none of these are just a one answer question, but I would put it into the following tiers ranked appropriately. Number one is our whole mantra and we\u2019ve had that for 18 months is build applications that are easier to use, easier to install, and lower cost of ownership. If you\u2019re doing a good job of the engineering of the product, the amount of effort and hours spent in professional services to get that customer up and running into value, absolutely have to come down. And as you start seeing these new sales and these products getting into the market that\u2019s been a less requirement for professional services.","Secondly, we\u2019re a software company. We\u2019re not a professional services company. And to the extent that we have professional services in our company that drove revenue but we\u2019re not associated with our software, we\u2019re definitely deemphasizing that type of business. And our professional services are focused solely on the customer success of our customers with our software.","So you\u2019re going to see that come down a little bit. And then lastly is just the focus we\u2019ve had over the last two years on product quality that that puts us in a situation where our professional services are not out trying to help customers understand how our product works because it\u2019s much, much easier. And if you take a look at it from this quarter to focus on selling net new software, the bookings are up for services this quarter.","So I think that works in conjunction for how we want to run the company. Professional services are there to help customers to go live and have great customer experience and show up with a high net promoter score.","Stefan Putyera \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Got it. Thank you guys so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives of Freid Billings. Your line is now open.","Daniel Ives \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, Inc.","Yes, thanks. My question is if you look out over, you know, call it the next two, three quarters, I mean what do you view as the biggest opportunity both from a product and addressable market? And then on the other side, what do you think the biggest challenges for you guys as you try to pursue growth?","Michael P. Gregoire","Sure, the biggest opportunities for us are in three very large business segments. Management Cloud and that includes all of our product and portfolio management. We just launched our Cloud Services product for service management, which is a very, very big market and open to competition. And we take a look at what\u2019s happening in DevOps.","I think we are the industry leader in DevOps with the most comprehensive solution when you look from how you go after service virtualization to the whole concept of release management and pulling in all of the processes that affect getting applications out to market very quickly. I mean that is number one and just about every customer I talked to [mind] (ph). And then lastly, something that everybody should be very aware of is security. So when you take a look at those three big markets and the products that we\u2019re putting into those markets and the products that we have that exists in those markets. I like our positioning.","Daniel Ives \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, Inc.","And in terms of just \u2013 I mean even sort of tuck-in acquisitions versus organic, how should we sort of think about that in terms of those areas? Thanks.","Michael P. Gregoire","Our primary focus and I\u2019ve been dogmatic about this since I\u2019ve been CEO of CA is we\u2019re a software company and we have this and we\u2019ll have great software built by great engineers. So my number one thing when I wake up in the morning is organic engineering and given the choice of build versus buy, all things being equal. I absolutely prefer to build.","Now, on the other hand is we also are a very large multi-national company with a great and secured balance sheet. If there were opportunities for us to improve our lot in life with an acquisition, we would definitely want to take advantage of it. Coupled with that is I now feel I\u2019ve got a very strong management team that we would be able to handle a variety of different acquisitions.","So if the market was conducive to being able to buy something, coupled with the fact that I felt that buying it would have a better financial return in the medium to long-term building it, we are definitely open to that. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, it\u2019s actually Jim on for Walter here. Are you guys on the debt pay down that\u2019s coming in the $500 million? Are you guys issuing new debt to pay down or just using cash? I\u2019m just kind of trying to understand why wouldn\u2019t you just get a new offering on the table given the rates?","Richard Beckert","Yes. So, this is Rich. How are you Jim? Right now, we planned on paying off that $500 million in the quarter. We have plenty of cash onshore and we also as you know, we generate cash both onshore and get a royalty back moving forward, which allows us to do our buybacks, our dividend, and any acquisitions that we feel the need to do. So we don\u2019t see the need to carry the incremental interest on that $500 million. We\u2019re very comfortable with where we are in our debt position.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then just switching gears here a little bit. Can you guys talk about the freemium strategy a little bit more, how is this actually leading to actual conversion from free to pay and what\u2019s the penetration there?","Richard Beckert","Sure. Today is modern software age, most company \u2013 most customers especially from an infrastructure perspective, they\u2019re very technical. And before they even bring you into an RFI or RFP, they\u2019ve already got a vision of what your product can and cannot do. So if you are not in a situation where you can give them something that they can play with that is easy to use, easily downloadable, and they can get an imagery of how that software would work in their environment. I think you\u2019re at a competitive disadvantage.","So pretty much all of our products that we can, we\u2019re trying to put into a freemium space, and that\u2019s primarily a lead generation tool. And when we take a look at our hit rate and the kind of information that we get when customers are using the product, our cost of sales dramatically goes down, our predictability for what quarter that particular release or that particular deal will close become much, much better. At the end of the day, I think that that\u2019s going to be table stakes across the software industry in general and for sure in the infrastructure space.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","James Wesman \u2013 Raymond James","Hi guys, good afternoon. It\u2019s James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Mike, I apologize if you guys went through as we\u2019ve been hopping around on calls, but I know you guys had mentioned that enterprise solutions new products sales had grown in the low teens. Could you just expand on that and give us some color on what did particularly well in the quarter?","Michael P. Gregoire","","We had a number of products do well. So it wasn\u2019t just one product that grabbed the limelight for us. The ones that did extraordinarily well would be a service virtualization our Layer 7 acquisition that we did about a year and half ago. We added an incredible amount of organic engineering on to that and it\u2019s really starting to payoff. Nimsoft Monitor had a very nice quarter and we still did a nice in some of the flagship products, APM had a very strong quarter. And so it is our unified infrastructure management. So I would say those are the top five products across the portfolio, all grew in the high 20s.","James Wesman \u2013 Raymond James","All right. And then just a follow-up, IBM has had some struggles with their mainframe hardware sales recently. Are you finding that\u2019s having an effect on your business?","Michael P. Gregoire","It hasn\u2019t affected us other than it\u2019s in general a declining software market for the mainframe by we\u2019ve always said between minus 1% to minus 3% and nothing has changed with respect to our renewal portfolio. Our attach rates on renewals have been traditionally what it was in the past. So it\u2019s a very stable business throwing off an awful lot of cash, giving us a great opportunity to talk to customers about how they look at the mainframe as well as areas where if they want to get off the mainframe and or products that they could use that in our enterprise group, it\u2019s a great cross-sell opportunity for us.","James Wesman \u2013 Raymond James","Great. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein & Co. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hey, this is (indiscernible) for Mark today. Just a quick question on margins, going forward, you notice that seasonally you guys are kind of weak towards the end of the year. Do you think there is any chance of potential weakness towards the end of the year in operating margins and kind of tagging along on that is how should we think about the mix shift in cost that you guys have going forward, maybe out a year? Could you shed some color on that? Thanks.","Michael P. Gregoire","So first of all, we\u2019re very comfortable with the 37% margin. Through the first half, we\u2019re sitting at a 40% for the first two quarters. There will be seasonality associated with things like commissions and we are still hiring people back from the rebalancing and remember in Q3 we will have CA World which is a big marketing expense. But in general, it is \u2013 we\u2019re very comfortable where we are, so we don\u2019t see the margin pressure that you just described. Going forward, we\u2019ve been very systematic with the way.","Mike described our transition from some of our older product and technology to the newer product technology. And over the last couple of years, you saw us readdress how we do development, how we do sales, the whole G&A functions. So we\u2019re in line and we\u2019re very much able to absorb the SaaS play as that comes into our total company. So just like we said back in May, we\u2019re comfortable with where we are at margins.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Matthew Williams \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Hi guys. This is Matt Williams in for Kirk. I appreciate you guys for taking the question. Just one on the Management Cloud and some of \u2013 it sounded like there is some good initial traction there. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you guys are seeing in the market it seems like it\u2019s a very competitive area right now. And I\u2019m just curious to see sort of what you\u2019re seeing in the market and how you guys are differentiating yourself there?","Michael P. Gregoire","Sure. Well, you don\u2019t want to go to a market that has no competition because that means it\u2019s usually not much of a market. So it\u2019s a big market, it is very competitive, and you have to work on differentiation. When we took a look at that market, one of the things that we saw that was needed in that market is ease of use.","So we have a brand new modern platform built on a modern architecture that requires no coding for integration coupled with that we are absolutely in the infrastructure management and application management business which kicks off a lot of issues with respect to service management. And to the extent that we can integrate our products and get into the whole idea of predictive analytics where we can create the trouble tickets immediately without human intervention.","We think we\u2019re the only vendor in town that has the ability to do that. So we\u2019re trying to think of what our customers are going to want on this mantra of easy to use, easy to integrate, easy to install and try to get as much of the use of predictive analytics into the software. And when you\u2019re doing that you need to repository in which you can report and act on it and that\u2019s a service management solution.","So great user interface, no programming required for integrations, easy to download and try and buy. And I think we\u2019ve hit a price in the market that is a little bit unique as well. And I think that\u2019s a market that needs another competitor with the unique offering.","Matthew Williams \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Great. I appreciate the color. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing now further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to John Doros for any closing remarks.","Jonathan Doros","Great, well thank you very much all. In closing, I just want to thank everyone for their time tonight. There is a lot of folks reporting and I also want to thank you for the time that you take to understand the work we\u2019re doing to drive customer and shareholder value. We\u2019re going to be very vocal over the next quarter. Rich, John and I are going to be out in the market, look forward to seeing you in some of the conferences and have a great evening on behalf of all of CA.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks and then we will open the call up for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Tuesday, January 26th over the telephone and the Internet.

Let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year in constant currency unless otherwise indicated.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Gregoire","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that both Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe new sales performed better than expected in the third quarter. Both revenue and new sales outperformed expectations, with strong new sales growth for the second consecutive quarter. Total new sales were up just over 10% year-over-year following an exceptionally strong second quarter.","Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the high single digits year-over-year. Mainframe new sales increased in the mid teens year-over-year. It marks the third consecutive quarter of Enterprise Solutions new sales growth and the second consecutive quarter of Mainframe new sales growth. This is a reflection of our on\u00adgoing efforts to improve product competitiveness as well as sales effectiveness and consistency.","Relative to our expectations, third quarter results benefitted from the combination of very strong performance from recent acquisitions, a higher level of renewal bookings growth that came at a healthy attach rate, and better than expected sales execution.","Looking to our fourth quarter and into the next fiscal year, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in our sales and product execution. I believe we are well positioned to achieve our FY '16 and medium term guidance. As conveyed in November, we expect our upcoming FY '17 to be the year CA crosses into sustained, albeit initially modest revenue growth. Our improved confidence in the business is reflected in the accelerated share repurchase, which essentially completed the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization, the additional $750 million share repurchase authorization and our intent to increase the dividend in FY '17, subject to quarterly Board approval.","We remain committed to our three-pronged capital allocation strategy of returning capital to shareholders with an ongoing share repurchase program and one of the highest dividend payouts in the industry while continuing to invest in our future growth. Importantly, we are investing in innovation that matters. From containers and data analytics to big data, Open Source, and Agile, we are making investments to ensure that CA solutions are meaningful and compelling and can drive growth for years to come. In some cases, this investment will result in net new products and in other cases it will result in meaningful feature enhancements to existing product suites that will make CA solutions even more competitive in the marketplace.","Many of you experienced this in November at CA World, which was a banner event. It was a tremendous opportunity for customers, partners, media and analysts to see the full breadth and power of the CA brand and portfolio. The pendulum is swinging towards the desire to reduce complexity and consolidate around full suite solutions suppliers with global service. Consequently, customers increasingly find CA more attractive than point product vendors.","All of the key CA World metrics were up year-over-year, including overall attendance, customer engagement, pipeline generation, and broad visibility across both traditional and social media outlets. More specifically, the number of customer accounts represented at CA World increased in the mid-20s and our social media presence nearly doubled year-over-year. These improvements reflect the increasing engagement of CA's traditional Platinum customers as well as the broadening impact the Named and Partner business is having on our ability to address growth opportunities.","At CA World, we launched four net new, organically developed products and dozens of new releases and product enhancements. CA's organic engineering engine continues to improve and drive innovation. We also demonstrated a number of innovation sneak-peeks showcasing products currently in development. These innovations extend CA's ability to enable customers to embrace and benefit from the rapidly emerging application economy. They represent CA's platform agnostic strategy of enabling customers to develop, manage, and secure increasingly complex IT environments. Regardless of whether the app resides in the cloud or on a mainframe or whether it\u2019s on-demand or on-prem.","As the time between major waves of innovation continues to compress, it is increasingly critical for global enterprises to be more agile. Agile is the way they develop and Agile is the way they think about their business models and strategy. The accelerating frequency and amplitude of the waves of innovation provide game changing opportunities for those with vision and the ability to execute. Agile is not just a prop or methodology that CA is evangelizing and selling.","It is a discipline and modus operandi that we are broadly embracing internally. We've already migrated 85% of CA's projects to the CA Agile Central platform, with the balance expected to be completed by the end of this fiscal year. I fully expect this will accelerate our pace of internal innovation and product development and result in more high quality, relevant products.","Leading enterprises all around the world are architecting their digital transformations. One of our customers, General Electric, aspires to be the leader in the industrial Internet and expects to be a Top 10 software company by 2020. Tangible proof that every company is becoming a software company. The momentum driving change with some of the most storied companies in the world is palpable. The opportunities for CA to help customers embrace the application economy are seemingly endless.","Now, I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. In the Agile Management pillar, formerly Management Cloud, I am very happy to report that Rally continues to exceed our expectations. Seat expansions within the large enterprise customers and improvement in seat retention positively impacted performance. Customer seat count retention, or what CA refers to as renewals, is the best it's been since before Rally went public in early 2013. This is indicative of our customer's view of CA Agile Central as a strategic partner and trusted advisor, rather than just a software tool.","It highlights the success of our land-and-expand strategy as initial deployments within enterprises grow exponentially. In the quarter, Barclays, which had been using Rally within just one of its North American divisions, executed a large upgrade to more broadly embrace Agile across its North American and European operations. Thousands of additional seats were signed in this competitive win. Another notable win was with a regional local exchange carrier that upgraded to thousands of seats to standardize on CA Agile Central across the enterprise.","Also within the Agile Management pillar, I'm pleased to note that ITBM, or IT Business Management, increased new sales for the third consecutive quarter. Within ITBM, CA Project & Portfolio Management SaaS again grew new sales, marking its third consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year growth. In the quarter, CA was recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Integrated IT Portfolio Analysis Applications. In Q3, we had a major win with an American multinational conglomerate. This win was the result of a very competitive campaign involving CA Project & Portfolio Management SaaS. We are seeing consolidation in the market as customers gravitate towards stable and proven vendors with the size and scale to support large enterprise deployments.","Moving to DevOps, API Management continues to be a bright spot, consistently posting strong growth rates. The third quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit or better year-over-year new sales growth. The opportunity here is vast and we are typically addressing whitespace or replacing homegrown solutions. We launched three new products and enhancements at CA World. CA Live API Creator lets customers rapidly create API connectors from database sources, like Mongo DB and Oracle SQL databases. What used to take developers three to four weeks to create an API can now be done in fewer than five clicks.","CA Mobile App Services provides core backend services for building end-to-end enterprise mobile applications. And, CA API Management SaaS enables customers to combine the convenience of Cloud SaaS with enterprise level security. Demand for CA API Management is expansive. The business unit acquired more than 50 new customers in Q3. New customers to CA API Management included one of the largest insurance companies in the world as well as a financial services technology company. The former is standardizing multiple divisions on CA API Management and the latter is standardizing on CA API Management enterprise wide.","While initial deployments are exciting, major capacity expansions are proof points of our successful land and expand strategy. Notable capacity expansion deals include a win with a leading global payments company. This customer is deploying CA API Management as the standard for a variety of application projects. And, due to CA's strong mobile and authentication use cases, a major U.S. airline is employing CA API Management to build its B2B environment and dotcom property.","Our security business had an outstanding third quarter, with new sales up over 45% year-over-ear. The acquisition of Xceedium, which has provided a tremendous lift to our Privileged Access Management product portfolio, is driving considerable momentum in our Security group and has far exceeded our expectations. In the quarter, we executed one of the largest deals for the Security group in recent history, led by Privileged Access Management. We closed a competitive win at a federal agency which is extending from a single use case to an expansion throughout their entire environment. The streamlined capabilities of CA Privileged Access Management is enabling this customer to leverage its existing Public Key Infrastructure, smartcard and strong authentication solution of privileged user controls and auditing.","Another highlight was the competitive win with an iconic American multinational mass media conglomerate. CA Privileged Access Manager was chosen to protect the brand and its intellectual property. It needed a standards based solution that could easily integrate with a broad set of applications and systems. CA offered a comprehensive solution that allows the customer to secure their on-premise and SaaS based applications and systems to ensure it can effectively control privileged users. Now the brand and its IP are protected against both internal and external threats.","In the quarter, we announced the new release of CA Identity Suite. New features include, an application launch pad so that users can access any web application on the go\u037e easy streamlined access\u037e direct account entitlement management\u037e and integrated advanced authentication. As one of our large customers, Florida Blue Cross and Blue Shield recently highlighted, CA makes identity management easy so that any employee can understand it. We help our customers manage and govern the access of its employees, which is critical to improving productivity, maintaining security, and protecting data.","I am pleased that what we are working on from a product perspective is beginning to bear fruit and our value proposition and messaging is resonating with customers. Our performance this quarter is evidence that the transformation into a modern sales organization is demonstrating increasingly consistent, solid performance. For the third consecutive quarter, our combined Named and Growth sales teams delivered healthy growth. And, in the third quarter, our pipeline conversion rates and win rates improved, our sales cycles shortened and our average deal size increased. I am pleased with the team's consistently improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity.","Overall, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance which reflects the consistent improvement in our execution. We feel that we are near an inflection point in the business. That said, we know there is still work to be done to grow at a rate that is representative of CA's true potential.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you.","Rich Beckert","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","The year-over-year strength in the dollar continues to be a headwind to both our results and our guidance. Our Q3 total revenue was $1.034 and was down 1%. Enterprise Solutions increased 3%, Mainframe Solutions decreased 2% and Services decreased 4%. Q3 renewals were up approximately 30% in constant currency and in the low 20s as reported. The higher level of renewal bookings was driven by earlier than expected closing of some renewal transactions originally expected outside of Q3, as well as an increase in the average duration. Importantly, attach rates to these renewals were healthy.","Renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-80s. The lower than historical average renewal yield was a result of a large North American financial services customer transitioning to an application that requires fewer of our products to support. This transition was expected and previously factored into our fiscal year and medium-term guidance and expectations related to our Mainframe business. Excluding this transaction, our renewal yield was in the low-90s.","We expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 30% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up in the mid 20s range as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal that occurred in the second quarter, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-to high-single digits, and flat to up low-single digits, as reported. Q3 total new product and capacity sales were up just over 10% in constant currency and up mid-single digits as reported.","The year-over-year increase was due to very strong performance from recent acquisitions, a higher level of renewal bookings growth with a healthy attach rate as well as solid sales execution also had a positive effect. The outperformance in Q3 relative to our expectations have smoothed that lumpiness we had expected between Q3 and Q4 due to movement in the renewal portfolio.","The Rally acquisition continues to perform well, with seat expansions within large enterprises and improvements in seat retention positively impacting performance. Total paid seats under contract at the end of Q3 increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We define a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. As a reminder, we plan to phase out this metric as paid seat growth is not expected to be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth as we penetrate our large Platinum accounts.","Acquisitions contributed approximately 10 points to total new sales growth in the quarter, as reported and just above 10% in constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, for the first nine months of FY '16, total new sales were up low-teens in constant currency and up mid-single digits as reported.","Turning to geographies, new sales were strong in North America and EMEA, driven by stronger than expected performance from acquisitions and the timing of renewals. However, new sales were down in APJ and Latin America due to smaller renewal portfolios. Within our segments, Q3 mainframe new sales including new product and capacity was up in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in-line with the Mainframe market.","Q3 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were up in the high single digits in constant currency, and up low single digits as reported. Acquisitions contributed mid-teens growth in the quarter in both constant currency and as reported. Excluding acquisitions, for the first nine months of FY '16, ES new sales were up mid-single digits in constant currency and down low-single digits as reported.","Services revenue decreased 4% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Over the long-term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners.","Total revenue backlog improved to up 5% in constant currency, or up 2% as reported. Current revenue backlog declined 2% in constant currency, or down 5% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield.","While the timing of some deals shifted from FY '17 into Q3 driven largely by customer requests, we continue to expect FY '17 to be a solid renewal year. We believe our customer's desire for MIPS capacity ahead of renewal expiration is a positive reflection on the strength of the current Mainframe cycle.","Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 12% for Enterprise Solutions, and 6% for Services. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 29% and our GAAP tax rate was 21%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, up 1% year-over-year, and includes a $0.02 benefit from the accelerated share repurchase in the quarter. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.52, up 18%, including a $0.02 benefit from the accelerated share repurchase in the quarter.","Our Q3 CFFO was $332 million, up 18% year-over-year, or up 6% as reported. CFFO improved year-over-year due primarily to a decrease in vendor disbursements and payroll, partially offset by the decrease in cash collections due to an unfavorable effect on foreign exchange. Single installment cash payments were $125 million and up year-over-year but down for the first nine months of the fiscal year.","We ended Q3 with approximately $250 million in net cash. During the third quarter, we repurchased 22 million shares for approximately $590 million, as we accelerated and essentially completed our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $750 million share repurchase program, which we expect to begin to execute in FY '17. In Q3, we paid $105 million in dividends. We also announced a plan to increase the annual dividend from $1.00 to $1.02 in fiscal year 2017. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating.","Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2015. The guidance also assumes no new material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full-year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5 points, at December 31st rates. For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to up-front we experienced in the first half of the year has created a headwind to our reported revenue. We continue to expect total revenue to be towards the low-end of our guidance of down 1% to flat, in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $3.99 to $4.03 billion. Please note that the negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is approximately $200 million.","The movement of some transactions from Q4 into Q3 has the effect of moderating our Q4 expectations, which we expect to weigh on metrics including new sales, reported revenue, bookings, operating margin and EPS in Q4. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 28%, and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margin will be negatively impacted by a higher mix of ratable revenue rather than up-front deals in the first half of the year. Keep in mind that our fiscal Q4 operating margins are likely to be the weakest of the year due to the seasonality of operating expenses.","Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% to 7%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.39 to $2.45. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.23. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 8% to 13%. This translates to a reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.74 to $1.80. The diluted earnings per share estimate includes the impact of the accelerated share repurchase, which has a positive impact of approximately $0.03 and $0.04 to GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, respectively.","At the end of the fiscal year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 427 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $970 million to $1.02 billion.","And now we will take your questions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instruction]. Our first question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John your line is now open.","John DiFucci","Thank you. I just have a couple of quick questions. I think it sound pretty good here but I guess just when I look at some of the numbers and that\u2019s where I just start to wonder a little. And Rich it's really more a mite around the Mainframe. So I see like new sales being up in the mid-teens year-over-year at high single digits on a reported basis and mid-teens in constant currency. But you still expect revenue to decline in low single-digits over the medium term. So can you help us just sort of understand that, because I think that and for a lot of investors think Mainframe's still relevant for you. They would love to see that, it can be relatively stable, but if the new business is up, do you still expect a decline over the medium term? That must mean that the renewals and I don\u2019t know maybe this quarter for Mainframe is an anomaly, certainly as you pointed that out. But it's maybe this quarter and quarters like that even like three year ago you had a similar issue. But it may have big effect because I would think that -- or first of all would Mainframe deal a little more stable. And I only hear that new sales are up and that's I think the second quarter in a row it was up pretty good. And to hear that the revenue is going to go down in the medium term it seems to be some of a disconnect or is it really just about the renewals? I am sorry for the long winded question.","Rich Beckert","This is Rich. So the quarter actually remains a little differently than what we expected back last quarter and it's in a better way. So two pieces of that were better, acquisitions clearly in total improved and the second part is the Mainframe that you described. Those deals that were due to be renewed in Q4 and a couple of deals that were in the first half of next year, customers are now getting our contracts in line with the MIPS they had purchased through IBM over the last year or two. And you can see in the last quarter that they just announced. They had another good quarter of MIPS growth. So we do expect that to come in over in the length of these deals over the next three years as we talked about back in the event. The second part is that the renewals we have done need to be in that around 90% range. This quarter we anticipated that particular standard to take off the Mainframe and put it in a non-Mainframe product set. We knew that they will be working on that for a few years. And so that was anticipated in both this year's guidance and on medium term guidance. And as you said that happens from time-to-time. It's a single digit kind of percentage where that happens, so we have that planned out over and we can see that coming because it takes years for people that migrate away when they choose to do so. As far as the total MIPS growth over the quarter that it was very healthy as you said and that is a positive for us over time. We need MIPS that will be growing in plus 25% in order for us to have flat growth. So this is really in line with what we have anticipated, just a few quarters ahead, so this will smooth out, that is really in Q4.","John DiFucci","Okay. And if I might just ask sort of a related question. And you had -- so in Q3 just overall renewals were up 30% constant currency, low 20% reported. And new business was up 10%, a little more than 10% constant currency mid-single reported. I guess when I look at that and I --and correct me if I am wrong but I think a lot of your new business is still connected to renewals. So I know you have been putting a lot of effort into trying to disconnect or not necessarily disconnect it but sign more new business outside the renewals cycle and also sign with new customers. So in order for you to grow that new business, sort of have to grow like at over time anyway faster or better than the renewals, is that the right way to think about it? And I'm sorry go ahead.","Rich Beckert","So, the way the quarter performed from the ES side of the house is exactly what we had said last quarter, we had anticipated being down low single digits and so that part of the portfolio will behave in that manner. What you really saw picking, volumes in Mainframe as you described, so the renewals in the -- the Q4 renewals that we did tend to be higher percentage of Mainframe customer driven. And then our overall new sales growth as you said just happened because of a very strong performance by both Rally and Xceedium. Xceedium had its largest transaction ever in the quarter and that was anticipated that closed in Q4. So having that close in Q3, helped the revenue and keeps us on track for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","I want to kind of follow on the Mainframe line of questions because that is the most popular question that we still get which is okay, maybe characterize for us this Mainframe cycle, the growth in that? Where you're seeing customers still putting those workloads and growing those workloads in terms of MIPS capacity versus those that are still starting to migrate off to more virtualized and other types of approaches? And how does that weigh on revenue versus what you might be able to do on the pricing side and benefitting from those that are -- they are growing their MIPS capacity?","Rich Beckert","There's a large number of financial institutions that absolutely are growing their Mainframe capacity and many times you see someone using a mobile application to check immediate --checking the counter -- the stock or anything else that's driving a huge amount of back end MIPS. They could be priced differently because they tend to be cheaper the way those MIPS are deployed but it has a strong growth for the Mainframe business. If you ask of us for in the hybrid model where IBM came out with their IBM's Mainframe and the ability to use Linux, we also have products that do that. We announced on at CA World so you'll see us putting on the Mainframe MIPS versus Linux and that will continue to keep that cost to that hardware and everything attached to it, very competitive in the market place. When you then asked, the last question who's really coming off, it's similar to what I said to John, we don't see a lot of large customers dropping their Mainframe. In fact we are seeing their capacity pick up. Tends to be very-very low end, a single application on our older Mainframe. So, that's really that where we see that business and we haven't really seen that change much over the last couple of years. We check that as you can imagine every quarter and we haven't seen any negative trends there.","Sterling Auty","So, does that change at all your outlook so when you talk about fiscal '17 having a modest low single digit growth? What does the Mainframe side need to contribute for you to hit those goals?","Rich Beckert","As we've said in November, we still think it's going to be low single digit decline. We think that's in line with the marketplace, that's more about price compression than it's about customers leaving the platform.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Raimo Lenschow","So, I have one question, Mike, can you talk -- and you talked in the prepared remarks already about some of the product areas that are doing better. Can you talk a little bit about the situation on the distribution side of the business or how strategic accounts fared as Named accounts this quarter and what are you seeing there?","Mike Gregoire","Can you just repeat that Raimo you cut out just a little bit?","Raimo Lenschow","So, I was trying to find out on the distribution side of the business how happy were you with the performance on the Named accounts and the Strategic accounts, especially on the Named accounts there was a lot of focus, you have kind of improved in here.","Mike Gregoire","Yes, I was very pleased with it this quarter, it was up over 10% and this is our ability to get through net new customers that we don't have a very material relationship with. The customer account was definitely up quarter-over-quarter as well and the kinds of customers that we're getting relationships with were quite impressive as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Siti Panigrahi","Hi guys, this is Siti Panigrahi for Phil. Just wondering in terms of geographic [indiscernible] could you give some color what you're seeing outside of the U.S.?","Mike Gregoire","Can you repeat the question I believe you asked how did we do outside the U.S.?","Siti Panigrahi","Yes.","Mike Gregoire","We did very well in Europe as we did in the United States and as I said in my prepared remarks we were down slightly in Asia and Latin America, those were both driven by just what the portfolio was to be renewed in the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","James Wesman","Hey guys good afternoon. It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Rich can you -- given the renewals that you guys had closed in fiscal third quarter earlier than expected, can you talk about what the renewal portfolio looks like for fiscal '17 and if it should still be up year-over-year over fiscal '16?","Mike Gregoire","We believe it will still be up in mid single-digits, when you back out the large system integrator for the rest of the year and it will still be up next year. We will give very detailed what we believe '17 is when we close out the year because we want to make sure that we don't continue to update it for any other transactions that might be at fiscal '17 or on the fiscal '16. But if you recall going back to what we talked about in November, we have three years of solid renewal portfolio. So we're anticipating that that will allow us to continue to see very strong renewals over the next three years.","James Wesman","Got it. Just to make sure, I understood what you said, for fiscal '17, even given the early renewals you still expect the renewal portfolio to be up year-over-year in '17?","Mike Gregoire","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi, thanks. Rich, on the cash flow, you didn't sort of provide any commentary about next year's cash flow, I think you indicated that it could be up slightly with the November event. Does the sort of pull forward in the renewal or the business that you saw from '17 to '16 here, change it all, kind of how you are thinking about cash flow next year? I'm just wondering, if that dynamic was meaningful enough to kind of have a bigger impact such as that?","Rich Beckert","I think what it does is it just takes pressure off of that. As you can imagine, you can see that we continue to have our total billings backlog grew -- grew pretty healthy and we grew 2% just in what we build. So, that better positions us Walter, but I'd say, it didn't necessarily have a major meaningful change year-over-year. As we said, it should over time attract a little bit better than the revenue growth as that grows. So, we still see that growing in that low single digit range.","Walter Pritchard","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matt Hedberg","Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Rich, what if anything can you tell us about the mix of ratable revenue as you look into next year? Should some of the trends that we're seeing now continue and should we expect to maybe correlate even more so?","Rich Beckert","The two things that will drive the ratable revenue, is one the product set. So an example, any of the SaaS products around that continues to be a bigger piece of the portfolio in PPM. That will all be viewed in a ratable nature. The other thing is the products that are to be renewed, so a Mainframe in this particular quarter as an example had a lot of ratable nature to it. Xceedium which is the other new acquisition though had a lot of standalone transactions as did our growth area which you heard, Mike talk about the Named accounts that grew 10%. So those tend to be more standalone transactions, will that mix change over time, yes. We saw change in the first half of the year where more things went ratable, but this quarter it kind of went back to more of the traditional mix and I think the quarter that we are currently in seems to be shaping up to be more than traditional mix. But as the product set becomes more ratable in nature, clearly there will be less revenue than will be taken up front. So, I think that -- to net that out you will have certain products that are going to drive that, as we grow with our SaaS products. But our portfolio will definitely drive certain products to grow ratable, an example, all of Mainframe and lot of our traditional ES products.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ken Sena","Hi, it's actually Ken filling in on for Kirk. Congrats on the quarter. One question, you put up a good margin close to 38%, you're looking for the same for the full year. Could you give us some framework to think about where future margin leverage might come from?","Mike Gregoire","This is Mike. I think, you will see our margin leverage comments, we start to generate more net new sales and higher revenue but we're still investing in a lot of our products. We think a margin in the high 30s is a good place for our company to be, provided we're paying very good dividend, we have a great share buyback program. When you take a look at all of those metrics together, we think that's the best balance between investing in the company, providing value to shareholders and also investing for the long-term viability of our company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.","Abhey Lamba","Thank you. Mike, can you talk a little bit about your confidence in growing revenues in fiscal '17 as the current revenue backlog is still declining? And as we look at it qualitatively you've got headwinds from some early renewals that moved from fiscal '17 to the current year, but I'm sure there are some tailwinds that you've seen. If you can share those that will be helpful?","Mike Gregoire","Sure, I'll comment on a part of it, and I will let Rich weigh in as well. First of all, when you just take a look at the math, our 2017 and 2018 renewal portfolio are very strong. So we've got an awful lot to work with that's already is pretty much booked business. We really understand how to close those types of transactions. We continue to see -- get high renewal yields in the low and mid 90s and we don't see that changing. So that's a good basis point to start from. And then secondly, we've been building a much, much better increasing portfolio of products. When you take a look at the competitive wins we've been getting over the last three quarters, take a look at what's being built organically in our labs and the improvement we have had with respect to organic engineering, I think that that's a confidence factor. And then lastly is, we are seeing a bit of a tipping point happen in the market where customers are really starting to get aggravated with the integration of big parts of their infrastructure being done on dirt nickel and they are looking for suites. And when you take a look at how we go to market and the buckets of products we have, we are a suite player and to the extent that we can get rid of all the engineering in and around the integration of multiple products, I think that's a net wind at our back. And I see this mostly right now in security. When we are selling a security product, we usually start to offer it as a tactical sale. And as soon as that sales start moving up the executive ladder and gets to a CSO or gets to a CFO or CEO they don\u2019t want to talk about a tactical solution. They want talk about how are you going to protect my company and how can we think about this more holistically. We got a great quarter with Xceedium and Xceedium is a great opportunity for us to have in that conversation. It's not lost on anybody, that most of the hacks that have happened over the last year and half have happened by a Privileged Identity getting compromised. There is a tactical reach out right now by just about every corporation to solve that particular problem. But it seems we start having that conversation and you bring it up to an executive level, they expand it into how we are protecting the identities for our whole corporation. There is only a handful of companies in the world that can do that, usually a couple that can do that at scale if they were very well positioned for those kinds of the competitive bids.","Rich Beckert","The only thing I would add is that when you asked about the current revenue backlog, some of that will be driven by -- since we do have a strong portfolio next year, as those items start to come off, meaning like a Q4 of next year no longer is in current. It has an artificial downward pressure on it. That's probably worth a couple of points. So we are feeling pretty good about where we are. You can see this whole revenue backlog and as Mike just described, we have some new products that are going to give us a tailwind.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg McDowell of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Greg McDowell","A lot of macro headlines have people worried and I was just wondering, if you are seeing any change in customer behavior in the first month of this year? And then maybe if you could just comment on maybe how your FY '17 commentary takes into account the potential economic headwinds? Thank you very much.","Mike Gregoire","Sure. With respect to macro we haven\u2019t seen any change in customer sentiments for the problems we are trying to solve. As you think about just about every single company, they are trying to be part of the application economy, so they are building applications. And through building applications they are going to be using things like route and CA Agile Management. They are going to be using testing tools that we have. They are going to be using Service Virtualization. They're going to want to instrument those applications and make sure that the hardware that they deploy them on has enough capacity and if that hardware is something in the comps you going to be notified about it. And obviously they are going to want to be secured. So being in the right spot as everyone thinks towards the macro how am I going to improve. The way that they are going to improve is by getting involved in the application economy. Now there is an also a lot of macro territory on the sheets. China's definitely been on the minds of just about everybody and how do you think people are going to solve their issues in China and China as they move into a consumer oriented economy from an export economy they are going to want to have all the things that you would expect that a G20 nation have. They are going to want to have credit cards, they are going to want to have insurance, they are going to want to have cars, they are going to want to have electronic devices. All of that commerce is going to be built on the application economy as well. So I feel like we are very well positioned strategically in macro in order to make that happen. And that is, we haven't put out our FY '17 guidance yet, we will feel that out when we finish off the year, but we will take that all into consideration. But what I see right now is a bit of a blip and a little bit of a correction. The stuff that is getting corrected, I think everybody probably saw that it probably should get corrected. When you have a company like ours that makes money, you have a company like ours that has great customer service, we see a company like ours invest a $1 billion in real R&D. That\u2019s the kind of stability that I think customers are going to want to pay attention to.","Rich Beckert","I think I would add to make a comment. We did see -- Brazil has had its troubles, it had strong quarter, but we know the last couple of quarters were not as big in China. So some of the pressure that Mike just described in China didn't -- were a little bit inflated from that as well as Russia. So we performed very well again in Europe and North America. A lot of what we did over the last 18 months to get our Named and growth accounts moving is really starting to pay dividend. And as Mike has said earlier that we saw that segment grow 10% and that's the third quarter in row that had significant growth. So I think we are in position where we have a lot of white space if you will in the Fortune 5000. We were traditionally, four years ago very concentrated in our Fortune 500. So that gives us a lot more insulation if you will from economic downturn in certain industries.","Operator","Thank you and this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Gregoire, CEO, for any further remarks.","Mike Gregoire","Great. First of all thank you for joining us late this afternoon and your interest in CA. I'd like to leave with the following key takeaways. First of all we are very pleased with our performance in Q3, which definitely exceeded our expectations. Our recent acquisitions are performing very well and we had a strong quarter in Mainframe. And finally, we continue to invest in innovation that matters, which will drive growth for CA for many years ahead.","Thank you and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kelsey Doherty. Ma'am, you may begin.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies' Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bill McCracken, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer.

Thank you for joining us. I hope you have had a chance to review our press releases announcing our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings and our enhanced capital allocation program. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our third quarter performance. I'll then talk to you about our capital allocation strategy, which we first discussed with you at Investor Day in July and then indicated in October that we would provide you an update this quarter. I will conclude with a review of our progress driving sales growth and margin expansion. Rich will then provide details on the quarter and guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2012. We'll then take your questions.","In the third quarter, we saw growth in revenue and EPS and operating margin expansion, even after adjusting for a single license payment we received. As noted in our release, the unsolicited early single payment from a software company relates to a license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement we first announced in February 2009. This payment was not included in annual guidance provided by the company in October because we expected it in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.","Headlines from the quarter, which reflect year-over-year growth rates include: revenue growth of 10% in constant currency and as reported. The license payment added about 3 points to this growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including approximately 2 points from the license payment. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 28% in constant currency. The license payment added 10% to this growth. Cash flow from operations, including the license payment, declined 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. As we had anticipated, cash flow for fiscal 2012 is weighted towards the fourth quarter and this afternoon, we confirmed our cash flow guidance for the year. Our current revenue backlog grew 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported.","While we had a good quarter on many measures and continued to make solid progress against our long-term goals, we know we are not done. We remain focused on executing our strategy and driving further operational improvements, including new product sales, execution in EMEA, greater sales productivity and continued work on our expense structure.","Now let me go to our enhanced capital allocation program, starting with some background. As you recall, in July, we said as part of our long-term guidance, that we expected to return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned in October, management and the board were continuing to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and continue to improve our competitive positioning. We believe our enhanced capital allocation program announced this afternoon puts us on a path to achieving a balanced approach to return more cash to shareholders, while still enabling us to invest in our future. This is a logical extension of the strategic and operational priorities we outlined at Investor Day.","Fundamentally, the dividend increase and share repurchase authorization underscore the board's and management's confidence in the company's long-term business outlook and our ability to generate significant free cash flow on a consistent basis. It is our consistent free cash flow, driven by our current and projected operating performance, that allows us to fund this ongoing return of capital and at the same time, continue to invest in our future to further improve our strategic market position and deliver superior mainframe enterprise and cloud solutions and services to our customers.","Today, we are focused on 3 priorities to build long-term value for CA Technologies customers, employees and shareholders. First, to continue to execute our strategy and improve our operating performance. Second, to provide for a greater return of cash to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. And third, to effectively use the balance sheet to return additional cash in the near term through an accelerated buyback.","In summary, we are targeting to return to shareholders approximately $2.5 billion through fiscal year 2014, or about 80% of our expected cumulative free cash flow over that period.","Key elements of the program include: One, an increase in the dividend from an annualized rate of $0.20 per share to $1 per share. That is a yield of approximately 4.5% based on yesterday's closing market price and currently puts our dividend yield at the top of comparable technology companies. The board and management view returning cash to shareholders through dividends as an important component of our overall approach to enhancing shareholder value.","Two, a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization through fiscal 2014, including an accelerated repurchase of approximately $500 million under an agreement to be executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Including the accelerated share repurchase and shares repurchased year-to-date, we expect we will have spent approximately $1 billion to buy back shares during fiscal year 2012. The $1.5 billion authorization replaces the approximately $230 million remaining under our current authorization. We are confident we have the balance sheet capacity to get this done and the program is expected to be funded by available U.S. cash.","Three, our strategic plan anticipates that we will continue our investment in the business consistent with that of previous years, or approximately $1 billion annually. This includes acquisition activity in the range of $300 million to $500 million per year, on average, through fiscal 2014 and the approximately $600 million we invest on average each year in organic research and development.","So let me answer the critical question of how we intend to continue to improve execution against our strategic plan. As we've highlighted in this afternoon's capital allocation release, we remain comfortable with the long-term targets for the period ending March 31, 2015, that we provided at Investor Day in July. This includes an acceleration to mid-single digit constant currency organic revenue growth and an expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points a year. Our expectation is that, over time, much of this operating margin expansion will come from improvements in execution in our Enterprise Solutions segment, driven by accelerating product sales and greater efficiency in our sales force. We intend to continue to drive more growth and more profit from each dollar we invest, and we will continue to systematically improve productivity and efficiency in our organization.","In our second quarter earnings call, we outlined 3 immediate growth initiatives: Expanding product penetration in new accounts and growth geographies; continuing to improve our results in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. In terms of product penetration, this past quarter, we focused on 3 main areas.","First, we continued our market segmentation initiative, which as a first step, includes the rebalancing of our sales force to align what has been a highly concentrated coverage model to new opportunities in approximately 1,000 large new enterprise accounts and approximately 7,000 accounts in the midmarket. Focus in these groups on sales of new products to new customers, our market segmentation effort is designed to drive product penetration in new accounts and accelerate performance of our acquisitions.","Second, we told you we expect to add an incremental 300 new quota-carrying sales reps globally by year end. 1\/3 of these resources will be new to CA Technologies, while 2\/3 reflect a reallocation of existing internal resources. All of this will be accomplished under our current expense profile. At this point, we are approximately halfway through this process and expect to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.","Finally, we have continued to make significant investments in growth geographies. These are long-term investments in markets that are key to accelerating new product sales and our ongoing success in the years to come. This quarter, we had excellent results in Latin America, where we added more than 30 new enterprise customers to the region and expanded our footprint in more than 60 current customers. In Asia Pacific, we added more than 30 new logos to the region, including 15 for Nimsoft. Growth in new product sales more than doubled in China and grew more than 40% in Korea.","Next in EMEA. We believe the team we have in place is introducing the right discipline and incentive structure to keep both our renewals process and new business pipeline on track. Our plan is focused on improving sales execution and productivity, driving marketing and brand awareness and developing our people. While we do not want to get ahead of ourselves, we were pleased to see modest revenue growth in EMEA this quarter and wins with Volkswagen, SAP, Daimler and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.","Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, we believe our strategy to aggressively capitalize on the evolution of virtualization management, cloud computing implementation and SaaS delivery of IT is working. We continue to focus on driving results from investments we have made, both through organic development and in companies such as Nimsoft, 3Tera AppLogic, ITKO and Arcot. Results achieved during the quarter give us confidence that our strategy to reach new customers and the midmarket is the right one. This quarter, Nimsoft added a record 100 new logos and in December, we received notification that Net One Systems formally selected Nimsoft to be their platform of choice for their future business services for their XOC managed operations center, one of the largest in Japan.","We closed a significant transaction with IGT, which selected AppLogic to continue innovating how casino games, systems and experiences are delivered with the IGT cloud.","ITKO delivered a record quarter, closed 5 deals over $1 million and saw their average transaction size significantly increase. Customers like DIRECTV and SoCal Edison report return on their investment in ITKO in terms of weeks and continued to expand their usage and licenses.","Finally, Arcot is protecting approximately 150 million identities worldwide. During the 2011 holiday shopping season, we averaged 1 million transactions per day for our e-commerce authentication on our SaaS platform.","In conclusion, the strategic initiatives and priorities we continue to pursue, in combination with our enhanced capital allocation program, reflect the ongoing commitment of the CA Technologies board, management and employees to deliver outstanding solutions and services to our customers and attractive, sustainable returns to CA shareholders.","Now I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the third quarter.","Richard J. Beckert","Thank you, Bill. Turning to our third quarter results, please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's result include the single license payment from the software company. This payment came in earlier than we had anticipated and was not included in the fiscal year 2012 guidance we provided in October.","The single license payment contributed the following to the quarter: revenue of $39 million reported in our Mainframe Solutions segment and in the Software, Fees and Other line on the P&L; GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05; and cash flow of $39 million.","Total revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion and grew 10% in constant currency and as reported. 8 points of this growth was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. This quarter, we saw a $20 million increase in perpetual sales associated with Enterprise Solution products, including $10 million of products that were newly eligible for upfront recognition during the quarter.","From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solution revenue was $682 million, up 9% in constant currency and as reported. The single license payment contributed 6 points of growth in constant currency and as reported to Mainframe Solutions.","Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $478 million, up 11% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Services revenue was $103 million, up 16% in constant currency and 17% as reported.","Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low-single digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter grew, both with and without single license payment. Capacity sales were down more than 20%. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of the customers in our underlying renewal portfolio. Year-to-date, we are encouraged by the capacity trends which are up and believe that IBM Mainframe is bringing increased attention to the platform and over time, should serve as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies.","Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 5%. We saw growth in Virtualization and Automation and Identity and Access Management. This was offset by Service Portfolio Management and Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring.  Finally, new service engagements were down slightly year-over-year.","Our renewal yield was just below 90%. We closed one transaction, a merger, that negatively skewed the results during the quarter. Excluding this transaction, the renewal yield would have been in the mid-90s. We continue to expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a difficult year-over-year comparison. This is due to a more than $500 million system integrator license agreement that was signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.","Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported.","From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $475 million, up 21% in constant currency and 23% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Operating margins for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 12%. This includes 4 points of continued investment in this segment. Finally, operating margin for Services was 11%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, up 28% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.01 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from the previously mentioned license payment, operational improvements and our stock repurchase program.","Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was 31.5%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $396 million, down 19% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Single installment payments were $107 million in the third quarter compared to $152 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year.","Moving to third quarter GAAP results, third quarter operating margin before interest and taxes was 33%. GAAP operating income was $413 million, up 22% in constant currency and 24% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, up 39% in constant currency and 42% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 34.9%.","Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. Between October 1 and December 31, we purchased approximately 9.6 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $200 million.","Now let me turn to fiscal 2012 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on December 31 exchange rates. This includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following: total revenue growth is now expected to be 6% in constant currency, at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 6%. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.21 to $2.25. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%, an increase from our previous range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 to $1.90.","We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 463 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This share count reflects the $500 million ASR under an agreement we expect to execute in the company's fourth quarter. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be a strong 34% for fiscal year 2012. And now, I will turn the call back over to Bill.","William E. McCracken","Thanks, Rich. I'd like to conclude by saying that our third quarter performance and positive operating momentum reinforce our belief that we have the right strategic plan in place. As I have said, we remain focused on execution and feel strongly that the initiatives we continue to pursue allow us to invest in our company's future, and at the same time, reward our shareholders.","And with that, Kelsey, let me turn it back to you.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you, Bill. As the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to remind you on Tuesday, February 7 -- the Goldman Sachs technology conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, February 15. The Morgan Stanley 2012 Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, February 28, and the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando, Florida on Monday, March 5. In the interest of time, we ask you to please limit yourself to 2 questions. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer & Co.","Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions on my end. Rich, can you guys provide us with kind of slightly more quantitative data on Europe. I know, Bill, you indicated some modest growth, but maybe a little bit more color on that, that would be helpful.","Richard J. Beckert","So sure. So, this quarter, what we saw coming out of Europe for the first time, 2 things. One, we saw them hold their forecast, which was great and then by the end of the quarter, it actually grew. So that was some positive momentum. We're not getting ahead of ourselves, but in the right direction. More important than that though, we saw them able to sell outside of their renewal cycle, which as you know, is low this year especially in Europe, but for all of CA, allowing them to have their best upfront revenue since we've been starting this program on the distributed side. It has allowed them to grow their revenue year-over-year and it demonstrated their ability to sell outside the renewal cycle. That help?","Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, absolutely, absolutely. Another question then on the cash flow, kind of, a little bit kind of on the weaker side as to how it relates to consensus numbers. Is it just a matter of collections? Is it timing? Is it kind of just being back-end loaded?","Richard J. Beckert","It's a great question. It's preliminary timing. We're very confident with our full year guidance. If you look at it on a year-to-date, CFFO is only down $14 million or 2%. Billings year-to-date is actually up $177 million or 6%. Customer collections is up $117 million or 4% and billings backlog is up 11%. So we can see a clear roadmap to how we're going to get to our 3% to 5% guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations on the capital allocation plan. It's a pretty impressive commitment, to say the least. I just had a clarification and then a follow-up. So Rich, it seems as though, as you said, 80% of your free cash flow through fiscal '14 is expected to go to buybacks and dividends and an additional $600 million to $800 million in M&A. I believe if I'm not mistaken, that would be roughly equal to or perhaps a bit above the $3 billion or so in the future cash flow generation over this period. So I guess first of all, I just wanted to see if that was correct.","Richard J. Beckert","No. We said our acquisitions will be in the $300 million to $500 million range over time.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And I'm sorry, was the $300 million to $500 million, is that per annum or is that between now and fiscal '14?","Richard J. Beckert","That would be an average over that timeframe, so in any one year we can do $300 million to $500 million. So averaging that.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, right. And I was essentially just kind of more or less doubling that in terms of kind of starting with $600 million in M&A. So I guess my question is, in terms of the future cash flow generation between now and fiscal '14, is essentially all of it kind of coming down to buybacks, dividends and M&A? Or is there another piece that I'm missing here?","Richard J. Beckert","No. We are looking at buybacks, the $1 dividend and our M&A, and we think through our continued operations and efficiency, we'll be able to easily do that. We have source and uses for the cash outside of the Americas and we're confident that we can do all our capital allocation with U.S. dollars.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of my follow-up, Rich, so I guess a multipart question, if I could. How much cash, if you don't mind sharing with us, how much cash is currently onshore at CA? Secondly, if you complete this plan, how much will remain onshore by the end of fiscal '14 according to your projections? And then third, does this plan contemplate any issuance of debt or no?","Richard J. Beckert","So I'll answer 2 of those 3 for you. I will tell you that we're at 36% of our free cash flows, our cash is here in the U.S. And we don't plan on having to issue any kind of debt in order to do this capital allocation plan. But I don't plan on doing a forecast by geo going out over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Schwartz from Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You talked a little bit about some of the, or actually even showed some numbers in terms of the upfront licensees in the quarter. Is there any change in terms of what you're bundling in with ELAs? And I don't know if that's related to your focus on new customer growth, but I would think that those would tend to be maybe one product sales versus bundled sales. I just was wondering if you could walk through that dynamic.","Richard J. Beckert","Great, that's a great question. From an -- what we are really seeing in the upfront revenue, we had announced some new products, it's actually refreshed products at CA World. We also had our products because right now, where we are in the renewal cycle as I talked about earlier in Europe, when the distributed products that have sold outside of renewal without mainframe, they qualify for upfront revenue. And so you see a little higher percentage of that happening because of the lower weighting, if you will, of transactions happening outside of the renewal. Remember, we also have ITKO, one of our new acquisitions, had a very strong quarter, that's all upfront revenue. So we were pretty happy with that.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, thank you, that's helpful. And then, I guess maybe a follow-on question to what Gregg had asked, but obviously you laid out quite a bit of capital commitment here in terms of the cash allocation. Is there any way you can sort of prioritize the M&A side versus what you're committing to shareholders? And then on that front, I mean, does this at all--your intention to go from 40% to 50%, now up to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders, does that change your view on hiring, on retention? Anything operationally that you would have to do differently?","Richard J. Beckert","No. The only thing that you will see and we're already anticipating doing this as part of this capital allocation is you'll see us leverage our overseas operations more. So some globalization will occur. Where we actually do our M&A acquisitions, some of those will actually happen outside of North America, so some of that cash will be non-U.S. cash. So it's sort of right in line -- it is right in line with where we want it to go.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And a last question for me, if I could, but is there any intention to repatriate some of the overseas cash and pay the tax on that?","Richard J. Beckert","No.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci from JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My congrats too here, I guess not just for me, but from the market that really likes what you're doing and doing the right thing with the capital structure here, but I'll let other ask questions on that. I also know, Rich and Bill and team, that you're totally focused on the business operations, and I don't necessarily see this as a signal, and you're talking about how you're going to continue to grow. And that's good to hear. And you can do both by returning cash and growing here. But when I look at the results for this quarter, which looked decent, but when I adjust for the $39 million single license payment, foreign exchange and if I adjust for the EDS revenue in the quarter or the large service provider in the quarter, and I realize it's real revenue, but at the same time it's not -- as far as a run rate, it's about the same business run rate as it was prior to the renewal. When I make those adjustments, I come up with revenue growth of about 2% on an organic constant-currency basis and bookings, and I realize, Rich, you really shouldn't be looking at it and you I think drove this home. And we understand you can't look at it, the bookings just because of timing. But it does, the bookings would have declined. So I guess looking at the 2% growth...","Richard J. Beckert","Can I just jump in for a second. It's about 2% for the system integrator. About 3% for that single license, so to your point that's -- you could argue 5 points. That'll be 3% that's organic and 2% that's acquisitive.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, but it's actually 3.4% and it's 2.2% and when you round them all up, they all add up to about 8%, it's like 7.7%.","Richard J. Beckert","John, I'm telling you, its 8.2%. So -- but keep going.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So if it's 8.2%. I guess my question is, this 2% to 3%, is this sort of what we should be expecting or should we be expecting more than this as far as your -- we understand you're going to be buying some companies and some exciting technologies. But so far, that has -- that's still in progress. Should we be seeing more of this? And I guess how are we going to see it? Are we going to see even maybe perhaps more product out of CA that's not just through acquisition? Are there changes being made as Peter's come on board, as far as more organic product development even or something along those lines?","William E. McCracken","John, there's a couple of things that we would have mentioned here as we look forward. The acquisitions we've been making over the last 2 years, many of them now have moved into the organic area and as we've added additional capability to those, those are supporting our organic growth as we go forward and that'll continue into next year. When you look at the segmentation that we talked about in the last quarter, with the 300 additional sales reps we're moving out and we're moving into the segmentation area, that growth, new products and new accounts, will add to the organic growth as we go forward. And I think one of the probably key points that's worth looking at in the quarter is that you may recall a year ago when Nimsoft was reporting, we talked about 20 or 30 new accounts. We had over 200 new logos in the quarter. And so, with Nimsoft and with Latin America coming on very strong, now starting to get growth in the Asia countries and a return a bit from EMEA, we're starting to see the organic growth coming out of what we had previously done from the new products and acquisitions, as well as from new segmentation pieces. So as we look forward on the base business, we see organic growth being the way we move next year.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, thanks, Bill. And if I could, just to follow-up from Aaron's question for I think, Rich. Rich, we saw a sequential decline in subscription revenue this quarter, which is sort of odd to see given your model. This was more than offset by this -- a big jump in the Software, Fees and Other, even if you back out that single license payment. So if you could just sort of explain what was -- what's going on there.","Richard J. Beckert","Right. So what you did see, and it was reflected in my discussion on Europe as an example. If you were to combine the subscription bookings and the SFO bookings, you'd see we're closer, we're up single digit, John. And really, outside of the renewal, when we're doing a lot of our distributed transactions, they're going to be taken as SFO, which then does put pressure on the revenue backlog in the subscription line.","Operator","And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on the bookings, and I know not a focus here in the quarter necessarily, but you have had, I think, about 11 out of 15 quarters on an annualized basis over the last 3 years or so, 4 years, have declining bookings. I'm trying to get a sense of when we should start to see the bookings turn around? It seems like you can't grow revenue forever without annualized bookings growing and it seems like when you see that here shortly, so I just wanted to get a sense of how far we need to look out to see bookings growth resume?","Richard J. Beckert","Right. So if you recall just for clarity, we'll have -- this fourth quarter, we'll have a very difficult compare with the $500 million transaction we did last year. So we'll be down for the year 15%. Next year is the end of our trough for the renewal cycle, and we start a very strong '14 and '15 thereafter. So to the degree that the renewals have, and they do weigh heavily on the total bookings because they tend to be longer in duration, it will put pressure on that. To the degree we continue to sell outside of the renewal cycle, which allows us to grow footprint, products like Nimsoft, which back to John's question, by this time next year, will generate about 1 point of growth, we really start to have other engines that are starting to kick in. ITKO will have another strong year. Again, that's outside of the renewal cycle. So I think you're right. It'll continue to be on the lower side. In May, we'll give you guys more guidance on FY '13.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just on a -- some questions, just a couple of specifics on the capital allocation. You talked about $1 dividend. Is that--can you talk about the path to get there? I assume that's not $1 for next year. Is that $1 exiting 2014 or any color on that? And then also, a share count around with the ASR next quarter. I think that the share count will come down.","William E. McCracken","So if that starts this quarter. So on February 14, I believe, if you're a holder, then you'll get $0.25 per share. And for modeling purposes for everyone on the line, as we said on the call, you should assume 486 million shares on average to do your model for EPS.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore Partners.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a couple of clarifications. I guess, Rich, first, going forward, can you give us any idea of just sort of what your assumption is or I guess what the historical split's been on operating cash flow between U.S. and international, just so I can get a sense of sort of what your -- you guys have said you can pay with it all--pay for all of this with your U.S. cash flow. I'm just trying to get a sense of how that's broken out. I know you've given us what the balance sheet split is. I'm just trying to get a sense on, I guess historically what it's been if you don't want to give us a forward-looking number.","Richard J. Beckert","Roughly a 40%, 60% split. It depends on the particular time of year, it depends on the size of certain transactions that might come in that might move it a little bit. Even though we've already accumulated through year-to-date $550 million worth of shares, we're still at 36% of our U.S. to non-U.S. at 64%. So it's pretty healthy, and we feel confident that we can continue in that range going forward.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, it's 40% comes from the U.S. and 60% is international in your operating cash flow?","Richard J. Beckert","And right now, it's 36%. No, I'm talking about the cash on the balance sheet to be very clear.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense on when you guys are planning this out, you obviously had to make an assumption on what the U.S. international cash flow is going to look like. And I know you don't want to get into guidance but I guess just historically, when you bring in $1 of cash historically, I guess, how is that broken out? Is it 60%, 70% U.S. and 40 -- I'm just trying to get a sense on -- just so I can do the math to make sure the numbers and what you've committed to make sense.","Richard J. Beckert","It's approximately 60% in the U.S. free cash flow. It will depend by quarter, but it's approximately 60%.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then just lastly on -- you guys have obviously recommitted to growing operating margins by 100% per year or 100 basis points per year. I guess, does that also take into account any kind of M&A you'd be doing? So if you do go through the $300 million to $500 million you're talking about in M&A, would that be inclusive of that? Or would that potentially have to be adjusted depending on the deal?","Richard J. Beckert","Any more tuck-ins would be included in there. Any upsize would not be included in there.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you give me an idea what you're thinking about size? Over $100 million?","Richard J. Beckert","Well, it'll depend on the year I think, going forward. So as we do make those, we will make corrections, we'll make sure that we let everyone know once that guidance changes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two sets of questions. First is a clarification on Kirk's question about the margin expansion. So if you do the $300 million to $500 million in a given year, should we anticipate you get a point of margin expansion or you get less?","Richard J. Beckert","As I said, it will depend on what the acquisition is, Mike, and it will depend on the size of it, when it happens in the year. So right now, the guidance that we're giving is currently without any impact. In other words, if we do an acquisition and it impacts us, then we will have to modify. So it's as if there's no impact to that. We'll let you know if it changes.","William E. McCracken","What you should expect is that we are driving operations cost and expense to improve 100 basis points on margin every year. If there's a transaction that comes into it that would change it in any way, we'll tell you that, but the operational improvements we'd make on cost and expense are at the rate that we have told you in the past and in our guidance.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I'll assume the baseline assumption for a point of margin expansion is 0 or close to 0 in acquisitions.","William E. McCracken","That is correct.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then a follow-up, obviously was a solid quarter in a lot of ways but 2 things that jumped out at me. One is that the growth rate for the current one-year revenue backlog, that growth rate decelerated again. I think down about 2 points, 2% and that's been going down for a little while. And then the other thing that jumped out that was of some concern to me was again, I think in Enterprise, you guys declined in new product sales. So what is really going on in terms of the fundamentals of selling new enterprise software licenses? Is it getting to be overall, a tougher thing to do? And do those numbers reflect that? And when can those start reversing?","Richard J. Beckert","Okay. So the first part of your question on the revenue backlog, it did slow down, although it did grow sequentially 1%. And that, there's a weighting on the lower renewal portfolio and a higher number of deals that are done outside the renewal cycle would drive that. And therefore, you move more of your products to the perpetual license that's accounted for in the SFO line. From a new sales standpoint, I think the way we would tell you is, we were pleased with our Virtualization and Automation, Identity and Access Management. Service Assurance was mixed, where we had good growth in Application Performance Management and that was offset a bit by Infrastructure Monitoring. And we had a decline in Service Portfolio Management. So it was mixed. But in general, we had some very good bright spots. We had very good mainframe new license sales as well, excluding even that single license payment.","William E. McCracken","And what we do see is that the SFO line does go up, as Rich explained, and that has a lot to do with what we talked about last quarter with respect to market segmentation. We're going and selling new products in new accounts. And a lot of those flow in on the upfronts. And as an example, ITKO, last quarter had $1 million. This year -- this quarter $20 million, so we're seeing significant growth in the upfronts with respect to the new products and new accounts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of questions. First are, what are the levers for the margin expansion of 100 basis points annually? Are these savings spread across R&D, sales and marketing and G&A or is it from one of the specific areas? And then the second is, you lowered guidance last quarter and now you're moving it to the high end of the range. What's changed to give you more confidence?","Richard J. Beckert","Okay. So I'll answer the second one first. The single license payment added a little under 1 point of revenue growth, which allowed us to move ourselves up to the high end of guidance. That will probably be a strong 6%, just so people understand where that sits. We thought that it was prudent to keep it within the top end of the range due to the macro environment. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves as Bill had said earlier. On your first part of the question, most of the improvements we'll see next year, we continue to make improvements on G&A. It will all be predominantly in the Enterprise Solutions segment, as we talked about back in July, and you see us continuing to demonstrate efficiencies that we're able to work through the business in all elements. So sales will become more efficient. We talked about the 300 people that by Q1 will have moved out of overlay positions into quota carrying. So that drives your sales E\/R. Our development E\/R, we think, is actually set fairly well. So we're not looking to do much to the sales here. We would always continue to make improvements to the G&A line. The G&A line of course will benefit all segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked at this point, but you just made a point about indicating that within Europe, you've seen a nice improvement in interquarter sales beyond the renewal period, which has been sort of something you guys have been working on for a while. I guess, can you kind of address that beyond Europe? In North America, APAC and kind of give us a sense for maybe how some of these newer SaaS products are helping in some of those geos as well?","William E. McCracken","We're seeing that now happening. We had talked about it before happening in North America and I think as we work on the growth geographies, as we talked before, Latin America for this quarter was a very significant expansion. In fact, they were up around 60% year-over-year and a lot of that comes out of those selling outside of the ELA cycle. Same thing was proven in Asia as well, too. So that has been a focus of ours and it is a big piece of what we've been talking about here with a lot of these questions, as to the revenue flow that we get out of new products in new accounts and the upfront license as it is booked from that perspective. So that is a big part of what our strategy was and how it fills in from revenue point of view on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then, one last question. You guys are making some nice progress on your quota-bearing sales rep hiring here. I guess I'm wondering how has attrition been? And I guess in terms of productivity, what more can we expect from productivity as we enter your fiscal fourth quarter?","William E. McCracken","We've not seen any significant change in the attrition at all. And as we said, about 100 of the 300 have come from outside. That was the plan as we talked about last quarter. We've got about 150 of those folks in place and we'll finish that this quarter. But we haven't seen a significant change with respect to attrition in any of our geographies.","Richard J. Beckert","And on your question on sales productivity, we continue, as we had said back in July, that over the next few years, we'll be taking 1 point or 2 out of that total sales to revenue ratio.","Operator","And our next question comes from Philip Winslow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but just wanted to go back to the new product sales commentary from earlier. You guys talked about how Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 5%. Now, that's better than last quarter when they were down 20%. But just that line in particular, you guys put a lot of focus in terms of incremental growth, I'm hearing. Even it's kind of excluding renewals, when do you think we're going to start to see that turnaround and what's really going to be the driver for that?","William E. McCracken","The key thing on that is, when you look back 2 years ago. One of the things we talked about when we bought Nimsoft was that we bought 2 things: we bought technology but we bought a delivery channel and primarily the MSPs. New products and new accounts midmarket is growing there rapidly. In fact, Nimsoft is up 70% the last 2 years in this growth piece. That is where the market seems to be going as well, too. In fact, I think you've seen it in the industry, the IM piece is actually cutting back a little bit in its historical way that it flowed and what we're finding is that we're bringing the Nimsoft piece up as the PNCV on the other piece goes down and that is, for us, been one of the strength pieces as to the way it's balanced it versus the way the rest of the market for some of our competitors have worked. The second thing is and probably very importantly, the acquisition of ITKO adds significantly to that. And as we've mentioned, that was a major growth not only in the revenue shift this quarter but also in the transaction size because it's about triple the size it was a quarter ago. Does that help?","Kelsey Doherty","I think we've lost them unfortunately. I think we need to move to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Zeller from Needham & Company.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","The first question is around the sales changes. You mentioned in the prepared remarks the 1,000 high-end accounts and then the 7,000 below that. Is that -- I guess I'd call it a reassignment or redrawing of accounts? Is that complete, the reassignment?","William E. McCracken","The segmentation of the pieces that we talked about last quarter, we are halfway through on the total, which is 150 of the 300. As far as the segmentation is concerned, yes, that work is done and the assignment of those folks to that is completed as well.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Enterprise Solutions group, the Virtualization-related products, could you talk about bookings trends in that group of products, please?","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. We're pretty pleased with the performance of the products in Virtualization. I think what you'll see is we had 2 large transactions inside of that space that really benefited us. And again, as we talked about ITKO earlier, it really had an outstanding quarter, right on target with what we had anticipated internally for our acquisition case.","Operator","Our final question comes from Kevin Buttigieg from Collins Stewart.","Kevin M. Buttigieg - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions on capital allocation. First of all, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your philosophy between the return of shareholder funds in the form of dividends versus buybacks? Obviously, you've been much more skewed towards buybacks historically, and this is a very significant increase in the dividend here today. And then just secondly, I wanted to ask, I understand, Rich, what you're saying about there's no need to issue debt here, but I guess my question would be why not? If you look a few years ago, CA had $1 billion more in net cash and $1 billion more in debt. So clearly, there's the flexibility on the balance sheet, and it would give you more flexibility today, including the possibility of an even greater return of cash to shareholders, particularly when the cost of debt is so low. So just wondering if you're targeting a specific debt rating there or really what your thought process is on those 2 issues?","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. So the first piece, the increase today in the amounts really underscores our confidence in our ability to do -- have a very strong long-term business outlook and our ability to generate cash over the long term, which is going to be given out via dividends. And we think by having the dividends, it really rewards our shareholders and the partnership we have with them over time. On your second question on why we wouldn't leverage up the balance sheet, that tends to be more of a shorter-term view. If we were to do something like that, it would really be more for a very large acquisition or something along those lines which we do not plan on doing at this time. We do not see the advantage of taking on incremental debt, and we are happy with the credit ratings that we currently have.","William E. McCracken","And on the dividend piece, I think it represents our confidence, both the board and management's confidence, on our operational performance going forward when we put it in the form of a dividend to reward our shareholders as well.","Kelsey Doherty","Thanks, Kevin.","William E. McCracken","So let me just wrap up. I guess I would make 3 points as we wrap up. First is we're going to continue to press, as we have been, on executing the strategy and improving our operational performances. On the second point, as we have mentioned today, we want to return cash to our shareholders and reward them because we believe we can both invest in our future, as well as return cash to our shareholders. And then finally, we want to make sure that we keep our balance sheet as an efficient balance sheet in the things we do going forward. So we were pleased with this quarter, and we believe that going forward, we have an opportunity to both invest in the future and also return cash for our shareholders. Thanks for hooking up with us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today.

Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks and then we will open the call up for a Q&A.","These prepared comments were previously recorded, and this conference call is being broadcast on Wednesday, May 11, over the telephone and the Internet.

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our first quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on June 15, 2016. Let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we achieved full-year results consistent with our guidance. Most performance metrics came in-line or above the high end. Our FY 2016 performance demonstrates progress in our ongoing work to reposition our product portfolio, refine our go-to market strategy, and intensely focus on customer experience and customer success. This effort has culminated in our first quarter of revenue growth in nearly four years.","However, our Q4 new sales execution was not as crisp as it could have been, a good reminder that we still have work to do. We believe we are poised to cross over into modest revenue growth for fiscal 2017 and over the medium term, deliver on our guidance of low-single digit growth. This is a big first step in our strategic goal of creating a company for long-term sustainable growth.","For the year, revenue, operating margin, and EPS came in-line with our guidance range, and CFFO exceeded the high-end of the range. Total new sales of FY 2016 were up low teens year-over-year and organic new sales were up mid-single digits. This is the third consecutive year of step-function improvement in organic new sales.","For the year, API Management, Agile Central, PPM, Security and Mainframe were among the products that contributed to new sales growth. This broad-based improvement is encouraging and necessary to drive sustained growth given the size and breadth of our portfolio. While we are pleased with our progress, there is still work to do to achieve the kind of sustainable growth our company is capable of delivering.","Turning to our Q4 results, revenue grew 1% year-over-year. This is the first quarter of revenue growth CA has reported since Q1 in fiscal 2013. In the quarter, API Management, Agile Central, PPM, and Release Automation all contributed to new sales growth, with each of these areas up double-digits.","However, the timing of renewals and shorter duration impacted our overall Q4 new sales performance. Recall that the number of transactions we realized earlier in the year leaving less to close in Q4, as indicated in prior earnings calls. Regardless of the timing of transactions, we remain disciplined and committed to realizing the value we deliver to our customers. As such, new sales were down high-single digits year-over-year, in-line with the renewal portfolio in Q4. While our freestanding Enterprise Solutions business grew in Q4 and Named and Growth or Partner-led business increased low-single digits, we are not satisfied.","We should have done an even better job of closing more opportunities outside of our renewal portfolio. Our results reflect that we are unwilling to pull deals forward and discount aggressively to amplify the results of any specific quarter or fiscal year. We are managing the business for the long-term best interest of CA and our shareholders. Looking ahead, we will be agile and deliberate as we make the requisite modifications to optimize our performance. This ongoing self-evaluation and fast-learning is increasingly part of our DNA.","Consistent with this discipline, we are continuing to focus on customer experience. It is a truly firm-wide effort and one that we believe repositions CA from a software vendor to a technology partner. We see this ongoing effort as a way in which we are elevating our brand in the eyes of both current and potential customers and in turn, driving a broadening set of new sales opportunities.","I'd like to point out a few transactions from the quarter that highlight how we are enabling customers in their journey of digital transformation and providing competitive advantage in the application economy.","Last year, we piloted a customer experience program aimed at supporting customers to ensure they realize the value of their CA solutions. Part of maximizing value from software is ensuring that customers are employing the technology they have purchased and updating them to the latest releases with the best features. This effort has been so well-received that a global health insurance and benefits provider, an established customer across a number of our Enterprise Solutions offerings, now enlists CA's counsel on best practices with regard to our customer care and user experience initiative. They view CA as the gold standard by which other solutions providers are measured.","This customer had deployments of both CA Agile Central as well as two other Agile management vendors. In the quarter, our sales team closed a deal making CA Agile Central the Enterprise standard for Agile management. Our key competitive differentiators were: the compatibility and integration, opportunity between CA Agile Central and CA Project and Portfolio Management, platform scalability, and the portfolio-level analytics. This is a great example because it highlights the value customers see in integrated solutions from single vendors. It also demonstrates success in our land-and-expand strategy.","Another example of how we're enabling customers to thrive in the application economy is our relationship with a leader in the global money-transfer space. This company has been around for more than a century and competes in today's incredibly fast-paced, technology-enabled industry. With its continuous stream of new solutions for consumers and businesses, its DevOps vision and strategy are inseparable from its business outcomes. We are pleased that they have chosen to standardize on CA Release Automation to accelerate automation in their development processes, driving faster speed and improved quality.","The decision was made to expand CA Release Automation across the Enterprise after achieving success with initial implementations. Our solution takes manual steps out of the development and deployment of applications. This allows the customer to broadly benefit from the reduced time, cost and risk associated with application development. This opportunity came on the heels of our Release Automation Continuous Delivery Edition, or CDE, which was made available in February.","This is a great example of how our organic efforts can create customer value which culminate in new and expanding opportunities for CA. Specifically, Release Automation CDE is an easily configurable, visual and strategic control point for optimizing processes, teams and applications. It supports collaboration and increases visibility while connecting delivered content with business goals.","As these customer examples demonstrate, the breadth and composition of our portfolio have become one of CA's competitive advantages. We remain committed to accelerating organic innovation. We are focused on creating meaningful solutions that are easier to install, easier to use, and easier to manage. With the rollout of Agile Central across our development organization now essentially complete, we expect a more frequent cadence of higher quality releases that delight, inspire and enable our customers.","While organic innovation remains a priority, I'm pleased to say that our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, now known as CA Agile Central and CA Privileged Access Management, or PAM respectively exceeded their business cases and our expectations. We believe our disciplined, strategic, and methodical approach to acquisitions and our thoughtful and deliberate integration execution is bearing fruit. They are enhancing our ability to provide valuable solutions to our customers.","We are establishing a growing portfolio of products that are scalable, easy to install, and easy to manage. This, in turn, will accelerate our ability to sell into our Named and Growth or Partner-led opportunities. For example, in the quarter we won a competitive deal with CA Privileged Access Management at an iconic American health care and consumer products company. Following a proof-of-concept, this customer was pleasantly surprised by their ability to rapidly deploy our CA PAM solution and quickly demonstrate value.","Similarly, we closed an API Management transaction with one of the largest SaaS companies in the world. After observing the value of CA API Management at one of its acquired companies, a decision was made to expand its footprint. It is expected that billions of transactions will run through our API Management software by the end of the year.","Another Named account win in the quarter was with a multi-national pharmaceutical company that has chosen CA Project & Portfolio Management SaaS for its IT operations and, interestingly, its M&A activities. We view all three of these examples as beachheads from which we can grow our relationships, provide increased value with our broader set of solutions, and successfully execute our land-and-expand strategy.","Our sales strategy, specifically the separation of Platinum from Named, Growth and Partner-led accounts is working. Though, we are fully aware that there are areas around consistency and execution that we can continue to improve. On the marketing front, we have made considerable progress to strengthen the image of CA's brand. There is strong evidence that our marketing programs are positively impacting consideration and accelerating our ability to build demand pipeline for our products.","As you may have seen, we are engaged in a technology partnership with CNN in its coverage of the presidential election. CNN is leveraging our technology to enable a new app, CNN Politics, built with CA API Management and CA Mobile App Analytics. This enhances CNN's ability to provide their audience with a rich and immersive election experience, enabling them to more directly engage in one of the biggest conversations of the year in the U.S. and around the globe.","We are making strides in changing the trajectory of CA. There are things we are proud of with regard to our execution in FY 2016, and there are areas where I know we can continue to improve. We are making progress, but as I said before, progress is not linear. We will continue to manage the business with thoughtful discipline and continue to do what's in the best interest of our customers, employees and shareholders over the long-term.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our fourth quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter and the fiscal year. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","Our Q4 total revenue was $1.01 billion dollars and was up 1%. Enterprise Solutions increased 6%, Mainframe Solutions declined 2%, and Services were flat. Fiscal 2016 total revenue was $4.03 billion, in-line with our guidance of down 1% to flat. Enterprise Solutions were up 2%, Mainframe was down 2%, and Services declined 3%. Q4 renewals were down approximately 10% and down low teens as reported.","As Mike stated, we realized a number of renewal transactions earlier in the fiscal year, leaving less to close in Q4. This year-over-year change in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Q4 total new product and capacity sales were down high-single digits and approximately 10% as reported. The acquisition of Rally and Xceedium contributed high-single digits to new sales in constant currency and as reported.","In the quarter, freestanding Enterprise Solutions new sales increased mid-single digits and increased low-single digits as reported. Named and Partner-led business increased low-single digits in constant currency and declined low-single digits as reported.","Our Q4 new sales performance was impacted by the headwinds of a smaller renewal portfolio as well as considerably shorter contract duration than we had experienced in recent years. Weighted average subscription and maintenance duration in Q4 was 2.66 years, down from 3.76 years in Q3, and the lowest it's been in recent quarters. Shorter duration in the quarter was driven by the composition of the portfolio that was up for renewal. The shorter average duration has the impact of reducing the stated total value of bookings.","To reiterate Mike's earlier comments, our new sales performance also reflects our discipline and general unwillingness to close deals earlier in the absence of compelling metrics for the sake of any quarter or year, for that matter.","For the year, total new sales were up low-teens and organic new sales were up mid-single digits. As reported, total new sales were up mid-single digits, and organic new sales were down low-single digits for the year. As Mike mentioned, this is the third year in a row of notable organic new sales improvement.","Fiscal 2016 renewals were up approximately 30%, and up mid-20s% as reported, in-line with our expectations. Excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q2, renewals were up high-single digits and low-single digits as reported. Renewal yield during the quarter was in the mid-90s%. Taking the average of the four quarters in the year, the renewal yield was just above 90%. We expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up mid-single digits year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported.","Turning to geographies, Q4 new sales were down across all the regions. New sales in North America and EMEA, our two largest regions, were particularly impacted by the renewal portfolio during the quarter. However, for the full year, excluding the impact of currency, new sales were up in all of the geographies, with the exception of APJ.","As reported, new sales were up in North America and Latin America and down in EMEA and APJ.","Within our segments, Q4 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down approximately 10% in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Areas such as API Management, Agile Central, PPM, and Release Automation contributed to new sales in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhance portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisitions contributed high-single digits in the quarter.","FY 2016 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up high-single digits in constant currency and up low-single digits as reported. Excluding the acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, Enterprise Solutions' new sales in FY 2016 were down low-single digits in constant currency and down high-single digits as reported.","In our Mainframe segment, Q4 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down low-single digits in constant currency, and down mid-single digits as reported, in-line with our renewal portfolio. Fiscal 2016 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were up in the mid-20s% in constant currency, and up in the high-teens as reported. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue to decline in the low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in-line with the mainframe market.","Services revenue was flat in Q4 and declined 3% for the year. Over the longer-term, as our products become easier to install and we're able to better leverage partners, we expect our Services revenue will not experience the growth we anticipate from our software solutions.","Current revenue backlog was down 1% in constant currency, and was impacted by a lower renewal portfolio, as discussed earlier. Current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low-90%s renewal yield.","Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Fiscal 2016 segment operating margins were 10% for Enterprise Solutions, 61% for Mainframe Solutions, and 7% for Services.","Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31%, our GAAP tax rate was 35%, and our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were 29%.","Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.60, up 21% year-over-year. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.43, up 6% year-over-year. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.41, up 36%. Fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.78, up 13%.","Our Q4 CFFO was $471 million, flat year-over-year. Single installment cash payments were $130 million and down year-over-year. Fiscal 2016 CFFO was $1.03 billion, up 9% and above our guidance of 2% to 7% year-over-year growth.","We ended Q4 with approximately $720 million in net cash. During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, consistent with our plan following the accelerated share repurchase in the prior quarter. We paid $104 million in dividends. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $707 million in shares and paid $429 million in dividends, which in total represents over 100% of our free cash flow. We expect to begin to execute against our existing $750 million share repurchase authorization through the course of fiscal 2017. At a minimum, we plan to offset dilution, and we maintain the flexibility to change pace opportunistically and due to market conditions.","Turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2016, and does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Total revenue is expected to be flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.04 billion to $4.08 billion. We expect a full-year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a full-year GAAP operating margin of 30%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 29%.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.51 to $2.56. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 3% to 6%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.92 to $1.97.","At year-end, we expect approximately 410 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. We expect the share count to be a few million shares higher sequentially in Q1 due to annual stock grants and then trend down through the course of the year.","Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 1% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations from my side. Two quick questions and then one follow-up for Rich. Mike, so you've been \u2013 actually, for full year we kind of start to see that ES growth is kind of balancing out the slight decline that we saw in maintenance. Can you talk a little bit about your priorities now that that first stage is achieved for the next year or two?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thank you, Raimo. The priorities haven't changed. We have a strategy that we rolled every \u2013 it's a three-year rolling strategy, and our strategy right now really hasn't changed. We want to continue to get better consistency on sales execution, which I think we're improving each and every quarter. The relationships we have are getting deeper and our penetration into each account is getting better.","Secondly is, as you know, I'm a big believer for a software company that organic development has to be a priority. I'm very impressed with the traction that the team has. I think this release \u2013 the next probably 45 days we'll have somewhere between 10 and 14 new releases of our software out. Some of this is net new products. So the organic engine is starting to \u2013 is really starting to cook, and we're going to continue to put as much fuel into that fire as possible.","We've been very disciplined in acquisitions, and the acquisitions that we have purchased all have beat their plans that we put in place when we bought them. We'll continue to be very focused on having the discipline to pick the things that fit within our strategy rather than chasing deals. And we're going to continue to focus on developing talent inside the company and acquiring talent to help us move forward.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. And then, Mike you've talked a lot about sales execution this quarter. It could have been even better. What makes you so sure that's not the economy? Because if I look at everyone else, like SAP had trouble. Microsoft had trouble. A lot of the established software companies had problems this quarter. What makes you so sure it's you rather than the economy?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think, first of all, our Head of Sales, Adam Elster, is a very disciplined executive and has his finger on the pulse of our global sales operations. And at the end of the quarter, we had a number of slipped deals that we thought should have closed in the quarter. And I think if we would had the relationships at the right level and we would've understood the buying patterns of those particular customers at the level of detail that we should have, I think we would have understood where those deals fit in the forecast.","Secondly is, we're not just training our sales force, we're training our customers. If you take a look at a number of deals it was our year-end, the trajectory or the pattern recognition of our customers is that CA would be desperate and be more willing to take weaker economics on deals. And if you take a look at the work that Rich Beckert and Adam did, we just did not bring deals from FY 2017 into FY 2016 to make a quarter or to make a year. And I think that that trains both our sales force and it trains our customers that we are not going to give up on value that we think we have, especially with our new products.","So, I think we can turn the crank on execution a little bit better. And I think that we have a great set of metrics and a great set of experiences in Q4 that show us areas where we can improve. And I can tell you, our sales force is absolutely committed to improving.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. And last question from me. Renewal pool \u2013 sorry, the duration that you saw this quarter looked very low, and you said the reason was renewal pool. Is there anything structural going on? Or, was it really just that? And it will normalize in the next year again? Thank you.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, the Q4 was 2.66 years which is a very low renewal, but what people need to understand is the portfolio that was to be renewed, was predominantly ES. And so, therefore, the mainframe transactions tend to go a little longer. When it's more of an ES, there are a couple more transactions that would be one or two years in duration that pull that down.","The other part of that though, even though the renewal portfolio is a little bit lighter, kind of going back to what Mike had talked about. The main part of our business continued to grow again, so we've now had every quarter where Named continues to grow and our ES freestanding actually grew mid-single digits. So we actually had some bright spots inside the portfolio for the quarter, but the overall what was to be renewed, a lot of it was renewed in Q3 and in Q2. So it kind of came in just as we'd anticipated, as what we have said on our last call at the end of Q3. And yes, it is a low renewal duration, but all that really shows is just when you have a little less mainframe, they go a little less in length.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you. Well done.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. I have a question for Rich and then, a follow-up for Mike. Rich, I think you said that 2017 renewals will be up mid-single digits, so I just want to clarify does that include that large SI deal of last year? Or, does that exclude that?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","No, including that large SI, year-over-year, will be up mid-single digits. So it is a very healthy year, in-line with what we've told everyone back in November.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Yup. Okay. I wanted to make sure. Thank you. And Mike, I really appreciate some of the commentary around ongoing self-evaluation and fast-learning and some of those comments. And, you reported decent results this quarter, but it's good to hear you sort of self-reflective here. And then as you know and we know, to really put up sustainable modest growth which is the goal, you need to sign more new business than attrition on an annualized basis anyway \u2013 the annual business.","And I guess \u2013 and that didn't happen this quarter. But, on the slipped deals, was there a meaningful amount of new business in those deals, and was there any \u2013 I know part of the renewal portfolio being down this quarter was because of early renewals in prior quarters. Were there \u2013 obviously, there's less early renewals, but were there any material or early renewals this quarter?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Long question. I'll try to summarize it. There's multiple things happening in the sales environment. I'll give you the macro, then I'll let Rich talk about some specific areas. First of all, we are in a very competitive space, which means if you are going to be competing for business, you have to bring your compete level up, which means that you have to have intimate knowledge of your accounts, and you have to have intimate knowledge of our products in those accounts.","Areas where I thought deals slipped, I think that we should have known more and we should have relationships at higher levels and at a more detailed cadence. And I think that those are things we can work on.","Now, if you look on a global basis, we have lots and lots of transactions that absolutely follow that, but we have to \u2013 in the words of Vince Lombardi, you don't do things right some of the time. You do things right all the time. And in our competitive space, Enterprise Software, we have to be more consistent on a global basis, and I think that we have an opportunity to turn the crank up on that a little bit.","Now, the second part, to your point, is in our Named business. Our Named business, definitely we had more transactions, and we're continuing to see the volume of that pick up, John. And I think over time, that's where we're going to see the upside that we're really looking for is getting those net new customers with the land-and-expand transaction.","If you look at the two examples, I specifically picked two examples in my prepared remarks that our small transactions that end up being multibillion dollar transactions. And this is what we're training our sales force to do, and we're also training our customers to understand how to look at CA in the context of some of our new software. Rich has some detail on some the renewal portfolio that he can bring you up to speed on.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","So, two things, I think if you look at it annualized, John, you'd see we're up low-single digits. The second thing, when you look at the ES freestanding, as I said earlier, so that means deals sold outside of the renewal were actually up mid-single digits which says we're growing with the market.","And then the last part was the Named and Partners. The volume actually is up quite a bit year-over-year double-digit. Even when you back out the smaller, let's say, the old Rally smaller transactions, we're still up double-digit. So, as Mike said, the land-and-expand that we saw in Q4, that we were populating a lot of customers with smaller transaction sizes. So, we're actually okay with how we thought that went.","So, in general, this quarter behaved exactly how we thought it would.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.","James Wesman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. It's James Wesman filling in for Michael. Mike, I wanted to touch on APM. I was just wondering how its performance was in the quarter relative to your guided expectations?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","APM pretty much hit where we thought it would. For us, there is a lot of renewal and renewal capacity in that business. And when we took a look at the renewals and it was up for capacity expansion, up for renewal, it pretty much hit where we want it to. That is a product that we continue to see as an entr\u00e9e into getting into net new accounts. If you take a look at the work we've done with CNN and the CNN mobile app. That's the APM mobile technology, and we're getting an awful lot of play, and an awful lot of leads as people want to understand what CNN did and how they're able to get that application up and running as sophisticated as it is and as quickly as they did.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","It's a good example of organic growth that we did with that application, and we are seeing a good pipeline build.","James Wesman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And I appreciate it. And then, Rich, just a housekeeping question. For the past two quarters or so, you had disclosed what Rally's paid growth was. What was it in the fiscal fourth quarter?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","So, we said we would start to downplay that, but it was still in the mid-20s%. So, it was still a very healthy growth. The reason why \u2013 as we said earlier, that we will stop talking about that next year, as we start to hit some of our larger accounts, that number is going to get very large, very quickly and we don't believe that will be a good metric. But for the quarter, it was still up in the mid-20s% for paid seats.","James Wesman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the Enterprise Solutions, as SaaS and some of the newer products continue to grow as a percent of ES, when do you think we could see a tipping point when we could begin to see sustained organic growth in constant currency within the ES product suite? Based on your guidance, it would appear to be this year, fiscal 2017. Is that correct?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're going to \u2013 it's kind of hard to guide on that because of the size of our Mainframe portfolio. But if you take a look at this quarter, the growth in the ES segment surpassed what we saw on the Mainframe. And we can't predict based on the renewal yield that happening every quarter. But, Michael, that's absolutely the goal. And as we build more organic products and as we continue to look at smart acquisitions, I don't think it'll be very long before we see that as the constant state of affairs at CA.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great. And then, on Mainframe. Can you maybe comment on the pricing environment for MIPS in the most recent quarters? I know that mix was a large factor, but I'm curious on how the pricing environment has been for you guys compared to prior Mainframe cycles on an apples-to-apples basis.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","It's been pretty consistent. I think two things that we've seen and, in fact, the fact that we had a lighter Q4 from renewals demonstrated there was a surge of requirements from our customers that they wanted to do transactions in Q2 and Q3, because they were topping out of the top of their contracts. We will probably start to see that again next year. And as far as price pressures, we're not seeing the same type of price pressures we had seen with some of our competitors before they went private.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks. Rich, I'm wondering if you could update us on how much of your new business is still driven by the renewal cycle? And then also, I wasn't quite clear on the dependency of new business on duration of renewals, or you talked about a dependency there? Is that just more Mainframe business which has higher duration was not as strong this quarter, and therefore, you didn't have as much new business from Mainframe?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","That's correct. So the Mainframe portion of that was really just a statement of what was to be renewed, and we had multiple contracts that were very heavy on the ES portfolio. And as I had said earlier, the freestanding part of our \u2013 for the ES portfolio was actually up mid-single digits. So we thought that performed fairly well as a standalone function.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And how much is that freestanding piece? Is that 10%, 30%, 50%? Just trying to get a sense as to how much of the new business is freestanding at this point?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","We don't give that out, Walter, publicly.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I thought I'd try. And then, Mike, on the sales and marketing. You talked about the higher velocity model and trying to drive more business from getting the digital marketing engine going and getting land-and-expand-type deals that are smaller, but turn into more over time. Can you update us on how that's doing? Maybe how much that channel is growing for you? And where you think you are in terms of its development?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think we're still in the early stage of it. We have a number of products that fit that mold well. We actually sold a completely sales unassisted piece of software just recently. I'm not sure if \u2013 that probably happened in the beginning of this quarter with Waffle (36:15) \u2013 it sits on top of GitHub. I think we have 11,000 developers or so using that product. It was something that we put out for free and we just started adding features and functions that make it have some value, and that was a completely seamless digital transaction where it had no sales assist. So the first time we've done that. And that's a great indication of getting those pipes built because we really do believe that there is going to be a portion of our portfolio that has to be that seamless in our ability to use it that way. But it's going to take some time.","When you take a look at the flagship-type products, take a look at PPM. It's number one in its category, pure-play, on-demand software that is heralded by customers all over the world and has the scale to do the project and portfolio management. Rally is on a great SaaS platform. We continue to be amazed at how thoughtful that team put together that platform and how easy it is for our sales force, especially in renewals, to go hit a button and be able to see how many users are using the system at any moment in time, and we'll continue to be building this out with some of our new incubations based on the Rally platform. So, I think we're in really good shape from an innovation point of view. It's about building out these applications on those platforms.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then just last one, Rich, on the billings backlog, the current billings backlog, I believe, still declined on a constant currency basis. I know you said it could turn pretty quickly, and we shouldn't focus too much on it. But, any sense as to when that metric will turn, because that does seem like that's pretty important to getting cash flow growing sustainably.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Right. So if you were to look at the billings backlog in the quarter, it was minus 3% for the current. Just next year, what is to be renewed, because we already told you it's going to be in the mid-single digits year-over-year, causes a headwind of about that size, just to give you a magnitude. So a lot of the headwind that you're seeing in the current portion of billings is just what's to be coming in the next 12 months.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. I'll follow-up offline on that one. Thanks. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Rich, just continuing on that comment you just made. Should we expect your current revenue backlog to turn \u2013 growth rate to turn positive next year? Because if it is that renewal that's coming up, which is a headwind, should we expect that metric to turn over the next few quarters?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","It will start to turn as the year goes on, but we're not going to give quarterly guidance as to when that would turn. But we continue to see that moving in the right direction. So, it is currently a headwind that will eventually turn into a tailwind as we go forward.","And so the growth of our new sales will help. There are certain customers, as you know, some of the Rally customers where they're really (39:19) one year at a time, so they don't even fall into that. But in general, we see that flattening out. And as I was trying to give you guys some headlights there, we have at least a 3% headwind just of what's coming into the portfolio. And you can see the current is down minus 3%. So, I think you can kind of figure it out.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","That's it. Thank you. And, Mike, you mentioned in your comments that you will be agile and deliberate going forward in terms of dealing with new product sales. Can you please elaborate on that? What do you mean by that? And, what steps are you taking to drive more sales outside of the renewal cycle? And also, can you talk about the sustainability of growth rate beyond fiscal 2017? What gives you confidence in that?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I'll do the last question first because it's the easiest. As we continue to make the portfolio more attractive where nothing is getting funded internally and our IT department is not being built using the agile methodology and the principles around that build, it has to be easy to use, easy to install, lower cost of ownership and easy to upgrade. So, right from the get go, those are the design principles being put into everything that we're doing from an organic perspective. And that also goes with respect to new releases.","So, new releases have a very strong part of the engineering to make sure that they're easy to upgrade. With a portfolio as large as ours, it's going to take time to get most of the portfolio into that state. But everything that we're doing right now, and every single project is fully loaded into Agile Central. So, we feel we've got great headlights into all the projects that are going on, and we're truly only building things that matter. I think that the headlights into what's happening into development is the best it's been in the history of this company for sure and better than most companies I've seen. And I've been in this business an awful long time.","So, I do think that what we're building really matters and we're going to see a lot more organic development. Now, that's going to have a knock-on effect to our sales productivity. And right now, some of our products require a fair bit of skill and a long sales cycle just due to the complexity of the product and the problem it solves.","But as we start to think through that over time and we get releases out there that are easier to use, easier to sell, easier to upgrade, I think the amount of time it takes and the amount of total head count to sell a particular transaction goes down. Take a look at Xceedium, our PAM solution. That is a solution that has a lower cost of sale, easy to implement, and high value in short period of time for the customer. Rally, similar. As we start getting more and more of those solutions into the marketplace with our sales team, we're going to see benefits both on the volume and velocity of sales and we're also going to see that in the cost of sales.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","That helps. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks, guys. I apologize if this was asked, but I was having some connectivity issues. Looking at the...","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry we're having trouble hearing you.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is that any better?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Looking at the bookings, could you quantify how much impact shorter duration had on some of them.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I apologize. You're cutting out.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How about that? Any better?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you quantify how much impact does shorter duration had on the bookings.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Can we quantify \u2013 say it again please?","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What's the shorter duration \u2013 the impact it had on the total bookings (43:26)","Traci T. Tsuchiguchi - Vice President-Investor Relations","Quantify the impact...","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Can we quantify how much of the shorter duration of the 2.6 years, I think that's what you're asking. It's high-single digit improvement if you were to normalize that year-over-year.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. I'll take the rest offline. Thanks, guys.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell from JMP Securities.","Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about operating margins, and specifically, Enterprise Solutions' operating margins? They ended the year at 10%, and I know there was an impact from Rally. So I guess, first, could you quantify the final impact of Rally on the operating margins for the year? And then, as we think about ES margins for next year, I know that's an area where you have a glide-path to better margins than 10% so I was just wondering if you could touch on that in a little bit more detail? Thanks.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","So I believe the first part of your question is what do we believe the margin impact was for Rally and it was approximately 1 point. And so we were able to \u2013 as Mike said earlier, a lot of the good work that's been done inside of development is that reprioritizing that we were able to reprioritize that. And the second part of your question if you could repeat because you were also a little bit choppy, please.","Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC","Yeah. Sorry I'm on a landline, so I think it's something to do with the connection. But, the ES margins for FY 2017, how we should think about the leverage in that business. I know at the Analyst day it was a topic of discussion that there was a lot of room for improvement in ES operating margins.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Right. And as you know we don't give guidance out by segment, but we can tell you as we work through what we had said back on Analyst Day is they would lose money last year and they'd be breakeven this year. So, you can kind of figure that out that you'll have a benefit in the ES segment going into this year. So, we've really worked out the fact that they'll be breakeven throughout the course of this year and then they'll just improve from there.","Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. And quick second question if you guys can hear me. On the Q3 earnings call, Xceedium had a really strong quarter. I think it was its strongest quarter ever, and I was just wondering if that momentum continued from Q3 into Q4? Or if that \u2013 if security was a little light, too? Or, if you're pretty happy with how Xceedium ended up for the year?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Xceedium continued to do well, and as Mike had said, right on track with the business case, in fact ahead of the business case. We were very happy with how they performed in the quarter and for the year, and the build-out of their pipeline that we see, and we're just now starting to get started in places like Europe. So that's a very bright product for us.","Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. It's Ben Hoffman (46:51) on for Kirk Materne. I just wanted to circle back on the organic new sales. You mentioned they were down low-single digits for the year. Can you discuss how much of the decline is related to sales execution versus perhaps a shift to a SaaS model? Is there something around with the more mature products in the Enterprise segment that's weighing on growth?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. On the organic sales for the year, we're up, it was just for the quarter that they were down. So, we're pretty impressed with our ability to sell these new solutions and some of the existing solutions we've had for a while in an organic fashion. So, this is actually a bright spot for us.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Right. We grew with the market in our organic business for the full year.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned it would take a few quarters of new sales growth and solid renewals to get current backlog back to growth. Is there anything you all that need to do or are planning to do structurally with the Enterprise product portfolio or the sales force to achieve that at this point?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","So there's a \u2013 actually there's a lot of things that are going on inside CA, some of it I'll talk about and some Mike will talk about. But a lot of what we're doing with our customers when we have a whole group of people to make sure that good customer satisfaction is going on. The second part of that is we've done a lot of reaching out to customers who were dissatisfied to find out why they were dissatisfied. And what we find with that is sometimes it has to do with their install, how it was installed, did they even install it? By coming back around with them later on, what we're seeing is a better uptick in our renewals.","If you noticed this quarter, we had a mid-90s% renewal which is a very strong renewal quarter. And for the year, on average of those four quarters, we were at around 90%. So as long as we continue to see that track that way, as long as a lot of things, Mike, talked about earlier, your ability to install continue, we believe that we'll continue to have \u2013 the renewal yield stay up in that range. And as long as we grow with the market like we talked about back in November, we think we'll be on track.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And this whole notion of customer experience is something that the company has completely adopted, and it goes way past just what's happening on the product space. For example, we have a team that goes through that is not in development and\/or sales crawling back into some of our customers in the finance organization, in the HR organization, just pulling customers to see what they think of CA and what they could do following the Net Promoter Score algorithm.","We're also making sure that for every single customer that calls the helpdesk, especially with a high severity issue, that they're getting turnaround time in four hours. Our Net Promoter Score have gone up each and every quarter for the last seven quarters since we've been tracking it, and I think the whole company focused on this is making a big difference.","On the development side, we separated a full group out that's called customer experience. And what they're doing is they're doing all the user design, as well as the usability of the product, of new product development.","So having a centralized group making sure that a product that gets put into the market is easy to use, easy to understand and easy to install. I think it's going to have a lot of dividends going forward, and what we've seen from what that group has been able to do so far, we're very impressed.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Gregoire for closing comments.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you, again, for joining us this afternoon. I'd like to leave you with a few takeaways. First, we delivered very solid FY 2016 results, with most of our performance metrics coming in-line or above the high-end of our guidance. Q4 revenue, for the first time, on the top-line, has grown in nearly four years, and we expect to cross into modest growth in FY 2017.","We're making very good progress in our journey to drive the long-term sustainable growth as we continue to manage the business with thoughtful discipline and do what's in the best interest of our customers, shareholders, employees for the long-term.

Welcome to CA Technologies' first quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer, and Kieran McGrath, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Kieran will offer some prepared remarks and then we'll open up the call for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Wednesday, August 2 over the telephone and the Internet.

Please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin the discussion of our Q1 performance, we recognize that there have been rumors and speculation around M&A transactions. Our policy is not to comment on rumors and speculation.","We are confident in the progress that we have made towards achieving sustainable, profitable growth over the medium-term planning horizon. We believe that we have a strategy in place that will result in long-term value for our shareholders. Management and the board regularly evaluate and pressure test our assumptions and consider risk-adjusted strategies to realize long-term shareholder value. We will not respond to any questions about rumored M&A transactions or speculate about future transactions.","Now turning to our first quarter performance, I am pleased that the momentum from fiscal year 2017 continued into our first fiscal quarter. Revenue, operating margin, earnings and CFFO all came in above our expectations. Following strong performance in fiscal 2017, our first quarter revenue and earnings results have given us a great start to the new year. Our Q1 performance increases our confidence, and we are very pleased to be in a position to raise our fiscal 2018 guidance.","The upside relative to our expectations was driven largely by better-than-anticipated performance from our recent acquisitions, as well as continued discipline around expense control. As expected, all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales, were significantly impacted by the very difficult compare relative to the year-ago period.","Recall that in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we renewed a large system integrator early at the customer's request. It's worth mentioning that even outside of the large SI, our renewal portfolio in the quarter was smaller than in the year-ago period. While new sales were down because of this dynamic, total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales, and organic Enterprise Solutions new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the mid-90s.","Mainframe new sales were particularly impacted by the difficult year-over-year compare. That said, we are very pleased with the continued strong performance from newer products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence. The pivot we have made towards more of a solution-based sale is gaining traction, as we are now more succinctly articulating our ability to help customers solve specific challenges. Our focus on quality, our zero defect policy, and our SKU simplification efforts with our Mainframe business unit reflect our ongoing commitment to drive continuous improvement.","The investments we are making in customer experience and customer success has consistently increased CA's Net Promoter Score, or NPS, an industry standard measure of customer loyalty. In Q1, CA's NPS score improved dramatically compared to the year-ago period. The percentage of customers that consider CA to be a strategic partner increased, our customer satisfaction scores continue to rise, and customers are rating our product quality higher.","Leading industry analysts are also recognizing CA's innovative product development and strong ability to execute. In the quarter, CA was positioned as a Leader in the June 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. The report evaluated CA's broad identity and access management portfolio, along with the company's ability to execute and completeness of vision. CA was also named a Leader in the May 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Project Portfolio Management, Worldwide. The report evaluated CA Project & Portfolio Management and positioned CA highest in the Leaders quadrant for Ability to Execute.","Also in the quarter, CA was named a Leader in the April 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Agile Planning Tools. This report evaluated CA Agile Central, an enterprise-class platform purpose-built for scaling agile development practices. This recognition is great validation of the work our development teams are doing every day.","In the quarter, our API Management team, which delivered very strong new sales growth, released new versions of API Developer Portal and API Management SaaS. By integrating the data analytics engine that exited the CA Accelerator, our VC-like technology incubator, the total cost of ownership is lowered. Its single, cloud-native code base enables same-day delivery for SaaS, hybrid-cloud, and on-premise versions.","The team also launched a microservices solution to help developers and enterprise architects create and deploy microservices and manage the APIs that connect and orchestrate microservices. Docker container deployment options are now available across a number of products within the API Management portfolio, and expanded integrations have been made across CA's product portfolio to address management, security, and advanced monitoring of APIs for modern architectures across any enterprise or cloud environment.","Now, turning to our recent acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the rate and pace of integration and the Q1 performance of both Automic and Veracode. This upside relative to our expectations drove better-than-expected performance for CA overall in our fiscal first quarter. To date, the Automic team has already built integrations across a number of CA products, including Agile Central, Continuous Delivery Director, Service Desk, Test Data Manager, BlazeMeter and Service Virtualization. There will be more to come.","Campaigns are now underway to promote these solutions to both historical Automic customers and historical CA customers to leverage existing relationships and cross-sell. The response we've seen in these early days is very encouraging. The Automic platform integrated across CA's portfolio is highly synergistic and has the opportunity to create tremendous value.","Similarly, the Veracode development team has been working very closely with its CA counterparts to further build out its platform to complement CA's portfolio and accelerate volume across the Veracode platform. The strategic alignment with the Veracode acquisition is ideal, as it sits squarely at the intersection between DevOps and security. We are very happy with the progress made so far, and we're thrilled by the opportunities that lie ahead.","After making some minor tweaks to the sales organization at the beginning of the quarter, we did not see any meaningful consequences to sales productivity. As expected, new sales for the Enterprise sales group, formerly referred to as our Platinum sales team, plus our largest Named customer group, declined year-over-year due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. New sales for the Enterprise customer group were significantly impacted by mainframe capacity. We are pleased that both the public sector and the global commercial accounts grew new sales at a healthy clip.","As we've said in the past, we are an agile organization. Following the pivot we made in the sales organization last quarter, we are actively looking for opportunities to improve the way in which we operate. We are wholly committed to the concept of continuous improvement and are convinced that we can drive even stronger profitability and cash flow in the years ahead.","I'd also like to be the first to invite you to CA World in Las Vegas. It's a great opportunity to see the breadth of our product portfolio, talk to our customers, and spend time with the broader executive team. We will host an analyst event there on November 15. We hope to see many of you there.","Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our ability to take our full-year guidance higher. As the momentum from the very strong fiscal Q4 and fiscal year 2017 has continued into the early part of fiscal 2018, we have increased confidence that these positive data points are beginning to form a trend.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our first quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","As Mike mentioned, overall we were very pleased with our fiscal first quarter performance. Revenue, operating margin, EPS and CFFO all came in above our expectations. As noted on our last quarter's earnings call, we faced a very difficult compare in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the renewal of a large transaction with a system integrator in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This was particularly evident in all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales, in the quarter. Renewal portfolio size and duration heavily influence booking metrics, given the opportunity renewals provide to generate new product sales.","Q1 total new sales were down in the mid-20s, and organic new sales were down in the mid-30s. Excluding the impact of the large SI, total new sales were up approximately 10%, and organic new sales were down in the high-single digits. Total organic new sales, excluding the large SI, were impacted by the lighter renewal portfolio compared to the year-ago period and commensurate lower mainframe capacity.","The total renewal portfolio was down in the high-50s compared to the year-ago period. As we have stated on our prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. As Mike mentioned, even excluding the large SI, the size of the renewal portfolio was lower by approximately 30% as reported and high-20s in constant currency. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-90s percent range.","Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter, compounded by the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were down in the mid-50s. Mainframe new sales were negatively impacted by the size of the renewal portfolio and related capacity sales in the period. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with the ongoing strength of our organically-developed mainframe products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence, both of which contributed to Mainframe new product sales in the quarter.","Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low-single digits and organically were down in the low-20s. Excluding the impact from the large SI, organic Enterprise Solutions new sales were up slightly in the quarter, in spite of the lighter renewal portfolio. We believe this dynamic demonstrates the recent improvements we've made, both from a product and go-to-market perspective, are beginning to materialize.","As Mike mentioned, the recent acquisitions of Automic and Veracode performed very well in the quarter and exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased by the rate and pace of both product and operational integrations, and are enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for both acquisitions.","Total revenue for the first quarter was $1.025 billion, up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 6 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 12%, both as reported and in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectation for the overall mainframe market. Services revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. As our solutions have become easier to install, deploy and manage, by design, our service revenue has been impacted. That said, we believe the rate of decline in services revenue will begin to abate in the second half of the year.","Total revenue backlog was up 2%, while current revenue backlog improved 6%, both as reported and in constant currency. Around 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. The remaining 2% was driven by organic factors, including the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months. As we've said on prior earnings calls, we expect that current revenue backlog will grow with more consistency after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield.","Q1 GAAP operating margin was 26% and non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Segment operating margin in the quarter was 65% for Mainframe Solutions, 8% for Enterprise Solutions, and 1% for services. In the quarter, Enterprise Solutions margins were impacted by acquisition-related factors. Mainframe margins came in above our longer-term target. This reflects company-wide efforts to decrease corporate-level expenses that result in generally improved margins across all segments, as well as the revenue mix shift and associated expenses to the Enterprise Solutions segment.","Our Q1 GAAP tax rate was 25% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42, down 11% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61, down 5% as reported and down 3% in constant currency. Our Q1 CFFO was $298 million, up 54% as reported and up 52% in constant currency. The improvement in CFFO is primarily attributable to single-installment cash payments, which were $194 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year.","We ended the quarter with approximately $44 million in net cash. We paid $107 million in dividends in the quarter. We did not execute any share repurchases in the quarter. As such, we have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will, at least, offset dilution with our share repurchase program.","With regard to ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard that we intend to adopt in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, you will see in our 10-Q filing tomorrow that we currently plan to use the modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, we are simultaneously considering ways in which to improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business.","Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. Given the continued momentum and outperformance of most key metrics relative to our expectations in the first quarter, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the full year.","For the full year, we now expect total revenue to increase by approximately 4%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.20 billion to $4.23 billion, and compares to our previous guidance of up 2% to 3% as reported, and up 3% to 4% in constant currency. In terms of revenue linearity throughout the year, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in constant currency will be between 3% and 4% in the first half of the fiscal year, with the second half of the year averaging constant currency between 4% and 5%.","We expect our full-year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27%, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76, and compares to our previous guidance of down 10% to 7% as reported and down 8% to 6% in constant currency.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48, and compares to our previous guidance of down 5% to 3% as reported and down 4% to 2% in constant currency. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares.","Cash flow from operations is expected to be up 1% to 5% as reported, and flat to up 4% in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion, and compares to our previous guidance of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency.","With that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.","Mohit Gogia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Congratulations on the quarter. This is Mohit Gogia filling in for Raimo. So, you guys have been sort of like talking about pushing for selling outside of your renewal cycle over the last few quarters, and I'm just wondering if you can discuss how that initiative went on this quarter, if you can discuss that. Thank you.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Great. Well, thank you very much, Mohit. Yeah. This is something we've been really focusing on is, our ability to sell outside the renewal. And as we mentioned in the prepared comments, our renewal portfolio was approximately 60% smaller year-over-year in Q1. And even excluding the large SI deal, which we talked a lot about, our renewal portfolio was 30% smaller. I'm very pleased with how the sales team performed in selling outside of the renewal and, in fact, freestanding new sales were up organically and up significantly overall. So, well done by the sales team.","Mohit Gogia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci of Jefferies. Your line is open. John, if your telephone is muted, please unmute. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Hey. This is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. So, last quarter you talked about changing your go-to-market motion from Platinum, Gold towards more of enterprise and commercial. Did you see any particular disruption from that particular change? And any particular sales change that happened across the enterprise accounts?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","No. I mean, basically as I said in my prepared remarks, it was pretty seamless. This is something we've been thinking about and evolving over a long period of time, and these changes were more driven by how we saw the sales team perform in the different layers of accounts and the kind of support and products that we want to put into those accounts. So, I think it was a pretty seamless transition, if you could even call it that.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Okay. Thanks. And on the mainframe portion, you talked about lower mainframe sales from lower capacity. Can you remind us when is the next IBM refresh for the hardware? And any particular catalyst that you think can drive the mainframe growth from here?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. IBM has already announced the new mainframe hardware cycle. It's out and you can check their website for the press release of when all of the different components are going to be available. But we should see that at the back half of this calendar year. From our experience, there's usually a lag of several quarters since it's generally available before we start seeing capacity increases. I also think that that probably had a little bit to do with some of the softness in mainframe capacity that happened in the last quarter.","With respect to anything happening in mainframe, I think you're seeing a few things that are going our way. As both Kieran and I pointed out in our prepared remarks, we had two products that were organically built that are selling very well, and we tend to be on the right side of competitive replacements and have been for the last several quarters.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","All right. Perfect. Thank you. And congrats on a great quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Congratulations on the raise, decent quarter, a nice quarter and also raise in the guide. If you could talk a little bit \u2013 and again, I missed some of the prepared remarks, but on the securities side of the business how that's coming together. And there's been, I think, an increased emphasis on identity, in particular, both in general and also getting some help from some of the companies that have recently come public in that space. So, how has that market changed? And then also if you didn't mention it before, what was the inorganic contribution to both the revenue backlog and to revenue?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Sure. I'll hit the first part on security and that'll give Kieran a little bit of time to dig up the revenue backlog answer. Yeah. Security is a big focus for us. It's a big part of our portfolio and we are highly, highly competitive in that space. There's a lot of players in that space. Some of them have become public and we welcome them to the ongoing issues of being public, which means you have to be very specific about what your product does and you can't really extract (25:08) the performance of your products. Having said that, we spend an awful lot of time on R&D and if you take a look at various analyst reports, we're in the upper quadrant in every aspect of ability to perform, ability to execute, as well as a leadership position with respect to innovation.","The ones that I would call out, in particular, with respect to security is our Privileged Identity Management. As you mentioned, Michael, this is an extraordinarily important piece of technology. We think we have a competitive edge with respect to product functionality and, most importantly, product scale. One of the reasons why we win so much with that product is we have an unbelievable reference base. And the references we have are very large multinational huge deployments. So, when it comes to scale and the functionality required to scale, I think you see us at the top tier.","The other area is an area that we've been dominating in for an awful lot of time and that's the whole concept of Single Sign-On. We also launched a product that not only does Single Sign-On for on-prem, but we have Single Sign-On in the cloud. So, this puts us in the unique position to really pay attention to customers and what customers want. Whether they want to be managing that Single Sign-On, or that identity management solution holistically in their own data centers, whether they want to be managing it in the cloud or in many cases in which we're seeing is a hybrid environment, where they'll use our product both in the cloud and on-prem depending on the usage and what that application is doing and the security in and around that application.","With respect to backlog, I'll pass it over to Kieran.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Michael. So, overall, just to recap for you, our total revenue actually had a contribution of 6 points from the acquisitions, revenue in aggregate. ES revenue actually had 14 points of growth from the acquisitions. Our revenue backlog was up 6 points, of which 4 points of that was actually attributable to the acquisitions. And our billing backlog \u2013 or bookings, rather, total actually had 2 points of contribution from the acquisitions as well.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just a clarification, was that on the current revenue backlog and current billings backlog?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Yes, that's right. That's right. Current.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great, guys. Thanks very much. Thanks, Mike, and thanks, Kieran.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Gregoire for any closing remarks.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Great. Well, thank you very much for taking the time to meet with us today. We really are pleased with the momentum we've had coming out of our fiscal 2017 and it's carried into the early part of fiscal 2018, with revenue, operating margin, EPS, and CFFO all coming in above our expectations. Our increased guidance reflects our strong performance in Q1 and our confidence in the coming quarters. Looking ahead, we'll continue to find ways to optimize our business and drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value. Thanks again and good night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

You've joined the CA Technologies Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jonathan Doros with Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jonathan Doros","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for a Q&A session. These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Tuesday, January 21, over the telephone and the internet. The information shared in this call is effective as of today's date and will not be updated. All content is the property of CA Technologies and is protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be reproduced or transcribed in any way without the express written consent of CA Technologies. We consider your continued participation in this call as consent to our recording.","During this call, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our fourth quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on March 14, 2014.","Before I turn the call over, I'd like to highlight that for modeling purposes our year-over-year currency headwind on revenue guidance is expected to be roughly 1 point for the full year. In addition, starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, the measure of segment expenses and segment profit was revised to treat all costs of internal software development as segment expense in the period the costs are incurred. As a result, the company adds back capitalized internal software costs and excludes the amortization of internally developed software costs previously capitalized from segment expenses. Prior periods segment expense and segment profit information have been revised to present segment profit and expense on a consistent basis. Also, in fiscal '14, the costs relating to the fiscal 2014 board approved rebalancing initiative announced in May are excluded from the company's segment expenses and segment profit.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Gregoire","Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. We had a solid third quarter driven by strong renewal business, disciplined cost control and good progress towards our long-term goals. Third quarter revenue outperformed expectations. We are increasing the midpoint of full year revenue guidance range once again. Non-GAAP operating margins during the third quarter was 39%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 37% from 36%.","As you know from a separate press release we issued today, we have made change in our executive team. George Fischer, Executive Vice President Worldwide Sales and Service is leaving CA Technologies after a 20-year career with the company. Adam Elster, who has been running our Mainframe and Customer Success organization will lead Worldwide Sales and Service effective immediately. I have had a chance to work closely with Adam for the past year and I believe he will be an excellent sales leader who will accelerate the transformation of our sales organization, reach new customers and drive growth. He is ideally suited to this new role. He has run development teams, customer success and support, service and sales on a global basis. His business and operational skills are more important than ever as we move to a more operationally key service oriented sales model. Adam also has a deep understanding about all aspects of our company and knows how to put them to work for our customers.","As I stated through my first year here at CA, we need to move to nail the core fundamentals that make software companies great. To that end, we are focused on three primary goals. Developing and delivering innovative products, increasing market and brand awareness and accelerating our sales velocity. The first goal is rooted in strong organic software development but it also includes prudent acquisitions and the integration of products into solutions that help make our customers more competitive.","Last quarter we spoke about organic development and the launch of CA Nimsoft Monitor Snap, a feature rich solution. It is free for up to 30 devices. In the 100 days since the product was introduced, 5000 customers in 147 countries downloaded Nimsoft Monitor Snap. We are tracking well ahead of our goals for downloads, installations and pipeline generation. Following on this success, we plan to expand this strategy of freemium and try and buy software to other CA product families, giving the customers the opportunity to test our software and learn more about the value we deliver.","We believe the proper use of these models will help us lower our cost of sales and sell more software to more customers. Another example of organic software development is CA Cloud Storage for System z which we launched during the quarter at the Amazon re:Invent conference. This solution allows mainframe customers to safely, securely and efficiently backup their mainframe data to Amazon Web Services at a fraction of the cost of on-premise tape or disk. Cloud storage for System z is just one of many proof points of our continued commitment to the innovation on the mainframe platform.","While organic development over the next 12 to 24 month is at the heart of our innovation strategy, we need to increase investments and innovations in markets that will drive growth in three years and beyond. To that end, we are shifting more of our R&D spend to longer term investments that will provide us with the IP to be a technology leader in future years. Some of this spend is purely organic with investments in areas such as mobility and analytics. But we are also beginning to make some external investments to help give us insight into new software technologies that fall within our addressable market.","During the third quarter for example, we invested with venture capital firm IDG Ventures India to give CA early visibility in to the many enterprise software startups in India. We are considering investments in other regions that offer similar ROI opportunities. We are making progress in recruiting the right talent and making the appropriate R&D investments to maintain and gain leadership positions in high values areas of the IT stack such as DevOps, identity management, mobility and analytics based IT business management. Look for some key product announcements in February for both mobility and security.","A good example of the progress we are making in DevOps. As you know we made two key acquisitions in the past couple of years to take a leading position in this rapidly growing market. ITKO for service virtualization and Nolio for release automation. We have seen good growth from both products year-to-date. One of our major customers is Lloyds Banking Group in the U.K. I shared the stage CA Expo in London last October with the bank's Chief Technology Officer who talked about Lloyd's success with our CA LISA solution.","What started as a single project has grown into a multimillion-dollar investment to standardize on our service virtualization solution throughout the enterprise. Our service virtualization wins this quarter were spread across multiple industries, including newer verticals such as energy, manufacturing and healthcare. These are just a few of the many proof points that show customers are recognizing CA as the clear leader in DevOps and are partnering with us to develop and deploy applications with greater speed and quality.","We also had a healthy renewal business in the third quarter, which is a testament to the value our customers place on their existing software investments with CA. This included a four-year deal worth more than $300 million with a large systems integrator, which included new sales of product such as Nimsoft Monitor. We added nearly 200 new logos during the quarter, bringing our total for the trailing 12-months to more than 580 new logos, and we saw strong performance from our two most recent acquisitions. Layer 7, which provides API management and security, and Nolio, which I mentioned earlier.","We implemented a new integration framework and execution model to make sure we continue the market momentum in both of these highly innovative companies. While I am encouraged by our performance in Q3, our marketing and sales execution is still not consistent. This is evident in our mid-single digit decline in new products and capacity sales during the quarter. We also need more consistent positive performance in our international businesses. Our recent experience has been that some regions beat their plan one quarter and then come up short the next.","As a result of our performance so far this year, we currently expect our FY '15 revenue growth rate and non-GAAP operating margin to be similar to what we are seeing in FY '14. As you have heard me say before, one of the keys to driving sales and growth is world class marketing. So we are putting a major focus on increasing our brand and market awareness, and this takes time. More IT buying decisions are being made by the business line and IT together and they do a lot of research before they even reach a vendor. As a result, a strong brand is more important than ever.","The reality is, there is a significant gap between what the market thinks CA does than what we actually do. To close this gap, we are building a stronger, more contemporary CA brand. As well as a demand engine that will emphasize new customer acquisition. If you were travelling recently, you might have seen the new, CA at the Center, banner ads at selected airports around the world. These ads feature testimonials from customers such as British Telecom, Rackspace Hosting and many others. The British Telecom ad, for example, shows how BT employs our identity management solution to authenticate every consumer that accesses online content, such as British premier football.","The Rackspace ad shows how the company leverages the CA application performance monitoring tools to ensure the uptime of its 24*7 customer services. This is a multimedia campaign that targets senior IT and business decision makers not only with airport banners, but also with visual, social and mobile ads. You can find a link to a summary of our brand campaign the Investor Relations webpage.","Marketing also made a significant contribution to the pipeline compared to last year and drove a substantial year-over-year increase in lead volumes. That brings me to our third goal, accelerate our sales velocity, especially new sales. There is no silver bullet to new sales growth but it's something that we need to get right to drive our long-term growth. Our success will come from strong, consistent execution across development, marketing and sales. We are seeing some signs of improvement in our sales execution. During Q3 for example, we had an impressive multimillion dollar win with Energy Future Holdings, a new enterprise customer. The deal combined our security, service assurance, and automation solutions to reduce risk and drive operational efficiencies. This transaction was highly competitive. We beat out IBM, Oracle and point solution vendors and demonstrated the potential of CA when we understand our customers business challenges and leverage our differentiated IP.","As I said before, building a sales model that will accelerate our growth is an evolutionary process, and I am confident Adam will provide the leadership we need to improve or execution and increase our sales velocity. Our plan to improve sales execution has three key elements. First, we need to consistently execute strategic account planning in both our direct sales force and our partner sales force. Second, we have to increase our focus on new sales and expanding our customer base. We can't drive long-term growth unless we sell more products to new and existing customers. And third, we need to sell the value of our software without the reliance on a renewal.","A critical part of extending our customer reach and accelerating sales velocity of course, is our partners. We have a thriving ecosystem of partners who have build great franchises around CA products, such as products in portfolio management, identity management and mainframe solutions. During the quarter CA signed an agreement with Northrop Grumman, a leading global security company and an IT solution provider, that will help Northrop Grumman expand its cloud-based services in the healthcare, civil government, and state and local markets. The company will use CA CloudMinder to provide customers with a secure, cost effective identity and access management station.","In addition, global systems integrators, including Wipro and Tech Mahindra, are building practices around CA LISA service virtualization for their customers. We are also strengthening the talent on our partner and alliances team. Earlier this month, we named Alyssa Fitzpatrick as our new leader of Global Alliances and Partners for CA. She joined us from McAfee and brings leadership experience needed to execute programs that will grow our revenue and advance our long-term strategic position.","I am excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. We have laid the foundation for a great software company through investments in organic engineering and the talented people that are fueling differentia products. We are strengthening our brand and marketing and we are improving our sales efforts to sell more software to more customers, directly and through partners. Now we need to accelerate the velocity of our execution.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you.","Richard Beckert","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","Q3 total revenue was $1.16 billion, down 2%. Mainframe grew 1%. Enterprise Solutions declined 5% and Services grew 4%. On an as-reported basis, Q3 renewals were up approximately 50% and include the impact from a four-year system integrator renewal. Excluding that large renewal, our Q3 renewals were up high-single digit as reported. We continue to expect fiscal 2014 renewals as compared to fiscal 2013 to be at high-single digit as reported, excluding the large customer renewal that closed in Q3. As a result, we expect our Q4 renewals to be down year-over-year as reported. Our Q3 renewal yield was in the low 90s.","Within our Q3 results, total new products and capacity sales were down mid-single digit as reported. Our Q3 new product sales performance was mixed by region and customer segment. New sales associated with renewal opportunities performed well in both North America and Latin America. North America sales outside the renewals also performed well. However, overall EMEA and APJ performance was below our expectations. In our mainframe segment, capacity declined more than 15% as reported and new product sales were down more than 20% as reported. Our new mainframe product sales and capacity growth can vary on a quarterly basis. We expect our mainframe revenue growth to be in line with historical trends.","Enterprise solutions new product sales were up low-single digits, primarily due to new sales attached to renewals and the performance of our recently acquired products, Layer 7 and Nolio. New service engagements were up 3% as reported. From a balance sheet perspective, current revenue backlog was flat. This reflects a combination of our year-to-date sales performance offset by a favorable year-over-year impact from a large system integrator renewal that is now entering our current backlog.","Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. Our segment operating margins were 62% for mainframe, 15% for enterprise solutions, and 4% for services. As Mike noted, we are raising our full year non-GAAP operating margins to 37% from 36%. Please note that we expect typical Q4 seasonality in the business along with the full impact from many of the investments we have made in the last few months.","Turning to GAAP. Our operating margin came in at 29%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.84, up 33%. Remember 26 points of growth are driven by the completion of the federal income tax exam. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, down 7%. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 14%, reflecting the completion of examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Our GAAP tax rate is 27%.","Our Q3 CFFO of $429 million was affected by the items we outlined during our investor presentation in May. Let me walk you through the year-over-year headwinds. $73 million incremental cash taxes. This includes the current year impact of the transitioning to a more balanced quarterly cash tax payment schedule. Fiscal '14 rebalancing payment of $19 million; and a reduction in capitalized software development of approximately $40 million. Single installment cash payments were down slightly year-over-year.","Current billings backlog was up 3% and impacted by similar dynamics as our current revenue backlog. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.07 billion in net cash. During the third quarter we paid $113 million in dividends and repurchased more than 4 million shares for approximately $140 million. We are authorized to repurchase an additional $167 million of common stock which is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2014.","Turning to guidance. Updated guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2013. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. Total revenue is now expected to be negative 2% to negative 1% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of negative 3% to negative 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.52 billion to $4.57 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is now expected to be in the range of 21% to 24% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of positive 17% or positive 20% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.12.","GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of negative 3% to flat in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of negative 7% to negative 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.01 to $2.08. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of negative 30% to negative 24% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $960 million to $1.04 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions.","Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 14%. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 439 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 448 million shares. For modeling purposes we would like to provide you our initial expectations for fiscal year 2015. Excluding the impact from the large customer renewal this quarter, we expect our fiscal year 2015 renewal portfolio to increase low to mid-single digits compared to fiscal year 2014. As a result of our fiscal 2014 performance, we expect our fiscal 2015 revenue growth rate to be similar to fiscal 2014. We expect our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP operating margin to also be similar to fiscal 2014.","And now I will turn the call back over to Jonathan and we will take your questions.","Jonathan Doros","Thank you, Rich. As the operator is polling for questions, I would like to inform you that CA Technologies is presenting at the I would like to inform you that CA Technologies is presenting at the Stifel Technology, Internet, and Media Conference on February 11; The Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference on March 4; the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference on March 5th; and participating in the Pacific Crest Emerging Technology DevOps Panel on March 4. In the interest of time, please limit yourself to two questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John DiFucci of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","John DiFucci - JP Morgan","A question for Mike and then a follow-up for Rich. Mike, you said that Nimsoft Monitor Snap, it sounds like you are getting good momentum with the free downloads and pipeline generation. But are you yet -- because this is sort of, this is an experiment to look at and now you are going to be doing it with some other product too. Are you yet seeing any traction as far as paid purchases of Nimsoft or is it still just too early to tell?","Michael Gregoire","No, John, it's a great question. We are seeing, as they move through pipeline progression, we are in a state with less than 10 but more than 5 transactions where we are moving from free to some level of paid purchase, or an evaluation where we are in the final stages of a selection.","John DiFucci - JP Morgan","Okay. Great. And that\u2019s what's giving you confidence to certify this model more broadly?","Michael Gregoire","It's more than that. When I take a look at how technology buyers buy, by the time they are getting ready to purchase something, they have done a fair bit of research already by reading white papers, by going to company websites. It's just a progression of people buy. And I think we have absolutely fantastic products and if we can get them to touch and feel them, see how they work, see the Christmas of the user interface, the ease of use, I think that puts in a situation where we are more competitive, not less competitive. So it's all in the evolution. And what I think happens as people try to buy software, so the more opportunities we have where a net buyer can really see the value with their own data set, in their own environment. I think that puts us at a higher competitive advantage.","So we are definitely looking at that for Nimsoft service desk sometime in the first half of this coming year. And we are also doing something similar with our perpetual products. Like if you want to do a try and buy with ITKO, we set up a lot of different proof of concepts. I would say more than 20% and probably less than 50% of almost all of the purchases happen by the customer touching and feeling and seeing the application at work. And that leads to some spectacular results. We featured Lloyds in the press release here. You know that was a very small transaction, a mezzanine transaction that turned into a multimillion dollar, standardized platform for a very well respected, very technical savvy company.","John DiFucci - JP Morgan","Great. Thank, Mike. And I might, Rich, and maybe Mike, you might have some color on this too. Rich, you said Q4 renewal portfolio was going to be down year-over-year, I think.... [Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Just, actually maybe a question where John was going, just trying to get a sense on the renewal side. First you had this large SI transaction in the quarter. I am trying to get a sense of, was that a transaction that was expected to close in Q3 or is that a transaction that you expected to close sometime next year and it happened earlier.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line, we are experiencing technical difficulty. Please remain on your line for just a moment. Mr. Prichard, if you could hold your question for just a moment. Yes, sir. We are in middle of a question from Mr. Pritchard. Mr. Pritchard, you can proceed with your question, sir.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Can you hear me now?","Michael Gregoire","Sorry, Walter, we got disconnected, I apologize.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Okay. So I guess the question, two questions. First, just related to the $300 million systems integrator contract that you signed in the quarter. I am wondering was that a contract that you expected to close sometime in 2015 or was that a contract that you had in your pipeline and was part of what you are thinking in terms of renewal portfolio this year?","Michael Gregoire","It was going to happen this year. It naturally would have expired in Q4. But the customer and us came to an agreement early. And that\u2019s a transaction that we are very happy with. That included net new product. It's a very powerful systems integrator that does an awful lot of work and a lot of their product portfolio in the cloud is featured using our product. So that was a big win for us. And it also -- it's a big body of work to get a contract like that done. I am very happy to have that done in Q3 so we can focus on the other larger contracts in Q4.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","And them Mike, Mike or Rich, just related to the renewal portfolio and you have given some preliminary guidance for fiscal '15. Could you talk about what you are expecting in terms of the renewal portfolio for fiscal '15 and when should we expect the revenue and billing backlog starts to stabilize and maybe even go positive.","Richard Beckert","Okay. How are you, this is Rich. So excluding the large system integrator we expect next year to be low to mid-single digit growth for the renewal backlog. And as you saw, currently the revenue backlog turned to zero this quarter, a little bit of a false positive because of the large system integrator. So it might pop down to slightly negative but as we continue to grow and expand you will see that pickup moving into next year.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","Mike, in your prepared remarks, it sounded like -- well, first of all, we are going to hear more updates from a product perspective in February. But I am wondering, maybe you can give us some hints as to where you guys could go on analytics, that certainly remains top of mind for a lot of IP buyers we talk to.","Michael Gregoire","Sure. It's early days for us in analytics, but there is two projects that we have ongoing right now. Both of these projects are being run out of our Silicon Valley R&D center. One of them is taking a look at all of the log data that we have, primarily with our APM product, and a lot of the IM and Nimsoft product. And looking for correlations into how to get to predictive downtime and help systems operations people predict and take corrective action earlier. The other area is in our mobility application, which we are going to be launching in the back half of the calendar Q1, and there is a number of analytics that are built into that application, but I would like to take it to a higher level. In the same way that every application you know four or five years ago stopped separating the application from the reporting, we are getting to that place with analytics. I think it's going to be very commonplace to have analytics built into just about every product in the same way that you can't build a product without a highly usable user interface.","So this is technology and a platform and a methodology that we are feathering through all of our products. And I think it's going to be standard commonplace, not just for us but just about everybody in the industry.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s great. And then, Rich, enterprise margins were impressive, 15% this quarter. I guess a two point question. Can you remind us again, longer-term where you think enterprise margins could go? And then second, should we expect a sequential decline in the fourth quarter in the enterprise segment similar to what we have seen in the last few years.","Richard Beckert","Right. So a couple of things. One, you have the historic Q4, you know you have more things coming due, as an example commissions. So that will put downward pressure on that. But you have to remember at the beginning of the year we removed $100 million worth of sales, and that will flow through going out over time. So as we build out -- we don\u2019t give guidance by individual piece parts, but as you'll recall we said, in a business as large as that we should get into the high teens over time. It's just a question of when we get there. And that will be a balance between the top line growing and us becoming more efficient as we go to market with all the things that we have laid out in this evolution that we are working on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","John DiFucci - JP Morgan","Yeah, just a question on the renewal portfolio. Rich, you said Q4 renewals, that renewal portfolio will be down year-over-year. So I guess that will have a negative effect on the year-over-year bookings growth. I guess if you can talk and Mike if you have any color on this, talk about your efforts of building that pipeline outside the renewals cycle. Because that will, at least in the optics will probably will be more important next quarter.","Richard Beckert","Sure. So if you recall, in the beginning of the year we moved roughly 10% of the sales force from overlays into direct quota carriers. And they all went to non-ELA accounts. So as we move through that evolution, you will continue to see us build that out rest of the year. And takes a while for that relationship to start and so as those relationships are happening, in fact North America had a pretty good quarter outside the renewals cycle in this quarter. So what we need to see is that to happen consistently in places like Europe in order for us to really move the needle year-over-year. I don\u2019t know, Mike, if you would add anything to that?","Michael Gregoire","Yeah, I'd echo what Rich said as in other strategies we are putting on place. First of all, it's been long time talking but we are definitely doing, separating the renewal from the going after net new accounts. And the same management structure is responsible for both. We hang around the renewal far too often. And you are seeing us evolve quarter by quarter, stripping that down. Coupled with that, when I take a look at the total sales population, how many of those sales professionals carry direct quota, the ratio has got to go up. And we have done that already throughout the year and once again as we evolve, John, we are going to continue to do that. I want to have more sales professionals that have targeted accounts that are necessarily based on the renewal or they are separated from the renewal.","And then it just comes to sales hygiene. When we are selling and we have some of our net new products, we are demonstrating a lot more discipline from having those net new high value products discounted at the same rate as some of our more mature value-oriented products. It's always frustrating to me and there is a telltale sign when we are doing a large renewal and one of our value products just starts to show up in the sales cycle towards the end of our renewal period. And we are just being very disciplined that that product is not going to get stuffed into the renewal. There is just too much value in there and we have to show the value of that product so we can continue to invest in it.","These are the kinds of things that we have been working on each and every quarter and we continue to evolve. And we are going to continue to do that all throughout 2015. With Adam on board and his background is a tight operator, I think we are going to see pretty dramatic improvements into our sales efficiency and effectiveness. We have four models in our company. We execute very very well one of them, which is enterprise licenses. We have to sell SaaS. We have to sell all of our products to net new customers and when you take a look at our partner ecosystem, I think there is work to be done to accelerate our partner ecosystem.","So I am very pumped up with some of the changes we are making in sales. I like an evolutionary approach as you well know, but now is the time to start taking a look at multiple things happening at the same time instead of single threading some of our changes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Schwartz of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies","I had a question on the large SI deal we made in the quarter. I think you said that was a $300 million plus deal over four years. And so if we just assume the best way to look at that is sort of a straight line over the four years in terms of what is added into the backlog numbers. If I make that assumption, it seems like current revenue backlog now, excluding that deal would have been flat sequentially, September to December. Which I think is rare for you given the seasonality, you usually see some growth there on an absolute dollar basis. If that is the right assumption for the treatment of that deal, can you just walk through what you are not seeing to increase that current revenue backlog in a seasonally stronger period?","Richard Beckert","Well, we had said earlier it did give you a slight false positive, which is what I had said earlier. So you will see that get back down which is really why the revenue backlog should really start to build in the first part of next year. We are actually quite happy with the renewal yield that we have been getting out of our renewals. You see that's been in the low 90s all year. It's first time we have had that consistently in the low 90s. And you see that benefit showing up in the subscription line. So Aaron I think we are on track as far as how we are doing the renewals. As Mike talked about earlier, it's really getting us to sell outside the renewal cycle and to consistently have our total new sales grow.","In the quarter, we were happy that ES did grow in the quarter, both with the renewals and standalone, but it was really driven primarily by the Americas, both North and South America. We need to see that around the world on a lot of things that you just heard Mike talk about is to go drive just that.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse","Just a question on the enterprise solutions segment. We saw another recent revenue rate, year-over-year decline there. And I understand there is obviously a big gap sometimes in rev rec and billings, but what do we need to see to start to turn that enterprise solutions line around and get that back to growth and then I will just have one quick follow up after that.","Richard Beckert","As we had just said, we really need Europe predominantly to be able to sell consistently across the board. What we see is in certain quarters, particular countries do well. We don\u2019t tend to have them hitting on all cylinders. And even though they are participating very well in their renewals, so that the 90s, low 90s, they are sharing in that, what we are not really getting is enough net new outside of the renewal cycle. So in a place like Asia this quarter tend to have a lower renewal cycle then they show up as a lower overall growth rate. So I think the things that we are currently working on to move quota carriers out into these areas, we will see that turn a lot of the new products that Mike talked about earlier and that we will announce over the next couple of quarters, also will drive that.","Michael Gregoire","And then Phil, it comes down to basic blocking and tackling. There are things that from an execution of view that I think we can do better at. And it's one of the reasons why I wanted someone who had a very strong operational background that knows how to run things of complexity and will do that all day, every day, in the senior sales position. Because I look at some of our account planning and it's not nearly as sophisticated as that needs to be. We are a company with a broad portfolio that competes with other companies with broad portfolios, but we also compete with single point products. We have to seal the right sales team at the right time and we should know that before we engage. And some of those decisions need to be made quicker, they need to be made faster. And Europe is a great example where we are probably not as crisp on that as we should be. And I think we can make some material improvements in how we execute across the board.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Michael Turits - Raymond James","Yes, strong quarter. Questions first on the SI deal and then on cash also. On the SI deal, I just wanted to make sure we understand the structure. Is this a standard structure where it's paid essentially, as cash annually over the period and rev rec over the period, and make sure we understand the impact on the income statement of this quarter. And then I had a question about the cash flow.","Richard Beckert","I think Mike, I'll make sure I understand your question. It's a normal four-year transaction. The payments flow in a very even manner, so it's not front loaded or anything like that. And in fact I would tell you that this deal closing one quarter earlier really didn\u2019t even impact the cash that we were expecting for the year. So that really is going to flow in a normal manner. It is all ratable revenue. So I hope I answered that question. We are happy with the renewal we had. As Mike said, we are happy with the new product that went in with that as well. So all in all, it was a very good partnership between the two companies. We left that renewal with a strong partnership than before we started that renewal process.","Michael Turits - Raymond James","And then on cash flow, there are two parts. One, you raised the guidance on the income statement but not on cash flow for this year. And also as we start to look into next year on cash flow, there were a lot of unusual items in this year's fiscal '14's cash flow. Can you just give us some idea what the primary puts and takes are? On this year if we wanted to try to look at next year on an apples to apples basis.","Richard Beckert","Sure. So if you were to normalize everything out so far, cash flow is roughly flat in Q3 and year-to-date. Just to remind people, the cash flow headwinds for taxes hit the $178 million and the rebalancing year-to-date is at $81 million. And as you recall we have the capitalized software that you can see coming off and that\u2019s another $18 million year-to-date. So as those things either end because we will have finished our taxes through -- in fact we finished that piece of that in Q3 here, the rebalancing will go the rest of this year and into part of the early half of next year. And then you will have an ease in compare with the software cap. So that is a benefit and you will see the overall CFFO go up year-over-year.","Now that being said, we want to remind you though that, and it gets back really to the earlier question, until we see our transactions outside the renewals happening on a consistent basis, we really want to be prudent with where the economy is. We want to be prudent with how we talk about CFFO going forward. So we think we have struck at the right balance. We are comfortable with the current guidance that we have given. And by design the headlights we talked about for '15, you will hear what our guidance is in May.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company","Most of my questions have been asked. I just had a question for Rich. Over the past two quarters, your operating margins have been trending around 40%. Just wondering if you would talk to the increments on that that are planned for fiscal '15 with regard to your guidance for roughly 37% margins next year. Thank you.","Richard Beckert","Right. So what we talked about for headlights. Remember, I am going to give guidance in May. So the headlights that we gave out the pieces off was really to talk about, you should expect the margin similar to the margins that we -- our new margin that we just posted. And I think that really hopefully addresses the question you are asking, right.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company","It is. And then a quick follow up. If you could talk to what percentage, Rich, of your new logo bookings perhaps go into FFO as opposed to subscription.","Richard Beckert","I don\u2019t have that level of detail but the way you should think about, by definition if it\u2019s a new logo, they are normally going to be standalone transactions. They won't have had any ELA before because it's a new logo. So be definition it will all flow there. Now remember inside of that FFO you have our entire SaaS portfolio which is growing year-over-year and sequentially. So they both all fall into that category. Over time it might start as a few hundred thousand dollar transaction, when the bigger transaction shows up that will no longer be viewed as a new logo. And at that we might start to introduce other products that maybe we will go out [ph]. Is that helpful?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Most of my questions were asked, one quick one. Mike, any sense on when do you think you will start to see product sales on the enterprise side start to improve from all the new products that you bring into market. When it will be visible?","Michael Gregoire","Well, we see it already in North America and we had a very nice quarter in Latin America. And we have some issues outside of, both in Asia and in Europe where we do a really good job at ELAs. The company does that on a global basis better than any company I have ever seen. It's just that the way that software is being build today and the relationships we have with customers are changing very rapidly. And I think that across the board we consistently need to understand how to sell SaaS, how to sell net new products to net new customers, how to sell net new products to existing customers and take advantage of our partner network. You know the partner network has thousands of sales professionals all over the world that not only know how to take our software but also add their own incremental value to it. And I think that we can do a lot more with those partners on a global basis.","So we are in a transitionary period of how customers buy and the kind of products and the way those products are delivered. And we just need to accelerate our own understanding of that and get our marketing, get our products and our sales working together in concert all day, every day, where it's not so lumpy. So I think we are well on our way. We understand what we have to do. We have to get to the work of doing it. Now once again, I would like to take a very evolutionary approach to sales. What I don\u2019t want to do is disrupt the 500 large customers that we have, that have significant operations with us. They like their sales professional that they deal with. I want to keep that as stable as possible. A lot of this has to do with moving to the new open wide space. There are literally thousands of customers between 300 million and 2 billion that we don\u2019t deal with very well. We need to have a marketing program in place, we need to have sales professionals that know how to hunt in that particular segment.","And then once again, we have to be very disciplined with our partners. It's always a mistake when you have a direct CA sales person and a partner at the same account. And I got to say from experience, it happens far too often. We need to have our direct sales force in the place where nobody is or have our partners in a place where we are not and try to sell more. Is that helpful, Mark?","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","No, that\u2019s very helpful, and I do appreciate it. One quick for Rich. How much of the cash is in the U.S. at this point?","Richard Beckert","41%","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Excuse me?","Richard Beckert","41%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore Partners. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners","I guess, Mike, just to follow up on a point you're making about some of the smaller customers. Do you think, I guess right now the sales model, do you have the requisite, say, telesales model in place to do things like a freemium model. If you want to experiment with that? I guess if you saw some success with Nimsoft Snap, just for example, do you have the right go to market mix? Because that is a little bit of a different type of sales model than your traditional model. So if you saw success in that...?","Michael Gregoire","I think you are 100% right on. We have it but we need to expand it. And that\u2019s part of the plans that we have going forward of getting the right amount of headcount into these kinds of techniques of getting higher quality leads with lower cost sales engine. When you take a look at our total population in sales and how many of them carry direct quota, we still have some work to do there.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners","Yes, it did. Thanks. And is that incremental expense, I guess when you think about your initial fiscal '15 guidance or is that -- can you reposition a lot of what you have on board already?","Michael Gregoire","No, I think this is repositioning. When I take a look at across the board, some of these new techniques are getting lead generation, they cost a lot less then the way we currently do it. The way we currently do it today I think is very bespoke, very expensive. It is one of the reasons why we are so attracted to having Lauren come on board to run marketing. As she has build digital marketing channels before and she has also brought in a number of people that she has worked with in the past. So they are not learning on the job. This is all about experience marketeers that really understand digital, that can get information into our sales force automation system and then have the right kind of sales professional go after the particular opportunity.","We are getting much much better at doing that. I think our sales force is starting to understand the value of being able to do that. They are not wasting their time on sales campaigns that have low probability of close. So I think across the board I would see traction on a global basis and it just takes a little bit more time than most people would like and we are going to be at this all in FY '15.","Richard Beckert","The only thing I would add to that, Kirk, we spend a lot of the money you hear us talking about, was getting some of our systems up to speed so that we can now have a lot of these things track electronically. So that\u2019s a lot of the incremental investment that we did in the back half of the year, everything Mike just said.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners","Great, thanks. And Rich, just one quick follow up for you. You mentioned the renewal portfolio will be up low to mid-single digits in '15, if you excluded the large customer this quarter. I guess if you are looking at it more on a reported basis, will that be up or is it down? I'm not trying to gauge the exact size, I'm just trying to get directionally, as we build our models out.","Richard Beckert","I am not sure I follow your question.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners","Sorry, I guess if you included the large customer, is it down year-over-year in fiscal 2015?","Richard Beckert","Correct.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners","Okay. Thanks.","Richard Beckert","And as you know whenever we talk about the large system integrators, we always back those out of our discussions as we showed back in last May, when we showed you the bar chart. We do that on purpose because they are an anomaly.","Operator","The last question comes from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho. Your line is open.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho","Mike, in the past you've talked about plans to reduce or eliminate commissions on renewal contracts. What are your latest thoughts on that and is that being contemplated for fiscal 2015 comp plans?","Michael Gregoire","Yes, we continuously look at how do we get the most amount of value and pay and incent our workforce most appropriately. And the way we look at it, the more complex the transaction, the more you should get paid. The least complex the transaction, the least incentive dollars. So that\u2019s philosophically where it heads at. You take a look at this renewal for the large system contractor, that was an extraordinarily well run pursuit. It required great efforts from our legal team, great efforts from our finance team, great efforts from the sales and product team. And the quarterback behind that is the sales and the management team. And they are into every cent that they get paid in commission on doing a transaction like that.","Now, if somebody is just trying to pickup nips on a renewal, you know that\u2019s exciting. And they should not get paid nearly as much as some of the more complex transactions. As we start looking through our sales force segmenting, taking a look at their talent base, what they are good at, what it is we need, what they want to do with their career, we are getting a lot more granular with respect to commissions. And I am pretty happy with how we are looking at this.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho","Thanks. And very quickly, Mike, you've spent a lot of time in talking about sales outside of renewal cycles especially in Europe and Asia, where it seems like they seem to be lagging behind North America for a couple quarters now. Is that something market dynamics on those regions or do you think you need to make some senior management changes in those regions within your organization to move those regions ahead?","Michael Gregoire","You know I think the leadership team we have there is more than capable of making the transition. I think it's a combination of understanding the market, getting the right product specialist in place and then taking advantage of the digital marketing. So I think they well understand what our expectations are. There is no shortage of effort and I think with the support we are getting from the rest of the company and seeing how we are able to make these transactions happen in North America, you know as you well know enterprise software is a very reference based business. Having these big reference accounts for sales outside the renewal, help us on a global basis. If you just take a look at the script that we used today, I think we had no less than five or six customer testimonials. You can't walk into a major airport right now and not see a customer testimonial of CA and what we do for customers. All of that is going to additive to helping some of our regions that are struggling a little bit, figuring out how to sell outside the renewal. But make no mistake about it, we are going to be able to sell outside the renewal, make no mistake about that.","Operator","Thank you.","Michael Gregoire","Well, with that I could like to conclude. Thank you everyone for their time on a very snowy afternoon here in New York. We are continuing to make progress on our organic product delivery. I am very happy with the product portfolio and what the team has been able to do over the last year. I think we would see that continue on going into Q4 and into FY '15. We are definitely making the right kind of evolutionary progress in sales. I am very excited to have Adam on board, to be able to work with him. And try to move us further down the field with respect to what we are trying to get done in selling to some of these white spaces where we just don\u2019t have enough traction. So with that I will let you go. We are going to have a really strong Q4 and do our best efforts to make sure that FY '14 ends the way we want it to. Take care and all the best.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your program. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

Please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid operating margin and strong CFFO growth. Our SaaS business continues to grow rapidly, and our stand-alone transactions in the quarter for both Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe group. New sales outperformed our renewal portfolio and we executed a number of key customer wins. Our renewal yield for the quarter was well above 90%.","Q4 Mainframe new sales grew considerably, and can be attributed to the combination of on-going innovation we are bringing to market as well as a robust Mainframe hardware cycle. Specifically, we continue to benefit from new innovations that are resonating with customers.","Our Mainframe Operational Intelligence solution, which addresses the engineering and technical skills gap by applying artificial intelligence and machine learning, continues to deliver strong results. And, Dynamic Capacity Intelligence, which helps customers to better manage costs by optimizing the MIPS capacity utilization, continues to do well.","In the quarter, our enterprise license agreements, or ELAs, had a significant increase in the attach rate of Mainframe products. We also saw a considerable uptick in stand-alone Mainframe business, or Mainframe new sales done outside of the renewal.","Within some of our combined Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions ELAs, our customers more heavily weighted their spend on the Mainframe platform relative to Enterprise Solutions on-premise spending with CA. As a result, the amount of Enterprise Solutions attached to contracts combined with Mainframe Solutions was at the lower end of what we typically experienced.","We believe this lower Enterprise Solution attach rate is a result of our strong suite of Mainframe Solutions and the strong Mainframe hardware cycle. This dynamic impacted our Enterprise Solutions new sales, which declined in the quarter. Though our stand-alone ES sales improved, we should have captured more. That said, both ES and organic ES revenue increased in the quarter.","Globally, security remains a critical concern to our customers, and CA is uniquely positioned in the identity space to help customers with hybrid cloud environments. In the fourth quarter, we saw a strong uptake in our recently launched Trusted Access Manager for Z, a solution for the Mainframe that is similar to Privileged Access Management, or PAM, in our Enterprise Solutions segment.","Within Enterprise Solutions, our PAM solution delivered one of its best quarters with new sales growth of more than 50%. In the fourth quarter, we are also pleased to have been named a Leader in the 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Identity Governance and Administration for the second consecutive year.","Customers like Comcast know that security mitigates risk and enables business. Comcast utilizes CA's security management solution ranging from PAM, APIM and Single Sign-On to simplify identity and access management, while also strengthening the governance and compliance by leveraging data from both its security and infrastructure platforms. This is a great example of how our product breadth solves customer problems in ways that point solutions cannot.","Product is the cornerstone of our strategy and a critical component of our efforts to achieve long-term sustainable growth. In Q4, CA was named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring Suites. It is great to see industry recognition of our application performance monitoring, or APM business.","We are very proud of the solutions we provide that help customers solve complex enterprise problems. For example, the European telecom provider, Orange, has used CA APM to achieve the business outcome of reducing the time it takes to isolate the root cause of poor application response time or error by 40%.","In fiscal 2018, we achieved total revenue growth for the second consecutive year. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. For the full year, we delivered results that met or exceeded the guidance ranges we provided.","We continue to be pleased with the contributions of our acquisitions of Veracode and Automic. We are increasingly adopting a number of digitally-based go-to-market strategies that Veracode employs across CA. And we have seen dramatic acceleration in both Veracode's number of large transactions and its bookings growth. The critical need for automation and the business value it delivers resonates easily with customers, and the enthusiasm and passion for our automation platform is palpable.","Customers like luxury retailer Thomas Pink are using CA's Automic platform to automate manual checking and validation tasks, eliminate human delays and errors in processing file transfers, and reduce delivery time for management reports. This allows them to spend their time and resources on other ways in which to enhance their business outcomes.","The themes of automation, agility, insight and security are the core tenants of the value proposition CA is delivering to customers. Our ability to deliver these principal capabilities across platforms in a hybrid cloud environment differentiates us from all other independent software vendors.","The breadth and strength of our portfolio has never been better. It is a reflection of the great work our teams have done to build organically developed solutions and to acquire strategic assets that have dramatically enhanced the capabilities we deliver to customers.","At the same time, we are making customer experience a competitive advantage for CA. Our Net Promoter Score, an industry standard measure of customer loyalty, continues to rise along a positive trajectory and increased 6 points year-over-year in Q4. Importantly, our product quality and customer satisfaction continues to improve and more customers are considering CA a strategic partner.","As noted in the press release, Adam Elster has been an integral part of getting our sales organization to where it is today. We thank him for his many years of service and wish him well in his future endeavors.","While we have made extraordinary progress on many fronts over the past several years, we are on a journey and are wholly committed to continuous improvement. I know that we need to move forward faster. To accelerate our progress, we expect to report a charge of approximately $140 million to $160 million in fiscal 2019. This will include the impact of executing against a real estate site consolidation strategy to move more of our people into our centers of excellence. The migration of our teams into fewer, larger locations supports our agile methodology.","This cross-business unit, cross-functional organizational alignment is required as we push with greater intention to shift more of our business to a subscription-based model. We know we need to enable our business to be more easily consumed this way. There is no doubt that more aggressively moving towards this delivery method across swaths of our portfolio can drive unparalleled value to our existing and prospective customers.","That said, we are in the early days and need to make adjustments to certain elements of our products, align our go-to-market resources and support functions to enable successful transition. As this unfolds, there will be employee implications as we look to transition a greater portion of our internal resources to better align with the skills and experiences required to drive our business forward. As such, in fiscal 2019, we expect to incur a charge that will also include the exit of approximately 800 employees.","These changes with regard to both site consolidation and the workforce will enable us to more heavily invest in specific areas within product development, increase investment in customer success, and employ a greater number of better aligned go-to-market resources.","For example, with the direct sales organization, we will more heavily invest in technical sales resources relative to generalists, and we plan to increase our digital sales footprint by 70%. We expect these changes will accelerate our transaction velocity and support our transition to more of a subscription-based model.","One of the areas where we've made tremendous progress over the last several years has been around re-defining, clearly articulating, and living our company's culture. This reflects our shared values and guiding principles in a way that we operate both internally and externally. While progress here is difficult to discretely quantify, I am incredibly proud that, for the third consecutive year, CA was named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute in 2018.","Looking back, while I'm pleased with the progress we've made as an organization, I'm even more excited about where we're going in the years ahead. As such, we plan to increase the rate and pace of our share repurchases this year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter and full-year results and guidance. Thank you.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated.","This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","In the fourth quarter, total new sales were up high-single digits as reported and mid-single digits in constant currency. From a geographic perspective, total new sales increased across all geographies in the quarter, except for Latin America, where new sales were down approximately 10% as reported and high-single digits in constant currency.","From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solutions new sales were particularly strong in the quarter and were up approximately 50% as reported and in a percentage in the mid-40s in constant currency. Our Mainframe new sales benefited from ongoing customer demand for our innovative solutions that help customers automate, optimize and secure their Mainframe operations, and from increased capacity sales driven by the strong Mainframe hardware cycle.","As Mike mentioned, this strength resulted in some of our customers spending more heavily on Mainframe Solutions this quarter. As a result, our Enterprise Solutions new sales were down mid-single digits as reported and high-single digits in constant currency.","Our renewal bookings were up high-single digits as reported and mid-single digits in constant currency, and our renewal yield was well above 90% in the quarter. For the full-year, total new sales were flat as reported and down low-single digits in constant currency.","Full-year Enterprise new sales were up low-single digits as reported and down low-single digits in constant currency, while Mainframe Solutions were down low-single digits, both as reported and in constant currency.","For the full-year, our renewal portfolio was down in the low-20s both as reported and in constant currency. Our renewal portfolio for the year was slightly below our expectations due to the timing of some transactions. Our average renewal yield was above 90%.","Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.08 billion, up 7% as reported and 4% in constant currency. Our acquisition of Veracode contributed roughly 4 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. Within our segments, Mainframe Solutions revenue was up 3% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, while Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 13% as reported and up 10% in constant currency. Services revenue was up 5% as reported and 1% in constant currency.","Total revenue for the full year was $4.24 billion, up 5% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. For the full year, our results included four quarters of inorganic benefit from our acquisition of Veracode, and three quarters of inorganic benefit from our acquisition of Automic, which was considered organic beginning in the fourth quarter. In total, our acquisitions contributed approximately 5 points to total revenue growth for the full year.","Full-year Mainframe Solutions revenue was approximately flat as reported and down 1% in constant currency, while Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 13% as reported and up 11% in constant currency. Services revenue was up 3% as reported and 2% in constant currency. Total revenue backlog decreased 1% as reported and 3% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported and 1% in constant currency.","For the fourth quarter, GAAP operating margin was 25%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. Segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 6% for Enterprise Solutions and 6% for Services.","Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 15% and 25% in the fourth quarter, respectively. Our GAAP income tax expense included a $28 million tax benefit relating to the refinement of the provisional amount previously recorded for the impact from U.S. tax reform.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, up 29% as reported and 26% in constant currency. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.62, up 15% as reported and 17% in constant currency. For the full year, GAAP operating margin was 26% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Segment operating margins were 64% for Mainframe Solutions, 9% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services.","Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 53% and 25% for the full year, respectively. Our GAAP income tax expense included a $290 million charge related to U.S. tax reform. This charge was comprised of $194 million related to the deemed U.S. repatriation of earnings held by non-US subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years, and $96 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in income tax rates.","For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.13, down 39% as reported and 38% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.59, up 4% as reported and 6% in constant currency.","Fourth quarter CFFO was $548 million, up 30% as reported and 29% in constant currency. Single-installment cash collections were $176 million and were flat compared to the year-ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.20 billion, up 11% as reported and 8% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations primarily because of improved efficiencies and lower cash tax payments for the full year.","We ended the fourth quarter with $485 million in net cash. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $20 million in shares and distributed $107 million in dividends to our shareholders. In fiscal year 2018, we repurchased $163 million in shares and paid $428 million in dividends. As of March 31, 2018, we have $487 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization.","The following outlook for fiscal 2019 is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2018, and is under the ASC 605 Revenue Standard. It assumes no material acquisitions, takes into account the costs and payments associated with the restructuring charge, and contains forward-looking statements.","As we implement the ASC 606 Revenue Standard for fiscal year 2019, we will be reporting results under both the ASC 605 and ASC 606 Revenue Standards during the fiscal year 2019, but will be providing guidance that primarily messages the business to ASC 605 results for comparability purposes.","As we push to sell a greater mix of our Enterprise Solutions as SaaS or subscription-based licenses, we anticipate seeing a near-term headwind to our reported revenue growth by approximately 1 point. In addition, we expect to successfully complete a long-term Services agreement resulting in the wind-down of a multi-year engagement with a government agency.","This, in combination with a growing portion of our business going ratable under ASC 605, impacts our expected revenue growth rates in fiscal 2019. As such, we expect total revenue for the full year to be approximately flat to up 1% as reported and down 1% to approximately flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.25 billion to $4.29 billion.","To accelerate our ability to align technical, field, and support resources with a cloud and subscription-based model, we expect to recognize a GAAP charge of approximately $140 million to $160 million. This charge contemplates the real estate site consolidation strategy that is well underway, as well as the exit of approximately 800 employees through the course of fiscal year 2019. As aforementioned, we expect to reinvest the savings from these actions into areas within development, digital go-to-market initiatives, and customer success.","As a result, we expect our full-year GAAP operating margin to be between 24% to 26% and full-year non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, which assumes no material refinements of the provisional amount previously recorded for the impact from U.S. tax reform.","GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase 58% to 65% as reported and to increase 50% to 58% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.87. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase 6% to 8% as reported and to increase 2% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.81.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 406 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 412 million shares. As Mike mentioned, for fiscal year 2019, we expect to increase the rate and pace of our share repurchases. This reflects our optimism regarding the long-term value we expect to accrue to our shareholders and the benefit of U.S. tax reform.","Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 5% to down 1% as reported and down 7% to down 3% in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.14 billion to $1.18 billion. This includes the cash impact related to the restructuring charge, which is estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million.","It also includes an estimated tax headwind of approximately $50 million compared to fiscal year 2018 due to the convergence of ASC 606 and U.S. tax reform. We estimate the impact of cash taxes in fiscal year 2019 to create an approximate 4-point headwind and the impact of restructuring to create a 6- to 8-point headwind to CFFO.","With that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. This is David Rainville on for Raimo. Thanks for taking our question. So, maybe first one on the business and then a quick follow-up on cash flow guide, if that's okay.","In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the strength in Mainframe drove lower Enterprise sales. How should we think about this? I mean, it seems quite unintuitive at first. So, any color on the puts and takes here would be quite helpful.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Sure. We've put a lot of innovation into our Mainframe suite of products and we've put out three net new, completely organic products in the last 12 months. And that, coupled with the Mainframe hardware cycle, which has been very strong, you can see that in the results on the hardware line from IBM, had customers very focused on buying Mainframe MIPS to prepare for their future year as well as taking advantage of our solutions that handle everything from Mainframe Operational Intelligence to also managing their MIPS and helping them with the GDPR.","So I think what we've seen is, if they had $100 to spend, they are prioritizing their spend with CA on Mainframe Solutions, which I think had a short-term impact on the ES line.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. All right. Thanks for this. And maybe it would be great to get a little bit more specification around the cash flow guidance. I mean, there seems to be quite a lot of moving parts behind there. So, maybe a bit more specificity around the non-recurring items and what it would look like without those.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Sure. So this is Kieran. As we talked about before, our guidance overall is down in aggregate from down 7% to down 3%. But within that, we have about 4-point impact from cash taxes increasing. So we closed this year right around $350 million and we're modeling about $400 million next year.","If you recall, in prior quarters, we talked about the beneficial effect that we're going to get from tax reform as we go forward, as our tax rate falls to about a 28% to 29% range down into the low-20s. But offsetting that is, as we move to ASC 606 and there is an acceleration of revenue, especially as we clear out all of the license income that's on our deferred backlog and we recognize that in the beginning of this year, there's going to be a pretty large cash hit for that that we'll get to take over four years.","You put those two together, all in, and what we see is about a 7-point hit next year from restructuring and about a 4-point hit from the net increase in the tax, so the tax benefit from tax reform and the tax hit from the move to ASC 606. And underneath that, we've also had some pretty significant operational improvement in the business. We do have some acquisition improvement on a year-on-year basis, as well as we're going to see a slight reduction in our interest expense as we move to next year.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. I guess this is for both, Mike and Kieran. You say you're restructuring here to better align business fundamentals and you're also moving to more of a subscription model. I guess, there's two things that I just need a little clarification on.","One is, I guess, aren't you already a subscription model? I mean, wasn't CA like the pioneer in that in 1999? I think it was when you went through a subscription model one day and went from $4 billion in revenue (25:38) to $2 billion and then built up over time. A lot of confusion back then, but I think people understand the subscription model today. So I'm just trying to figure out what that means.","And then, I guess, to better align business fundamentals, the restructuring, that's still a little unclear as to what that means too?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","So, hey, John, it's Kieran. So, let me let me start with \u2013 so you're absolutely correct that CA had a Mainframe business that was by and large subscription, primarily subscription, and obviously taken on a ratable basis.","I think the big move that was discussed that you're asking about in the early 2000s was really towards moving the entire business to ratable and a lot of that, especially from an ES perspective, where the licensing model was primarily a perpetual licensing model, but because of the absence of VSOE, required us to take business ratably.","So, if you think about our business today, our Mainframe business by and large is a business that is subscription in nature. Our ES business though is by and large, with the exception of our SaaS businesses, the rest of the on-prem business is really perpetual modeling in nature, but because of the lack of VSOE, has been taken primarily as ratable.","So what we're trying to do now is to drive more, obviously, the SaaS businesses subscription and we're going to continue to grow that business, and that business has been growing quite healthy. So what we now look to do is take more of the on-prem business and actually move that to a subscription model as well. We see more of our customers are expressing an interest in actually acquiring that on more of a term or rental basis and really owning outright.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","And then, John, of how that gets done, we've fully embraced agile. And what agile means is, you need to be in the office, you need to be collaborating with each other. And we're taking a lot of our smaller satellite offices and reducing those footprints on a global basis and trying to get large groups of employees into bigger locations that are strategic. So, that hits the real estate side of the house.","But also we've gotten much, much better at developing software, which means that we don't need as many people with some of the skills that were for the legacy platforms. What we do need is skills for building SaaS. We need sales skills that understand how to sell to net new customers and, additionally, more technical sales that can sell to existing customers outside of the renewal.","So, when we take a look at what we're trying to do and make this move to a subscription model that is based on product, the only way to do that quickly is to go through a restructuring. And unfortunately, we're going to remove some 800 people from the company, but we're also going to be hiring somewhere between 500 to 600 people over the next year as well that will have different skills and more strategic geographic locations. And all of this is to drive growth and focus on our newer products and be able to ensure that we have the technical sales and the technical abilities to build these products.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. That's really helpful, Mike.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Right. So, John, what you're going to see is, obviously, the reduction in our facilities expense. A big piece of these head count reductions will be coming in the services and the sales area. And obviously, we'll always take a shot at going after G&A, and then reinvesting really in organic R&D in the fastest parts of our portfolio and remixing more of our sales resources into a digital sales and marketing model.","And from that perspective, we would expect that we're going to be more than doubling actually next year the amount of our digital sales resources.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","And I guess, just one quick follow-up, I think, quick. Because I want to make sure, Kieran, when you talk about going, in the Enterprise Solutions, from the on-prem license plus maintenance model, perpetual model, to more of a subscription, are you actually referring to cloud based because that sounds like a huge change? Like, I mean, it doesn't happen that quickly.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","(30:09)","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Are you talking about a little of both? Go ahead. Sorry.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Yes. So, John, you're absolutely right. I mean, we have a SaaS business up next year. As we open up here in fiscal 2019, we'd be disclosing how much SaaS revenue we have and we'll see that.","But what we're discovering is, even within our on-prem business, there is a greater desire for customers to actually look at a he subscription model. We've had those offerings for quite some period of time, but Mike has said, you've heard Mike often say this, that the times where customer is going to pay upfront and to buy something outright in an environment where technology is changing so rapidly, little-by-little we're starting to see more and more of our customers asking for this model.","So, once again, we're trying to listen to our customers here and move more rapidly. Doesn't mean we're not going to have any on-prem sales. Many of our customers are going to want to buy with capital. They're going to want to own the licensing rights outright. But many of our other customers will want to enter into a model that allows them to have this on a rental basis, and we think that's going to be about 1 point of headwind against us in fiscal 2019.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","So, John, if you think of a couple of products that you'd be familiar with, like, for our Privileged Identity Management Solution, we can sell that license plus maintenance, but we have the ability to sell that as a subscription as well. What we're seeing is more and more customers given the choice who would prefer to buy that as a subscription. Similarly, with our APIM solution, it's an opportunity for us to get more customers be more attractive in the marketplace and be more competitive.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay, guys. That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Hey. Hi, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. Thanks for taking the question. So you guys mentioned that you would be reducing your head count by 800 this year and then hiring more like 500 to 600 people. So, just wondering in terms of the disruption that this would create, because most of the head count reduction is coming out of the customer-facing roles like sales. How have you baked that kind of disruption along with the departure of Adam in your guidance for FY 2019?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Sure. First of all, out of the 500 to 600 people, I would say probably about 200 or so are coming from the customer-facing. But this is going to be net new head count, a lot of it doing digital sales which we currently don't do enough of today. When you think of customer acquisition and customer acquisition cost, the last thing in the world you want to do is have a direct sales person engaging with a customer for the first time.","The proper way to go about sales in a modern software company is to nurture those relationships digitally. And if you're doing it very well, the customers are going to have an opportunity to try and buy the software online. And then you're going to use your direct sales force to go past the land agreement into an adoption and expand, and once again, into a renewal. So, a lot of that head count is focusing on digital demand.","And, secondly, as we've built a lot of net new solutions that require a different skill set in selling, more hunters rather than farmers, you're going to see a more proliferation of attacking white space where we don't have relationships with customers. And then, we have a lot of customers, especially in the Fortune 500, that haven't had an opportunity to buy some of our newer solutions. And in order to do that, we need a more technical sales force that has the ability to not only sell, but demo the product.","This will help us in a number of different areas. First of all, get more customers, have more feet on the street. And when we put those feet on the street, they're going to be armed with better marketing and better digital support.","With respect to Adam, Adam has been a great contributor to our company. He's been personally a great help to me in transforming our sales organization away from just a renewal-only focus. But when you stop and pause where we are now and where we need to go forward, we are making a change. But, in doing that change, on the BU sales, there is no change. The same person that's running that business is going to continue to run that business and will report to me in the interim. I see no disruption there at all.","On the geo and the government work, it's going to report to another executive for the last 18 months has been running our global transformation strategy to get to digital and get to a more subscription-based business. And I expect him to spend about 80% of his time working with the sales force on how to do land, expand, adopt and renew deals. And he has the ability to do that because he's designing the work progress and all the systems for us and comes from the sales orientation background of the company, where he is an expert in our existing business model.","So, when it comes to doing renewals, there is nobody that knows how to do that or managing ELA (35:23) better than CA. I don't see any change in that. What I do see a change in is the acceleration of our ability to sell to net new customers and to be able to sell and move our products into our existing customers outside of a renewal. This is something we've been working on for the last couple years. I want to take a more intentional step forward in making that our priority going forward. So I see this as an opportunity to accelerate, not decelerate.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","And I guess, just one other point to add, much of the sales resource that will be transitioning out of the business, very little of that, if any, are primary quota-carrying people. Really, it's more the overlay roles and support roles that are supporting that older business model that we've been working with for a long period of time, as we transition more into our higher velocity businesses.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Got you. That is really helpful. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned that, I mean, the cash tax increase from the ASC 606 is going to have a full 1 point headwind on your cash flow from operations growth. Just wanted to understand whether this is like a one-time expense that you would be getting in fiscal 2019 or, because of the like ongoing upfront recognition going ahead, is it like a continuing expense?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Yeah. So, as we've mentioned in the past, this impact from ASC 606, we get the opportunity to actually pay it interest-free to the government over four years. So we would expect that that will be over the next four years.","Clearly, from a year-on-year perspective, we would expect this to be the first year of it having an impact versus another year. But we'll be paying that over four years and then, obviously, would be getting the benefit of (37:05) the ongoing cash flow benefits from the reduced tax rates overall to mitigate most of that. We think it's a net hit of about $15 million.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Perfect. Thank you, guys. Thank you so much.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Fenn Hoffman - Evercore ISI","Hi. This is actually Fenn Hoffman on for Kirk. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to start, could you talk a little bit about sort of why now in terms of the reduction of the workforce? And are you looking to streamline the product portfolio at all as part of this announcement?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","So, why now? It's a beginning of a new year for us. When you take a look at our product portfolio, we have a number of products that are now SaaS-oriented and subscription-based. We'll be giving out guidance with respect to ARR sometime very soon, and you'll be able to see what that looks like from a progression point of view quarter-over-quarter. Obviously, you won't be able to compare it to last year because of the differences between ASC 605 and ASC 606.","And when we take a look at the ability to streamline our go-to-market and the investments we've made in digital, we have an opportunity here to put more primary quota-carriers and move away from support roles in the business than have paying multiple commissions for one deal. This is something we've been working on for an awful long time and we just felt now is the time to make these kinds of changes in a more dramatic fashion.","And secondly is, we have real estate that is underutilized and we want to focus our teams to be more together. If you are developing an agile, you're going to have designers, right beside sales professionals, right beside customers, besides programmers, DBAs, architects. And in order to do that, we need to get people into the office working closer together. So, in the last two years, we've been doing that and, in doing that, we've got a lot of satellite offices and excess real estate that is not being utilized. So, that was an opportunity for us to go ahead and clean some of that up.","Fenn Hoffman - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. And just as a follow-up, does the increase buyback program indicate that you are not going to be as active as it relates to M&A?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","No, I don't think that is. We spend on average between $300 million to $500 million per year. As all of you know, the market's been a little frothy right now and we're still digesting two pretty big acquisitions. And so we are definitely still in the market looking for things that fit our strategy, but we are very disciplined buyers and we feel we have plenty of firepower to buy the kinds of things that the size that best suits our strategy and our ability to execute.","Fenn Hoffman - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Gregoire for his closing remarks.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Great. Well, thanks again for this evening. In summary, we delivered strong earnings and cash flow growth in fiscal 2018. And excluding the non-recurring items, we are guiding for a strong CFFO growth for fiscal 2019. We are definitely accelerating our business transformation. We have a lot of confidence in the business to be able to do that, and we expect that to drive long-term shareholder returns.","Thanks, again, for your time. And I want to remind you that we're going to be having Analyst Day on May 30, if you have the opportunity to be there. We'd love to walk you through our product portfolio and a little deeper into some of our transformation activities. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

You've joined the CA Technologies First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Kelsey Turcotte. Ma'am, you may begin.","Kelsey Doherty Turcotte","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies' First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer.","Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for a Q&A session. These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Wednesday, July 24, 2013, over the telephone and the Internet.

We consider your continued participation in this call as consent to our recording.","During this call, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our second quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on September 13, 2013.","Before I turn the call over, I'd like to highlight that, for modeling purposes, our year-over-year currency headwind on revenue guidance is expected to be roughly 2 points for the full year.","In addition, starting in the first quarter of fiscal '14, the measure of segment expenses and segment profit was revised to treat all costs of internal software development as segment expense in the period the costs are incurred. As a result, the company will add back capitalized internal software costs and exclude the amortization of internally developed software costs previously capitalized from segment expenses.","Prior period segment expense and segment profit information have been revised to present segment profit and expense on a consistent basis as reflected in the 8-K we filed today and in our supplemental financial package, both of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Also in fiscal '14, the company will exclude costs relating to the FY 2014 Board-approved rebalancing initiative announced in May from its segment expenses and segment profit. So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael P. Gregoire","Thanks, Kelsey, and thanks for joining us this afternoon. I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter and the start we made to fiscal '14. We did better than expected on the revenue line. New product and capacity sales grew high single digits as reported. In addition, we capitalized on organizational efficiencies and expense management. These include headcount and personnel-related expenses, primarily in our sales organization, and improvements in G&A.","CFFO came in as expected, reflecting the cash tax, rebalancing and capitalized development items we discussed in May. We also received a favorable resolution of a U.S. tax matter, which contributed to a $0.41 improvement in GAAP EPS and a $0.14 improvement in non-GAAP EPS.","One of our primary focuses is to grow Enterprise Solutions. And to do that, we need to accelerate the rate and pace of new customer acquisition outside the renewal. One of the indicators of our progress is new customer additions. Over the last 12 months, we added more than 460 new logos to Enterprise Solutions. And we saw acceleration in new customer adds from Q4 to Q1.","When you look at our Growth Enterprise customers, where we have the most greenfield opportunity, we see a much smaller transaction size relative to the existing enterprise business. This reflects our land-and-expand strategy across the portfolio from application delivery to our SaaS solutions. We will continue to add differentiated solutions to the portfolio with acquisitions like Nolio and Layer 7, as well as increase our focus on organic development that delivers technology with SaaS characteristics of easy to use, easy to install and easy to sell. Over time, we expect these investments to drive top line growth.","SaaS technology is a critical component to CA's future. This was clear in Q1 with one of our flagship products, Clarity on Demand, that has made the transition to SaaS. Though on a small base, Clarity on Demand's new product sales more than doubled year-over-year. Equally as important as the numbers we reported this afternoon are initiatives we are pursuing to improve future results across the portfolio.","To start, the approximately $150 million rebalancing we announced in May is coming along according to plan. We completed more than 1\/2 of our facilities consolidations for the fiscal year and actioned approximately 3\/4 of our global headcount reduction.","By year end, we expect headcount to be roughly flat compared to where we started in fiscal 2014. We are actively recruiting engineering talent with the skills to increase the rate and pace of organic development, drive more effective product marketing and lead generation, as well as evolve our sales effectiveness.","As I made clear during my May investor briefing, I believe that the key to improving performance across the portfolio will be product differentiation. That is why my initial focus over the last 6 months has been on research and development. And we are starting to see evidence of our efforts in momentum created by the company's adoption of a more centralized and collaborative development model.","In fact, during the first quarter, we introduced: the latest version of Application Performance Management, with companies like Starwood Hotels, Bed Bath & Beyond using our integrated application behavior analytics; Nimsoft Service Desk, our next-generation SaaS-based service management, our solution which was purchased by customers like Boston Financial Data Services, BOC Fullerton Community Bank in China, UniConverse in Korea and Fujitsu U.K., features quick time to implementation, ease of use, social collaboration and mobile user interfaces.","CloudMinder, after a highly competitive process, Wipro signed a strategic partnership with CA to provide hosting services in EMEA. This SaaS security offering unifies identity management, single sign-on and advanced authentication in a single platform for managing cloud and non-cloud applications.","Our new Mobile Device Management solution, which secures and manages mobile users and devices. We are beginning to see the pipeline build and closed a $9 million-plus transaction in Q1.","And finally, Chorus, our next-generation mainframe management platform, where we added infrastructure management to our database management, security and storage family of technologies. Customers like SCANA Corporation use Chorus to increase efficiency and grow next-generation mainframe skills.","Highlights of innovative technology that we expect to release in the balance of the fiscal year are as follows. Clarity Playbook, Playbook is a strategic planning management product for CIOs and top business executives that connects companies' comprehensive IT investment portfolio to top-level corporate strategy in a single mobile interface.","Nimsoft Monitor, our SaaS technology featuring modern development platforms and architectures which will allow customers to download, install, start monitoring thousands of elements in less than an hour. And we will extend our mobile family of solutions to include mobile application management.","To more efficiently and effectively deliver this technology to our customers, we need to accelerate our marketing capabilities. As a result, we recently announced that Lauren Flaherty will be joining CA next month. Coming from Juniper Networks, Lauren brings years of business and marketing expertise to CA Technologies. She has a proven track record of success, as well as a deep insight into the technology industry and, more importantly, how to achieve our top 3 goals in marketing: effective, efficient and impactful lead generation; product marketing to increase our competitive advantage; and global brand management.","Best-in-class marketing is critical to increasing sales velocity, sales efficiency and expanding our total addressable market outside of renewals, all of which, will be necessary to accelerating CA Technologies' performance.","Now I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you very much.","Richard J. Beckert","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. In addition, last year's Q1 was positively affected by IP transaction which closed during the quarter. This transaction provided an incremental $35 million to operating income and cash flow from operations, 3 points of GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin and $0.05 to GAAP and non-GAAP EPS.","This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","As Mike said, we had good growth in renewals this quarter due to a higher dollar value of scheduled contract renewals as compared to fiscal 2013. We also had several renewals which closed prior to their scheduled expiration dates. I'm not concerned with the timing of these transactions as we preserved the value of our maintenance stream and we sold both mainframe and ES new products into these renewals.","Our renewal yield was in the mid-90% range. Please note, we expect the renewal yield will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Over time, we expect it will average around 90%. We now expect renewals will be more evenly distributed between Q1 and Q2 than outlined in May. We also continue to expect fiscal '14 renewals as compared to fiscal '13 to be up high single digits, excluding the large customer in the second half of the year and back-half loaded as we previously indicated.","Q1 total revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1%. Mainframe declined 1%, Enterprise Solutions declined 3% and Services grew 8%. With these results, total new product and capacity sales were up high single digits as reported. Mainframe benefited from an inventory of renewals heavily weighted towards this segment. Capacity grew more than 20% as reported, while Mainframe new product sales grew more than 70% as reported. Enterprise Solutions new product sales were roughly flat as reported. New Services engagements were up approximately 20% as reported.","From a balance sheet perspective, current revenue backlog was down 2%. This reflects last year's sales performance and the headwinds created by the increased renewals scheduled for the second half of fiscal '14. As we look to the balance of the year, particularly the back half of fiscal '14, we expect the large inventory of contracts that will renew to reverse the downward trend we have seen in the revenue backlog. The volume of Q1 renewals that closed earlier than anticipated was not large enough to have a material effect on the revenue backlog.","From an expense perspective, operating margins reflect the typical seasonality of commissions, as well as year-over-year headcount reductions. In addition, our overall GAAP margin was negatively affected by approximately $120 million of expenses associated with the rebalancing.","Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, while GAAP operating margin was 20%. For the segments: Mainframe was 61%, Enterprise Solutions was 10% and finally, Services was 8%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78, up 25%. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.73, up 47%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 14%, while our GAAP tax rate was negative 54%. This reflects completion of the examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal year 2005, 2006 and 2007.","Finally, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $11 million, as expected. In addition to the difficult year-over-year compare resulting from last year's $35 million IP transaction, Q1 CFFO was affected by items we outlined during our investor presentation in May. Let me walk you through the year-over-year changes: $74 million incremental cash taxes; fiscal '14 rebalancing payments of $23 million; and a reduction of capitalized software development of $11 million. When normalized for these items, CFFO would have been in line with Q1 historical averages. We also saw a year-over-year decrease in single installment payments of approximately $70 million; $53 million in Q1 fiscal '14 compared to $123 million in the prior year.","Regarding our rebalancing, while we have exited people at the rate and pace we initially anticipated, some of the payments expected to hit in Q1 moved to Q2. For the full year, we continue to expect a total of over $100 million in payments. The company also expects to receive cash refund related to the previously mentioned completion of the IRS appeals of approximately $70 million by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2014.","Current billings backlog is down 4%, again reflecting the same dynamics we saw in the revenue backlog. We ended Q1 with approximately $1 billion in net cash. We paid $114 million in dividend and repurchased approximately 2 million shares for approximately $53 million. We are authorized to repurchase an additional $452 million of common stock through fiscal 2014.","Turning to guidance, which we reconfirmed this afternoon. Guidance is based upon exchange rates at the last day of the preceding quarter, for this quarter, June 30, 2013. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of negative 4% to negative 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.39 billion to $4.48 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of 16% to 20% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.90 to $3.","GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of negative 11% to negative 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.81 to $1.91. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of negative 30% to negative 24% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow of operations of $960 million to $1.04 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions.","Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 14%. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 437 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 446 million shares. We continue to expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2014. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Kelsey, and we will take your questions.","Kelsey Doherty Turcotte","Thank you, Rich. As the operator is polling for questions, I would like to inform you that CA Technologies is presenting at Oppenheimer's 16th Annual Technology, Internet & Communications Conference in Boston on August 13; Citi's 2013 Global Technology Conference in New York City on September 4; and the Raymond James European Investors North American Equities Conference in London on September 10. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question was about the renewal rate strength that seems like the mid-90s range was higher than the historical averages. Kind of curious what drove the strength in that number.","Richard J. Beckert","This is Rich. We're pleased with the renewal yield in the mid-90s. We've had it there before. Over on average, it'll tend to be around 90%. In this particular quarter, the things that are great about that as well is what you'll also see, we had a low single installment, which allowed us to really leverage the transactions that we had. And you heard us talk about transactions that were Q1 and a couple in Q2, Q3 or whatever, and we were very selective as to which ones we brought forward that the customers wanted, and us. And you can see from the results that they really positioned us nicely for the rest of the year. So the only thing I would say is the mix is a little bit different than normal. It's a little heavier towards Mainframe, and you see that show up in the Mainframe results. Again, very strong results for the Mainframe and a little less in ES, and it's really just a statement of what the portfolio was as we had to renew it in the quarter.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And Mike, you talked about SaaS [ph] being the driver going forward and cited some strength in one of product areas. I'm wondering when -- can you not breaking out that, that revenue line?","Michael P. Gregoire","We have segment reporting right now that breaks out Mainframe and Enterprise. And I think, there's no discussion on changing that segment reporting. Is there something specific that I can try and answer for you?","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, trying to get more of a sense of sort of overall strength in cloud revenue as opposed to kind of picking out 1 or 2 specific products each quarter?","Michael P. Gregoire","Sure. We're early days in this, so it's kind of hard to break it out and have it meaningful. But the thing that I saw that you would see in any kind of SaaS company that you're covering is new customer logos. And this is something that quite clearly hasn't been a priority for the company in previous years. And our ability to add as many net new customer logos as we did and the acceleration of those logos from Q4, which is traditionally the biggest quarter for the company and into Q1, gives me some confidence that the sales forces is starting to understand the importance of getting out there and meeting net new customers and talking about our whole portfolio. But the way to do that is with our SaaS solutions, because the SaaS solutions are easier to implement. They're definitely easier to use, and they are easier to sell. Now the awkward part of that is they're smaller transactions, so you don't really get to see that move the revenue needle in a short period of time. But if you take a look at any company that's scaled in SaaS, they start off with the mezzanine-type transaction. And then that transaction works and it grows from departmental to countrywide to global. And if you're doing a really good job at that, you're trusted to add more solutions. So this is the beginning of the flywheel, and we are definitely in early days, but it was really nice to see, it was something I was definitely looking for, and I was really happy with the sales team, their ability to make that happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Winslow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","For Phil. Could you just talk a little bit more about the Mainframe pricing environment throughout the quarter?","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. This is Rich again. I think what we're seeing, and I think you saw in the results, the Mainframe, with our competition, we're actually poised very well. So there's some disruption in the marketplace. I think with the announcements that we have made earlier in the year at CA World, they're really starting to pay dividends. So you're really seeing some impressive numbers being put up on CA course. And from the renewals, you're seeing that we're getting a good renewal yield, which is what we want, the right balance for us, putting our -- or keeping our maintenance stream going and introducing new products. And this is the first quarter in a while you saw decent capacity. And again, the capacity number is a little misleading. It's a small number, right, in Q1 and it was a little bit heavily weighted towards Mainframe products in those renewals. But we had a high capacity rate for us. So overall, I think, I would say it was a very solid quarter for Mainframe.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have question for Mike and then a follow-up for Rich. Mike at CA World, you laid out a plan to continue to do what CA has always done for your customers in managing data centers. But you also provided -- but also for CA to provide other things that customers are asking you for, things around mobility, Big Data, SaaS and cloud. I guess the question is on one of those areas, and it's mobility, because I was a little surprised to see so soon a transaction of the size of $9 million that you mentioned. This is a relatively new area for CA. It's not something I've thought of -- associated CA with, and I'm assuming customers haven't always thought of that either. I guess why would a customer -- maybe you can walk us through that a little bit, how did that customer come to the conclusion that they wanted to choose CA, and obviously, for such a large deal to do something like mobility management, something I assume was a competitive deal, but I -- that's just -- I'm just surprised to see it so soon.","Michael P. Gregoire","Yes. Well, you referenced my speech at CA World. And if you remember what I said in that speech when I talked about mobility, I said CA has been managing PCs and devices for years. Hundreds of thousands of them, and when you think of managing mobile, it's not something we have not done before. And as the world is starting to think of all these different mobile devices in a heterogeneous environment, there is nobody that has managed more heterogeneous devices than CA. I mean, it's just a core competency of ours. And being able to extend what a customer's currently doing in managing their own infrastructure and the devices that they currently have and then just adding on to the phenomenon of bring your own device to work, it just makes an awful lot of sense. And when you think about a transaction that size, it's going to be at a very large company that's looking for stability. They're looking for a global rollout. They're looking for a company that's going to continue to invest in that particular domain. And if you look at our product roadmap for mobile application development -- or sorry, mobile device management, we're adding [ph] mobile applications onto that platform, it's on the roadmap for the end of this year. So this is a very competitive situation. And as we showed our product and what we're able to do with it, coupled with our track record of managing large scale heterogeneous devices, we were a very good fit. Is that helpful, John?","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very helpful, Mike. And Rich, thanks for the cash flow detail and pulling out some different parts of that. I guess -- and I have another question on cash flow. What was that negative -- there's a negative $338 million contribution due to decrease in taxes payable. Is that part of the special charge this quarter? But that was something like $70-something million. I guess if you can explain that line a little bit?","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. So how about if I just -- this will probably be helpful. So if you think about the incremental cash taxes that we paid in order to do the catch-up that we talked about back in May, that's $74 million. The other thing we talked about is the IP assignment that we did last year was $35 million, that we did last year that we did not repeat. And the rebalancing, that $27 million hit in the quarter. We had told you it would be a little bit larger. We are happy with the number of folks that left the company, but the payments actually slid into the next quarter, so we're on track. The collections were slightly lower. Cap debt was slightly lower. So all in all, you add all that up and it's about $200 million of change. The last piece, John, just from a cash flow standpoint, as we did, by design, do a little less in Q1 on the single installment payment of about $70 million. So between all those things, you can see why our cash would be slightly down. But we're on track, exactly where we thought we would be from what we had said about the reversal of the accrual. But just to refresh people's memory, that was $235 million we have estimated. It actually came in at $221 million. And so the net benefit, if you will, that drove that rate down.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In that one line, the taxes payable lines, so did you end up paying taxes that were previously due?","Richard J. Beckert","Correct. There's both inside of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two quick questions. The first one is the margin improvement that we saw this quarter in the Mainframe and Services and margin compression in Enterprise, should we expect this to continue as a trend for the next few quarters? Is this driven out of rebalancing? And then I got a question on capacity.","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. So as we had said earlier, our margin for the year will be 36% in total. What you also have to recall, though, from an ES standpoint, the $35 million IP transaction all was in ES last year. And to the total company, that was a 3-point change. And then you have the natural, just in Q1, as later, the biggest thing that really drives that is commission payments. But you also have marketing investments and other things that tend to be skewed towards the back half of the year. So we are very comfortable where we are with guidance. We're definitely on track. The Mainframe benefited from what we had already talked about, a strong quarter, and you'll see that kind of flow through the year. And the SaaS -- I'm sorry, the Services is in line. But as you can see, if you look back over the last couple of years, we're doing a much better job as a company, making sure our utilization rates are correct. So we think we're in a very solid place for the full year.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Perfect. Okay, second is capacity is up, but the Mainframe revenue itself is down. Do you see this as, both of these as a continuing trend that we're just kind of -- that the renewals are going to be -- even though they're going to be bigger, there may be more pricing discount that are driving that?","Richard J. Beckert","No, that's just the statement of the ratability of those transactions. They all happen in the last few weeks of the quarter. So you get a few days' worth of revenue. What you'll see over time, if you really look at the revenue backlog, you can see, sequentially, it actually got smaller. And as we said earlier, the revenue backlog will turn around for the company in the back half of the year. Again, you'll have a similar issue going on where a lot of transactions will happen in Q3, Q4. So the amount of revenue that shows up in those quarters is very small.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore Partners.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It's Matt Williams actually in for Kirk. Just one quick question from us. I'm wondering if you could discuss a little bit your position in terms of sort of helping customers manage their private cloud environments. VMware appeared to show a pretty nice jump in its fee cloud offerings in the last quarter. and I just wanted to get your comments on sort of how you see your opportunity and competitive position in that market.","Michael P. Gregoire","Great. It's a great question. Pretty much across all of our portfolio is applicable to a private cloud. The area that we see the most traction is in security. We have a cloud-based product called CloudMinder that is all-encompassing and manages identities and manages a whole portfolio of security solutions, both on-premise, because a lot of these private clouds still have a on-premise security component. And having the ability to manage the cloud and the on-premise piece from one development console is extraordinarily attractive. And the other thing is we had a huge transaction in APJ this quarter that was for a cloud-based vendor selling our CloudMinder product. So this is an area where we think we are very competitive and pretty much across the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Schwartz of Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I had 2 quick questions. First, on the sale in the go-to-market side. I believe you collapsed 2 segments, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was sort of the large new enterprise and the growth segment. I think you collapsed that into one. One, is that complete? Or are there still some sort of operational changes that have to occur? And then the second question I have is sort of longer term, but you've talked about developing easier to stand up or lighter weight products, and I'm just wondering what the impact that will have on your Services business over time. Is there less dependency on Services, as you see a mix shift to those products or is that unrelated to the overall model?","Michael P. Gregoire","Sure. Great. Once again, great questions. With respect to collapsing markets, the company had 3 distinct markets that we were serving, which meant 3 distinct management teams and 3 distinct overheads that were associated with those management teams. And after running that model for a very short period of time, it was really clear that the buying patterns were really bifurcated into customers that are existing customers, that have big solutions with us, and we need to be selling them more solutions; and customers that have a very little footprint with us or no footprint at all. And the way that they buy is different. So separating out those 2 was just a more economical model, and we are definitely finished with that transition in the sales force. Now make no mistake about it. We're continuing to evaluate our sales force. We took $100 million of expense out of our sales force for this year, and we are getting more efficient. We're getting more focused and we're getting more directed at when we deploy sales resources and how we deploy those sales resources. So I see us making evolutionary changes to the sales force based on tangible evidence of what works with respect to our solution portfolio. And I think that's one of the reasons why you've seen the net new customer additions happen this quarter. We were able to focus and pivot on a very big mainframe renewal portfolio that we were able to execute on. And I thought it was extraordinarily well. The other thing, I think, that the sales force did, primarily because of good execution and some of the organizational structure, is they were extraordinarily disciplined in what got sold into renewals. If you take a look at the renewal portfolio, we've been very careful with some of our new flagship products, not allowing those to get put into the renewal without being -- charging the kind of premium that's required. So I was really happy with some of the execution of our sales force in that particular domain this quarter. With respect to Services, we have a big portfolio. And if you take a look at how many service professionals that are required on a global basis, we're constantly using staff augmentation or third parties to do that kind of work. The kind of work I want our service professionals to be migrating to is the architectural work. Now how should the solution be architected in the context of your business in the higher value services and plain core implementation services? That's probably going to get decelerated over time, if we do a really good job, which I think we will, on our product engineering. So at the end of the day, I think it's going to be the right mix of services doing the right things that add the most amount of customer value. Is that helpful?","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That is.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Rich, can you talk a little bit about drivers behind very strong bookings growth here? Were there any renewals moved from future quarters into this one? Or is this just better pricing or more products you added there?","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. So as we had said in the prepared remarks, what you'll see is Q1 and Q2 will smooth out slightly, so there were some transactions that were due to close in Q2, a little bit out of Q3 and 4, but predominantly out of Q2. So if you go back to what we had said in May, it's a little bit smoother between those quarters. Overall, though, we are, as Mike had said, pleased with the pricing levels that we had in the quarter. The reason for the big surge year-over-year is really just the portfolio that is due to renew, as we had talked about earlier, a year ago was the lowest quarter in the 5 years if you went back over the last 5 years. So we expected to be up quarter-over-quarter. We expect to be up year-over-year, excluding the large outsourcing agreement, which comes due at the end of fourth quarter. So we will be up -- we should be up all year long on our bookings. And as long as we keep focused, like we have in Q1, I think you'll continue to see that revenue backlog build as the year progresses.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And Mike, I think you touched upon it briefly in a previous discussions where you're not adding a lot of your key products into these contracts with customers. Can you talk a little bit more about your success in selling outside of the renewal cycles? Are there any other successes on that front that you can talk about?","Michael P. Gregoire","Yes, that's an area that we're still working on. We did all right this quarter, but I still think there's room for improvement. Our portfolio this quarter was so Mainframe-dominated. It kind of dwarfed a lot of the performance of the Enterprise Solutions arena. But this is an area where I think that we can make things happen, but we did have some very large deals. We did, as one of the questions was asked earlier, is in mobile device management. It was a very large outside-the-renewal transaction. And we also did a very large security deal that was definitely outside of the renewal cycle. But I'd like to be here talking out about a handful of transactions. I like to be talking about dozens of transactions. This is an area where we do got to get better and it's definitely a focus of our sales team.","Well, With that, I want to thank everybody for taking the time to listen to our call. I was really happy with Q1. We have an awful lot of work to do here at CA, but we have a very committed team ready to make that happen, and we look forward to keeping this momentum up going into Q2. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation. That does conclude your program. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Ma\u2019am you may begin.","Traci Tsuchiguchi","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies\u2019 Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call.","Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer, and Kieran McGrath, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Kieran will offer some prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Tuesday, January 30, over the telephone and the Internet.

Please refer to our SEC filings including our annual report on Form 10K for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our fourth quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on March 15, 2018.","Please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Gregoire","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am very pleased to report strong fiscal third quarter results. Total revenue growth accelerated from the prior quarter, and organic revenue grew year-over-year. Quarterly revenue was the highest it\u2019s been in four years and resulted in the highest growth rate CA has delivered in six years. Importantly, we delivered a number of new, innovative products to the market.","In terms of bookings metrics, total new sales and organic new sales outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio.","Our strong revenue performance combined with disciplined expense management resulted in solid operating income and margin performance. Excluding the one-time impacts of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that was enacted in the U.S. during our third quarter, commonly referred to as U.S. Tax Reform, earnings per share grew year-over-year.","Across our portfolio, we are positioning CA as the preeminent partner for customers in building a Modern Software Factory. One that is agile, built to change, and able to adapt to market disruption and customer demand. Its foundation is in automation and it is fuelled by data and analytics that are protected by strong security to preserve customers\u2019 most valuable assets. It enables customers to save time and money and reduces errors so that they can deliver application experiences that delight their end users. This effort in building the Modern Software Factory is the combination of developing innovative organic products, acquiring strategic assets, and remaining focused on the customer journey and customer success.","In the third quarter, we launched a number of new products. They represent the on-going investments we are making across our portfolio and are great examples of the innovation CA is delivering to the market. One of our newest organically developed products is CA Continuous Delivery Director, or CDD. This new SaaS based offering integrates the DevOps workflow for end-to-end visibility and management of application development, test, release, and monitoring.","CDD applies intelligence to test planning and quality risk assessment. This enables developers to more easily assess pipeline progress and performance. It provides a seamless way to eliminate inefficient, spreadsheet-driven processes in release planning and management in a single pane of glass by orchestrating CA DevOps solutions, third party solutions, and open source technologies.","Another new product, CA BlazeMeter API Test is a lightweight SaaS-based testing solution that enables developers and testers of agile teams to auto-generate and execute hundreds of API tests concurrently. This is a great of example of a small acquisition that we made in FY\u201917. Since the acquisition, we have ramped organic investment in the underlying technology and continue to expand its capabilities while knitting it into CA\u2019s broader DevOps and Continuous Testing set of solutions.","Globally, security continues to be a critical concern for our customers and CA is uniquely positioned in the identity space to help customers that have hybrid cloud environments. In the quarter, we launched CA Trusted Access Manager for Z, which is essentially Privileged Access Management for the mainframe. It eliminates the need for shared privileged credentials. And, it works directly with mainframe security best practices, producing forensics on all privileged user activity so that customers can maintain complete control of sensitive, mission-critical data.","Our largest mainframe customers continue to experience MIPS growth. Often, they view mainframes as just another enterprise server within their hybrid cloud environment. As the second largest software supplier for this platform, and one of the only software companies making meaningful investments in the area, we are able to provide compelling and unrivaled solutions that address real business needs.","Our solutions are enabling customers to better manage storage needs while protecting the privacy of this data, helping them to achieve GDPR compliance. Our Dynamic Capacity Intelligence solution addresses the challenge of higher costs associated with increasing MIPS usage by optimizing capacity utilization. And, we\u2019re addressing the engineering and technical skills gap by increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.","All of this innovation is helping to drive sustained, long-term renewal yields and healthy new sales in our Mainframe business. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Mainframe business unit. Our third quarter revenue performance was no exception. Clearly, we continue to invest in both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe portfolios.","On the acquisition front, we continue to be pleased with the strategic nature of both Automic and Veracode. The integration of both acquisitions is progressing well and both are contributing to new sales and revenue growth. For example, the third quarter marked Veracode\u2019s largest bookings quarter in its history. Strength was driven by expanded opportunities influenced by CA\u2019s relationships. It also benefitted from broader geographic distribution. In the quarter, Veracode experienced robust growth internationally, where it had little distribution prior to the acquisition.","One of the core tenants of the fundamental improvement we\u2019ve seen over the past few years has been our commitment to customer success. Our NPS, or Net Promoter Score, which is an industry standard measure of customer loyalty, continues to rise on a positive trajectory. In the quarter, our NPS improved three points from the year ago period. All underlying drivers of the score, including Product Quality, Product Functionality, and Ease of Use improved year-over-year. The percentage of customers who consider CA a strategic partner increased year-over-year. Our customer satisfaction score also improved over last year, with an average score exceeding nine on a ten point scale.","We are entering our fiscal fourth quarter with good momentum, which reinforces my confidence in achieving our full year revenue, margin and CFFO guidance.","In many ways, CA is a very different story today than it was several years ago. We plan to host an Analyst Day here in New York on May 30 to provide a framework of what these changes mean as we look ahead to our FY\u201919 and beyond. The timing of the Analyst Day will be shortly after we report our FY\u201918 results and before we report our first quarter of FY\u201919 results under the new revenue recognition accounting standard. It will be a great opportunity to refresh your perspective on CA and to better understand the way in which we will measure and judge our performance going forward. We look forward to sharing more then.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you.","Kieran McGrath","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I\u2019m going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","We were pleased by our results in the third quarter, which was driven by improved topline growth and ongoing disciplined expense management. Importantly, organic revenue grew on a year-over-year basis both in our Enterprise Solutions segment and for the Company overall.","Total new sales in the period were up high-single digits both as reported and in constant currency. Notably, we delivered strong new sales growth despite a renewal portfolio that was down in the high-teens as reported, and down approximately 20% in constant currency.","As we have stated previously, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Our renewal yield for the third quarter was in the mid-80s. Year-to-date, our average renewal yield is slightly above 90%.","From a geographic perspective, new sales increased in all geographies except in North America where new sales were approximately flat on a year-over-year basis.","From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions new sales were up in the mid-teens as reported and up low-teens in constant currency.","Mainframe new sales were down low-single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. Strong new product sales, driven by both established and newer products like Dynamic Capacity Intelligence, Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence, were more than offset by lower capacity sales in the period, reflecting a smaller portfolio of renewals compared to the year ago period.","Total revenue for the third quarter was $1.093 billion, up 9% as reported and up 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 6.5 points to total revenue growth in the quarter.","From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 19% as reported and up 16% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was up 1% as reported and was approximately flat in constant currency, slightly better than our longer-term expectation for the Mainframe market. Services revenue was up 11% as reported and up 9% in constant currency.","Total revenue backlog was up 1% as reported and down 2% in constant currency while current revenue backlog improved 8% as reported and 5% in constant currency. Approximately five points of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode.","GAAP operating margin in the third quarter was 28% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 64% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions, and 3% for Services.","In the third quarter, Mainframe segment margins benefitted from reduced corporate overhead, while ES segment margins benefitted from higher revenue and efficiency improvements. We believe that we will improve the margin of our Enterprise Solutions business over time. However, going forward, as our Enterprise Solutions revenue becomes a larger portion of our overall product mix, we expect it to also absorb more of our corporate overhead, which will partially offset the positive trends in our ES business.","GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense for the third quarter was $375 million and $71 million, respectively. GAAP income tax expense included a $318 million tax charge from the preliminary estimates resulting from U.S. Tax Reform. We have excluded these one-time charges from our Non-GAAP results. Of the $318 million, approximately $220 million related to the deemed repatriation of earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years, and approximately $98 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in income tax rates. We will continue to refine these estimates over subsequent periods.","As a result, our Q3 GAAP tax rate was 133% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 18%. Currently, we expect our longer-term effective tax rate to be in the low-20% range, subject to further interpretation and clarification of U.S Tax Reform.","GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was a loss of $0.23, down 146% as reported and in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.75, up 19% as reported and up 16% in constant currency. Higher revenue coupled with solid operating margin drove our non-GAAP EPS performance. Our non-GAAP EPS also benefitted from an otherwise lower than anticipated effective tax rate. Specifically, net favourable discrete items benefitted our non-GAAP results by approximately $0.04, and the lower statutory U.S. tax rate benefitted our non-GAAP results by an additional $0.05.","Our Q3 CFFO was $315 million, down 39% as reported and down 41% in constant currency. The year-over-year decline in our CFFO is largely attributable to the timing of single-instalment cash collections, which were $36 million in the quarter and down $195 million year-over-year. The timing of single-instalments reflects a lower mix of bookings with financial services companies compared to the year-ago period.","We ended the third quarter with approximately $45 million in net cash. We paid $106 million in dividends and repurchased $53 million worth of shares outstanding in the quarter. We have $507 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization.","We\u2019d like to provide some incremental disclosure with regard to our upcoming adoption of ASC 606. We have not yet finalized our assessment as we still need to close our fiscal fourth quarter and there are a number of factors that will still need to be analyzed. That said we currently believe that upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard our total deferred revenue and revenue backlog will materially decline. As we mentioned last quarter, this reflects the license component of bookings recognized under the current standard. Under ASC 606, this will become part of a cumulative effect adjustment within retained earnings.","As a consequence of this adjustment, when taken together with certain U.S. Tax Reform provisions that accelerate the timing of U.S. income recognition for accrual-method taxpayers, we currently expect an incremental impact of $100 to $150 million of cash taxes to be paid, on average, per year for the next four years.","We expect that this cash tax impact will be largely offset by the benefit from the reduced U.S. corporate tax rate enacted under U.S. Tax Reform. Taken together, we believe the incremental cash taxes resulting from ASC 606 adoption and enactment of U.S. Tax Reform will be approximately $25 million to $50 million, on average, per year for the next four years. As a reminder, we do not expect the new revenue recognition standard to significantly impact billings and cash collections from billings.","Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2017. No material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance.","For the full year we continue to expect total revenue to increase by approximately 5% as reported and approximately 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.25 billion.","We continue to expect our full year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. Given the impact from U.S. Tax Reform, we now expect our GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 55% to 58%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 25%. Our previous guidance was between 28% and 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP.","We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease by 46% to 41%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.10 per share. The change to the GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook primarily relates to the change to the full-year GAAP effective tax rate as a result of U.S. Tax Reform.","We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to increase by 2% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.54 to $2.60. The change to the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook primarily relates to the reduction in the statutory tax rate as a result of U.S. Tax Reform and other net discrete tax benefits realized.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares.","We continue to expect cash flow from operations to be up 2% to 6% as reported, and flat to up 4% in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.10 billion to $1.15 billion.","With that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes thanks. Hi guys. Kieran lot of discussions that were untapped, I just want to make sure that we\u2019re clear, what is the net impact that you talked about in terms of the cash tax impact of the moving part?","Kieran McGrath","Hi Sterling. So what we defined is that we think that as you know, as we do this flow through into our retained earnings as part of the modified retrospective method. With that tax liability that we create we get to pay that tax to the U.S. government over a four-year time period. We think that the impact could be anywhere from $100 million to $150 million a year related to that impact alone. However, as we move forward because of the benefit with our tax rates that as we said we expect to be in the low 20% range, we think we\u2019ll be able to mitigate most of that and the likely impact will probably somewhere between $25 million and $50 million on a net a basis.","Sterling Auty","So that\u2019s $25 million to $50 million higher than what we would have seen under the old accounting rules. But then again after the four-year payments on the deferred then you\u2019ll get the net benefit of the lower tax rate will really start to flow through.","Kieran McGrath","Exactly, exactly.","Sterling Auty","Okay, alright. On to the business, it looks like there\u2019s very solid improvement, especially in the ES part of the business. You announced a number of new products, but I want to make sure that we\u2019re clear in terms of what really resonates, what were the things that you saw the most improvement in the ES portfolio here in the quarter?","Kieran McGrath","Mike?","Mike Gregoire","Hi Sterling it\u2019s Mike. I think it was a combination of things. As you know, when we move from quarter to quarter, we have some renewals that come up. But we had a nice uptick in selling outside of the renewal portfolio. And on the Mainframe, they had a very nice quarter. We had three net new products that we put out there, Dynamic Capacity Intelligence, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and Data Content Discovery. I think some customers, as they were getting ready for GDPR, were starting to think through how they are going to go take a look at their data cycle. That was a bit of an uptick for us. The products are really, the newer products are really starting to take off. Very nice quarter with Veracode, PPM, Agile Central and strong performance from API Management","So when we take a look at the number of organic and acquired products that we put a lot of R&D into and how they're being sold and marketed into our customer base, well, net new customers, it was significantly better than Q2.","Kieran McGrath","And if I might add, in addition to obviously the SaaS products that Mike referenced with Veracode, PPM and Agile what really helped us as well, and again, part of that benefited as from a smaller renewal quarter than a year ago. As part of selling outside the renewal, we actually saw an increase in our upfront revenue recognition as well in areas like PAM and API Management that were also much better than we experienced in Q2.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.","Mohit Gogia","Thanks guys. This Mohit Gogia dialling in for Raimo. So great guys. So on the top line seems like a solid performance on revenue. If you look at the mix, it's good to see the company going back to organic revenue growth, delivering organic revenue growth. But can you just provide more color on the bookings performance? Some of the puts and takes there? Thank you.","Mike Gregoire","Sure Mohit. A good question. So as a reminder, and you know this pretty well, our bookings are actually heavily influenced by our renewal portfolio overall. And the renewal portfolio, depending on duration and timing of when we signed big customer events, can vary from quarter-on-quarter. In the quarter, our renewal portfolio was down 20% versus a year ago. So when we look at it and we see that our total new sales are up in the high single digits, well obviously, that is benefiting from both inorganic as well as organic participation.","But take a look at the Mainframe business our new sales from a Mainframe perspective were down in the low single digits. Our ES new sales in aggregate were up around 10%. However, if I look at that on an organic basis only, it was down around 10%. However, I still see a lot of selling outside the renewal because my renewal portfolio was down 20% in total. So we definitely saw a lot of sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter on that even though overall, organic ES sales were down.","Mohit Gogia","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John DiFucci of Jefferies. Your line is open.","John DiFucci","Thanks. Mike a question for you, then one for Kieran. I guess, Veracode sounds like it really benefited from working under the broader reach of CA. I guess I'm trying to give a trying to give a sense for how sustainable this is. How are sales to sort of traditional customers outside of CA's, what I would say somewhat limited core customer base? ","Mike Gregoire","Yes, I think that's a great product that is probably one of our easier products along with API Management to sell standalone to net new customers or customers that might have some of our more mature products and are looking to engage in the relationship with CA outside of the core because it's such an important product with respect to protecting the assets of the company and being able to run it in the cloud. It's a very low implementation cost, so it's a very approachable product.","The other thing is to your second question, Veracode had a very small distribution engine especially outside the United States. It's a product that sells well in Europe. We're starting to see some traction in both Latin America and APAC. The other thing is we continue to pour R&D dollars into the Veracode. And as we continue to enhance the product and also bring our net new products under the Veracode platform, I think it's going to sustain for the next foreseeable future, John.","John DiFucci","So you are seeing sales, continued sales outside your traditional customer base?","Mike Gregoire","That is correct. It's probably \u2013 as I said, it's one of the easier products to sell because it fits the mantra of easy to sell, easy to install, easy to run. It's got a very interesting and quick ROI.","John DiFucci","Okay great. Thanks Mike. And Kieran, if I can just go back to Sterling's question because it's important. You've been great about this. This is something that's all new for us, too. CA has been sort of front and centre in trying to help explain all this. But I just want to make sure I understand. ASC 606, I was always under the impression that, that would have a net neutral effect on cash flow, although you pointed out early that it would affect the timing. It could affect the timing of cash flow. But according to what you just said, is that still hold? I mean to have $100 million to $150 million negative impact over the next \u2013 per year, over the next four years, is that all due to ASC 606? That sounds like \u2013 that doesn't sound like a shift, a little shift in timing. ","Kieran McGrath","Yes, so John, it's a great question and I think it's worth spending little time on it. So two things and a third. We always knew that ASC 606, if you have a change in the timing of your revenue, obviously, the government is going to have a change in the timing of the taxes that you're supposed to pay to them. So we always knew that was coming. And quite frankly, we originally estimating that it will hurt us on the 35% statutory U.S. tax rate. The good news is U.S. tax reform in terms of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, get signed, reduces the statutory U.S. tax rate at 21%. So any of that hit that you're going to take as part of the 606, you'll take it at a cheaper tax hit.","However, the government also had a clause in there, I think they called it the [indiscernible] test. And especially, they expanded their reach beyond just what was in your deferred revenue as well, but actually wanted to see everything that was in your total backlog. And essentially, what with the same reaction once you sign a contract, they were \u2013 you have to recognize that revenue in its entirety. They were entitled to take the tax and all that. ","What we're talking about is purely the profits that we would recognize sometime in the future being accelerated to a point in time and we have the opportunity to pay that tax over four years. But it's purely down the timing. There is no incremental tax hit related to it. It's all related to timing.","John DiFucci","Okay. Kieran we really thank you. We really appreciate. This is for all of us and it's somewhat complex, and you've been very, very helpful. So thanks. Appreciate it.","Kieran McGrath","And what we did wanted to be clear was \u2013 and we're emphasizing it again. So yes, we have the 606 haircut to come along both because of the benefits in terms of the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate as well, it really is a net modified hit of only between in our estimate right now, $25 million to $50 million a year.","John DiFucci","Yes, I got it. Okay, thank you. ","Kieran McGrath","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Abhey Lamba","Yes, thank you. And good performance guys, congrats. Mike can you talk about the drivers behind sales outside of renewals cycles? Clearly, we saw pretty good results there. And you highlighted Veracode doing really well due to geographic expansion. What are the other products that can benefit from a similar type of geographic expansion? ","Mike Gregoire","Sure. I think selling outside the renewal first of all this is something that we've been working on for an awful long time. I would say it's been a top of mind and focused believe it or not, for about eight quarters. And we did have a very nice quarter. I still think there's work for us to do to become more consistent with respect to that. But I do like the pattern recognition that I saw in the quarter and I like the way that the sales team called their forecast and stuck to their forecast pretty much throughout the back end of the quarter, which means that they're really getting in and digging in deep in understanding the buying patterns of the customers.","That's what being a professional, that's about being diligent and having a little bit of grip. And I think that had a lot to do with selling outside of the renewal. And as you can remember, I was less than flattery about the sales force in Q2 for what I thought was less than diligent performance with respect to selling outside the renewal and understanding the process at each and every customer, which is not necessarily the same. You have to really go in and understand who the economic buyer is who the economic user is and who the approver is. I think I saw signs that the sales force is a really nice job this quarter and being able to do that.","Abhey Lamba","Got it.","Mike Gregoire","Now if you have products that \u2013 I can't stress this enough, if you have products that are easy to use, easy to install, intangible ROI, I mean, it's easier to sell those products than it is to sell a product that's got a long sales cycle, a perpetual license, which means it's got to have probably a more complex install. Now there are some products in the world and some products definitely at CA that add an incredible amount of value, but they're complex because they're solving complex problems. But to the extent our portfolio has more SaaS, easy to use, well-designed products will we be able to articulate the ROI in very easy to understand business terms, I think you have a shortened sales cycle plus a more impactful sales cycle. Now the products that fit that more easily, obviously Veracode, PPM, Agile Central, API Management while it's more or less a lot of perpetual, it's a product that is more easy to install and easier to use.","And I would argue that PAM, well, if you get into a multi-country, multi data centre, multiplatform environment that could get awfully complex. But we do have a lot of customers that are looking for Privileged Identity Management, whether it be on a single mode of mainframes with a new product we put out that does that persistency or just in one particular data centre with homogenous servers. So I think it really depends on what the customers \u2013 the problem with the customers trying to solve, but we definitely have a much bigger portfolio of solutions to hit a modern software performance agenda.","Abhey Lamba","Got it, thanks. And Kieran you talked about North America being flat versus while other regions have been extremely well. Can you just compare and contrast the dynamics in the regions? And that's it from me.","Kieran McGrath","Sure. I mean, so just as a reminder, from the North Americas perspective, obviously, we're heavily influenced because of the renewal portfolio declining on a year-over-year basis. Actually we\u2019re pretty happy with \u2013 actually very happy with their selling outside the renewal portfolio. APJ, inside of APJ, Japan did pretty well. Honestly, we could have done better on the sales outside of the renewal and the upfront revenue there. L.A., L.A. just had a really gangbusters quarter for us in terms of new sales and revenue growth. And EMEA, obviously, they did well with new sales especially with a lot of help from the Automic acquisition.","We would like to see a little bit more consistency across all the regions within EMEA. North, South, West, et cetera. But I would take a step back and say all of our geographies actually seemed revenue growth in the current quarter. So that was a real positive.","Abhey Lamba","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard ","Hi Kieran, wondering first just on the software fees and other, that number was up quite a bit, I think the market jumped versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past, that $220 million. What drove that? ","Kieran McGrath","I'm sorry. One more time again? I didn't \u2013 which one?","Walter Pritchard ","The software fees and other line the upfront fees went up a lot, yes, up a lot, and I was curious what the driver was there? ","Kieran McGrath","Right. So as we talked about in the past within there, we have both our upfront revenue, as well as our SaaS revenue. And I'm happy to say that both contributed very strongly sequentially and in the year-to-year basis in the quarter. So both our SaaS business as well as our on-prem business that's recognized in an upfront basis both did quite well in the quarter.","Walter Pritchard ","Okay. And then I guess if I sort of parse through just on a high level, total revenue grew 9%. You're talking about two points of currency impact, 6.5 points to M&A, the organic growth is more like 0.5 point, which is pretty different than your headline number. But your \u2013 I'd say your rhetoric sounds a lot better in terms of how you're feeling about the business. I guess, I don't \u2013 if I look at that half a percent kind of organic constant currency growth on the revenue side, I don't necessarily \u2013 with a little bit more upfront, I don't necessarily come away thinking this was a much better quarter.","Could you help me understand just in your tone why you sound like you're much happier with the results than that would indicate?","Kieran McGrath","Sure. So in the last quarter in Q2, ES revenue was down organically. I think it was 5% or 6%. We were up organically in ES revenue in Q1 really driven by the strength in our SaaS revenue recovery in the upfront and then strength in the SaaS businesses. Mainframe, which had been down 3% in Q2, actually was flat on a constant currency basis in the quarter. The Services business, which had been a real drag on the business for many, many quarters, now actually was organically up 1%. So I would say I saw a very strong sequential improvement across all three of our business segments in Q3 that made me actually quite happy in the performance overall. We can always do better, but in terms of sequential improvement, it was quite strong.","Walter Pritchard ","And then just last quick one on the renewal rate in the mid-80s. What was the \u2013 I think that\u2019s been a little lower than normally what was the driver there?","Kieran McGrath","I mean it was down 20% in our renewal portfolio overall. It only takes couple of deals that are challenged to heavily influence the renewal portfolio like that and that's kind of where it is. On a year-to-date basis, I don't see any trends here that and I'm worried about. We're still over 90% in total but again, a few deals and a smaller renewal portfolio in aggregate can influence it.","Walter Pritchard ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Kieran McGrath","Thanks Walter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Moerdler of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you for taking the question, I appreciate. As you mentioned Mainframe revenue was flat constant currency, but new sales and Mainframe were down low single digits. Can you give me a little more color to understand that? Then I have a follow-up.","Kieran McGrath","Remember, the Mainframe model is a rateable business model and the performance in the current quarter is predicated upon the new sales that we've been driving as well as the renewal rates that we see the Mainframe business for all of the preceding quarters. So as you've heard Mike talk about other new products that we've been bringing to market here for the Mainframe perspective, it's having an effect along with the business that's quite sticky. So we feel that really come to a fruition here in the quarter, where our revenue in aggregate was flat on a year-to-date basis. And I might add actually against a pretty difficult compare with our Mainframe business for Q3 over a year ago as well.","Mark Moerdler","That makes sense. I really appreciate that\u2019s very helpful. And second, just to confirm on the tax implications [ph] to change in ASC-606, you're saying that the IRS looks at your total backlog basically hit you now with a charge for what's sitting in the backlog. Does it simply mean that they\u2019re pulling for the tax payment? And if so, I guess, we won't see those taxes payments in the future. And is that fully included in the 20% tax rate going forward that you guided?","Kieran McGrath","So I think you have to separate the thought process, Mark. One thing is it's actually the difference between 331-18and 4118, but we're going to watch the backlog and the deferred revenue into retained earnings. That's going to create a taxable transaction. That's what I talked about in terms of spending $100 million to $150 million a year over the next four years. It will spread that payment out. That's the onetime event.","Prospectively, our new revenue recognition to 606 is going to require that you take revenue at point in time when you deliver it and that will also accelerate revenue. But it's not going to be nearly as substantial, and that's the piece that's captured in the low 20s rate as we go out through time.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent. Very helpful, I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Kieran McGrath","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Brad Zelnick","Great, thanks so much. Mike, a lot of indicators suggest the industry is in a midst of a strong spending cycle in data centre. Can you talk about the extent to which you think it benefits CA in both sides of the business? And specifically what you're hearing from customers relative to their optimism and propensity to spend? ","Mike Gregoire","Sure. I think that there is an awful lot of optimism. Last week, I was in Davos and pretty much across the board, there is two big themes. One, just in general, business optimism And second, a big, big focus on jobs and how jobs are being affected by the digital footprint. And every company really understanding that they've got to have a digital persona regardless of what industry they're in. And as they accelerate their ability to understand their customers, taking advantage of artificial intelligence, taking advantage of Big Data, they have to put systems in place that are very close to their customers to collect that data and also serve those customers.","So I think that this combination of better than average synchronized growth on a global basis coupled with this notion that they have to get more digital, that puts us in a great spot. If you're going to be building products, you're probably going to want to manage that product in that project. You're going to use PPM. If you're going to be building software, you're going to wanted to do it to Agile. If you are building the software, you're going to have to test that software. If you're going to test that software, you're going to want to do it in an automated fashion.","And as you move from unit test to integration test to system test to performance test, you're not going to want to do that by hand or write custom scripts. You're going to want to automate that whole continuous delivery process. And then oh by the way, if you're thinking on a much more digital footprint, you better make sure you've got security. You don't want to have that code go through a couple of scans. And as developers are starting to write their code, you're going to want them building in the security functions into the code before it's flipped over to operations.","When this is running, you're going to want to be able to monitor it. You're going to want to be able to monitor disk drives, you're going to want to be able to monitor a cloud functions whether you put the application in AWS or Azure in your own data centre on the Mainframe, we're the only company that can monitor that completely heterogeneous platform.","So when I see high GDP growth-driven by a company's desire to have a bigger digital footprint, I'm very bullish about our opportunity to participate in that. ","Brad Zelnick","Awesome Mike. And Kieran just a follow-up for you. How do you think about your cash balances in on-shore subsidiaries now post tax reform and possibly using the cash to buy back more stock?","Kieran McGrath","Sure. Well I mean, the first thing I'll say is obviously, we're still permanently invested with our cash overseas. We'll obviously use this as a great opportunity now to replace it with Mike and with the Board our capital allocation strategy overall. We do that with the Board in a fairly regular basis and so there's nothing new about that. But obviously, it still has the potential to potentially free up more cash for CA to access and as well we're going to look for the best geographies and the best places to make our investments to drive the most optimal shareholder value that we can.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Hi, yes thanks very much. Mike may be just a follow-up on Brad\u2019s comment around sort of the economic cycle. When you look at sort of the execution this quarter, are there any metrics you look at in terms of win rates or sort of the pipeline build that makes you feel good that the execution is really sort of more organic CA getting better versus sort of just being able to tag along on a better economic cycle? I know obviously, you hope to have both. But as this is sort of selling outside the renewal cycle, it's been an ongoing process. What makes you feel good that this is two steps forward and not one step back as we look out over the remainder of this calendar year?","Mike Gregoire","Sure. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got enough data to say that we've got repeatability on a consistent basis to be able to sell outside the renewal quarter every quarter. Now part of that is just systemic from what the renewal portfolio looks like. To the extent that we've got a big renewal portfolio, it's going to be harder. If we have a smaller renewal portfolio, it's going to show up. It's going to show up more that we were not able to do that because it less adds that.","But from a metrics perspective, you look at a handful of very important metrics. We'll look at every single product every quarter, win loss, and we take a look very diligently once a week as a whole management team on pipeline and pipeline progression. We take a look at split between digital and direct sales, so when we see the pipeline and we have heuristics on some of these products because we've had them for a while. We know what kind of pipeline we need to get to the kind of numbers that we're looking for.","Most products like you see in most software companies is about 3x. We also take a look at each and every sales professional, each sales territory to understand how much pipeline they've added, what their close rates are and how well they perform against their forecast. I think if you are calling a number especially midway through the quarter and they are able to hold that forecast that means you intimately understand the buying patterns of your customer. That was much, much better in Q3 than it was in Q2.","So we are constantly looking at ways to improve. I saw quite a bit of improvement, as Kieran pointed out across each and every segment. But make no mistake about it, we still have work to do here and we are going to be on it all day every day. We think we have a great opportunity. We've got great products. It's a complex industry, it's a competitive industry. I think if we let our guard down at all and don't seek for continuous improvement, I think you will fall in the weight inside of every software company that got over their SKUs with respect to their performance. We had a good quarter. I was really happy with it. We've got another one coming up and another year and another year after that. And customers change, personnel changes, products change. I think we have to stay off this all the time. And that's kind of an agile mindset, which we adopted.","Kirk Materne","That\u2019s great. That really helped. I really appreciate the color. And just Kieran, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that in terms of the margin mix shift that ES gets bigger. Can you just talk about the opportunities for where the opportunities, I guess, exist to take margins up in the ES business, understanding the business itself will be taking on some of the overhead or more of the overhead? Specifically, I'm wondering around your sales and marketing efficiency, R&D efficiency, where maybe some of the opportunities in that part of the business? ","Kieran McGrath","Sure. Well, I think first and foremost, nothing has changed in terms of our overall view in terms of the opportunity for our ES margins. We really believe that this business should be capable of operating in the high teens. And I think our on-prem business certainly has plenty of opportunities to get there. I think when you think about those businesses, we want to make sure we do the appropriate level of investments. So we're not looking to start those. I think from our SaaS business perspective, scale is what you find. As you grow the scale, a lot of these are businesses that we've acquired, that we acquired them and they're now profitable. So scale is critically important. I think where you'll see most of that benefit will literally be on the sales and marketing side, right? As you start to scale through that.","What we're seeing on our businesses that we're acquiring and we are doing all orders of magnitude, more transactions but we're doing these transactions at a much smaller average selling price. And that takes a different sales motions and things like that than what we've historically done. And we're always looking to fine-tune our go-to-market motions and our go-to-market spend in total and I think that's one of the areas where will see the improvement as we go through time.","Kirk Materne","Great. Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Kieran McGrath","I think it\u2019s just important to reemphasize, really, we don't see any change in either the Mainframe profitability or the ES opportunity profitability. We just want to point out especially in the quarter where you see ES' revenue growth so dramatically, it actually pulls more kind of the general overhead from the corporation as well. So it's a little bit of \u2013 as they make progress, they're still having to absorb little headwind, if you will.","Kirk Materne","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Matt Hedberg ","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Mike, you mentioned GDPR in your prepared remarks and we think your Identity assets can certainly be well positioned in that regard. I was curious, though, throughout the quarter, throughout the December quarter, did you actually see GDPR conversations drive sales? Or is it still too early to say if that\u2019s influencing sales behavior?","Mike Gregoire","No it's definitely driving sales. We have to go live with it. All of us do that operate in the European Union in May. So especially large companies that have mainframes in particular, like 70% of the world's business data is on the Mainframe. Almost every company that we deal with it has a Mainframe as a multinational and they're looking for ways to be able to deal with the regulation. And they want to make sure that they get it right and this is a tool that can help.","Matt Hedberg ","Got it, that's helpful. And I know there's always a question about a lag effect here. But how should we think about the potential benefit from the IBM Mainframe research cycle?","Mike Gregoire","Sure we\u2019re seeing obviously MIPS increase, so that shows up a little bit in our capacity. In one of our products, Mainframe Operations Intelligence, I mean, every customer is looking \u2013 they wake up in the morning and they have to say, I want more MIPS but I want to be the least amount possible. So if they're going to drive more MIPS, they're going to want to run those machines as efficiently as they possibly can. And Mainframe Operational Intelligence is a way that they can take advantage of getting the right applications to run at the right times and in the right partitions. And it gets a little bit complex. But it really does save on their MIPS usage when they are using those a general purpose MIPS that they could be quite expensive if you're running complex, heavy transaction processing.","Matt Hedberg ","Great.","Kieran McGrath","And if I just might add. So obviously, we're thrilled to see the quarter that the IBM hardware had in terms of the MIPS abatement out there. What we normally find is our customers tend to buy increased capacity where their renewal cycle naturally comes up. So we were headed down renewal cycle this quarter and we expect to move into a heavier renewal quarter here in Q4 that we have an opportunity to sell incremental capacity as well.","Matt Hedberg ","Thanks guys. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mike Gregoire, CEO for closing remarks.","Mike Gregoire","Well, thank you very much. And thanks everyone joining us to night. I know everyone is super busy. At the end of the day, I think we delivered really strong third quarter results. I'm very pleased that it was the best revenue growth rate we delivered in six years. And organic revenue grew year-over-year, although as Walter pointed out, relatively small. It's definitely a step in the right direction. The revenue performance combined with disciplined expense management drove solid operating income and margin in the quarter. And over the long term, we believe the CA will benefit from the recently enacted U.S. tax reform.","Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value. Thank you once again and good night.","Operator","Well ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Thank you for joining us.","I am pleased to report solid Q2 results. We delivered another quarter of revenue growth with strong margins and earnings. Our performance in the quarter improves our confidence in our ability to cross-over into modest revenue growth for the full year of fiscal 2017. We are making progress across a number of our key initiatives. Our product development and innovation engines are beginning to gain traction. And I am very pleased with our customer experience metrics. We know that we are moving the ball in the right direction, while we recognize that there are areas in which we still need to continue to improve.","As expected, new sales declined in the quarter, driven largely by the very difficult year-over-year comparison as a result of the large System Integrator deal we closed in the year-ago period. Importantly, as we mentioned last quarter, we now have agreements in place with our three largest SI customers for the next several years. This reflects our position as a trusted technology partner to the largest global System Integrators and provides us with good visibility into our longer-term customer commitments.","In terms of sales execution, I am happy to report that our freestanding new sales increased year-over-year. While the overall portfolio of deals for us to renew was smaller in Q2, I am encouraged by our healthy attach rates to renewals. In the quarter, MetLife, one of the largest global insurance companies; FedEx, a global transportation and business service leader; and Cerner, a healthcare delivery solution provider, expanded their relationships with CA to include a number of solutions across our portfolio.","New sales in our Named and Growth, or partner-led accounts, also grew nicely. Continued progress in freestanding new sales and penetration into Named and Growth accounts are key to driving long-term sustained growth. Q2 CFFO was negatively impacted year-over-year by the combination of a lower level of single installment collections and a higher level of cash tax payments in the quarter.","As we've said before, we remain focused on and committed to developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage. A byproduct of this can be seen in the decline we are experiencing in our Services revenue. We continue to expect that as our portfolio of more user-friendly products grows and we increasingly leverage partners, our Services revenue line will be impacted.","Our Q2 Services performance reflects this ongoing trend. Results were also impacted by a lower level of prior-period services bookings and some non-strategic projects that have come to close. We expect these collective factors will continue to be headwinds to our Services revenue.","We remain committed to cultivating and nurturing the spirit of innovation at CA. While there is always more work to do, and we acknowledge that real, systemic change within a large product organization takes time to bear fruit, we are making considerable progress. We are continuing to innovate within our existing portfolio and now have a more disciplined process in place to invest in future areas of growth for CA. I am very pleased that our efforts are recognized by industry analysts and, most importantly, by our customers. We look forward to providing more color on our progress at CA World next month.","I would like to highlight our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions, which had a great quarter with significant customer wins across a number of sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, media, government and healthcare IT. We are committed to helping our customers become more agile in the application economy. Our Continuous Delivery portfolio is central to this strategy as it enables customers to rapidly develop, efficiently test, and reliably release applications. The result is more, higher-quality applications delivered to the market at a faster pace.","We continue to invest in innovations across the Continuous Delivery portfolio. Our latest version was made available in July and focuses on an improved security model for customers. It also provides dependency management for complex deployments involving multiple applications. We are pleased that CA Release Automation was positioned by Gartner in the Leaders quadrant in its inaugural Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. It helps customers manage their complex continuous delivery pipelines and is a critical element of a DevOps strategy in executing many small releases in quick succession.","In August, we released the latest version of CA Agile Requirements Designer, an end-to-end requirements gathering, test automation and test case design tool that reduces manual testing effort. And, just last month, we announced the small but strategic acquisition of BlazeMeter. While not meaningful in terms of its immediate financial impact, BlazeMeter adds a next-generation open-source, SaaS-based performance and load testing platform to the portfolio.","Within Security, I am particularly pleased with Privileged Access Management, Advanced Authentication as well as Payment Security, which all delivered very healthy new sales growth. In the quarter, we closed multiple seven-figure transactions, including very good competitive wins for CA Privileged Access Management. We released a number of enhancements across the portfolio, and we continue to view Security as one of the key pillars in our strategy to grow in the years ahead. Security is a critical component for our customers and their digital transformation strategies.","We are pleased with our performance of our Mainframe business from a revenue perspective for the second quarter and for the first half of our fiscal year. We recognize that this is a market not in secular growth, unlike the rest of our markets. As such, there is no doubt that size matters. We are in a unique position as the largest independent software vendor in this market and really the only other company outside of IBM making meaningful investments to support, sustain and innovate for our customers with a mainframe footprint.","This means that we are able to organically innovate on the Mainframe, with solutions like CA Data Content Discovery, or DCD. With more than 70% of enterprise data on the mainframe, DCD enables customers to identify data exposure risks on z Systems by automatically scanning through the data on the mainframe infrastructure for regulated or sensitive data. Data discovery, classification by security level, and comprehensive reporting enables our customers to mitigate risk. We are the only vendor in the market that does this on the Mainframe and we are very pleased with its performance and rate of market adoption.","The breadth and scale of our portfolio, our focus on integrations across the enterprise, and our dedicated efforts to continually improve customer experience are the foundations of our ability to support end-to-end DevOps on the Mainframe. We have flagship solutions like CA Endevor, which provides source code management and archives versioning of code development, including Java and parallel development. We also provide newer solutions like CA Application Lifecycle Conductor, or ALC, which helps customers automate and manage the software development lifecycle spanning mobile-to-mainframe environments.","CA provides one of the broadest portfolios of mainframe solutions in the industry. And we are leveraging our R&D across our development organizations. For example, CA Agile Central users can create a new agile story and then drag and drop so that ALC and Endevor create all of the associated code on the Mainframe and moves the code from development to test and then to production. Other examples of Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe synergies include: CA Release Automation, Test Data Management, and Service Virtualization. These are all tangible proof points of CA's commitment to, and investment in, providing value to our customers across Mainframe, distributed, cloud, and mobile.","This leads me to an area in which everyone across every level of CA's global workforce is focused: customer experience. Perhaps the best way to illustrate what this means to us is to provide a few specific customer examples. TomTom, the Dutch navigation, mapping, GPS and now sports and fitness company, implemented CA Agile Central in its transition from traditional waterfall software development to Agile. Through this experience, TomTom views CA as much more than a software provider. CA is a trusted partner that provides access, demonstrates responsiveness, and engages in continuous product collaboration.","The Royal Bank of Scotland is implementing the bank's vision of delivering a seamless, omni-channel customer experience using CA Risk Analytics. CA's solutions and partnership enable RBS to be agile and adaptive to the needs of its customers in an ever-changing financial services industry. These are the types of stories that motivate us every day.","From the earliest point of contact with customers through the many years that follow, we have vastly improved how we are showing up. From our CNN partnership for its election coverage, to the tens of thousands of customers we reached out to on Customer Experience Day last month, and the ongoing contact our development and sales teams have with our customers on a daily basis, we have made considerable improvement. CA's brand familiarity and consideration continues to move higher, particularly among business decision-makers. Our customers are giving us higher scores on product quality, and customer satisfaction continues to trend positively.","We are proud of the great progress our team has made across the organization, but we are not satisfied. We still have work to do to further refine and optimize and really be agile, so that we can continue to evolve and achieve the type of long-term sustainable growth we know we have the potential to achieve.","Looking ahead, I'm optimistic. When I look at our company holistically in terms of the markets we're in and the opportunities we have both organically and inorganically, I believe that we are on track. Overall, we believe we can deliver modest, low-single digit growth over the medium-term.","We look forward to welcoming many of you at CA World next month. Through keynotes, guest speakers, and technical and best practice sessions, we'll explore and demonstrate how software has risen from a supporting role to the lead actor in driving business strategy and velocity. We will host an analyst session on November 16 that will provide a great opportunity to speak with our executive team and to hear what our customers are saying firsthand.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","Our Q2 total revenue was $1.018 billion and was up 1% and up 2% in constant currency. This was the second consecutive quarter we've grown revenue year-over-year as reported and the third in constant currency. Q2 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% and increased 8% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions decreased 1% as reported and in constant currency. Services declined 10% and declined 9% in constant currency.","Q2 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-20%s as reported and in constant currency. The decrease in Q2 total new sales was due primarily to a difficult year-over-year compare, driven by new sales associated with the large system integrator renewal transaction we signed in Q2 last year. Excluding the large SI transaction, total new product and capacity sales were down low-teens as reported and in constant currency.","Q2 renewals were down in the mid-50%s both as reported and in constant currency. Excluding the large SI transaction, renewals were down high-single digits both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high-teens year-over year both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low-90%s, in line with our longer-term target.","Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America, due in part to the difficult year-over-year compare resulting from last year's large SI transaction, as well as a smaller renewal portfolio even outside of this large SI transaction. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region.","New sales were up in EMEA due to strong performance in Named and Growth, or partner-led accounts. To this point, we have seen minimal impact from Brexit on new sales. APJ was up sharply to more normalized levels following a difficult quarter in the year-ago period. Revenue grew across all geographies as reported, except in EMEA. Revenue grew in North America and APJ, was flat in Latin America, and declined in EMEA in constant currency.","Within our segments, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-40%s year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-20%s and in the low-20%s in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance reflects lower levels of mainframe capacity due to the composition of the renewal portfolio, outside of the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Overall, we continue to expect our mainframe revenue to be down in the low-single digits over the medium-term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.","Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high-teens year-over-year, as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased high-single digits, as reported and in constant currency, in line with the renewal portfolio. Areas such as Continuous Delivery and Security saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our Enhance portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow.","Services revenue decreased 10% and 9% in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Services revenue is also impacted by a lower level of bookings in previous quarters and the conclusion of some non-strategic Services engagements. As Mike mentioned, we expect this headwind in Services will continue to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth.","Total revenue backlog was up 4% as reported and in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 2% as reported and in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low-90%s renewal yield.","Q2 GAAP operating margin was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 40%. Operating margin improved year-over-year due to improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the acquisition-related expenses in the year-ago period.","This was partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to us entering into an agreement-in-principle to settle the longstanding matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. This litigation was previously disclosed by us and relates to time periods as far back as 2002. The proposed settlement is for $45 million and admits no wrongdoing. While it is still subject to finalization, we are pleased to have entered into this agreement-in-principle in an effort to put it behind us. We look forward to continuing our longstanding relationship with the government as a trusted and valued customer and partner.","Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 18% for Enterprise Solutions, and 3% for Services.","Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 31% and 29%, respectively. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, up 28% year-over-year and up 31% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, up 20% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency.","Our Q2 CFFO was negative $58 million, down year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. CFFO declined relative to the year-ago period, primarily due to a lower level of single installment collections in the quarter as well as higher cash tax payments. Single installment cash payments were $59 million and down $70 million year-over-year. The lower level of single installment cash payments resulted from the mix of renewals in the quarter, which had fewer large financial institutions. Single installment cash payments typically come from large financial institutions.","We ended Q2 with approximately $496 million in net cash. During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization.","As Mike said, we are pleased with our Q2 performance and it gives us improved confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year in fiscal year 2017. We are making progress across key imperatives and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve our ability to sustainably grow.","However, there is still work to do. Our performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth and partner-led opportunities continues to improve but remains uneven. Also, our strong revenue performance in the quarter and the first half was aided by a relatively low proportion of upfront deals in the year-ago periods, making for easier compares.","As we indicated last quarter, the large SI deal we signed in Q1 substantially shifted the renewal portfolio such that fiscal year 2018 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year. To overcome this headwind, we are working to drive continuous improvement in the sales organization to increase consistency and velocity, independent of the renewal cycle.","We are continuing to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization, and continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to supplement our portfolio. As a company, we expect modest revenue growth in the medium-term. This is the result of our three-pronged capital allocation of quarterly dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions.","Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase in a range of flat to up 1% as reported and in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectation. This translates to reported revenue of $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion.","We expect a full-year GAAP operating margin of 29% and full-year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations.","GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 6% to 8% as reported and 2% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 2% to 5% as reported and 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54.","We'd like to provide some additional color regarding our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2017. While there's no change to our full-year revenue guidance, I'd like to provide some headlights into how we expect Q3 to play out. In terms of the year-over-year compare, the tailwind of the upfront revenue mix that benefited the first half of the fiscal year is expected to become a headwind in the second half of the fiscal year.","As such, we expect revenue to decline a couple of percentage points year-over-year in Q3. This is largely due to the timing of the mix of upfront deals that closed last year, in addition to a lower level of Services revenue. As discussed earlier, the upfront mix was particularly low in the first half of fiscal 2016 and then rebounded in the third quarter.","With regard to non-GAAP operating margins, we expect the lower revenue level to impact Q3 operating margin when compared to the year-ago period. As indicated earlier, there is no change to our full-year 2017 revenue or operating margin guidance.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares.","Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 1% increase, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion. Previous quarter guidance was an increase of 2% to 6% and an increase of 1% to 5% in constant currency. This change is due to the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement-in-principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed.","With that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is Andrew (25:05) on for Raimo. Could you dig in a little more to that GSA settlement? And are we going to see any more impacts maybe this year or next year?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Hi, Andrew (25:18). Thank you. Yes, the GSA settlement, this is a longstanding complaint that was filed sometime in 2009 and it goes back to transactions that reach all the way back to 2002. And we've been working with the DOJ since 2014, trying to understand their complaint and how to best resolve it.","And we're pretty pleased to be able to resolve this at $45 million. We'll pay that $45 million off sometime in Q3 or Q4 as we get through the formal process of the settlement. This has been a boat anchor that's been in every 10-K and 10-Q since I've been here and working through this process is long and arduous, and I think both us and the government are happy to have this behind us.","The government's a great customer of ours. We do a lot of different transactions with a lot of different agencies. And this has been something that we've both been working in earnest to try to get to a reasonable settlement.","We don't have anything of this kind of magnitude on the books for the rest of the year. And the way we're running the railroad here, we've got enough controls in place that I think that being very clean with respect to how we transact, especially with the government, we've really stepped that up over the last couple of years. Hopefully, that's helpful.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Quite. And maybe if I could sneak in one more just to cross the Ts and dot the Is on this. Anything in the next few quarters of any particularly large deals that might be coming up that we should look out for?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","With respect to selling deals or respect to settlements?","Unknown Speaker","For booking deals.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Oh, we're always trying to find the big ones, but our renewal portfolio is pretty set between now and the end of the year. And we don't see anything that we have in the pipeline that would be of the magnitude of Q2 of last year. But as we saw in the first quarter of this year, sometimes customers decide that they want to make a strategic decision to consolidate their data centers and\/or consolidate their relationships with fewer vendors, and we really can't control that.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","And just as a follow-up, obviously, you know that we have our three biggest SIs now locked up for the next four-and-a-half years plus. So we wouldn't anticipate any of the big SIs coming in.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. I'd like to dig a little into the Enterprise Solutions operating margins in the quarter. Coming in at 18% is higher than we've seen in some time. Can you talk a little about what drove that? And then, just as a reminder how the products within Enterprise Solutions vary from a profitability standpoint?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Sure. I'll give a little bit of color and then I'll have Kieran weigh in on some of the financial metrics. Well, the first thing is that I was super pleased about is of the growth portion of the Enterprise segment, of the 8%, 4% of that was from our staff solutions. And these are solutions that didn't exist 18 months to 24 months ago. So I'm very happy to see tangible metrics that our innovation engine is working.","With respect to the higher margin, a lot of that has to do with just timing. If you take a look at the cyclical nature of our business and when acquisitions have hit, we're on the year anniversary of Rally, and with the Xceedium acquisition being relatively small and the amount of capital we had to put into to make Xceedium ready for large-scale customer usage, we've had some savings. This will be a blip in Enterprise margins. Eventually, we'll get up to the high end and be repeatable there, but I don't think 18% is going to be consistent for the next little while.","Kieran?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Yeah. So, Mike, I agree. If we go back and take a look at last year when we were at 36% margins for the company as a whole and where ES was extremely low, that's obviously the quarter when we brought in both the Rally and the Xceedium acquisitions. So there was a significant amount of one-time costs associated with that.","And for the company as a whole, if you look at those one-time costs that we didn't incur this year, basically I think of it as an offset with the GSA impact. So the real impact in the margin improvement for the company as a whole as well as for ES was a lot of the upfront revenue that we talked about.","So you heard me describe that we had a very weak compare in terms of our upfront revenues, and that's all in the ES segment a year ago. The growth that we had in upfront revenue in Q2 was worth about three out of four points of margin expansion on a year-on-year basis.","And as Mike said, longer-term plans, we'd expect to get there. And just keep in mind, Q3, we always have the seasonality of CA World, which incurs some big costs. And then obviously, in Q4, when we're finalizing commissions and payouts, it's usually our seasonally lowest quarter of the year.","Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thanks for the thorough answer, guys, and for taking my question.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Thanks very much. I had just a question about the Mainframe business. Is it sort of mid-single-digits decline that you guys are seeing? I guess, Mike, when you go and talk to people, is there any concern that that decline could accelerate as people start thinking more and more about public cloud? And I think the Mainframe's been somewhat of a stalwart and it doesn't get brought up that much, and I'm not sure if that's just because we don't talk about it enough in general. But I'm just trying to get a sense on whether or not you feel like that's a pretty good glide plane from here.","And then, secondly around Mainframe, obviously very high margin business. Do you feel like there's enough margin expansion in the ES business to offset the sort of margin contribution, I guess, mix shifts there just to maintain sort of margins where we see them, I guess, just generally when we look out a year or two years from now? Thanks.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Sure. First, on the Mainframe deceleration, we don't see high-single-digit Mainframe deceleration. We've consistently seen low-single-digit Mainframe deceleration. So I wouldn't characterize it in the higher end of single-digit deceleration.","And when we're talking to customers, customers that have made an investment in the mainframe continue to invest in the mainframe for a variety of reasons. I think the biggest reason is that's where the applications are. And to re-port those applications on to a different platform to do the exact same thing, the amount of calories to do that and the amount of risk, especially if you're in a regulated environment, there just hasn't been a whole lot of appetite to do that. They'd rather spend their net new development dollars building net new products and services that get to devices that customers want.","Secondly, there's been a great set of technologies. One of them that we're one of the primary suppliers of is API management. So, a lot of mainframe customers want to serve up that mainframe data that's very protected, very secure, and put it onto a tablet, put it onto a smartphone. And the way that they're doing that is using API technology.","So they get to keep the high volume transaction processing engine that is currently working, keep the applications, the data structures in place, and then be able to serve their customers in a way that customers want to be served. So I think that's the stability argument for the Mainframe, and we haven't seen anything really change with respect to that.","With respect to margins, as you know, we break out our business in three segments, Mainframe, ES and Services, with Mainframe always being in the low-60%s and Services fluctuating in the mid-teens. As we continue to get better and have better efficiencies in our Enterprise business and the higher volume of revenue, we are able to get a blended margin in the high-30%s and we feel pretty confident about that for the foreseeable future.","Kieran, maybe you have a couple of comments with respect to the margin?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Right. So, just a couple of points. So for starts, just from a Services perspective, mid-single digits is where we expect the margins to be over the longer haul. We think that there's a lot of opportunity, as Mike pointed out, as you start to scale the revenue, especially on the SaaS side, and you start to achieve some scale. We really think we can improve this low-teens that we've been operating at in the ES, certainly to get to the high teens over the tactical and mid-term time horizon.","From a Mainframe perspective, we think as long as the growth continues to decline in the low-single digits, as Mike pointed out, we can manage both the cost profile of that business as well as improving the cost profile of the ES business to maintain ourselves in that high-30%s that we've been staying at for the last couple of years.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Hey, Kirk, just to finish up your question. When you go take a look at the transcript, I'd specifically put a lot of commentary in with respect to the Mainframe because the other thing that's helping in the Mainframe is we've been able to blend innovation from the ES segment onto the Mainframe, and that makes the customers more attracted to the platform because they're constantly seeing innovation.","And to the extent that they can work with their mainframe solution, their on-premise enterprise solution and the cloud solution, we have products that scale across all three, it just makes less of an argument to move off of a platform that's already working and spend your precious R&D resources on net new innovation that's going to drive your customer segment further along.","Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI","All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Guys, I'm just trying to reconcile. I know your model has a lot of moving parts here, but bear with me for a second. Because excluding that large deal last year, I'm just trying to figure out how new business could be down greater than renewals, especially if new business attached to renewals was good and new business standalone was good. I guess, was it good but just last year it was even better and that's why new business growth \u2013 or new business declines were greater than renewal declines this quarter?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","So, John, let me take a shot at that. So, from a renewal perspective, total renewals were down in the mid-50%s. If you adjust for the big SI that we had in Q2 of last year, we were down in the high-single digits.","When we go and think about the Mainframe business, I mean really the Mainframe business without that big adjustment, adjusted for the big SI, was down in the mid-20%s. And quite frankly, that's capacity. We're seven quarters now into the latest Mainframe cycle. It's not unusual for that to start to drift off a little bit over time. And it is so highly dependent on our renewal cycle.","So this Q2 was just a very, very seasonally low renewal cycle for us, just based upon the number of large deals that we're going to close, and normally that's where we would expect this to drive incremental Mainframe capacity.","If we take a look at the ES business, we think the ES business, which quite frankly we were very pleased with a lot of freestanding sales that we saw across the spectrum as well as the attach rates on the small amount of renewals that we did do. And we think, overall, the ES business was sort of down at that mid-single-digit, high-single-digit number, consistent with what the renewals would have been if you adjusted for the big acquisition from last year.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So it's all the Mainframe. And I guess that's just something we have to live with. I mean, it is what it is.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Yeah. Especially from a capacity perspective.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And, Kieran, you made a statement, you said you expect modest revenue growth \"in the medium-term.\" And I just want to \u2013 can you give us a little bit of more color on what you exactly mean by the medium-term?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Well, I think we've always been pretty consistent in defining medium-term as our three-year strategic plan cycle. We have not changed \u2013 anything we've seen, we have not changed our view of that at this point in time.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Very good. Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. I think, Kieran, I have a similar question on the \u2013 just maybe trying to understand what's going on with the upfront business. I mean I guess my interpretation of what you had last year was a lot of the Rally business and some of the new product success was showing up in SFO. And it sounds like now, are you actually looking for that business to decline year-over-year or flatten out? And I guess, why wouldn't we see better growth there if that's where some of the new product business is going?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Well, Walter, I hate to revisit the subject that you and I were just on when we had our panel discussion along a whole world of accounting and VSOE and all the rest of that stuff. But, sadly, we have to get into a little bit of that. What you normally find is, a year ago, it was a very large renewal cycle quarter. And in that renewal cycle quarter, when you have a lot of renewals and you're selling the new product, that product is going to be taken ratable, right, from the VSOE that we have, that's forced to take ratable.","But we were at really extremely low levels, as we said, in the first two quarters of last year and that really rebounded very nicely up to actually quite high levels of upfront recognition in the third quarter of last year where we actually had a deal related to our Xceedium business that we sold into a government agency, the largest deal that they had ever done. And that was all taken on an upfront basis.","So what we see in this quarter, very low renewals. Again, nothing unusual about it except that we just didn't have a lot of big deals expiring at this particular point in time. And any of the free-standing sales that we sold outside of that renewal cycle, for those qualifying products, we were able to take the revenue upfront. So I hate to get corpy (39:33) with the VSOE and accounting world of it, but it was a little bit of that complicated with the mix of just when our renewal cycle was naturally ebbing and flowing.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I guess relative to the Services business, that business has been kind of anywhere from flat to down 10%. And I understand strategically what you're doing with pushing more of that to having the partners pick up more of that to give them some business in your ecosystem. But can you talk about, do you expect that actually to steepen in terms of the declines you've seen? Do you expect it to flatten out over time? Any direction there would be helpful.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Yeah. I think, in the near term, we're anticipating declines pretty consistent with what we saw this quarter. So think about it mid- to high-single digits, and probably for the near- to mid-term until we reach a certain level.","We've gotten ourselves out of some businesses that we didn't think as necessarily strategic. We really want our Services business to be there really to help with adoption of our software. In all honesty, long-term we expect that we will have a level of service that's required, one to drive transformation in our customers like we would do at a Rally or something like that, as well as to help continue with adoption.","So we don't think the business is going to totally evaporate, but I do think in the near- and the mid-term, we'll probably see rates that decline pretty consistent to what we saw this quarter.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Parthiv Varadarajan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yes. Thanks very much. This is Parthiv in for Abhey. The 32% growth on the software fees line, can you give us a sense of what the drivers behind that were, and how sustainable that is over the next few quarters?","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Well, I guess from a categorization perspective, the first thing I need to point out is that in that SFO line, we have a combination of the upfront revenue that we take, which as we said was significantly stronger in Q2 this year than it was last year. It's also the line item where we've been putting our SaaS business. And as Mike mentioned earlier that we get about half of our overall ES revenue contribution from our SaaS businesses. So it's really a composite of both.","Parthiv Varadarajan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up, when you look at your portfolio today and with your growth goals in mind for fiscal 2018, do you think you have all the pieces in place to sort of achieve that growth? Or are there any product areas that you don't have exposure to but are currently evaluating?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Well, we always have an opportunity to trim the portfolio in areas that are not growing, and we also have opportunities to build new organic product. And we also try to look for opportunities to use our balance sheet and buy adjacencies that we think will help us grow in the future. So, to answer your question, I think we're in a very good position to achieve the kind of growth we gave through in guidance, but we're always going to be taking a look for new technologies on the buy versus build analysis.","If you take a look at just this last quarter, we bought a relatively small company called BlazeMeter, which is very strategic for us. We've had a lot of growth in our testing market. This is an additive to the testing market, which gives customers another opportunity to protect their code as it goes into production. And this is a foray into another SaaS product and it's also using a significant amount of open source technology.","So it hits all of the things that we think are important and what customers want to buy. And to the extent that we see opportunities like that, what it does is it gives us an opportunity to accelerate growth and it also de-risks our plan going forward.","Parthiv Varadarajan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike, I just want to follow-up on some of the comments you had in your prepared remarks around the innovation on the Mainframe, specifically you mentioned DCD. I'm curious, are you using DCD in some of the other innovations on the Mainframe as a retention tool on renewals? Or are you selling those products to customers discretely? And if discretely, is it meaningful? And what would the decline in the mainframe look like without it?","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Yeah. It's a single product and I think, in my prepared remarks, I had three or four different products that we profiled. This is one that's done both ways, Michael. For example, I know of an insurance company that bought that particular product outside of their renewal cycle because they thought it had value and they wanted to be able to use that to scan their data logs to make sure they're following the regulatory procedures that that particular industry has.","Whenever we're pitching a renewal, our sales force is trained to use that as an opportunity to keep the renewal yield high. So we're constantly shooting for something higher than a 90% in our renewal cycle. And what it does is it takes some of the pressure of that renewal yield away.","The over-arching thesis of what we're trying to do there is to help that secular deceleration of the Mainframe, dampen it down by offering customers both net new solutions, and also psychologically show them that we're still investing in the Mainframe. We're one of only two companies that are still making significant investments in R&D on the Mainframe. And to the extent that we're able to package that up and show the value, I think it protects the franchise.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great. That's all I have. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Two questions. One, I don't know if you addressed it. Obviously, the next 12 months revenue backlog, again, I realize that we're far away from returning \u2013 or at least you're not at the point where it turns positive, but it did tick down. So what was the issue there? And then also can you square up the growth year-over-year in freestanding sales given the fact that ES was down with the renewal portfolio ex the SI deal? Because I guess my understanding is that the big push has been to work on what you're doing in terms of selling outside of the renewal portfolio.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","Okay. So let me take the last one first and then we'll get back to the backlog. So, as I think I said before, the opportunity when you're not selling with the renewal per se, this is the opportunity to take that revenue upfront. So what ends up happening is you have a much higher yield than that what you sell from a new perspective that you'll actually recognize upfront. And that does, in fact, play a part with why the revenue backlog comes down a little bit as well, because the license portion of that revenue you're taking in the current time period.","Additionally to that, similar to the lift that we were getting inorganically over the past several quarters as we added revenue from our acquisitions last year, there was a modest current backlog help there as well. And now that that's we've wrapped around and we've flat lined on that, I think what you're seeing is probably \u2013 I would say it's actually relatively flat quarter-on-quarter when you take those things into consideration.","Now, from a freestanding sales perspective, clearly long-term that is absolutely the objective. The objective is over the long haul to ensure that our business is always going to look for opportunities to sell and not have to wait until an annual or a tri-annual contract expires. I think our teams are getting better at that. We've seen actually some good performance over the last year and several quarters happening in our Named and Growth accounts, but surprisingly it happens actually quite frequently in our platinum accounts as well.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","The other thing I'd add to that, Michael, is we're seeing a change in how customers buy. Up until even two or three years ago, enterprise software companies were constantly selling in and around renewals for these large ELAs because that's how the customers have been trained for 20 years to buy from us.","In breaking that mold has taken some time. So, even though we have the best intentions and we'd prefer to be able to sell solutions when customers need them, there's a lot of procurement teams that hang on, waiting six months, nine months before they buy, thinking that they're going to get a better deal if they package it up into an ELA.","I'm seeing some of the frost break on that particular model, but when I take a look at the mainstream, large, Fortune 200 companies, there's still a lot of decisions made by procurement teams that I think is shifting the line of business buyers. When we're selling to a line of business buyer, they don't care about ELAs. They have a problem. They want that solution solved and they're buying it with a capital budget \u2013 with an operational budget rather than a capital budget. And a lot of times, they're buying it outside the context of a general CIO procurement team.","Still some work to be done in our industry with that, but I don't think that's a unique CA phenomenon.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Kieran.","Kieran J. McGrath - CA, Inc.","All right.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Mike Gregoire for closing comments.","Michael P. Gregoire - CA, Inc.","Well, thank you very much for everyone joining. I know it's a big evening with a lot of companies reporting tonight, but I'd like to leave you with a few closing thoughts.","First of all, we are very pleased with our second quarter revenue, operating margin and earnings performance, and remain on track to achieve modest revenue growth this fiscal year. We're making progress across a number of our key imperatives, including product, sales and customer experience. And I look forward to seeing many of you at CA World next month when we host a track for financial analysts on November 16. Thank you very much for your time and goodnight.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's event. This concludes our program.

Welcome to the CA Technologies First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Now I'll turn the conference over to Kelsey Doherty of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies' First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bill McCracken, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. These prepared comments were previously recorded. This conference call is being broadcast on Thursday, July 26, 2012, over the phone and the Internet. The information shared in this call is effective as of today's date and will not be updated. All content is the property of CA Technologies and is protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be reproduced or transcribed in any way without the express written consent of CA Technologies. We consider your continued participation in this call as consent to our recording.","During this call, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please also note that our second quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on September 14, 2012.","Before I turn the call over, I'd like to highlight that for modeling purposes, our year-over-year currency headwind on revenue guidance is expected to be roughly 2.5 points for the full year. It is forecasted to peak at 4 points in our September quarter.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William E. McCracken","Thanks, Kelsey. And good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us.","I'd like to start this afternoon by reviewing our first fiscal quarter and the drivers behind our updated guidance. I will discuss the challenges we faced, the progress we made and our execution-related initiatives. I'll then turn the call over to Rich for more detailed review of the financials and guidance before we open the call for questions.","By now, I hope you've had a chance to read our press release. We are adjusting revenue guidance from 2% to 4% constant currency growth to 1% to 2%. This reflects both the slow start we had to the year and the macroeconomic environment. We increased our expectation for non-GAAP operating margin for the year to 36%. The 36% margin reflects the benefit from an IP transaction closed during the quarter, which provided an incremental $35 million operating income, as well as driving more profitability from the organic business. In addition, we updated our original outlook on non-GAAP earnings per share growth from 9% to 12% to 10% to 12% in constant currency. And we reaffirmed our outlook on cash flow growth of 4% to 6% in constant currency.","Despite the headwinds to top line growth we experienced during the quarter, we are committed to delivering the earnings per share and cash flow growth we provided at the beginning of the year.","Now let me provide some comments on the market and our performance in the first quarter. Our revenue grew 1% in constant currency. Some growth, but short of our expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, including 3 points of contribution from our IP transaction. Our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations were up 16% and 10%, respectively in constant currency, both also improved by the IP transaction. We had new product sales decline in North America and EMEA, growth in APJ and continued strong momentum in Latin America. Growth economies continue to reward our investments.","Clearly, I'm not satisfied with the top line performance in the first quarter. Because of CA Technologies' highly ratable model, it is important for us to get a strong start and we didn't. We knew heading into the year that the renewal portfolio would be down. In fact, we shared this with you at Analyst Day last July and again in the Q4 fiscal 2012 earnings call.","We also highlighted that first quarter was a trough for the portfolio for the year, with the portfolio coming in approximately 40% lower year-over-year. To give you a sense of this portfolio dynamic, the number of large renewals worth more than $10 million that closed during the quarter was 1\/2 that of last year, 4 compared to 8. As a result, the value of large contracts signed during the quarter decreased by approximately $200 million.","Renewal of the ELA continues to be a good opportunity for us to sell new products and new capacity. It builds energy and momentum in an account, both for us and the customer. When we have a lighter renewal inventory, we have less opportunity to sell new products. This is also the case for new mainframe capacity, which is tightly correlated to the renewal portfolio. As our portfolio builds in the second half of this year, this will help drive opportunities for new product sales and capacity. While that explains the dynamics behind new product sales and mainframe capacity related to the ELA, it is only part of the story. The other piece relates to the sales of new products outside the renewal. We did not deliver at the level we expected.","We knew we had challenges selling outside the renewal and our customer segmentation initiative is designed to address that.  We created 3 distinct customer segments with unique approaches to reach each of our target customer segments: large, existing enterprise customers; large, new enterprise customers; and growth market customers. The addition of large, new enterprise and growth market customer segments more than doubles our total addressable market. Although we were below plan for the quarter, we did not anticipate significant traction in these new customer segments in the first half of the year. In fact, we continue to believe that the actions we took will be drivers in the back half of this year and beyond.","What we did not adequately plan for in the first quarter was the level of disruption our new customer segmentation efforts would cause in the sales force and the impact it would have on our productivity in large, existing accounts. Any time you move people into new territories, create new coverage models and train extensively, it takes time away from the customers. When combined with the lighter renewal portfolio, we slowed our start to the year. The result, new capacity and new product sales were down approximately 30% year-over-year.","So with the first quarter behind us and much of the move to customer segmentation largely complete, we are now back in the territories with a renewed focus and a clear set of objectives, further penetrating existing accounts and acquiring new customers. To realize our objectives, we have increased accountability throughout the organization and made a number of important changes.","We've moved all disciplines associated with our growth markets business under one general manager worldwide. This allows regional executives to focus exclusively on execution in our large, existing and large, new enterprise accounts. We've consolidated all business operations into the finance team, scrubbed the sales pipeline for each region and customer segment and increased executive oversight in key transactions. As a result, we are confident in this afternoon's updated guidance.","From a new product perspective, we are entering a strong product cycle, leveraging the investments we have made in organic development and intellectual property from our acquisitions. While we have introduced many products enhancements over the last decade and a half, these new solutions raise the bar of innovation and customer productivity.","In June, we announced new releases of award-winning CA Mainframe Chorus, together with CA Database Management solutions that provide the fastest path to value for DB2 upgrades.","Next month, we will introduce performance analytics capabilities to our service assurance portfolio. The new solution will focus on the infrastructure, which we will extend to applications. We now have the ability to rapidly analyze the massive quantities of performance data we collect and provide customers insight into improving their quality of service and customer experience. Service providers in particular, will be able to leverage this capability to simplify and accelerate 4G network rollouts.","Customer demand for new solutions that can be deployed in both on-premise and SaaS models continues to grow. Providing a choice of delivery model allows customers to migrate at their pace while preserving their current investment, which we believe is a competitive advantage. We continue to build our service management portfolio with these capabilities, including a mobile, self-service social interface, advanced dashboard and reporting analytics and world-class software asset management that we believe customers will find compelling.","We will continue to introduce new products and solutions throughout the back half of the year. These present ongoing up-sell opportunities to our current customer base and differentiating technology to retain and attract new customers. Given the timing of these introductions and the associated sales cycles, we expect traction later in fiscal 2013.","Before I turn the call over to Rich, I would like to address CEO succession. We are working on succession planning. My role, along with the Board of Directors, is to ensure the execution of an effective and smooth transition that will drive the company's future success. Our focus on the business will not waver during this transition, whenever it occurs.","I also want to reaffirm that the Board of Directors and executive management team are committed to the $2.5 billion capital allocation plan we announced in January, including the $1 per share annual dividend and share repurchase program we have put in place.","We remain on track to return an average 80% of our cumulative free cash flow through fiscal 2014, which we believe allows us the optimal mix of making investments in the business while returning cash directly to shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter.","Richard J. Beckert","Thank you, Bill. Please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated.","Total revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, up 1% in constant currency and down 2% as reported. This includes a $32 million headwind from foreign exchange.","From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solutions revenue was $628 million, flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. As a reminder for your models, we have a challenging mainframe revenue compare in the third quarter due to a $39 million single license payment that occurred last year.","Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $426 million, up 2% in constant currency and flat as reported.","Services revenue was $91 million, up 4% in constant currency and 1% as reported.","Underlying these results, Mainframe Solutions new product sales for the quarter were down more than 30%, while new capacity sales were down more than 60%. New mainframe product and capacity sales are highly correlated to the timing of underlying renewals and will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate that mainframe new product sales and capacity will accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by a more robust portfolio of renewals.","Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down just over 20% this quarter.","Finally, new Services engagements, which are highly dependent on new product sales, were down more than 15% year-over-year.","Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 80% range. This is due to a single transaction, where the effect was amplified by the lower amount of renewals in the quarter. Excluding this transaction, our renewal yield was approximately 90%. We continue to expect full year renewal portfolio to be down single-digit year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2012, and it will be back-half loaded.","Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 1% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.8 billion, down 5% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Backlog was affected by sales performance in the quarter, as well as the higher percentage of sales recognized as software fees and other. We will continue to see headwinds in backlog metrics as contracts burn off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increase in our 2014 renewal portfolio.","As Bill mentioned, first quarter results include $35 million, or approximately $0.05 in GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, from the assignment of certain intellectual property assets to a large technology company. This benefit was recorded as other income and was incremental to full year guidance provided in May.","From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $439 million, up 8% in constant currency and 5% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, 35% excluding the IP transaction.","Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 59%. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 16%. The IP transaction contributed 8 points to Enterprise Solutions margin.","Finally, operating margin for Services was 4%.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, up 16% in constant currency and 15% as reported. This includes a year-over-year $0.01 headwind from currency. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.","Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $183 million, up 10% in constant currency and 28% as reported. The difference in as-reported and constant currency growth is due to the positive FX impact of the U.S. dollar cash investment by our European subsidiaries. These investments protect the company against European event risk. Next quarter, the maturing FX hedge of these assets will be a headwind to as-reported cash flow growth.","From a year-over-year perspective, cash flow growth was driven by lower tax payments in the quarter and the IP transaction. In addition, single installment payments were $123 million in the first quarter compared to $64 million in the previous period. This increase was driven by Q4 billings which were paid in Q1.","Total billings backlog of $4.58 billion was down 8% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Billings backlog was affected by the first quarter decrease in sales.","We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash.","During the quarter, we successfully completed our accelerated share repurchase program with the receipt of 3.7 million shares. This was in addition to the 15 million shares received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Subsequent to the completion of the ASR, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares for approximately $96 million in Q1. We are authorized to repurchase an additional 900 million of common stock through fiscal 2014.","Moving to first quarter GAAP results. First quarter GAAP operating margin was 33%, GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $381 million, up 10% in constant currency and 11% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, up 11% in constant currency and 13% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was 35% compared to 32% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.","Now, let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based upon exchange rates of the last day of the preceding quarter, or for this quarter, June 30, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.","Updated guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is now expected to be 1% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.74 billion to $4.80 billion.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 10% to 12%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50.","GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.12.","We continue to expect that cash flow from operations will grow 4% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.54 billion to $1.57 billion.","Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions.","Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of this year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 452 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 459 million shares. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William E. McCracken","Thanks, Rich. Before we close, I'd like to leave you with a few thoughts. First, we continue to drive shareholder value through a disciplined return of capital.","Second, this quarter, we invested the time and energy necessary to enable our go-to-market customer segmentation model. Now moving through to reliable execution is the next step.","Third, we are on track to deliver a series of market-leading products and solutions this quarter and in the back half of the year that leverage our organic development capabilities and acquired technology.","Fourth, we are a corporation that has the ability to increase operational efficiency and drop more profitability to the bottom line, even in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have taken the steps necessary to position ourselves to deliver the earnings per share and cash flow growth we forecasted at the beginning of the year.","And with that, Kelsey, let me turn it back to you.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you, Bill. As the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to inform you that CA Technologies is presenting at the 15th Annual Oppenheimer Technology, Internet and Communications Conference in Boston on Tuesday, August 14; and the 2012 Citigroup Global Technology Conference in New York City on Wednesday, September 5.","In the interest of time, please limit yourselves to 2 questions.","Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Phil Winslow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. So could you give us a sense of the dynamics in the Mainframe business in terms of pricing and volume? And also, could you give us your expectation for the timing and potential impact from the next platform release from IBM?","Richard J. Beckert","This is Rich. As far as what we're seeing in the mainframe market, it's pretty much steady as she goes. So as you know, our business is really tied to our renewals, and we have a high correlation with the mainframe as the renewals come in. We're seeing continued demand for the MIPS in the marketplace. The MIPS are growing at the standard rate, at the price points that we're seeing. I mean, it's always been a competitive market, but that market seems to be holding up just fine. Our product introductions that we've had just recently and a couple we have this fall give us great confidence because we're seeing our ability to outpace some of our competition who's not at the same level of investment. So we just continue to say it will be a strong tailwind for us as we progress through the end of this year and into the out years. On your second question, as you know we work very closely with IBM and their technology. Their ability now to go across platforms, both mainframe and distributed, moves right into our sweet spot. So we think that's a great move, and we work with them daily in order for us to both be successful to expand the mainframe marketplace.","Operator","And the next question is from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Rich, can we talk about the reasons for the shortfall in the quarter? Were they all related to sales changes and external execution challenges? Or was there any impact from macro as well? Any commentary on macro would be helpful. Then I've got a follow-up.","Richard J. Beckert","So the renewals themselves were exactly where we thought they'd be. If you recall, our renewals go out over the next 5 years, and we have those mapped out by quarter. So the renewals piece of this was not the issue in the shortfall. On the yield piece of that, we had one transaction that we accepted that was below our normal yield that we accept, and that drove it down to the low 80s as opposed to if we back that out, it was mid-90s -- low 90s, excuse me. so there's really not a change in the yield. There's not really a change in the renewals. As far as the macro environment, we are, just like everyone else, seeing an impact in Southern Europe and some other places around the world. Some economies are slowing, but our basic business is somewhat insulated from the macro environment but it does elongate our sales cycles and maybe keeps our pipeline a little bit longer.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","The deal that you just mentioned, which lowered your renewal yield, can you talk a little bit about that? Is this -- it renewed, but there are lower yield? Or did the deal not renew? Or are you still working on it? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Richard J. Beckert","The deal itself did renew. It just had some products that actually fell out of the actual renewal.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got it. And Bill or Rich, either of you, now over the last couple of few weeks, there have been some interesting announcements by VMWare, especially they've indicated their intention of building some management tools for heterogeneous environments or go beyond the computer stack to networking or storage. Now how do you view those developments? How do you think they'll impact your competitive position? What type of opportunity upset can you think it creates for you?","William E. McCracken","Okay. Yes, Abhey. A good question. VMware is, as you mentioned, expanding into the management area. We don't meet them too much in the marketplace, though, when we are in our account environment. The thing that we see is we have been now, for many decades, in the management area. And it gives us a significant advantage with respect to the capability we have, especially from an enterprise point of view. The key point, though, is our positioning is to work across all platforms. That helps us integrate VMware with all the other platforms that are in the environment. So it really deals with our strength with respect to the way we deal with VMware. They're a piece of the growing market along with the rest of the pieces, and it deals with our strength.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James.","James Wesman","This is James Wesman sitting in for Michael. So if I look at the current backlog, for the first time in recent memory, I think it's been down year-over-year in constant currency. Can you talk about what happened there?","Richard J. Beckert","So this is Rich. So the current backlog, as I said earlier, the renewals piece is what we thought it would be. What we didn't do to the level that we had anticipated was selling outside of the renewal backlog. So therefore, our overall sales were off from what we had anticipated. What we also have is the headwind of our entire business. As it builds out over FY '14 and we get closer and closer to the renewals in FY '14, the backlog shrinks until they're renewed and then the backlog is refilled. So what you're starting to see is 2 things. One, we had a weak Q1, and you see the impending increase of renewals in FY '14.","Operator","Our next question is from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My first question is for Rich. Rich, if renewals for the year are going to be down single digits and they're back-end loaded but this quarter, the renewals were down 34% constant currency, 36% reported, should the -- could the --  or do you plan for the renewal portfolio to actually grow right on the second half?","Richard J. Beckert","The renewal portfolio, depending on the  quarter in the second half, will absolutely grow. What you'll see is it's very much back-end loaded. So to the degree between Q3 and Q4, that can move around. Where they're today, planned, John, you'd have a very large Q4, so it could move slightly. But absolutely, and then that moves right into FY '14.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Bill, a question for you. New product sales declined it looks like in every region except maybe Latin America, which is the smallest region. And this is the quarter that you reorganized your sales force and focused more on new product sales. But it sounds like you underestimated the disruption that the reorg would cause. And I just want to -- and it sounds like you made some comps, some changes, but why should we be confident that it's going to get better this quarter, that sort of disruption?","William E. McCracken","Okay. You mentioned one of the primary reasons. In both Latin America and Asia Pacific, the new product sales were up in both those regions. The investments we've made in those regions, in fact, has paid off for us, and that's where we see our growth. But the most important point behind that, John, is that we have been in that model now for the last year in both Asia Pacific, a partner model, and Latin America, and we saw the results that stayed even and grew in both those geographies. The biggest challenge we had was to move that model into both North America and EMEA. And the thing we did underestimate, which is what you said, we knew we were going to have to move to territories, we moved people into new enterprises, as well as into the growth area, but the magnitude of the impact that it had with respect to the account changes and the territory changes did, in fact, have more impact for us than we thought, and we ended up in the territory only part of the quarter. We're back in the territory now, and so we have great confidence that's going to bring us to where we said we would, John.","Richard J. Beckert","John, if I could just add to that. If you look at how the portfolio is evolving, the large, new growth will be in place now for a few quarters, and you'll start to see the pipeline -- we are seeing the pipeline build, especially Q3. As it progresses through, they'll actually come to fruition in Q3, Q4. On the renewals, we talked about earlier, which you know we have impending events, which then allows us to put out -- we have new products being announced in August and then again, in October and then again, in November. And it will allows us to cycle through our portfolio at that time. So we're positioned better both from our product and our portfolio. And we'll have people out in the territory now, it ought to be 6 months by then.","Operator","Our next question is from Aaron Schwartz of Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on the deal duration. It shortened a little bit here in the quarter, presumably tied to the renewal portfolio dynamics and also, I guess, self-disruption. But could you talk about sort of the macro situation with the deal duration, whether you expect that to bounce back if the renewal portfolio grows through the year? And if it is more macro related and sort of stays at the shorter end here, how would that tie into cash flow for the year?","Richard J. Beckert","A good question, Aaron. No, there's no change to the buying pattern. What you're seeing is when we have a low renewal portfolio, you have more as a percentage of what's being done in the quarter: standalone transactions, they tend to be a little shorter than 3 years; renewals tend to be a little bit longer. The most important part, if you recall, the top deals that were $10 million or more, there were only 4 this quarter, totaling a little over $60 million, whereas if you look at that same period a year earlier, it was $260 million. So that would elongate back to the normal 3, 3.5. So we're not concerned about this. This actually, we saw this not to this degree. If you look a couple of quarters back, I think it's about 1.5 years ago, you'll also see that when we had a low renewal portfolio and it was predominantly products being sold outside the renewal cycle, it will shorten. And we expect that to bounce back. So we're not concerned about the cash piece of this.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I just had a follow-up question on Europe. You've obviously made a lot of changes there internally year-over-year in the past year but you're also facing a lot of external influences that are out of your control. So how do you sort of measure the improvement in Europe against the -- in the face of a lot of things that are out of your control right now?","William E. McCracken","Well, I guess that the first thing I would say is the changes we have made and the leadership that we put in place in Marco and then the additional leadership that he's put in place in the regions and in the countries, we're pleased that they are executing and paying attention to the details to sell outside the ELA, which is one of the things we talked about a year ago, as well as to build the pipe on the 3 segments that we talked about. Having said that, we see them executing against it, but you do have that downward pressure of the macroeconomics. So what we're looking at is what is the renewal, what is selling outside the renewal cycle and the metrics that indicate their execution against the plan that they put in place. So we're pleased with what they've done. But as you well know, the macroeconomic environment in Europe puts a downward pressure on everything you do.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","2 questions. The first one is you made the comment that you moved to all disciplines associated with growth under one manager. Is that from a development point of view, a sales point of view? What exactly is involved in that?","William E. McCracken","Yes, all of the resource that sells in the marketplace for the growth is now reporting to the executive that we had in Latin America in the last 2 years, and he now leads that worldwide.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And the second one is at the conference, you talked about moving of applications to your own Platform as a Service you were building up. We haven't heard much more about that. Is that still underway within that product portfolio?","William E. McCracken","Yes, it sure is. And that's one of the key advantages we think we have in the marketplace because if we look at our SaaS, it performed about 30% better in the quarter this time. We have departmental capability that we put in the SaaS kind of environment. We have had, as you know in the enterprise environment the capabilities, whether it be service assurance or whether it be service desk kinds of things. And what we've done now, and as part of the SaaS-first strategy that we announced a couple of months or a couple of quarters ago is that we have the ability to bridge between those 2. So we actually, I think, have put ourselves in an advantaged position. We're growing on the SaaS side, the way that part of the market is. We're able to bridge it into the enterprise side as well at the same time.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rich, I'm just wondering on the cash flow, these items. You had the cash tax, it's lower. You had the higher upfronts, and then you had the IP. Was that all anticipated in your guidance that you gave at the beginning of the year?","Richard J. Beckert","The only thing, the IP was not in there. The rest of it was anticipated.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then just on the upfront, I guess your renewal portfolio was down. I'm surprised to see that the upfronts were up. Was that just sort of contract dynamics on an individual basis or is there any trend there that you're driving in the business?","Richard J. Beckert","There's actually 2 pieces to that. So the first piece is that it's really -- the upfront, it also recognized a onetime transaction from Q4 that is in Q1. So if we pay -- or if we bill and they pay the entire amount, that shows up in Q1. That was 1\/2 of that upfront. If you look at the Q1 upfronts, they're actually down year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question is from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer.","Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","2 quick questions on my end. Bill, can you kind of slightly touch and maybe provide us with more color specifically about the U.S.? I totally get what's happening in Europe but maybe kind of what's happening in U.S. domestically. And then the follow-up is, more specifically on your Identity and Access Management product, how did that perform during the quarter?","William E. McCracken","Okay, Shaul. On the U.S., when you think about it, the main part of our business, which was the existing enterprises we had, was primarily in the U.S. So a lot of the change we talk about with respect to the account assignments and the movement of that resource really happened in North America. And so it has more impact there than it did actually in the other geographies, as I referenced before with respect to Asia Pacific and Latin America, where we had that model before. So therefore, it did have more impact. We don't see anything beyond that. The economy is a drag, as we know. But we didn't see indicators coming out of here that have had a significant impact. Most of it was the things that we changed. And on the security side, we had a strong quarter in security, a significant growth. But I caution you on that. It's on security. It's a long sales cycle and one quarter you're up and you have a good result, which we did this quarter. Another quarter, it may not be up as much. Overall, though, security is working very well. And then security, just to give you an idea, was up double-digit over the 20% range in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Williams of Evercore Partners.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just popping in for Kirk. Just 1 or 2 questions. In terms of the sales disruption in the quarter, was there any real pipeline build in the quarter or does that process kind of start this quarter with the payback 6 to 9 months from now? And then along those lines, I guess, sort of when did you start to notice that the reorg was a little more disruptive than maybe you would have expected?","William E. McCracken","Yes. Good question because as we got back into the territory, then the pipeline did begin to grow because we're focusing attention on that. And there's clear focus, and an organization as to how we go about it with respect to how we review it. And I think, as we said -- Rich did in his prepared remarks, we're actually tracking that by region around the world. So yes, as we go back in the territory, that begins to grow. Do you want to comment beyond that, Rich?","Richard J. Beckert","Yes. So one of the things that we definitely saw is there was a slow build. There were in the territory but as they're now out looking at it and talking to their customer set, the pipeline now we're starting to see fill in. The other piece of that, though, is that as they are now working their way through the pipeline progression, we expect that to pay off in the second half of the year. Your question is when did we really see that come to fruition? I would tell you that it was really more towards the end of May, first week of June, because by then where we are in our pipeline progression really gives us headlights as to where we think this -- that transaction should close in the quarter.","William E. McCracken","Yes. So let me make a comment on the back of what Rich said, too. And it's something we said when we ended the year last year, and I want to emphasize it again. We are back in the territory. We are building the pipe in those new growth areas. But we see the second half of this year as when that gets traction, not second quarter.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And if you don't mind, just one quick follow-up. Could you maybe discuss how some of the newer businesses like Nimsoft or 3Tera, how they fared in the quarter since they're not as attached to the renewal cycle?","William E. McCracken","Well, actually Nimsoft was -- it's sold primarily outside the renewal cycle, and it was up in the 40% range in the quarter. So we saw growth in that. And that's some of the things that contributed to that and our code [ph] and other products such as that that's sold in the SaaS environment area, which overall, drove a 30% growth for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Hedberg of RBC.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Within the sales reorg, I'm wondering, was there any reduction enforced there and potentially offset by some hiring in the past? You've sort of trimmed but then added in higher growth areas. So I guess I'm wondering sort of when you started the quarter, how does capacity look today versus maybe quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year?","William E. McCracken","We have added, as we said coming out of the fourth quarter, we were adding 300 on our headcount in sales worldwide. We will be at headcount on that as we exit August. We're largely there in the first quarter, but we'll be continuing that as we go through the second quarter as well. Rich, do you want to comment beyond that?","Richard J. Beckert","I think -- so as we've talked back in Q3 of last year, then again Q4, we unlayered quite a few people in the sales force. So there were about 200 or so people who are unlayered and put into direct quota carrying. And then  as Bill said, we also then hired in some people. There was some attrition as normal, but I would tell you our attrition is actually down year-over-year, so we're seeing good attrition in sales and across the entire company. So attrition is not a problem, which is why we can say that we and the job in the quarter that we're in are what we need to be from a sales. As Bill said, everyone's out in the territory now selling. The second part of that question, overall though, the total sales spending will be down slightly this year compared to last year as will the G&A piece, which allows us to drive to that 36% margin. So across those, we expect to see productivity improvement in the back half of the sales team and we have overall spending down. So it's a good combination to drive the 36% margin.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up on the guidance. Embedded within your 1% to 2% constant currency growth, now at this point, can you talk about the dynamics of sort of what's embedded in your expectations for both U.S. and international growth? Is it -- I mean, are you expecting much of a diversion there from sort of what happened this quarter?","Richard J. Beckert","No, I think we're -- we will see. As Bill said earlier, I believe the Asia, Latin America will continue to grow at a reasonable rate. EMEA will continue to be the lagger across all the geos. And North America, we think, should start to build momentum over time as we break into these new large corporations and the new growth areas for us.","William E. McCracken","Okay. So let me wrap up probably with just 4 comments. We did what we needed to do, what we wanted to do, what we said we would in the first quarter. And we're positioned now to take all the steps we do as we go through the second quarter and the rest of the year to execute as we said we would for the balance of '13. We're committed to deliver in the bottom line that we forecasted at the beginning of the year. And in fact, as Rich indicated, we'll expand that margin to 36% as we move through the year. We're going to continue, as I mentioned before, we're going to continue to drive the shareholder value through our disciplined return of capital to them through this year, as we said we would through the extended period.","And finally, we're committed to the model year guidance that we first introduced to you last July. So thanks for hooking up with us","and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

Ma\u2019am, please go ahead. ","Traci Tsuchiguchi","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies' second quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer, and Kieran McGrath, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Kieran will offer some prepared remarks and then we'll open up the call for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Wednesday, October 25, over the telephone and the Internet.

All content is the property of CA Technologies and is protected by US and international copyright law and may not be reproduced or transcribed in any way without the express written consent of CA Technologies.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.

","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike. ","Mike Gregoire","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter. We are very pleased that the contribution from our SaaS business continues to grow at a rapid pace. Total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales, and Mainframe new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. This, combined with our revenue backlog, gives me confidence in our full year guidance. ","That said, it is not lost on me that we have work to do. Our sales execution in Q2 was disappointing and revenue came in below our expectations. In particular, velocity in sales outside of the renewal cycle of Enterprise Solutions products was short of our expectations. There are a few primary factors underlying this. ","First, the renewal portfolio was smaller in the second quarter than in the year ago period, as we expected. A lighter renewal portfolio creates a natural headwind to all of our bookings-related metrics. However, our expectation is that we should be able to consistently sell outside of our renewals, regardless of the timing of the renewal portfolio. ","Any failure to do so erodes opportunity to recognize up-front revenue that directly ties to our quarterly revenue results. After demonstrating success in selling outside of our renewal portfolio, we got complacent. Growth in our ES free-standing new sales requires a level of sales leadership and focus across the team that did not materialize in Q2. We expect to return to a more consistent level of performance in the second half of our fiscal year. ","Another factor that impacted our Q2 organic revenue performance was the result of a conscious decision we made to prioritize new sales of the Automic automation platform. Unifying CA\u2019s organic automation solutions into an integrated Automation platform negatively impacts our organic revenue in the near-term, particularly in the Enterprise Solutions segment. ","We believe the long-term benefit to all of our stakeholders more than offsets the organic headwinds this creates in the near-term. Over time, our customers will benefit from the clarity of a single platform with robust integrations across our product portfolio. For our customers, this decreases their development dollars, integration efforts, and simplifies their broader IT environment. ","We will continue to make decisions that are in the best interest of our customers and long-term shareholders, even at the expense of near-term optics. We remain pleased with the strategic nature of our recent acquisitions. The importance of our Veracode acquisition, which elegantly bridges our Security portfolio to our DevOps portfolio, could not have been more evident this quarter with very well publicized recent data breaches. Security continues to be top of mind among business leaders and individuals. ","Looking back at the breaches that have happened in the recent past and looking ahead to GDPR, or the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May of next year, it\u2019s clear that security continues to be critically important. ","Today, there\u2019s an extraordinary amount of code that\u2019s written. This proliferation accelerates the need to ensure that code is written securely to prevent hacks and compromises that can severely impact consumers, tarnishing the reputation of corporations and their executives. Fixing faulty code earlier in the cycle with a SaaS-based tool, before it\u2019s released, is efficient, cost-effective, and in everyone\u2019s best interest. Veracode\u2019s value proposition precisely is the sweet spot. ","When I look at our identity-centric security portfolio, I am incredibly proud of CA\u2019s partnership with customers like NASDAQ and the State of Louisiana Office of Technology Services. With the latter, we are implementing identity and access management solutions across government agencies to further digitize and better protect state and citizen information. It is working to modernize and standardize IT services across the state\u2019s 16 government agencies in order to streamline processes and enable engineers to more efficiently and more securely run services and applications across networks. ","In the second quarter, we announced the release of CA Privileged Access Management, or CAPAM 3.0. This gives companies and organizations the ability to scale their PAM deployments across multiple departments, and provides Managed Service Providers a helpful way to manage multiple instances of the product for their customer base across platforms and infrastructures. The scalability of a PAM solution is critical to ensure organizations can address and control cyber risk coming from trusted users in any environment. ","Customers need to manage access across departments, geographies, heterogeneous IT environments, and consider complex architectural requirements. CA PAM supports these needs with enhanced features that enable greater control across the spectrum of user access points. ","Last month, we announced Day One support for IBM Z14 for our key mainframe solutions. Our continued investment in the mainframe and partnership with IBM helps to ensure the mainframe remains a system of trust with its elevated level of encryption and security. In addition, our solutions, which leverage the new Z14 platform, greatly decrease the risks of data breaches that can arise from the degradation of performance associated with increased encryption needs. ","We are collectively providing unified enterprise security that helps to increase an organization\u2019s compliance structure across new and existing mainframes. This is of increased importance as organizations prepare for the implementation of new regulations that focus on data privacy, like GDPR. ","Strength in mainframe new sales, despite a smaller renewal portfolio in the quarter, was driven by our newer products, including Mainframe Operations Intelligence, Data Content Discovery, and Dynamic Capacity Intelligence. ","Across our product portfolio, we continue to earn the recognition of third party industry analysts. CA was recently named a leader in the IDC MarketScape Worldwide Agile PPM 2017 Vendor Assessment Enabling Adaptive Planning for Emerging Markets, DevOps and IoT. CA was also named a Leader in the Forrester Wave for Continuous Delivery and Release Automation, Q3, 2017. And, CA was positioned as a Leader in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. ","We are well positioned in great markets, and our solutions are solving real problems for our customers. This feeds my optimism as I look ahead. In the near-term, we believe we are on-track to achieve our fiscal year 2018 guidance. Additionally, we are working on an on-going plan to improve the efficiency of our OpEx spend across the organization. Longer-term, we are working on a plan to drive accelerated improvement in our organic revenue trajectory. Concurrently, we are putting in place improvements to drive sustainable growth and expand profitability over time. ","We are optimistic that we have a path to improve the long-term health of the company and our shareholder returns. I look forward to seeing many of you at CA World next month. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 15. There is no better place for you to see the breadth and depth of CA\u2019s portfolio of solutions and hear firsthand from our customers how they are deploying CA\u2019s solutions. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you.","Kieran McGrath","Kieran McGrath: Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I\u2019m going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. ","Q2 total new sales were up mid-single digits as reported and low-single digits in constant currency, and organic new sales were down approximately 10% as reported and low teens in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, while we are pleased by the continued strong performance of our SaaS products, we were disappointed by our overall slower sales velocity in the quarter. ","The total renewal portfolio was down mid-single digits as reported and high-single digits in constant currency compared to the year ago period. As we\u2019ve stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to timing and duration of large transactions. Our renewal yield for the quarter was greater than 90 percent. ","Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter. Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were up in the low-20s and were positively impacted by both product and capacity sales in the period. ","Specifically, we saw a strong demand for new products such as Dynamic Capacity Intelligence which optimizes mainframe capacity utilization. New sales contributions from Mainframe Operations Intelligence, which embeds machine learning to improve operational performance, and Data Content Discovery which addresses security and compliance challenges were also drivers in the quarter. ","Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low-single digits, and organically were down approximately 20%. As mentioned, we were very pleased with the performance of our SaaS products, which continued to grow at a rapid pace in the quarter. Our recent acquisitions also contributed meaningfully to our results in the quarter. ","Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.034 billion, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 5 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 3% in constant currency, in-line with our longer-term expectation for the overall Mainframe market. Services revenue was flat as reported and in constant currency. ","Total revenue backlog was up 2% as reported and 1% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog improved 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Approximately 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode, while the remaining balance was driven by organic factors. ","In general, the size of renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months is a driver of our current revenue backlog. Q2 GAAP operating margin was 27% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 65% for Mainframe Solutions, 10% for Enterprise Solutions, and 1% for Services. ","Our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 28.7% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28.5%. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.44, down 12% as reported and down 10% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.62, down 7% as reported and down 6% in constant currency. ","Our Q2 CFFO was $37 million, up $90 million compared to the year ago period. Single installment cash payments were $80 million in the quarter, and up meaningfully over the prior year. Recall that in the year ago period, single installments were unusually low. ","We ended the second quarter with approximately $100 million in net debt. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $90 million worth of our shares outstanding in the quarter. We have $560 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. ","Consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past few quarters, we\u2019d like to provide some incremental disclosure with regard to our upcoming adoption of ASC 606. Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard under the modified retrospective method, we expect that a significant portion of deferred revenue and revenue backlog booked in accordance with the current standard, ASC 605 will not be recognized as revenue following our adoption of ASC 606. Instead, it will become part of a cumulative effect adjustment within retained earnings. ","Said another way, the license component of bookings recognized under the current standard will fall out of deferred revenue and revenue backlog. Instead, it will be captured in retained earnings on the balance sheet. As a consequence of this adjustment, we expect to see an acceleration of the timing of income taxes payable. We are still evaluating the amount and timing of those payments upon adoption and awaiting updates from regulatory agencies. As a reminder, we do not expect the new standard to significantly impact billings and cash collections from billings. ","Now turning to guidance, Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. As a reminder, please keep in mind that our renewal portfolio for the year is heavily weighted toward the fourth fiscal quarter. Typical seasonality for CA implies bookings and revenue to be stronger in the fourth fiscal quarter as well. ","Operating margin in the third quarter will be impacted by the timing of spend related to CA World, and therefore should be the lowest operating margin of the year. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase by approximately 5% as reported and 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.25 billion. We also expect our full year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. ","We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease by 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48. ","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. We expect cash flow from operations to be up 2% to 6% as reported, and flat to up 4% in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.10 billion to $1.15 billion. With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Raimo Lenschow","Question for Mike first. If you look at your Mainframe unit by depths. If you look at it, we always talked about it, a little stable to small declines. But if I look at the last two quarters, you saw kind of an acceleration of rate of decline compared to the 1% we saw last year. Can you talk a little bit about what gets you the confidence that this is not a trend started in the revenue line in the coming quarters?","Mike Gregoire","Sure. First of all on a quarterly basis, revenues get oscillated in the low single digits within any given quarter. So there\u2019s a bunch of puts and takes and sometimes there is an impact from rounding. So the quarterly results were within our expectations. And as you start thinking about how we look at the full year on the Mainframe, there\u2019s a strong system shipments that you\u2019ve seen from IBM last week and that gives us confidence in the strength of the hardware cycle. And historically our capacity sales like the system hardware by a few quarters. ","And despite the renewal portfolio headwind, Mainframe new sales of both product and capacity were quite strong, driven by the newer products like dynamic capacity intelligence, Mainframe operations intelligence and the content discovery. So we\u2019re confident that the revenue declines will remain within our medium target for the foreseeable future. ","Raimo Lenschow","And then the other thing I want to say is that, obviously there were the BMC CA rumors. Did that have an impact on the business in one way or the other at all or it\u2019s just the count that\u2019s totally behind us now. ","Mike Gregoire","I think it\u2019s all behind us. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Brad Zelnick","I guess just in simple, what gives you confidence to maintain the full year 4% growth guidance that\u2019s out there given your disappointment this quarter?","Mike Gregoire","Great question, a one we\u2019ve spent a lot of time analyzing and make sure that we are confident in reiterating full year guidance. And when I look at it the metrics lead us to believe that we just had an unfortunately bad quarter. ","When you take a look at the revenue backlog, it\u2019s up 6% year-over-year in constant currency. We expect our Q4 FY\u201917 acquisitions to contribute slightly more in the second half than in the first half. We expect the services headwind to moderately debate in the second half, and then of course we have seasonality of our standalone sales, our backhand loaded driving more upfront revenue in the second half, compared to the first half. ","And once again, I think from an execution perspective I think we got the attention to everybody in the company after getting to organic growth for a few quarters over the last several quarters, this is not a sometimes thing, we expect it to be an all-time thing. And I think it\u2019s given everybody a little bit resolve of what it takes to be excellent in selling in the products and the marketing and whole company rallying around that motion. So it\u2019s been an opportunity for us to really evaluate what does it take to be a successful software company and consistently grow.","Brad Zelnick","It\u2019s helpful color and it actually leads to my next question on go-to-market. We\u2019ve heard of more recent changes to the field sales organization specifically in commercial account coverage. What\u2019s the strategy for commercial accounts which I imagine you need to get right for new business growth and what does it mean for your channel? ","Mike Gregoire","Two things, first of all, the channel is incredibly important and as anyone who\u2019s been in software for an awful long time, when you got a very strong heritage in direct sales, it takes a while to get the channels working. When you take a look at the global system providers, I think we\u2019re doing really, really well with them. ","When you take a look at the system integrators, I think that\u2019s a strong spot. When you get in to resellers especially in the United States and in some cases outside the United States that\u2019s an area where I\u2019d like to see a lot more improvement. When you take a look at the point solution providers that we compete against, many of them have never had an opportunity to get out there and build a global direct sales force. And the only way that they\u2019ve been able to get their product to market is through distributors. ","So we have to help distributors understand that we\u2019re a better play that our software is better than the competition and that the overall value proposition of CA and the breadth of our solutions can help them be more successful than just hawking a plain product. So a lot of work to be done there. That\u2019s going to take multiple quarters to get done. ","On the commercial side of the equation, that\u2019s about three or four different motions. Number one is, we have to have an effective go-to-market cost and go-to-market - and that\u2019s going to be ton of sales, and really working through our digital demand. So by the time we dropped in a very expensive, very qualified sales professional to help sell a product, we\u2019ve already moved down the buying motion at a more accelerated pace. ","When we have very expensive sales resources and there\u2019s only so many of them any one company can have, getting in too early in sale cycle and not taking advantage of modern technology, I think we put ourselves at a disadvantage. So there\u2019s a lot of effort in that commercial sector to get that to be more effective and more efficient. Is that helpful Brad? ","Brad Zelnick","It\u2019s extremely helpful, and I really appreciate the thoughtful response.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. ","John DiFucci","Mike and Kieran appreciate the candor on what went well this quarter, but also the areas that needs some work. And just a follow-up to Brad, especially on the channel stuff, CA has attempted to leverage reseller channel partners many times over the last 10 to 20 years, and it\u2019s been difficult. And one of the things that I think leaves a question mark in resellers minds and the channel partners is that CA has come in and then they\u2019ve sort of left and we also have heard of some reorganizational round to your channel sales. I think the area you used to call growth. I just wonder how are you going, if in fact you have made those changes. How are you going to maintain the interest of these channel partners, which is an area where you could leverage because CA really hasn\u2019t been able to do that historically? ","Mike Gregoire","First of all, you\u2019re hitting on a very salient topic and one that requires a very thoughtful response. I\u2019ll do my very best in this call to help you understand it and everybody else for that matter. First of all, the concept of growth that was just nomenclature on our part. If I could go back in time, I never would have used that world. It all meant one segment. ","So that kind of got people a little bit more confused, but it really didn\u2019t have anything to do with a particular market. What it is to your point is getting in to these resellers and quite frankly I think we\u2019ve been kind of Lucy with the football than Charlie Brown. We\u2019re in to it, we\u2019re not it it, we\u2019re in to it, we\u2019re not in to it. ","If you take a look at the history of almost 15 to 20 years we\u2019ve been down that path. So we have to earn our way back with these partners and make sure that they understand that we\u2019ve very serious about having a focused channel. Now how do you do that, I think there\u2019s three ways. Number one, we\u2019ve got very hard lines between where direct sales force can go and where a reseller can go, and to the extent that we are very adamant about holding on to those lines. ","And if you look at in the previous iterations of CA, we would have a tough quarter. We would want to get a deal done and we would go on with the direct salesforce and accelerate that deal that a partner was doing. That is just bad hygiene, there\u2019s no tolerance for that in CA any more. We won\u2019t pay ourselves professional direct commission if they do that and a sales manager to let that behavior permeate through the company is one that we think is probably not going to be having a strong leadership future in our company. So we\u2019re very serious about that. And I use a very strong language, because it has to be that way. ","To change a decade long history, you have to put in a lot of structure and you have to be very serious and a tone from the top matters. Secondly products matter, if you have products that are difficult to sell via channel and there\u2019s no way that you had helped that channel in either the lead generation or their understanding of how to sell that product and help that partner competitively differentiate with other products we compete with and other partners that they compete with. I think that you\u2019re going to have a less than stellar result. ","So what we\u2019ve done and to your question of why is there a little bit of a noise in the system, we\u2019ve been very diligent. We used to have something like 300 to 400 partners that we said we were partnering with. We\u2019ve paired that down to somewhere in the 60 to 80 total partners on a global basis and we\u2019re putting the marketing and training dollars on a much smaller base, and we\u2019re really working collaboratively with these focused partners to make sure that they are getting the right kind of lead generation and they are able to articulate how to use our products to differentiate against competition. ","I don\u2019t think that get sticks in a short period of time, and it has to be something we are committed to for the long haul. ","Kieran McGrath","If I might add as well Mike. So John its Kieran, we spent a lot of time as well ensuring that the problematic rebase incentives that we have with our partners much more aligned with what they see in the industry now. We recognize that the partner has to make money as well. And I think the programs that we put in place over the last year; I think are really starting (inaudible) what my experience has been as well. ","And I think we\u2019ll start to get traction with that. As we go through, we\u2019ll constantly be evaluating, do we have the right partners, are we getting traction with them, what more needs to be done, and that 60 to 80 that Mike talked about, as we sign traction, but somebody may decide that we\u2019ll narrow it even further if that makes sense as we look at product by product. ","So it is taking probably longer than any of us would like. I do think [problematically] we\u2019re there and I do think Mike was spot on with the discipline inside the company and our reinforcement of that with our partners overall trying to get them comfortable to believe in us. ","John DiFucci","That\u2019s really helpful guys. And I really love the analogy. Maybe the mantra should be, let Charlie Brown kick the ball. But thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho. Your line is now open. ","Abhey Lamba","Kieran, we\u2019ve talked about in the past about reaching organic growth, I think exiting fiscal \u201919 is what you had talked about. Given all these initials that you\u2019re working on, the challenges we\u2019re seeing or the choppiness we\u2019re seeing. Do you think that\u2019s still the plan or should we expect organic growth in a couple of years or does any of this derail that?","Kieran McGrath","So I think Abhey as we\u2019ve spoke in the past, we\u2019ve always said that CA to really see organic growth, we expect the Mainframe will be in the low single digits, our services business pretty much to push one way or the other, the ES business has got to grow organically in the high-single digits. Obviously our experience last year was we grew very modestly about two points. I\u2019d expect modest growth again this year. ","I do think our ES growth will accelerate organically this year, especially driven by the good base line of SaaS business that we\u2019ve been generating in the past year. I do think it\u2019s a little early for you to say declaratively on the company as a whole if we\u2019ll be in a position to do that. We obviously like to see my backlog numbers coming out of the year. But I do think from an ES perspective that we should see a strong acceleration in the organic portion of ES next year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","Unidentified Analyst","This [Stan Hoffman], on for Kirk, thanks for taking the question. First question is did you see any pickup in inbound increase related to Veracode following some of the data breaches this summer. And has that all changed your thinking on the potential revenue contribution from that business this fiscal year?","Mike Gregoire","All of our security products not picking pipeline, it is definitely across our mind. And strategically, we started getting this message now that we are fully integrated with Veracode and they understand our full security stack and we have a better understanding their full security stack and we\u2019ve got the marketing machine of CA starting to work the strategic nature of this. And the message that, if you can fix the security breach when the code is been written, before it gets into production is absolutely and positively resonating on a global basis to just about every company. ","So I do think that Veracode\u2019s good to see some level of uptick. We\u2019ve obviously factored that in to our guidance. But I\u2019m very happy with their performance so far. It is a very great team, it\u2019s a great technology and they worked very well in collaborative within the confines of CA.","Unidentified Analyst","And then is a follow-up, it since have been more choppy than expected execution in the ES business in the second quarter. What gives you the confidence that execution will improve in the second half?","Mike Gregoire","When I take a look at execution, I think as I take a look at Q4, coming out of Q4 I was very happy with our ability to (inaudible) at the renewal. Once again Q1 definitely showed progress in that space and for us to get to where we want to be which is organic growth in ES; we have to sell with the renewal for sure. We demonstrated for years we know how to do that. For us to really get and brush up against our potential, we\u2019ve got to be able to sell outside the renewal and add net new customers. ","We did that pretty well, I was happy with Q4, I was happy with Q1. And when I take a look at Q2, I just think that we were a little complacent and we backed off the amount of rigor and then the amount energy and the amount of thoughtfulness you have to put in place to get a customer to decide to buy your product over a competitor\u2019s product and to buy your product as opposed to the 20 other things that they could spend money on. ","Why does this matter? When you take a look at the modern software factory, a metaphor that we are using in our ad campaign and I\u2019m talking to senior executives. They absolutely understand the modern software factory. Why is it that we\u2019re not getting some of the traction of the tools that enable the modern software factory and other technology purchases are being made is because we have to do a very good job of articulating that this software needs to be bought above all other software. ","It\u2019s not like I saw deals lose in the quarter. I saw way too many deals push and some of the reasons for it gave me a pause. They had decided that this wasn\u2019t a top of mind. Well if you really want to survive in the modern business infrastructure, you have to be very adapted software. I can\u2019t think of a single company that\u2019s not going through a digital transformation. ","If you\u2019re going through that digital transformation, you should definitely understand how to build your modern software factory. And you take a look at CA and our product portfolio; we are the tooling to build your modern software factory. That message has to be said emphatically and almost evangelically in each and every sales pursuit. ","To the extent that we did that, I think there is opportunity for us to improve. ","Operator","I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Gregoire for any closing remarks. ","Mike Gregoire","Well thank you everyone for taking the time. We will be right back at it, first thing tomorrow morning and looking forward to talking to you at the end of Q3. We also have CA World if you can make it. That\u2019s a great place for you to see the modern software factory at work and talk to a lot of our customers that truly understand how software from CA differentiates them in the market place.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kelsey Doherty. You may begin.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies' Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bill McCracken, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. These prepared comments were previously recorded. This conference call is being broadcast on Thursday, October 25, 2012, over the telephone and the Internet. Information shared in this call is effective as of today's date and will not be updated. All content is the property of CA Technologies and is protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be reproduced or transcribed in any way without the express written consent of CA Technologies. We consider your continued participation in this call as consent to our recording.","During this call, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our third quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on December 14, 2012.","Before I turn the call over, I'd like to highlight that, for modeling purposes, our year-over-year currency headwind on revenue guidance is expected to be roughly 2 points for the full year.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William E. McCracken","Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start this afternoon by providing some detail on CA Technologies' second quarter results and our revised annual and long-term guidance. I will then turn the call over to Rich for a more detailed review of the financials and updated guidance before we open the call for questions.","Let me start by saying that our second quarter was short of our objectives in several areas. Obviously, we are disappointed in our performance. Because we do not expect the macroeconomic environment to recover quickly and we therefore expect that our marketing transition will be elongated, we are lowering our guidance for the year. I will walk you through the quarter, what has changed in our outlook, what did not work well and some things that did work well.","Before I do that, let me turn to our expectations as we entered fiscal year '13. We knew the fiscal year '13 renewal portfolio would be down year-over-year. We also knew that we would be reorganizing the sales force, and we were sensitive that the economy might be a headwind this year. Having said that, there are 2 critical aspects of our business that are not performing to plan.","First, underlying our performance, new product and capacity sales did not come in as expected, particularly new sales outside of the renewal. New product and capacity sales were down approximately 25%.","Second, as we have outlined, our sales force reorganization has been slower to gain traction than we had expected. Clearly, I'm not satisfied with our sales execution and transition to segment marketing, which is a key to our future growth.","Finally, I would be remiss in not mentioning the weakening global economic outlook which has impacted our performance. In fact, we saw sales cycles elongate and deals slip out of the quarter. This trend exacerbated our efforts to sell to new customers under the segmented marketing model.","As we told you when we announced quarter 1, we are closely inspecting the pipeline and managing progression from a segmented view. This is new. This inspection improved the visibility into and quality of pipeline, but shifted the expected time of closing of some transactions to future quarters. All of this was exacerbated by the macroeconomic climate.","The result, as Rich will review in greater detail, is that we are reducing our full year expectations for revenue in constant currency growth to negative 3% to negative 1%. This results in updated cash flow guidance of negative 8% to negative 4% in constant currency.","However, we will continue our focus on cost and expense control through the second half of the year and expect our non-GAAP operating margin, which we raised last quarter, to be 36% for the full year. As a result, we are updating our outlook for non-GAAP EPS growth to 6% to 10% in constant currency.","Before addressing the plan for the balance of the year, let me place our second quarter results in perspective. First, there were headwinds that we knew we would have to contend with during the quarter. With the renewal portfolio down year-over-year and the mainframe portion down even more, we expected capacity sales to be down. This, coupled with an uneven macro environment where buyers are being cautious, resulted in capacity being down approximately 60%.","Based on our performance in the first quarter, we saw a trailing effect on cash flows, as our quarter 1 new product sales shortfall created a gap in billings that affected Q2.","Additionally, our renewal yield was in the high 80% range, a little bit lower than historical levels in this tough economic environment, but attributed to 2 transactions. The pipeline, while building, is building slower than we expected. This is the second quarter in a row North America has been down, and the impact of the economic political uncertainty in Europe was even greater than we expected. As a result, several core product lines declined, including our Application Performance Management and Infrastructure Management businesses.","At the same time, there are areas of the business which are performing, though off smaller bases. They include: Mainframe new product sales, which were up approximately 10% year-over-year; in Latin America, where we have been leveraging channels and partners for 2 years, we grew high teens; APJ, excluding Japan, where we also implemented a partner and segmentation program earlier, was up mid-teens. Both demonstrated that our segment marketing can produce improved results. Technology investments, such as ITKO and Nimsoft, delivered double-digit new product sales growth in the quarter; and our SaaS revenue grew by more than 30%.","Let me assure you that CA Technologies' competitive position is sound. I talk with customers and visit clients every week. And I remain confident that we are well positioned in the market, and our portfolio of products and solutions is compelling.","Because of our weak new product sales this year and the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we see a dampening effect on revenue and cash flow growth next year. As a result, we are modifying our long-term guidance. We continue to believe the multi-year financial objectives that we previously shared are correct, but we now believe the time line to reach these objectives will extend beyond our original expectations.","We feel very comfortable with our ability to generate cash flow. We expect approximately $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations this year and can fund the dividend, share buyback and future investments in the company. The Board of Directors and I remain committed to delivering our $2.5 billion capital allocation plan. This includes the $1 per share annual dividend and share repurchase program we have put in place.","Now let me turn to our plan to improve execution in the second half. First, we are continuing to introduce new products to the portfolio. This past quarter, we launched Infrastructure Management 2.0 and Nimsoft Monitor 6, which together arm our sales force with what we believe is the most complete infrastructure management solutions in the market. We will continue to extend our Service Assurance strategy with: A new version of CA Executive Insight, which adds capacity planning data to a solution that provides managers with IT insight in a business context; expanded monitoring capabilities for mobile browsing in a new version of APM Cloud Monitor; and new integrations of APM with CA LISA from our ITKO acquisition, which will provide advanced performance analytics for better decisions in service virtualization and testing.","As I said in the first quarter, we are entering a period of increased product introductions. Second, we are focused on building our partner ecosystem. For example, our partnerships with the India-headquartered global systems integrators have driven an approximately 200% increase in related new contract value. And we added more than 20 new MSPs, a critical distribution channel to reach growth markets. We also recently announced a partnership with Citrix to provide additional management and monitoring capabilities on top of Citrix cloud and desktop virtualization solutions. Products include CA Nimsoft Monitor, CA Automation Suite and CA Server Automation.","Third, we are continuing to pay close attention to our expense profile to assure we deliver the 36% non-GAAP operating margin we outlook for the year. We know we have work to do to sell more new products. The full impact of market segmentation was not evident in Q2, and it is going to take longer than we originally expected to gain traction. Our market segmentation has put short-term pressure on our performance. We implemented this strategy because we believe it is the right thing to do for our business, and it will have long-term benefits for the future of CA Technologies.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter and guidance.","Richard J. Beckert","Thank you, Bill. Please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, flat in constant currency and down 4% as reported. This includes a $43 million headwind from foreign exchange.","In Mainframe Solutions, revenue was $619 million, down 2% in constant currency and 5% as reported. I want to remind you that we have an unfavorable mainframe revenue compare in the third quarter due to a $39 million single-license payment that occurred in Q3 last year.","Turning to Enterprise Solutions, revenue was $438 million, up 1% percent in constant currency and down 2% as reported. Services revenue was $95 million, up 3% in constant currency and down 1% as reported. New Services engagements, which are heavily dependent on new product sales, were down 15% year-over-year.","We now expect FY '13 renewal portfolio to be down closer to 10% as compared to FY '12, with Q3 down year-over-year and growth in the fourth quarter.","Looking at the revenue backlog, current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.5 billion, down 7% in constant currency and 8% as reported.","Backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year. We also continue to see a headwind in backlog metrics, as contracts burn off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increase in our 2014 renewal portfolio.","From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $406 million, up 12% in constant currency and 7% as reported.","For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 60%. Operating margin for Enterprise Solutions was 6%. Finally, operating margin for Services was 6%.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.59, up 22% in constant currency and 16% as reported. This includes a year-over-year $0.02 headwind from currency.","For the second quarter, non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $89 million, down 50% in constant currency and 53% as reported. CFFO was affected by weaker new product sales; we have adjusted our full year outlook accordingly.","Single installment payments were $95 million in the second quarter compared to $100 million in the previous period. Total billings backlog of $4.5 billion was down 10% in constant currency and as reported. Billings backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year.","We ended the quarter with approximately $790 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $250 million. We are authorized to repurchase an additional $654 million of common stock for fiscal 2014.","Moving to second quarter GAAP results. Second quarter GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $337 million, up 12% in constant currency and 1% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 15% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 32% compared to 28% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.","Now let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based on exchange rate on the last day of the preceding quarter or for this quarter, September 30, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.","Before I review guidance, I would like to comment on this afternoon's update. Our adjustments take into account both our macro environment, which has elongated purchasing cycles, and our current view of pipeline progression for the second half of FY '13.","Updated guidance is the following: Total revenue is now expected to be negative 3% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.58 billion to $4.67 billion. A point of this year-over-year decline in revenue is attributed to a $39 million single-license payment that occurred last year and will not reoccur.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.44.","GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 8% to 12%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.99 to $2.07.","Cash flow from operations growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of negative 8% to negative 4%. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.38 billion to $1.44 billion.","Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of the year.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 449 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 458 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William E. McCracken","Thanks, Rich. Before we close, I'd like to leave you with a few thoughts. Market segmentation is the right strategy for CA Technologies. Expanding beyond our core 1,000 customers by accessing new channels, leveraging new partnerships and improving our coverage model will drive growth and expand profitability.","At the outset of the fiscal year, the timing looked right to introduce these changes. With a lighter renewal portfolio, we hope to minimize the effect on our existing customer base. However, over the last 6 months, we have continued to be challenged selling outside the renewal, both to our existing customers, as well as potential new ones. Driving this amount of change in an unpredictable economy proved more difficult than we anticipated. Because of our transition to segment marketing and expectations that the macro will not recover significantly, we are not projecting a rebound in the second half of this fiscal year.","That being said, we understand the challenges we face. We have reset the time line of our expectations, but not our goals of profitability and acquiring new customers. We continue to focus carefully on all details of our sales execution and will continue that focus until we reach our objectives.","And now, Kelsey, back to you.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you, Bill. As the operator is polling for questions, I would like to inform you that CA Technologies is presenting at the 2012 RBC Capital Markets' Software & Services Investor Day in New York City on Tuesday, November 13, and the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on Wednesday, November 28 in Phoenix, Arizona.","[Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Okay, we'll go to the next question from Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So 2 quick questions. Can you give a little more detail on exactly what affected the cash flow from continuing operations? Is it the deal mix? Is it the staffing mix, et cetera? And then the second question is, you discussed the 10 deals that were done -- 10 large license agreements with incremental contract value greater than $10 million and then a value of $232 million and then last year, a similar size, had a larger dollar. Is that the contract term that's affecting it or the license component of it?","Richard J. Beckert","Yes, on the second one, it's a little bit of both. So they were definitely longer in duration last year. This year is a shorter duration. If you look at the top, we're at about a 3.11. Last year's closer to 3.6 in duration, so that drove most of it. I think your first question was on how we came up with CFFO and the change in guidance. Is that correct, Mark?","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes.","Richard J. Beckert","Okay. So -- and I think this will be a reoccurring question maybe for some others. So let's start with -- what really we saw coming out of Q1, as we had said, was a slight decline in -- are transactions that were done outside of the renewal cycle. The deals that were done within the renewal cycle actually came in, in both first and second quarter, a rate under normal historical levels. And those impending events actually proved out to be the way we normally would see them. In Q2, what we saw was a slight difference, and that was a little bit of elongation in some of these transactions that were now going to happen later on in the year. That predominantly sits in the distributed or Enterprise Solutions segment. And that $150 million worth of perpetual licenses normally would have flowed to direct cash, as well as the revenue associated with it, for the licenses. And so what we thought was prudent, looking at the macro environment and the pressure the macro environment has on some of our geographies, and thought it was the right time to take that down.","Operator","Okay, we'll go to the next question from Aaron Schwartz of Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Rich, on the renewal portfolio, it sounded like there was a slight downtick, if I heard that correctly. And I was just wondering if you could reconcile that. It seems to me that would be something that was pretty well scheduled, and I just don't know if that's just something -- just an overall sort of conservatism to the guidance or if there was something specific. Or maybe you could just walk through that if that was sort of -- I know it's pretty minor example, but it did seem like it was a very modest downtick there.","Richard J. Beckert","It's a good question. What we saw, Aaron, is as I said, the overall duration came in at 3.1, a little lighter than the 3.6 that was a year ago. Not that that's anything that's really that significant, but the second part of that, that we saw in the quarter, and I think is a general economic trend, is people who sometimes are at the top end of their capacity either from MIPS or they need incremental seats on the enterprise solutions side of the products would have maybe potentially gone a little bit early or the ones that are there would have extended to a larger transaction. What we're seeing is they're buying just enough for what they really want over a 3- or 4-year transaction. And although it's minor, it was enough that we thought it was the right thing to tweak it down. And if you recall from our last call, what we said is as we thought we had better highlights into that number, we would share it with you guys because we did give a single-digit range which wasn't as close as what we're really trying to be more and more transparent to.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, I understand that. It could have been 9, and now you're at 10, so maybe it is very minor. But I thought the deal tenure was -- the shorter duration there was more tied to just the fact you were doing sort of more of the perpetual deals that are just shorter in nature and that was a little more independent of some of the mainframe renewals.","Richard J. Beckert","It's a little of both. So remember, that's the case, as you said. And clearly in Q2, it's the case because what we currently have is a lighter portfolio in Q2. So the transactions that were done outside of the portfolio would have pulled that down. But even in the ELAs that we saw, some that maybe historically would have gone 4-year or a 5-year, they were being done closer to 3 to 4. So there was a slight detraction there.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James.","James Wesman","It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Just a question, some of your competitors have seen a September slowdown spend from their software customers. I was wondering, did you guys experience a similar effect this quarter.","William E. McCracken","No. As we said in some of the comments, Shane, I think -- you said Shane? The macroeconomic environment is having an impact. We've all talked about it in EMEA in the past. We saw it now in North America as well. This quarter was the second quarter where they were down from where they had been before. So we do see a slowing. And for us, it's actually an amplifying factor on our market segmentation piece as well. So as we're moving into the market segments, having that slowdown, having the decision cycle slowdown, people sometimes even canceling projects and moving them, we do see that impact. And we saw it in September, but we think -- our expectation is that that's going to continue through the back end of the year, and that's a large part of why we took our guidance where we did.","Richard J. Beckert","I think -- if I could just add to that. What we really saw was -- we have pretty good headlights now into our pipeline and our pipeline progression. Transactions that are not driven by an ELA with a specific renewal date, what we're seeing is a slight -- people being a little more cautious and taking a little longer, especially inside their own firms, maybe to either get budget approval in the case of the Government or in order for them to get higher levels of authorization to spend their capital dollars. So we thought it was the right time to make the decision to elongate our pipeline. So what would normally have been a certain cycle, depending on where they were in the cycle, we actually extended that out. And that really is what caused us to decide to take that extra -- both cash, which came with the perpetual licenses and the revenue.","Operator","The next question is from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Bill, can you discuss the reasons behind new product sales not taking off? Is it all sales execution and macro-related? Are there any competitive issues in terms of the products of the market you guys are competing in?","William E. McCracken","Let me add to the second part first. Competitive-wise, we're very strong positioned. In fact, one of the things I reviewed going through some of these comments were we've launched several products as we went through this quarter, and we are on the front end of a very strong new product announcement cycle. So we don't see competitive losses. So we feel strong on that. If you take a look at the new product sales, it varies by segment. If you look inside the existing accounts, probably the macro thing we talked about is probably the biggest factor. Decisions are slowing down. We don't see people making decisions without going up their change for approvals as they do it. So that does delay things. And in some cases, customers, because of their own demand cycles, are delaying projects or pushing projects out. It's not directly related with the new sales, but on the -- from a renewal point of view in the existing -- I think future agreements sometimes in the past have been brought forward. We're not getting as many requests on that. And some that are brought forward to us, we've rejected because we think it has too much impact on the future. So that would sort of put the existing in place. If you look at the new, as Rich mentioned, we're building the pipe as we go through the quarter. The quality of that pipe is better. You will recall, we said when we put that in place, it was a 2-year plan. We do have accelerators on though for our reps to close the new orders in the new enterprise segment as soon as they can, and we're moving that competitive accounts. And clearly, the macro cycle, because they're in many cases the same size as our existing accounts, the macro environment plays on that as well. And then finally, on the growth side, we're building that pipe, but we're also building the partnerships with our business partners. And so the productivity of that takes time. And then all 3 of those, as I mentioned, are being impacted and elongated with respect to how we implement the segmentation.","Richard J. Beckert","The only thing I would add to that, because when we looked at the transactions that did move out of Q1 into Q2, we won most of those transactions. They're the ones that went out of Q2 and now into October, we won most of those as well. So we have not seen a disproportionate number of transactions that were either lost to competition. What we saw was, more often than not, a delay by the customer to just put off the purchase.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Go it. And just quickly following up on that, given that you saw delays in September, how has the environment been in October? Are you seeing a continuation of the same trend? Or have you started seeing some improvement on that front?","Richard J. Beckert","No. It's exactly what I said. I mean I think we saw -- what we thought was just a single point in Q1 became 2, which is now aligned and a continuation into early part of October. I think we've all read similar things from different firms, and I think it all came into our -- we are very metrics-driven now with our pipeline. And depending on where we are in the cycle, we decided to elongate that as far as when we were calling that to be in. And so we think that's the prudent thing to do with an uncertain environment. With the government sales and a lot of other things, it's the right answer and the way Europe currently is. So we think we positioned ourselves well for the second half.","William E. McCracken","And we did see some of the transactions that we had originally thought might close in the second quarter, did move into October, and some of those did close. But that doesn't, in our opinion, change what the macroeconomic impact is for us going forward.","Operator","And the next question is from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer & Co.","Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions on my end. Bill, I know you mentioned on the kind of new Citrix-CA partnership. Can you kind of expand a little bit on that, kind of what's the scope or as to when we might be seeing some meaningful revenue contribution over the next couple of quarters? And then also, a word about your Identity and Access Management. I know you mentioned a couple of products that did perform well and kind of grew double digits. So just want to find out whether the IAM product is also included here.","William E. McCracken","Yes. So on the Citrix piece first, we think that's a great partnership. As you well know, Citrix is one of the leaders in the VDI area. And what they need to add to their customer system and management control piece is that we add to and for them. And so it gives them more competitors in the marketplace and it gives us opportunity in the marketplace, both in their accounts as well as in our accounts. So we just thought it was a very strong partnership. As you well know, one of the things that we bring uniquely to the marketplace is we work across all platforms. And so when you work in the marketplace, I think our customers and Citrix looks at it as an opportunity for them to expand their presence in the accounts. It's just a strong partnership for us. On the Identity and Access Management, that continues strong. Arcot was strong. But as we've said many times, quarter-to-quarter, security goes up and down. We had a strong quarter, I think it was the first quarter. It was down a little bit the second quarter and come back again in the third quarter. It's a longer sales cycle than it is with a lot of our products. But security, as I travel the world, there is nothing that I talk about more because of customers asking us questions, because of the implementation of the cloud, whether it's private or public or a combination of those, is that security piece. So it continues to be a very strong demand for us and we believe it will, primarily because of the cloud. And that was one of the things we did first, is move our security into the cloud.","Operator","And the next question is from Matt Williams of Evercore Partners.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just looking for any incremental color you might be able to provide on trends in the Enterprise business. I know you highlighted in the prepared remarks that there were some declines in the APM business and the Infrastructure Management piece. And I was just curious as to any sort of other trends that you might be seeing within that Enterprise business.","William E. McCracken","Are you asking particularly with respect to the ES area or Mainframe and ES?","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just ES, primarily.","William E. McCracken","Okay. We think that when we look at our products across ES area, they were all essentially down. And they were because the revenue there was down because of the new product sales. So yes, we have seen a slowing in the APM market, and I think that has been a trend that frankly, on the on-premise side, has been slowing over time in the last couple of quarters. So we saw that continue through this quarter.","Rich, would you add anything to that?","Richard J. Beckert","I think the way I would answer that question, when there was a renewal that was due, so therefore there was an impending event, the customers acted in a very traditional -- their attach rates were the same as normal. The way they wanted to pay their cash was the same. I think what we did see, as Bill alluded to, in North America, which has been a growth engine for us, that was a little slower. We saw some transactions that required higher levels of signature, even -- almost back to a little bit of the '08 feel to it. But that being said, we had strong growth out of Nimsoft, we had strong growth out of ITKO. Our SaaS business grew well. So it was a little bit of a mix. But in general, clearly, it's not where we want it to be. In the Enterprise Solutions, we're looking for that business to continue to expand.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And if I might, just a quick follow-up. I know you made some changes to the sales leadership in EMEA a couple of quarters ago. I'm just curious, I know it's a tough region right now, but are you pleased with sort of how the changes that you've put in place are progressing. Or is there still a fair amount of work to be done? Just some incremental color on EMEA would be helpful.","William E. McCracken","Yes, EMEA marketplace is a challenge, I think it is for everybody. It is for us as well too. The changes we've made have been the right changes. And we're seeing improvement, especially with respect to the relationships that have been built in the enterprise existing accounts, but also in identification of now the pipeline for the enterprise new. And if we look at the changes that you refer to, clearly, those have been the right changes and they are making a difference in the performance for us individually, but it is weighted down significantly by the macro environment over there.","Operator","And the next question is from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bill, in prepared remarks, you said you're closely inspecting the pipeline. And I just -- it seemed like you're doing something a little bit different than you've done in the past. I guess, what do you mean by that? And why should we be confident even with lower expectations you're going to be able to hit them?","William E. McCracken","That's a great question. We did mention at the end of last quarter that we put additional focus on that. The key piece of that though, frankly, is we're looking at the pipeline by segment now. And looking at it by segment, as you look at it in different ways by segment and you look at it and inspect for different things as to what the close time would be. So the pipeline clarity by segment is much better. It is building, and the quality of it is building. But also, as we look at it, especially when you think of it, for example, in the enterprise new or in some of the growth areas, some of the things that needed to be done for it to close are then identified. And as a result of that, where we may have had it setting in the second quarter or third quarter, we might now have it setting in our third or fourth quarter. So we've always inspected it before, but we're down to a level of detail now, the way we follow with that, with both Rich and George, primarily because of the segment orientation. And it does give us good confidence into what's building there. And the thing that has been, I guess, the amplifier on the delay really has been the macroeconomic environment because it lengthens the decision cycle, John.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So Rich is also involved in this pipeline inspection?","Richard J. Beckert","Yes. George and I, together, do a deep dive of all 21 regions on a regular basis. It gets very up close and personal. And I think what we're seeing is a very structured way that we collectively go for and have the pipeline progress. And I think collectively as a team, we're coming up with much better metrics as to when deals should be viewed as 20%, 40%, 80%. And I think that all led into, John -- George and I saying, we think there's certain sections of certain geographies or certain product lines because they have longer sales cycles, like you heard. Security is a great example, right? When you win, you win big, but it's a longer cycle. So those kinds of things into a large new or into some of the growth markets I think has given us better insight. I think taking down the number, which I'm sure a lot of people said, \"Well, your 2Q really wasn't that far off,\" it really is all about our trust in the pipeline going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Phil Winslow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. So could you comment on the trends in the Mainframe segment and your expectations going forward with the release of this new IBM mainframe?","William E. McCracken","Mainframe. Yes, I think a couple of things on the Mainframe side. So you heard on our prepared remarks that the new product sales in the Mainframe was up 10%. That's driven, frankly, by some of the investments we've been making now for the last 1 year, 1.5 years in our product set that we call the Chorus products and our tools that we provide in that area. And that's helping to improve our revenue in that area. We look at a 90% renewal rate as we do the renewals on those. And then I think the final piece of that is when you look at the capacity piece of Mainframe, it is largely driven by the customers' increased volumes or increased demand. There's been times in the past, for example, in the financial industry, which is important to us, where we've been the recipient benefits of large banks buying smaller banks. And then that load is transferred onto that, and that has pushed some of that capacity. I think what we're seeing now across probably all segments is that there appears to be a reduction of the demand that those people have. That reduction in demand is impressing them to put capacity on. So that is, I think, one of the key pieces that we see happening with respect to capacity. And then a final point would be that competitive win back. I think a lot of the new tools that we provide in the mainframe area, we are now winning in the mainframe marketplace, and that's adding to our revenue as well. So does that answer your question?","Richard J. Beckert","If I could just add one thing. I think what we see is a slowing down of the growth. It's not a statement that there's a lessening of demand. And that really is back on some of the financial institutions, I think, because of the pressures they're under. They're not going to put as much headroom out ahead of them. And so they're buying a little bit closer to what their base business is growing at. That's just something we'll cycle back through and catch it later. That was my point earlier when I said why we're more comfortable at the 10% than when before we said in the mid-single digits, is we're seeing just a little bit smaller in total transactions as they're being cautious, which I think in their case, it goes back again to the economy.","Operator","The next question is from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess the third time's a charm. But I guess just one question. It's one that I get asked a lot, so I figured I can ask it publicly. I guess in this, with all due respect to Bill, who I know remains very active here. I'm just curious, you had publicly announced in June that you had begun a succession plan for the CEO position. I just wonder if you can give us any update at all on that.","William E. McCracken","Actually, John, it's probably good that you do ask it because I get asked that question a lot as well. We did announce that both the board and I are working on a succession plan. We have no new update to that. Obviously, when we have announcement with that, we will make that known. But in the meantime, what you and everybody else should know, we are full steam ahead on what we've just talked to you about today with respect to where we are and where we're going. We are on offense. We're staying on offense, and that will not vary as we move into the transition whenever that occurs.","So I think then, let me wrap. I think I would make 3 points. First, we believe that market segmentation is the right strategy for CA Technologies. It is expanding us outside our current base, and that's what's going to allow us to grow and to be even more profitable. We will continue our focus on cost and expense, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we expect to deliver a 200 basis point increase in our non-GAAP operating margin this year.","And finally, we understand what we have to do to close out the balance of this year. And with a careful focus on all the details of the sales execution we talked about, the segmentation implementation, we're going to continue that focus until we've met those objectives. Folks, thanks for hooking up with us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program. You may now disconnect.

Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer, and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks and then we will open up the call up for a Q&A session.

","Let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. ","So, with that, let me turn the call over now to Mike. ","Mike Gregoire","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We had an encouraging first quarter, driven by improved sales execution, strong operating margin performance, and continued progress towards achieving our long-term goals. While our overall first-quarter total new sales were down mid-single digits year-over-year, enterprise solutions new sales were up low-single digits year-over-year. This was offset by mainframe new sales, which were down in the high-teens. The decline in mainframe new sales was in-line with our expectations. ","Mainframe capacity was negatively impacted by both the decline and composition of our Q1 renewal portfolio, as well as a renewal with a large North American financial institution that required less capacity following a merger that occurred multiple years ago. That said, our outlook for the mainframe business remains unchanged, as we continue to expect mainframe revenue to be down low single-digits over the medium-term, which we believe is in-line with the mainframe market. ","Non-GAAP operating margin was 41% in the quarter, as we remain focused on efficient execution and financial discipline. Although I am pleased with the efficiency of the business and encouraged by the improvement in enterprise new sales, we still have work to do to drive the kind of growth that our company has the potential to achieve. ","Our recent results only partly capture the traction we are experiencing in the field and the strong market opportunity in front of the company. The disruption of traditional business models is clearly accelerating, as enterprises across the globe are embracing the application economy to drive innovation. CA\u2019s solutions enable enterprises to capitalize on the opportunities created by this application economy, where software is the competitive differentiator and application development is the driver of innovation. ","Let me provide you with more insight into the progress we're making towards our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.","First, in product development, we have stated that in order to be a leader in the next generation of software, innovation must be the lifeblood of our company. The recent hiring of Otto Berkes as our new Chief Technology Officer signals our intent to accelerate organic innovation and enrich CA\u2019s long-term technology vision. Otto\u2019s experience as Chief Technology Officer at HBO and his 18-year tenure at Microsoft, where he was one of the four original innovators of Xbox, exemplifies the talent we are attracting that will be critical in helping us to achieve our longer-term product development goals.","I am also very pleased that Ayman Sayed will be joining CA as Chief Product Officer on August 10. Ayman comes to us from Cisco where he was the Senior Vice President of the Network Operating Systems Technology Group, leading the development of network operating software on which nearly every Cisco networking product runs. Ayman is a very accomplished executive who oversaw the vision and engineering direction for Cisco's software strategy. He is experienced with agile software development and pioneered Internet of Things innovation at Cisco. At CA, he will work closely with Otto to create best in class products. Their teamwork and focus will drive organic technology and product development, which continues to be our priority, and help CA\u2019s customers gain advantage in the application economy. ","To complement our organic roadmap, we recently enhanced our internal development capabilities with three transactions. We characterize two of the deals as technology tuck-ins that expand our capabilities in security and DevOps. The acquisition of Rally, which closed a few weeks ago, represents a more significant investment. ","By adding Rally\u2019s award-winning cloud-based agile development platform and its transformation consultants and coaches to the fold, CA becomes an industry leader in the fast growing Agile Application Life-Cycle Management software market. Importantly, this acquisition also adds product and service capabilities that are highly complementary to our award winning PPM solutions and strengthens CA\u2019s existing DevOps leadership. With less than 5% customer overlap in our platinum accounts, Rally\u2019s best of breed technology and unmatched scalability provides ample opportunity to cross-sell into these strategically important accounts, as well as cross-sell our solutions into their install base. ","I am confident that Rally is a natural, strategic fit for CA. Our products and go-to-market methods align well, and equally as important, Rally\u2019s culture and focus on delivering high quality solutions mirrors ours. To maintain the current momentum, the Rally organization and its leadership team will continue to report to Tim Miller in his new position as General Manager and over time will be fully integrated into CA. Later during the call, Rich will discuss Rally\u2019s impact to our fiscal 2016 guidance. ","Our management cloud solutions experienced success in the quarter and our solutions continue to be recognized for their leadership in the space. For example, in the quarter, CA PPM was designated as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Project and Portfolio Management Software. In addition, during Q1, CA PPM had several high profile wins, such as a competitive replacement with Delta Airlines that is leveraging our technology to automate the vast number of complex business processes across a multitude of different internal organizations. ","Equally impressive was the win with Macys, which required enterprise wide PPM to provide a common system of record and process for all business and IT projects. Overall, I\u2019m encouraged by the improved execution during the quarter and I look forward to updating you on the integration of Rally and our product roadmaps throughout this fiscal year.","Turning to DevOps, the new releases of CA APM 10 and CA UIM 8.3 feature compelling, new user interfaces and analytics to facilitate collaboration in dynamic environments. Specifically, these new integrated solutions dramatically improve the ease of use for IT operations teams by providing the speed and scale organizations need to rapidly deploy new applications, monitor dynamic environments, and continuously optimize application quality to ensure superb customer experiences.","Let me briefly highlight our continued APM success. I am pleased to report that APM\u2019s positive momentum has continued in fiscal 2016. In the quarter, the product posted impressive new sales growth of approximately 20%. Our fiscal Q1 release of APM 10 was a highlight and it brings to market new capabilities that accelerate customers\u2019 DevOps initiatives. ","Key patent pending functionality added to APM 10 include: a completely redesigned user interface that enables first-level production support personnel to resolve production problems much more effectively; analytics technology designed to reduce the skill-level required for troubleshooting; unique timeline functionality that quickly correlates performance issues with past app changes. This is differentiated technology that enables DevOps teams to receive recommended fixes in real-time. A must-have in the highly dynamic world of cloud and microservices. ","I am very excited about our continued success in APM and the launch of APM 10. Importantly, customers and the broader market share my enthusiasm. For example, just a few weeks ago, CA APM was featured as the Number One APM product by Dow Jones Newswire based on the number of customer reviews on crowdsourced review site ITCentral.","Our security pillar demonstrated consistent execution during the quarter. The need for comprehensive security solutions continues to strengthen worldwide. With the frequency and severity of breaches continuing to impact enterprises across the globe, companies are looking to software firms like CA to provide guidance on how to protect their users and data.","Leveraging our position within security and application delivery, our API Management solutions continue to gain mind share. During the quarter, CA was positioned in the Leaders Quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Services Governance for our API management product. APIs allow customers to modernize existing architectures and connect to hybrid cloud applications and mobile devices while unlocking the value of data. We are a leader in this fast growing opportunity, as we can provide API management solutions at the scale and security levels needed for the massive amount of data traversing these newly created digital platforms. ","For example, after an extensive evaluation of the top vendors in the API management market, a leader in the peer-to-peer lending FinTech space, chose CA\u2019s API Management for ease-of-use, flexibility, and security profile. We see many API management opportunities like this emerging in the marketplace.","Now, let\u2019s turn to a second piece of our strategy, sales execution. During Q1, we saw continuing evidence that our decision to separate platinum accounts from our named and growth accounts, and to specialize sales by product discipline, is yielding results. ","The highlight for the quarter, from a sales perspective, was the accelerated new sales growth from our named and growth sales teams. Importantly, participation within these combined customer accounts was broad, as every geography grew double-digits during Q1. Worldwide, these more seasoned sales teams increased deal counts, improved pipeline conversion rates, and improved win-rates on a year-over-year basis. ","Additionally, inside sales demonstrated impressive performance, as the team substantially increased its participation in closing business during the quarter. This is important and exciting progress for the company. It is a key indicator as the value of our products, and consistent performance from these customer accounts is critical to the success of our strategy. ","Finally let me address velocity. While Q1 represents progress towards our long-term goals, we still need to move faster in some areas. Our focus on brand awareness and demand generation are vital to improving CA\u2019s velocity. ","Let me briefly highlight a recent success our marketing team has experienced. During the quarter, our digital marketing team won the highest accolade in demand generation marketing, Marketo\u2019s Revvie. Winning this award represents our marketing team\u2019s use of next generation technology to push the status quo and help CA break away from the competition.","Before I conclude, let me be the first to invite you to CA World 2015 at Mandalay Bay Las Vegas. CA World \u201915 is bringing the greatest minds in the application economy together. Building off our success from last year, this year\u2019s event will showcase several new organically developed solutions that will help our customers develop and manage apps and modern IT infrastructures with confidence in the application economy. I hope you will join me in Las Vegas on November 16 through the November 20.","On balance, our first quarter results and qualitative indicators, reinforce my confidence that our improvement in product quality is resonating with customers. In fact, our Global Net Promoter Score improved in all geographies and increased more than 10 points year-over-year. During fiscal 2016, we will build upon our progress by focusing on innovation, execution, and speed to compete and win in the application economy.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you.","Rich Beckert","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. ","As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q1 total revenue was $977 million, and was down 3%. Enterprise Solutions declined 2%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. ","Q1 renewals were down in the mid-single digits and down low-teens as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits and approximately 10% as reported. This is due mainly to headwinds from the renewal portfolio.","Renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-80% range. The lower than historical average renewal yield was the result of a large renewal with a North American financial institution that required less capacity following a merger that occurred multiple years back. Excluding this one transaction, our renewal yield was in the mid-90% range.","We continue to expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up low-single digits year-over-year, excluding a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in fiscal 2016. As reported, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 10% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, including a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in fiscal 2016.","Turning to the geographies, we experienced an improvement in new sales in Latin America, in spite of the macro headwinds in the region. However, sales in EMEA and North America were down, reflecting both the decline and composition of the renewal portfolio in Q1.","In our Mainframe segment, Q1 mainframe new sales including new product and capacity were down high-teens in constant currency, and down in the mid-20% range as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our mainframe revenue to be down low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in-line with the mainframe market.","Q1 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were up low-single digits in constant currency, and down mid-single digits as reported. The improvement in Enterprise Solutions new product sales was mainly the result of improvement in sales outside our renewal process.","Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services booking in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the longer-term, we expect services revenue to decline, as we design our products to be easier to install and leverage partners for more service engagements.","Current revenue backlog was down 3%. Current revenue backlog was impacted by headwinds from a large system integrator expected to be renewed later in fiscal 2016 and lower fiscal 2015 services bookings. As I have said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low-90% renewal yield.","Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 41% and GAAP operating margin was 31%. Segment operating margin in the quarter was 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions, and 10% for Services.","Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 29% and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, up 9% year-over-year. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, up 15%. Our Q1 CFFO was $188 million, up 38%. Single installment cash payments were $37 million and down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.4 billion in net cash. ","During the first quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividends. We have $735 million remaining in our original $1 billion share repurchase program. Subsequent to Q1, we drew down $400 million from our $1 billion revolver in conjunction with the close of our acquisition of Rally.","Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. This guidance also includes the acquisition of Rally Software, which closed earlier this month, and assumes no incremental material acquisitions. ","We expect currency to have negative impact on our full-year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 4%, at June 30th rates. Total revenue is expected to be down 1% to flat in constant currency compared to our previous guidance of down 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.04 billion to $4.11 billion.","We expect the full-year GAAP operating margin of 28% compared to our prior expectation of 30%, and full-year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% compared to our prior expectation of 39%. As previously disclosed, this 1 point decrease in our full year non-GAAP operating margin reflects the Rally acquisition. We expect the majority of this impact to be realized in our fiscal Q2. We expect Q2 margins to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. And, recall, our fiscal Q4 margin was negatively impacted by our Q4 fiscal 2015 severance actions.","Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5%, unchanged from our previous guidance. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.37 to $2.44.","GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 10% compared to our prior expectation of 12% to 17% growth. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.72 to $1.80.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 432 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. ","Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.98 billion to $1.03 billion.","And now we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. This is Stephan [ph], sitting in for Raimo. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what seems to be a slight change in strategy perhaps to more aggressively pursue acquisitions again. And then more specifically, if you can comment on where you expect to see meaningful synergies from Rally over time?","Mike Gregoire","Sure. I wouldn't say that our strategy has changed at all. We've been consistent for the last two years that we've spent between $300 million and $500 million on acquisitions, but our number one focus is organic development. So if you take a look at this particular quarter, we've had an opportunity to accentuate both of those strategies. Doing Rally, which is a big acquisition, at 480 plus million and bringing on two extraordinarily well-respected technologists in Otto Berkes and Ayman Sayed shows that we\u2019re playing both offence and defense here.","We want to bring in Rally because we see some really deep synergistic opportunities for us, both on the PPM space and on the DevOps space, coupled with the fact that we see almost every customer driving themselves into the application economy and the way they\u2019re doing that is by building software and the way they are building software is through agile.","So we see that as a very unique asset that fits very well within our strategy and then when you take a look at the two tuck-ins we\u2019ve brought, both of those tuck-ins are going to need a fair amount of organic engineering in order to get them to scale for the kinds of customers that we sell to as well as the kind of opportunities to expand a little bit more than the standard deviation outside the core of some of the products that we are looking at.","And in order to do that, you have to have some very experienced technologists, both on the product side and on the pure technology side to make sure that you are building on the right platforms and truly driving product management and when I take a look at the combination of Otto and Ayman, I think that puts us in the upper class of the ability to do organic development from a leadership perspective. Did that help answer your question?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, absolutely. And then if I could sneak in one more, I believe it's been a few years since the segmentation between the platinum named and growth accounts. So I was wondering if you could provide any additional color on the progress, because it seems like that took off this quarter. And we sort of haven't seen that until this quarter. So if there's anything specifically going on, whether it's certain products that are doing better than others. And then, just how that coincides? Because it seems like there was a decline in Enterprise Solutions' up-front revenue. And I would think that the named and growth accounts, given that they're sort of separate outside of the renewal cycle, would actually positively impact that trend, so any additional color would be super helpful?","Mike Gregoire","Sure. Very complex question with multi-tenants, I\u2019ll try to answer it as succinctly as I possibly can. First of all, it's not any one thing. First, I got to give my hats off to the salesforce. We have moved into this year, we said we weren\u2019t going to change sales accounts, we weren\u2019t going to go change sales leaders and we weren\u2019t going to change the way that we wanted them sell in the segmentation.","So when we walked into this year, we had an experienced salesforce selling to people that they know, understanding how they buy and I think that was very important. Secondly, from a product perspective, we have a number of products that are selling very well in the market. I referenced in my call, APM, up 20%. API management, we are the number one player in that space, according to industry analysts as well as by financial performance and then we had a very nice quarter with UIM. So those products sell very well to customers that are not necessarily in the Fortune 50, Fortune 100 and customers that we don't have big relationships with, they\u2019re a great entry in to those accounts and I think the combination of both products and our sales force did a really nice job getting in to those accounts.","The other thing I would remind you of, Stephan, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time, energy and money on marketing and how do you go find the right people to sell our products to and understand what their buying perspectives are and I think that that put a lot of air cover and helped make the salesforce more productive.","The other thing with respect to why the upfront revenue didn\u2019t happen, I would put it into two categories, and I'll get Rich to comment on it. First of all, our SaaS revenue is increasing. So if you're selling SAAS, you're definitely going to be recognizing that revenue ratably and then a lot of the deals we sold primarily in APM, those deals went ratably as well. ","Rich, maybe you have a little bit more color on that.","Rich Beckert","Yes. So Stephan, I think the thing that would help is we actually had a very good attach rate this quarter on our portfolio that was renewing when you back out that one transaction, we actually had a strong quarter and that put a lot of traditional products in the ratable nature and as Mike said, some of the products that did well this quarter tended to be PPM and things like that that you will see show up over time. So -- and they would then move from SFO backup in to the subscription line.","Mike Gregoire","Thanks, Stephan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ken Talanian","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. We saw an inkling of growth in the enterprise solutions new sales this quarter. And you just mentioned you saw growth in APM, API, UIM during that quarter. But you also said that you need to move faster. I was wondering what specifically gives you confidence that you can grow enough organically to actually reaccelerate the top line?","Mike Gregoire","Yeah. I think it comes down to two things that I kind of referenced in my previous answer. Number one, I was happy with the sales force, but I still think there is room for improvement. If you want to be a modern sales force, a modern sales force generates about 80% of the leads, follows their methodology all day, every day and does strategic accounting planning. When I look across the globe at our sales force, we have pockets of brilliance. We have work to do help people understand the business importance and for us to truly penetrate the kind of customers we want, we have to have the whole sales force operating at that level of proficiency and I think there is some work to be done there.","Secondly, on the product side, we have a number of products that are selling well into both the named and growth accounts, as well as back into our platinum account. What we need to do is have more products and I think that\u2019s what we look at when we\u2019ve done some of these tuck-in acquisitions to accentuate our portfolio. Purchasing Rally I think is going to be a multi-year investment where there is lots of tangents and where we can take that particular product when we think about analytics with respect to how that works on to lifecycle portfolio management. ","And then lastly, some of the products that we have that are \u2013 we\u2019ve had for a long time, big releases are coming out in that we are going to be announcing at the CA World. So I feel that we finally have some of our product mojo working. We are putting out net new products that people want to buy and that are very competitive in the marketplace. But I think it\u2019s wise for you to ask the question, because I don\u2019t think we should rest on that. I think there is a lot more to be done with respect to the market that we participate in and the constant push of the entire company to build products that really matter, I think we have to continue to drive that.","Ken Talanian","Okay. And as a follow up to that, you mentioned some new releases of older products, where would you say you are in sort of turning over that older product portfolio? I mean, how far are you to in there and refreshing all of those?","Mike Gregoire","I think it\u2019s once again it would be a long answer to the question. I will just give you a few highlights. I think in APM I think we are in the medium to early stages. I think on UIM, I think we have a lot of work to do. A lot of the UIM success has been in selling to net new customers. I think getting some of the existing customers that have run the portfolio of products under UIM, we have a particular program in place called [indiscernible] [00:29:38] that we are driving that. I think we are in the very stages of that.","I think in the we are in the medium term stages with our flagship security products. The latest version of that has been out for about a year and it was a significant change from the previous version. And as we start adding to the existing version right now I think that\u2019s going to be a lot easier and the upgrades are going to be an awful lot easier. So definitely some room to grow there for sure. And depending on which particular product, in which particular segment, I think you are going to get a different answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John DiFucci","Thank you. That large North American renewal you called out, was that expected in the quarter, or was it renewed early? We try to model that, I realize it's never perfect in the timing of these things, we just do it based on an average renewal time. But even though the renewal portfolio was down, it wasn't down as much as we thought it would be, so just wondering if that big deal was something that came in early.","Rich Beckert","That was due, John, to be in the back half of the year and working with the customers, I asked if they could have that in Q1. This was a transaction that \u2013 they had access to do it even earlier in previous years and we had said no. They had excess MIPS after working through their consolidations. They actually consolidated 100% of the renewal yield on all their ES products. So it was really just overcapacity on MIPS. What it did though and it goes back to the first question of the first caller, it did little bit distort though. We actually had very good quarter. So the mid-90s if you back that out and the attach rate of the ELAs, but to your point, there are \u2013 it\u2019s a light quarter, though, from -- traditionally Q1 is a light quarter, so that does distort your model, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of yield out of that. That being said, we had a similar thing if you recall maybe two years back.","John DiFucci","I do.","Rich Beckert","Later on they came back and had to buy incremental MIPS and when they choose to not have the excess capacity, they actually have to pay us more dollars per MIPS. So in the long run we work it out that it\u2019s better for us. We do try to encourage them to keep their model, but sometimes their own internal pressures cause them to make some short-sighted decisions and we let them do that. ","John DiFucci","Great, Rich, and then just a follow up to that. I know the renewal rate is at the mid-80s, but without that deal, in the 90s. I know when you calculate the renewal rate, I know you are taking -- I think it's the majority of the revenue in the larger deals. But the actual renewal rate, if you calculate it across the entire business, wouldn't it be a little bit higher even than what you --?","Mike Gregoire","And we do both, just we\u2019ve been very consistent for the last I guess five years of doing just the large. Now that we have SAP on every place, but Japan we actually do both, but we\u2019ve kept with the same metrics. And you are correct, it\u2019s always within like two points of each other. We check it every quarter to make sure it doesn\u2019t have a distortion. If you actually were to back that out, the dollar per day revenue, per day type would have been very strong this quarter, so you are accurate. ","John DiFucci","Okay, great. And I am sorry, just one more on this. Do you have any expectations? Just so kind of we can anticipate it of any other deals like that this year that may come in, a large deal where for whatever reason consolidation or something like that, your renewal rate may look little lighter in realizing the first quarter is a lower renewal quarter, so it\u2019s going to have a bigger impact, but is there anything else that we should be looking for?","Rich Beckert","Not from a \u2013 are you asking the renewal yield question or are you asking just renewals in total, because we do have a large system integrator scheduled for the back half of the year and whenever that happens, it will definitely distort that quarter, but as far as renewal yield, now that should be nothing for that magnitude or size.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives of FBR Capital Market. You line is now open.","Jim Moore","Great. Thanks guys. This is Jim Moore for Dan Ives. Just wondering if you can talk a little about the competitive landscape and specifically, on the DevOps side of things. What kind of opportunities you are seeing with your recent acquisition?","Mike Gregoire","Sure. The DevOps is really a fragmented business, which I think is storming and forming as we move forward. When you take a look at the whole notion of service virtualization, the ability to create synthetic testing and the whole option of continuous delivery, I think when you look at Agile and take a look at how we're going to use Rally, that accentuates our position in DevOps because now we can go directly from product and portfolio management directly into how you built software into driving, how you test software both virtually and through synthetic testing methods and then driving the whole concept of continuous improvement.","Now, when you talk a look at all that, there is still more things that need to be build in the context of DevOps and the driving factor of this is speed, as companies move into the application economy and their primary deployment mechanism is mobile devices, the time to build net new apps is decreasing at a pace that I don't think anybody has really understood or taken into an account. And as we start thinking about that problem set, it gives us a lot of opportunity to continue to build on our portfolio. Now, when we\u2019re talking about competitive competitors, we see most of our competition coming from point competitors that can't stitch together a full DevOps strategy and a full DevOps mission. And we have a whole division built in on that because we think that we're still in the early days and there is a lot of innovation that still needs to be built to make that as seamless as possible. Is that helpful?","Jim Moore","Yes, very helpful, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi, your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Thanks. Rich, I just wanted to confirm that the entire revenue guidance change came as a result of the Rally acquisition and including that in the guidance?","Rich Beckert","Correct. So, as we had said last time, we were going to be one to two points and you see, we put that right back just like we had said a couple weeks back and you also that we had around 39% margin, we brought that back down to 38%. I do want to remind people that that one point degradation in the margin will show up almost entirely in Q2. So as people do their modeling, they should be aware of that. And then if you look at it from a historical perspective, Q4 last year was very heavy about because of all the rebalancing work that we did, so please make sure you correct that in your models as well.","Walter Pritchard","Okay. And then Mike on your end, I think last year Q1, Q2 you saw sort of a similar strength in your ES business showing I think mid-single digit growth in Q1, and then it accelerated in Q2. And then you had some disappointment in the back half of the year, where the quarters get larger. Can you talk about sort of how -- and I think a year ago, you talked of some good signs in the business and then it reversed. Can you talk about how what you\u2019re seeing right now is different or similar than what you saw a year ago? And do you have confidence that you can continue to see the sort of growth in ES business based on drivers that you highlight here as we move through the year?","Mike Gregoire","Sure. I think what we see today, just snap the chalk, the products are definitely better and definitely more competitive. I think the marketing is more crisp, more targeted, and more focused. I think the sales force understands their mission better and we have a higher percentage of sales professional that really get what selling is in a modern IT environment. The days of chasing elephants and buying a stake in a bottle of wine and expecting somebody to give you a five-year perpetual license contracts are dead and I think that our sales force has migrated to a much more collaborative, much more product knowledge based selling and our targeting has definitely improvement. So when I take a look at the statistics on how I measure the sales force, I see up into the right type movement, not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but definitely better the ones last year.","Rich Beckert","If I can just add on to that, Walter. If you think of the revenue backlog being down 3%, one point of that is the services business which we by design, is going to [indiscernible] a little bit because of just the new products being easier to install. One point of that is that large system integrator that comes due mathematically in Q4. That leaves you with one point, and if you think of the fact that the mainframe business as we continue to tell you is at low-single digit decline, it kind of gives you the idea that over time the ES business is actually growing inside that revenue backlog.","Mike Gregoire","Is that helpful Walter?","Traci Tsuchiguch","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James, you line is now open.","Michael Turits","Hey, guys. Michael Turits. Just on mainframe, I know you said that you think that the revenue growth rate would be down low-single digits no big change there but, any recent observations relative to what's going on in terms of units and pricing? Any change in what you think of as nets growth or pricing? And then is that consolidation reduction, is that kind of a one-off happens once a while or any concern that that might be a trend?","Mike Gregoire","Sure, Mike, I\u2019ll give you a couple of pieces of information and I\u2019ll let Rich walk you through how that flows through the financials. If you just take a look at the quarter that most recently reported by IBM, they had a pretty significant increase in MIPs. So, the platform unto itself is being more used today than it ever was and that\u2019s good for us. The customers that find the mainframe to be as stable great transaction processor is not fading in any way, shape, or form. The number of MIPs that were shipped just last quarter by IBM I think exceeded just about everybody\u2019s expectations and we will be a net beneficiary of that phenomenon.","As far as how the market goes, we think that the market is shrinking still at 1% or 2% and where we usually make gains is when there is any kind of consolidation going on, we\u2019re tended to be one of two stable providers that are still investing in pure R&D into the mainframe, but we come across as a very stable and committed vendor and partner to that platform. Rich, maybe as you\u2019re looking at that business, you have something you would want to add.","Rich Beckert","Yeah, I mean, because I sat across the table from that one provider and that had nothing to do with them leaving the platform, that was just two companies that together had too much capacity. As far as our ability to look through our installed base, it hasn\u2019t changed and I recently as last month sat with the pricer who maintains that for me and Michael, there is no change and at the very, very low end, those guys continue to drift away at 1% or 2% a year, at the very, very high end, those guys are growing their MIPs double-digit and that offsets that low end disappearing. So, I don\u2019t see anything really changing other than the fact that there is a more of a blur between what is it -- what you call mainframe and what\u2019s just up in the cloud but at the back-end of it is still a mainframe churn.","Michael Turits","Okay. And then just one follow up. Rich, the buyback level went down a bit this quarter from $2.5 million, $3 million, a tune of 3 million shares down to 1.5 million. Is that lowering intensely? Is that to do with Rally? I think that I noticed that you had a contract of buying back some more.","Rich Beckert","No, more to just do with Rally. We have roughly $400 million coming in the quarter. So, that\u2019s nothing more. We are very much still on track and as you saw, we\u2019re committed to the weighted average of 436 and the ending share kind of 432 for the year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Greg McDowell of JMP Securities, your line is now open.","Richard DesLauriers","Hi, this is Richard DesLauriers dialing in for Greg McDowell. Thank you for taking my question. In terms of geographies, you did kind of break down in terms of new sales. You said LATAM was up, EMEA and North America were down. Do you have any color in terms of what the driver in that improvement in LATAM was and any sort of color on APAC?","Mike Gregoire","Yeah. LATAM, very specifically was a very tough year for us last year and I think there was a little bit of pent-up demand over the course of the year that showed up in the performance in LATAM. Secondly, which I was pleased to see, we did put a new sales leader in Mexico and we\u2019re very pleased with the performance in Mexico and we also saw some transactions happen outside of where we usually get those transaction, which is Brazil. So, seeing the whole ambient space able to participate was a step forward for us. Similarly in Asia, we\u2019ve seen an uptick in Japan and the execution in general from our Asian team.","Richard DesLauriers","Okay, great, thanks, it\u2019s very helpful. And then just a quick housekeeping question Rich. You had mentioned FX headwinds for the year in terms of revenue would be about 4%. Do we have any idea, I guess, what sort of headwind we would see on the bottom line in terms of EPS from the change in currencies?","Rich Beckert","Yes. At the end of the day, non-GAAP EPS you are asking? It\u2019s about 7%.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Michael Gregoire for any closing remarks.","Mike Gregoire","Great. Well, thank you everyone for participating in the call. I know it\u2019s a big reporting night and everyone is really busy but I\u2019d like to end up with just making sure everyone understands a lot of the positive momentum that we\u2019re seeing in the Company. The key things that really stand out for me is we had growth in ES new sales. As a matter of fact, we had double-digit growth in the main growth space in all geographies.","The growth in new sales outside of the renewal process was exceeded my expectations for the quarter, which is also a big qualitative metric that I look at. We continue to run the business in what I think is a very smart way and a very efficient way with margin expansion of 1 percentage point. We had great CFFO growth and we continue to see the EMEA team doing a really good job and getting revenue returning to growth.","Looking forward, I\u2019m super excited about the strategic acquisition of Rally. This improves our revenue guidance by 1 to 2 points. But I also think long-term, there is a lot more in the Rally acquisition with respect to the platform that they built and our ability to take advantage of that platform. We got the strong renewal portfolio in the back half of FY16 and we continue to see great metrics on our CFFO growth. So, with that I\u2019ll let you return to your evenings and thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kieran McGrath, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Kieran will offer some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll open up the call for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Tuesday, January 24, over the telephone and the Internet.

Please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Gregoire","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively impacted reported revenue by an additional 1.5 points in Q3, relative to September 30th rates.","As discussed last quarter, we faced a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of upfront revenue realized in the year-ago period and the continued attrition of our Services revenue. This continued attrition of our Services revenue is due primarily to our on-going efforts to develop products that are easier to install and easier to manage.","The cadence and quality of our product releases continues to improve. While we are making progress across a number of our key strategic imperatives, we are continuing to work to improve the consistency of our performance across business units, customer groups and geographies.","For example, our Mainframe business is performing very well and our North American Platinum team delivered solid results in the quarter. However, performance in our Named and Growth, or partner-led business was inconsistent.","Total new sales and ES new sales declined in the quarter. This was due to a variety of factors, including very large deals in areas like Privileged Access Management or PAM and Service Management that closed in the year-ago period, which created a difficult compare.","In addition, the pipeline for some of our products like Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is more heavily weighted towards Q4 than it was for Q3. Mainframe performed very well in the quarter, reflecting the combination of key competitive wins, healthy renewal performance and our successful partnerships with global service providers.","This is the result of our on-going organic innovation and commitment to customer success. This dedication to customer success extends beyond our software. There is no doubt that we live in a highly integrated world, where various systems are interdependent. Our solutions are known to be mission-critical, high-reliable and zero down-time.","Our Net Promoter Score or NPS, which is an industry standard measure of loyalty, continues to rise on a positive trajectory. Our Customer Satisfaction score continues to increase and our customers are rating our product quality higher.","With this backdrop, we are pleased but not surprised by the performance of our Mainframe segment both in Q3 and through the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Our zero net new defect policy has resulted in considerably lower customer support issues and higher customer satisfaction.","In the quarter, 12 new Mainframe releases went into GA, including new SKUs for CA Development Environment for z Systems, Mainframe Operations Intelligence, and CA Release Automation Connector for z\/OS.","We have demonstrated a long-standing commitment to innovating on the Mainframe. Due to the value and quality of our systems, customers continue to rely on the mainframe for mission-critical applications, which continues to drive MIPS growth. And, there are an increasing number of customers choosing to standardize on our solutions. All of these factors are driving our success in this market.","At CA World in November, we introduced the concept of Built to Change. Companies and organizations used to be Built to Last, now they must adopt the mindset of Built to Change.","New opportunities and new threats are emerging at an accelerating pace. This requires a more Agile approach, which provides the framework to pivot quickly and results in more robust, higher quality solutions.","The adoption of Agile across our development organization is enabling us to develop integrations across a number of our product families, improving the seamlessness of our broad portfolio.","For example, at CA World we released new integrations between our APIM and APM solutions with CA Precision API Monitoring. We introduced new Application Lifecycle Conductor or ALC integrations with CA Agile Central.","And, our latest release of CA Identity Service, our new Security SaaS offering, incorporates new integrations with CA Single Sign-On solution. Users can now access all of their cloud and on-premise applications from a single system.","There is no question that our end-to-end vision is resonating with customers. Our solutions enable customers to plan, develop, test, manage, and monitor with seamless security across all environments.","Our APIM business, for example, delivered the largest quarter in its history in Q3, with strength across most geographies, products and routes to market. In the quarter, CA was positioned highest for Ability to Execute in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management. CA was also named a leader in the Forrester Wave, API Management Solutions Q4, 2016.","In addition to a number of new releases announced at CA World, the APIM team also demonstrated CA API Gateway for Microservices. It also demonstrated industry vertical use cases, including a healthcare mobile app on top of our Healthcare Portal and a Finance mobile app with Payment Services Directive and open banking.","Customers like Service NSW or New South Wales in Australia are using our API Management solutions to connect millions of citizens to hundreds of services running on different processes and platforms.","Our solutions enable every company to be a software company. We are really excited about our position in the APIM space and the opportunities we see going forward.","Similarly, our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions had the best new sales quarter in its history, driven by continued strength in Test Data Management, and all product lines in the business unit released new versions in the quarter. The innovation engine at CA is alive and well.","Code.org, the organization driving to ensure every student has the opportunity to learn computer science, used CA Blazemeter to synthetically test its site for over 25 million users at its global Hour of Code campaign. The event offered tutorials on more than 30 languages and had the capability of reaching tens of millions of students in more than 180 countries.","We are passionate about the need to encourage and expand computer science education to reach a broader population of students. We are very proud of our ability to help ensure the success of Code.org and its events.","Across our portfolio, we are continuing to focus on developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage, without compromising functionality for the sake of simplicity. Agile Central, which also experienced new sales growth in the quarter, is a good example of this.","In the quarter, we launched significant enhancements, simplifying the user experience with personal navigation. We are also working within and across business units to encourage cross-functional collaboration which should result in unique differentiation in our solutions and frictionless experiences for our customers.","Consistent with our strategy of moving our portfolio of solutions forward and creating opportunities to best serve our customers, we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Automic last week.","We had been in conversations with Automic\u2019s management team for well over a year. It is an asset that we had targeted for strategic, operational and financial motivations. So we are excited to welcome Automic employees and customers to CA. Strategically, Automic expands our Workload Automation and DevOps portfolio with its cloud-enabled platform and gives us an end-to-end automation solution.","Operationally, it elevates our presence outside of North America and strengthens our footprint in the Germanic region, where we were under-penetrated. Financially, the acquisition meets our rigorous hurdle rates and was a great opportunity for us to utilize offshore cash.","As I look towards the end of our fiscal year and into fiscal 2018, I am pleased with the progress we are continuing to make. Increasingly, we are a company that is Agile and Built to Change and we will continue to pivot to make thoughtful and strategic adjustments to optimize our position.","While we are proud of our progress, we are by no means satisfied. We know that we must continue to evolve in order to achieve our potential and consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth.","With one quarter left to go in the year, we believe we are on track to achieve our objectives in FY '17. To provide some insight into how we\u2019re thinking about FY '18, including Automic, we expect the level of growth to be in-line with what we\u2019re experiencing in FY '17.","This assumes that Services continues to be a headwind to revenue and that Mainframe performance is consistent with our expectation of low single digits revenue decline year-over-year. Taking a longer-term, holistic view of our business, including both organic and inorganic contributions, we believe that we can deliver low single digit growth in the medium-term.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kieran to review our third quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you.","Kieran McGrath","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I am going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","Our Q3 total revenue was $1.7 billion and was down 3% and down 2% in constant currency. Our constant currency revenue performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations due to a higher level of up-front revenue recognized in the year-ago period and the decline in Services, as Mike has mentioned.","The strength of the US dollar, negatively impacted our reported revenue by 1.5 points compared to September 30th rates, the last day of the preceding quarter. For year-over-year comparison purposes, the strength of the US dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 0.5 point.","Q3 Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 2%, Mainframe Solutions declined 1%, and Services declined 12%, as reported and in constant currency. Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits as reported and in constant currency. Q3 renewals were up in the mid-single digits both as reported and in constant currency.","As we have previously stated, the year-over-year changes in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teen\u2019s year-over-year both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer term target.","Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America, due primarily to uneven performance in Named and Growth or partner-led accounts. New sales in Latin America declined due to on-going macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were flat as reported and increased in constant currency in EMEA. New sales in APJ were down, reflecting the timing of the renewal portfolio in the region.","Revenue increased in APJ as reported and in constant currency. In Latin America revenue increased as reported, but was down in constant currency. In EMEA revenue decreased as reported, but was up in constant currency. Revenue declined in North America as reported and in constant currency.","Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were flat as reported and increased in the low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter reflects the combinations of competitive wins and customer consolidation onto the CA platform, continued traction with newer, organic products, like Data Content Discovery or DCD, and our on-going successful partnerships with System Integrators or SIs.","Overall, we continue to expect our mainframe revenue to be down in the low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in-line with the mainframe market.","Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high single-digits year-over-year, as reported and in constant currency. Areas such as API Management and Continuous Delivery saw positive new sales growth in the quarter.","However, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our Enhance portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow.","Services revenue decreased 12% as reported and in constant currency. We expect services revenue to decline, as we design our products to be easier to install, and as we leverage partners. We continue to expect this headwind in Services to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth in the near term.","Total revenue backlog was up 3% and up 4% in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 1% as reported and was flat in constant currency. As we\u2019ve said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90\u2019s renewal yield.","Q3 GAAP operating margin was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. GAAP operating margin increased 3 points compared to the year-ago period and is consistent with our medium term target.","Segment operating margins in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions, and negative 4% for Services. Q3 Services margins reflect actions taken during the quarter to right size the segment given our expectation that Services revenue will continue to be a headwind.","Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, down 4% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, flat year-over-year and down 2% in constant currency.","Our Q3 CFFO was $517 million, up $185 million year-over-year. CFFO increased relative to the year-ago period, primarily due to the timing of single installment collections. Single installment cash payments were $231 million and up $106 million year-over-year.","As we discussed last quarter, we have entered into an agreement-in-principle to settle a longstanding matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. We have accrued for this liability and expect to pay the $45 million in cash during this fiscal fourth quarter.","We ended Q3 with approximately $739 million in net cash. During the third quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. We did not repurchase shares in Q3 due to the timing uncertainty related to our payment of the GSA settlement, combined with the rate and pace at which we had executed our share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year.","Generally, we expect to offset dilution with our share repurchases. We have $650 million dollars remaining of our original $750 million dollar share repurchase authorization.","Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31st, 2016. The guidance also includes the impact of our acquisition of Automic.","As described at the announcement of the acquisition, given the timing of the close, which occurred on January 18th, we expect Automic to contribute half a point of revenue as reported and in constant currency.","The acquisition is expected to adversely affect GAAP and non-GAAP total company operating margin by one percentage point, and be dilutive to CFFO, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, both as reported and in constant currency.","The impact of the Automic acquisition combined with the higher level of expenses typically incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter are expected to meaningfully depress ES margins in our fiscal Q4.","For the full year, we expect total revenue to be flat as reported and flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.01 to $4.03 billion.","We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%.","GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 1% to 4% as reported and flat to up 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of flat to up 2% as reported and down 2% to flat in constant currency. This translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.47.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 413 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 5% decrease to a 1% decrease as reported, and a 3% decrease to a 1% increase in constant currency.","This translates to $990 million to $1.03 billion and includes the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement-in-principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed.","As we look ahead to fiscal year 2018, we'd like to provide some preliminary headlights into our current view. Including Automic, we expect fiscal '18 growth to be similar to the level of growth we are experiencing in fiscal year 2017.","We expect Services to continue to be a headwind to revenue and consistent with our longer-term view, we expect Mainframe revenue will decline in the low-single digits year-over-year.","Now with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks for taking my question. I had like to - two quick clarification questions and then one underlying fundamental. And first, Kieran, can you talk - if I look at the guidance, and I assume Automic is about a half a point of benefit for 2018 as well and maybe that\u2019s the first clarification you need to give me? Then you are looking for a decline of revenue of 0.5% to grow over 0.5%, is that marked correct just to start with that one?","Kieran McGrath","So Raimo, I think for '18, we're expecting Automic to contribute probably closer to 2 points of growth overall. What we're seeing is in terms of why we think it will be in sync with where we were this year, kind of the higher end of where we were this year, is really because we'll continue to see services being a headwind probably up a point.","And from a Mainframe perspective, Mainframe has actually operated I\u2019d say on the high-end of our guidance all year long. I think just consistent with how we view the market over the long-term, declining in the low single digits, that\u2019s going to contribute to the impact to it as well next year.","And then I think just from a clarification perspective, we also think that if FX remains consistent with where we ended in 12\/31\/16, we think that probably represents about another four points of headwind to us next year as well.","Raimo Lenschow","Okay. So that - because that was my - the FX was my next question in terms of the impact there for Q4 and full year, it\u2019s kind of a bull-talk, what you just kind of talked about?","Kieran McGrath","That\u2019s a fair point. So we expect it to be - it was half a point. The guidance was half a point. The impact was half a point year-to-year in Q3, it will represent a full point on the year-on-year in Q4, and then obviously a point as well for next year, presuming the rates stay consistent to where they are right now.","Raimo Lenschow","Okay. Perfect. Okay. Thanks for that. And then one for you, Mike. So the - if I look the name and the growth accounts were the ones that, you know, this quarter where you were kind of inconsistent, but that has been going on for a while. Did you guys do any of root course analysis to see kind of what's going on there, what needs fixing? Thank you.","Michael Gregoire","Thanks Raimo. Especially this quarter, I was really disappointed to what happened primarily in Named in North America. I think that when we look across the Board on a global basis, what we're seeing is that at the high-end of the Named look a lot more like our platinum customers and that's a little bit of a different selling motion. And the lower end of Named, we put a lot of that into growth, is much more like a reseller.","So when I take a look at our staff and the way that we've trained them and the way that we've positioned them on a global basis, I think we can do a little bit more to match the accounts to the buying patterns that we're seeing in the market.","And it took us several quarters to really understand this motion. It's not as fluid and predictable as you would expect and it wasn't until we looked at the data over four or five quarters that we saw that.","The other thing is, we are probably masked a little bit because we've had pretty good traction in the eSTG space over the last five quarters. Like this is the first quarter in five that we haven't grown revenue in the eSTG.","So a combination of maybe a little too optimistic about our progress and then not fully understanding - the patterns of these distinct customer patterns.","Raimo Lenschow","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matt Hedberg","Sure. Thanks guys for taking my questions. I've got two, one a modeling question and then a follow-up for Mike. I guess, Kieran, at your Analyst Day you talked about your renewal portfolio I think it's expected to be down in fiscal '18 versus fiscal '17.","And I guess, considering your initial guide for '18 on revenue, I am wondering, can you give us some color on how we should think about cash flow growth next year, you should slash [ph] it down a little bit, it be the right way to think about it?","Kieran McGrath","I think we might have even touched on this little bit at CA World as well Matt. But truthfully our customers are going to pay us fairly consistently. You know, well sometimes we'll see spread out over a three-year deal, the customers might actually pay 40% upfront in a particular year.","In general it's fairly linear where it comes. I guess the one thing you should think about is that whole GSA payment that we're going to make here of $45 million in Q4, that's actually going to be tailwind for us this year until next year.","Matt Hedberg","Got it. Okay. And then maybe one other follow-up from Analyst Day, Mike, you guys talked about CA Accelerator program. I'm curious, can you give us an update on some of the innovation? I know there is a lot of cool technologies percolating in that. Maybe an update that would be helpful?","Michael Gregoire","Sure. There is a number of them in there. Some of them, we want to try to hold that a little tight to the vest because we're still playing around with it we think it's a competitive advantage. But the ones that are kind of progressing along we're very happy with, one in particularly called Forty2.io, the initial idea of what we were going to use it for, it didn\u2019t work out.","But the underlying technology ended up being our whole analytics platform which we co-named Jarvis. And that's being used in a couple of the products in our - as we went out to market in Ayman\u2019s Group, our Chief Product Officer.","We have another one that we've been working on called Who's Who, which is one that really takes a look at matching skills. We have another one that\u2019s doing some very interesting work in machine learning, really understanding how an application functions in the context to the environment it's in.","So there is quite a few things going on in there that I'm very pleased with. It's a high-performing team that really takes advantage of Agile, and they are truly disciples of lean and really work hard to make sure that they pivot very quickly and go through our process in very quick form.","And also with - since you're asking about innovation, I think the products groups, which is run by Ayman has done a phenomenal job. They put 12 relatively media releases out this quarter. And I can think of several in particular like Identity Services, which is a great application so that you can come to CA, that is number one in Identity Access Management, especially for high volume on-prem, but now you can go and use the same system and do all the cloud oriented authentications.","There is no company that has that ability to bridge between all of these on-premise systems and a robust cloud set of services. Agile Central, did a big release this year this quarter, where they really trimmed up the user interface and made the whole Agile methodology much, much more approachable.","And I think that\u2019s going to drive a lot more usability. And if you think of how a modern software company runs with land and expand, making it easier to use gives you an opportunity past the land to start expanding.","One on the Mainframe that I think was extraordinarily impressive was Intelligent Mainframe Management Automation. This is once again only a CA product, we are one of the few companies that are really investing in the Mainframe and this is using machine intelligence to really understand what\u2019s happening in the Mainframe environment was that be the network, the destructor of the CPU power. And it\u2019s also built, but you don't have to be a Mainframe expert to use it, which is driving this whole notion of ease of use.","So I'm very bullish on what\u2019s happening in our products organization, code quality is high, customer satisfaction is up and innovation engine is clearly humming at CA.","Matt Hedberg","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John DiFucci","Thank you. My question is for Mike. Hey, Mike, I'm looking at revenue, I'm looking at new bookings, and it's not too much that new bookings are down year-over-year because I remember last year you had a great quarter for new bookings. But it looks like it's really the new bookings don't seem to be able to offset attrition.","And when I look at - forget about the professional services for a minute, but when I look at subscription, that subscription line has been negative in every quarter for I think five years now.","And I know some of it may have shifted to software fees and I know there is some currency effects in there, too. But I look at that and I think about all of the things that you have done and your team has done, the sales operation side, which I think are very positive and on the products side there is a question Matt asked and I think that's really cool and positive.","But maybe given what CA is and half of what CA is the Mainframe and this slowly not too nice, but maybe trying to grow it isn't really going to work and maybe there are other ways to return value to shareholders.","I'm just wondering if that's anything you're considering especially given that next year's guidance now implies that organic constant currency growth is going to be negative again?","Michael Gregoire","Well, I would challenge your assumption. As you know, CA's model is a little bit more awkward, it's not as straight forward as many software companies when you've been around for 40-years you have multiple revenue streams.","And if you take a look at your two assumptions, we have grown bookings 2% this last quarter. So the opportunity to grow is clearly there. And if you take a look at ESTG, we've had revenue growth in five consecutive quarters except for this particular quarter.","When I take a look at the number of products that are out there and when I take a look at our ability to penetrate the market, I take a look at what customers are looking for with more stability in a software provider, they are looking for a - that is heterogeneous with respect to platforms and not tied to selling services or selling hardware, I think we're a very unique property out there.","And we are definitely seeing growth. We will grow this year. The guidance we've given for next year we've given you an indication that we have an opportunity to continue to grow. We kick out a great dividend. We are very careful with our capital structure. All of the acquisitions that we have done have been accretive to revenue. So I am not in the same place you are, John.","John DiFucci","Yeah, no, Mike, I hear what you're saying, but even next year's guidance, I mean, if you take out - and I think making these acquisitions makes sense. But just trying to measure you the way we measure every company on an organic constant currency basis, you aren\u2019t going to grow. If you do you\u2019ve guided too, if you take out Automic.","So I just - and I believe you've added a lot of value to be a much better company today than it was five years ago. But I just wonder if it is just - I mean, you are trying to make this thing grow and there is some unnatural that go into that and maybe, maybe, I don't know, people ask me all the time, they may increase the dividend, this doesn't work, things like that. And I am just wondering it\u2019s now the time to start to think about it, but it sounds like that\u2019s not what you are thinking?","Michael Gregoire","Well we review our capital structure every year, and we look at multiple opportunities to drive shareholder value. And when we think about the long-term of CA and the value we drive over a longer period of time we're very comfortable with their strategy.","John DiFucci","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Mark Moerdler","Thanks. I appreciate it. Two questions. First, how should we think about the use of cash if what's being discussed in the government occurs in terms of the ability to return cash efficiently from a tax point of view? And then a follow-up question.","Michael Gregoire","Sure. First of all, we don't know what the policies are going to be. Right now we return about 65% of our cash back to shareholders. We have been relatively consistent on that for several years. So we will take a look at it in the context of that framework.","And I'm sure that when you take a look at all of the discussions that have happened that I don't think it's going to be a, you know, just take the money off and do whatever you want with it. There is probably going to be some strings attached with any kind of program that they put in place.","And until we see what that program is and evaluate that against all of the opportunities we have to drive shareholder growth, it\u2019s just hard to really think about what could happen. We're going to wait and see what the programs are.","Mark Moerdler","Thanks a lot. Mike, as a follow-up, given the size of the Automic acquisition, how should we model and think about on a going forward basis the spend on acquisitions?","Michael Gregoire","Yeah, we have been - once again we try to be as consistent as we possibly can. You can take a look at what we've done here with Automic, we haven't done a large acquisition for about 18 months. We try to do 300 to 500 per year on average. And as we said in the opening comments, we have been talking to Automic for a year.","So we don't know when we're going to be able to transact. We're extraordinarily disciplined, we do a great deal of due diligence. And at any given time we're looking at multiple opportunities with respect to acquisitions. We just really can't control the closing time of it of those acquisitions.","So we still like those you know, tuck-in type applications, and, you know, the $40 million to $60 million range. But when we see an opportunity to get something that's a little bit more meaty in the 300 to 500 or in this case 600 million at the right valuation, we feel that those are good fits for our company and to drive our long-term strategy.","Mark Moerdler","So you still figure on 3 to 5 on a year-over-year basis going forward, is a fair estimate?","Michael Gregoire","You know, I take the timing out a little bit. Once again, that's how we kind of think of it. But I don't have complete control over how these things work.","Kieran McGrath","It's Average, right?","Michael Gregoire","It would be an average.","Mark Moerdler","Right, over a long time. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Nemeroff","Thanks for taking my questions. The Service margins this quarter were negative. I'm just curious what the drag was there. We haven't seen the Services margin negative in several years. Is there - can you get that back to breakeven overtime and keep it there? And then I have a follow-up please.","Kieran McGrath","So this is Kieran. Certainly, we have been telegraphing that with our Services revenue declining we obviously look to keep our Services business, you know, not making a lot of - not really contributing a lot of profit to us, but not that we wanted to lose a lot of money.","What you saw this quarter and I actually referred to it in my script, was actually the cost that we took to really try and realign our resources with what we project the future revenue to be. I know, this will probably play out over several quarters and things like that, but it's really more about right sizing it.","Over the long-term, I think we feel pretty comfortable that we can drive a business here in low to mid-single digits. We want to ensure that the Services that we put in place are there for deployment and to help our customers to make the best use of our software. We're not trying to gouge anyone. We just think that's the right use of it. So, yes, absolutely we can recover here once we get through the next quarter or two, just trying to realign our resources.","Michael Nemeroff","Thanks, Kieran. That's helpful. And then on the ES solutions if I may, maybe this is wishful thinking. But could you give us maybe the growth mix of the legacy versus the new products, so we can kind a determine how much longer those legacy businesses are going to be a drag on that unit's growth?","Michael Gregoire","Yeah. It's a complicated question. We don't break it out by product, but the best way to think of it is three distinct buckets. We have a group of products which we call enhanced. And those products we don't sell a lot of net new, we sell a little bit of capacity. But they're very profitable products and our customers use them all day every day.","And part of our relationship with them is the fact we continue to invest in these products. Mind you, we are very careful with respect to our R&D spend and very limited marketing spend.","The next bucket are scale products. These are the ones you\u2019d see us doing a lot of advertising on, a lot of marketing on, they still get a healthy R&D budget. These are products that we are actively selling across the board. We\u2019re selling them into our platinum accounts. We're selling these into our Named business, and we're selling them into our Growth business.","And then we have the third bucket, which is high growth products not yet mature, very high R&D cost, scaling marketing costs, and the mix of all three of those buckets, we have various products that move back and forth.","Once a product gets to a certain level of scale, where it's primarily a capacity sale, it will move into enhance. A product that is new and when they\u2019re starting to ramp up and scale, we put into the scale bucket. And the spend and the management of that looks a little bit different than you would manage a team that is going for a net new product with net new innovation and really working on the - and getting customers into the agile Scrum team rather than working heavily on deploying. Does that give you a little bit of context for how we think about it?","Michael Nemeroff","Yes. It definitely does Mike, but if you can put maybe some quantitative meat on those bones that would be a little bit more helpful. Thanks.","Michael Gregoire","Yes. We\u2026","Michael Nemeroff","In terms of the mix.","Michael Gregoire","One of the things were - it\u2019s really hard to do the segmenting we have is on the three segments that we have.","Kieran McGrath","I would say that we did attempt to try to give a broad level segmentation in our CA World slides where we at least gave a sense is to what\u2019s the overall mix would look like and what the changes would be over time.","I mean, no doubt about it, but the scale products is where the focus is Mike points out and that's where the real growth is. But some of the enhanced products will grow on the unique quarters as well. So it is difficult to specifically quantify, but I do think that choice put it in the CA World that at least give you some sense of how big it is.","Michael Nemeroff","Okay, guys. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Kieran McGrath","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi, I'm wondering, Kieran, if you could just clarify the comment on or I guess it was Mike, that answered the question on Growth and Named account issues does it sound like customer segmentation issue and that was really the issue that you feel like the sales motions in those various buckets are working it's just a matter of getting the customers in the right areas? Is that the right interpretation I think it\u2019s your answer to Raimo question?","Michael Gregoire","Yeah. Walter, it's Mike. We've been paying close attention to this for several quarters and you're always trying to optimize your sales force and we do pay pretty close attention to customer satisfaction as well as cost of sales. And a platinum customer does behave different than a net new customer we have never done business with before. I think we get those two extremes.","When it comes into the middle I think we need to take a harder look at some of the customer segmentation because I think there is a lot very large customers that actually look a lot more like a platinum customers.","They expect a dedicated sales rep, they expect a different type of service, they are going to competitive bid pretty much all of the work that's out there and that platinum team is very good at these long multi-country bids that they have been doing for a number of years.","On the flip side of it there is a whole segment of customers that are looking for point solutions, and, you know, four years ago or three years ago we didn't really have point solutions, we had very complex on-prem solutions that required high services and a lot of configuration if not customization. We don't have a lot of those products in the portfolio anymore.","We really have pivoted to SaaS, cloud, on-demand, easy-to-use, easy-to-install. There is a whole segment of customers that are looking for a try and buy and much more digital footprint.","And I think we can take a harder look at that and give a little bit more work on customer segmentation and get the customers that look like platinum to be sold to like a platinum customer.","And then take advantage of this growing group we've built in handling our partnerships. Our partnerships did a very nice job multiple quarters in a row and we're starting to scale that out on a global basis so I think we can leverage that, as well.","Walter Pritchard","Got it. And then just on ES, is it possible to help us understand the impact - sort of the magnitude impact of tougher comps you saw with large deals a year ago and then the execution issues in that new product growth rate?","Kieran McGrath","I mean, clearly from a revenue perspective it was worth about four points on a year-on-year business to the ES business, the upfront revenue as we talked about. So from a new sales perspective, you know, I'd say, it actually constituted a fairly substantial portion of the new sales.","If I just think about our PAM product and probably our IT service management product in particular, all of which had some big deals with upfront type of characteristics a year ago. That was probably really responsible for all of the ES decline in its aggregation.","Walter Pritchard","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Yeah, thanks, hi guys. I just want to do follow up on that line of questioning around ES, was there anything in that ES segment in terms of some of the newer growth initiative products that had a tougher quarter or you know when you look across was it primarily stuff that was in kind of your more mature bucket you talked about that maybe saw some additional headwinds, beyond the examples that you gave in terms of issues like tough compares, et cetera?","Kieran McGrath","So not to be redundant but the PAM is to Xceedium business really was the one that faced the big headwind on year-on-year basis and that was one of the items I mentioned to Walter before. Most of the other stuff that we really think about is our scale products like API, continuous delivery, actually did quite well in the quarter and all had some really good growth.","Sterling Auty","Got it. And then you talked about the improvement in Net Promoter Score. Any sense that you can give us in terms of where your Net Promoter Score sits relative to the peers that you compare against?","Kieran McGrath","Sure, we take a look at the whole software space and we try to focus directly on the enterprise base. And we've had a lot of growth in the Net Promoter Score over the last two years, and I would put us in the mid to upper quartile with respect to the software industry and definitely in the upper quartile with the enterprise sup set of the software industry.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.","Abhey Lamb","Yes. Thank you. Mike, you talked about low single-digit growth in the near term. What's your timeframe to get there on organic basis? Or will acquisitions be a key part of that strategy on a continuing basis?","Michael Gregoire","Yes, it\u2019s going to be a combination of both using acquisitions. You know, we got a very solid balance sheet and being able to use that balance sheet is a competitive weapon for us.","Secondly, I do think that there is a little bit of a misunderstanding with respect to organic and inorganic. For example, if you take a look at our purchase of Xceedium, that was a very, very small acquisition and it was a great starter set with respect to security and privilege identity management.","But if you take a look at the rapid revenue growth that's been done because of our enterprise sales capability which didn't exist. So that's not - that is a complete organic capability that we brought to a great product set.","Secondly, when you are starting to sell to the Fortune 500 and some of the biggest governments in the world, a small company needs a lot of R&D help and our ability to help that team with our own resources that really understand what a large complex customer is expecting, that's all organic, as well.","So when we take a look at the kinds of things we buy, we don't buy things just because we want to get revenue, we buy things because we think we can really add value to their product roadmap and we can add a lot of structure with respect to distribution. So it's a combination of those two things that you put them together you are able to drive the kind of growth we're looking for.","Abhey Lamb","Got it. Thank you. And, Kieran, you gave us a marker for top line for fiscal 2018, how should we think about your OpEx and margins next year. I know you don't want to give guidance right now but any qualitative commentary on how we should think about your priorities for next year would be very helpful?","Kieran McGrath","It is a little premature to say Abhey. Clearly you have to take into account that even though Automic will be contributing to us next year, with all of the purchasing accounting, preferred revenue haircuts and lot of the integration costs that we're going to spend, it is going to be a headwind and probably an impact to us from an overall margin perspective. I think from a profit perspective, it probably won't be from a profit perspective, but from a margin perspective, probably will be.","Abhey Lamb","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits","Hey, guys, a couple of questions. First, just a small clarification but the level of growth that you talked about being the same next year, is that on the USD or currency basis or was it one point of FX headwind total or incremental that you're expecting next year?","Kieran McGrath","I think right now we're thinking it's about one point in aggregate, assuming no change with the rates.","Michael Turits","And you said that you thought that would be the same level of growth on a USD or constant currency basis next year?","Kieran McGrath","On a constant currency basis.","Michael Turits","Okay. And as to the weakness in ES, Mike, one thing that you didn't mention this time that we talked about before is the ability to quote sell outside the renewal cycle. So I know it's tough given especially with the platinum customers that they are so tuned to that, but that's been a long-term project for CA and I was wondering where you are there.","Michael Gregoire","Yes. It\u2019s a cost of work in process, I was disappointed for sure with how the Named Group worked this last quarter. But I was encouraged by the transaction volume that we saw.","Now, when you take a look at that products that we're building in the business model, that not just us, but every software companies moving towards, which is try and buy and land and expand, getting that volume up is a precursor to being able to expand those accounts. So that was a definite bright spot. But I do think we can do better and selling standalone outside of the renewal portfolio. It\u2019s an imperative.","Michael Turits","And last question for Kieran, if I understand right done the Central, but you mentioned in the original press release that Automic was profitable. So it seems like if you do the math, that you're expecting at least for this year more expenses than revenues. Why so much delusions if it was profitable, what are you doing here?","Kieran McGrath","In the short trend here you\u2019ve got a lot of onetime costs that you are taking just related to transaction costs, legal fees, banker fees and then obviously you can't underestimate the deferred revenue hair cut it is all part of the purchasing accounting. So that's the kind of stuff that impacts us.","When you think about what I said actually, what our guidance that when we announced it, we believe that it will be accretive in fiscal '19. So we get there fairly quickly. It\u2019s a good entity, but you have to get through all these purchase accounting issues and the integration costs.","Michael Turits","Thanks, Kieran. Thanks Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. Thank you very much. Yes, first question for Mike. How did security do overall all this quarter and within that what was strong and which product area didn't grow as much as you would have liked, perhaps?","Michael Gregoire","Security did pretty well. Our flagship product continues to impress and continues to do well, which is the Privileged Identity Management product and that was well pretty much across the globe.","Some of the older products that are in the Enhanced category didn't have a whole lot of capacity this particular quarter and that does ebb and flow. This was a quarter where we saw some of that behavior.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. And then just a clarification on M&A getting back to Mark's question. So as you noted Automic was above your guidance of $300 million to $500 million per annum, are you still looking at potential M&A beyond tuck-in acquisition in case an opportunity presents itself or is there any significant M&A off the table over the next several months as you digest Automic? Thanks.","Kieran McGrath","Yeah, we'll continue to look at what's available in the market. We have the capacity and the ability to do multiple acquisitions, whether they be, a handful of small ones or a couple ones the size of Automic.","But as I said earlier, we can't control the closing of these transactions. There are things we obviously would like to buy and sometimes the seller doesn't want to sell. Trust me, there's not a banker that isn't trying to get in my office every week trying to sell something and we listen to a lot of conversations and every now and then one will make sense to us and hit the valuation criteria that we have. It also has the cultural fit as well as the financial performance that we're looking for.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. Mike, can you talk about the Automic integration in terms of the sales and go-to-market strategy on that front in terms of what you're doing I'd say it sounds like they are more there were pretty good presence in Europe? I was just going to wonder how you're going to start integrate that in the broader CA sales force?","Michael Gregoire","We have a methodology for doing that much like what we do with Rally and the first principle is do no harm. And when you look at this particular transaction, the primary focus that they've had has been in Europe and that's was one of the things that was very attractive to us, and they have a relatively small presence here in the US.","I think we'll take our time making sure that we don't lose any of the pipeline that they've built and strength that they built in Europe and we'll initially start augmenting our ability to transact here in the US.","There is also a lot of work we can do with respect to our own products and driving some synergies on our global basis that we want to make sure that we capture and that will happen over the course of the next six months.","We've put a very experienced integration lead. He used to run all of Asia for us and prior to that he's been international in LATHAM, been with the company for an awful long time. And I think that level of experience and that experience in operating in international theaters will help us not make mistakes because, as you think about a company that's primarily based in Europe, does think a little bit differently than a company that's based in the US.","We want to make sure we have the right cultural fit. We want to make sure we take care of customers. We also want to make sure we get the appropriate fit within the overarching context of CA.","Kirk Materne","Okay. And then just one follow-up in terms of M&A in general and little bit more philosophical. But when we listen to you, you guys are obviously very excited about the management rally, there are number of products that I think you guys are very excited about. You mention that you feel like your internal development engines back sort of cranking out really good products and better code than it ever has and it\u2019s really hard arguing that.","On the other hand, you guys continue to talk about sort of buying things and I guess my question, Mike is, how wide do you want this portfolio to get before you lose sort of focus potentially, your name, growth account, it sounds like it\u2019s more segmentation than focus on a product perspective.","But I think we\u2019re also wondering, you have a lot of good things going on, when do sort of those organic growth engines start to stand on their own feet versus having to go out, continue to sort of pull something else on. It seems that you guys have a big enough base of product and especially the Automic amount - sort of let things run by themselves and see how it plays out.","I guess what am I missing there because it seems the internal development engine should be able to take over at some point versus the inorganic acquisition strategy? Thanks.","Michael Gregoire","I agree with you 100%. As you know, it takes time to take a product from scratch, build a product, get it through, you know, system test, unit itself, performance test, integration test, market it, get it out of the two customers. We've been at this for a couple of years and we're just starting to see some of those products come off.","Now if you look at the organic - net organic products that we\u2019re putting to the market, our cloud identity service product is an organic product that just went out this quarter. When you take a look at the intelligent Mainframe intelligent Mainframe automation that\u2019s a completely organic solution.","AXA which is tagged on to - it\u2019s a pure SaaS solution. It is one of our fastest growing products right now. And that's attached to our APM business. We also have the work in the amount of engineering that we've put into our APIM solution. Most of that solution now is organic. So there's a lot that\u2019s been done and I think to your patient, we should impatient, but we're just start to see the fruits of that organic activity now.","Kirk Materne","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Hey, thanks guys for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked, but I wanted to focus on the medium term guidance that you talked about on the Mainframe side. Obviously declining Mainframe revenue business, so you have done a very good job of keeping the margins high there.","But as you continue to have a decline in the revenue, you know, what are the levers that you can pull to keep that margin flat because that's the question I\u2019ve been getting. You think about scale on our software business model on the way up, isn't there kind of forward leverage on the way up, isn't there kind of inverse leverage on the way down. So, how do you manage that because you obviously have done a good job managing that past couple of years, but is that sustainable?","Michael Gregoire","Yes. Thanks, Phil. If you take a look, we've been talking about ES a lot tonight, so let's start with that, because I think that's where the focus needs to be. I don't think you're going to drive Mainframe operating margins up any higher. I think that' the right mix at that particular space. And if you drive those margins up any higher I think you isolate yourself from customers.","When you take a look at the ES business, we did 14% operating margin this last quarter. It's been hovering in and around the teens. We need to get that business in a steady state up into the high-teens and we're investing a lot obviously in marketing, we're investing awful lot in R&D and over time I think you are going to see that portfolio move up into the, you know, the high teens.","Now, the other thing that's working a little bit against us, but that's our job to go figure this out, is everything that we're building is SaaS and it\u2019s ratable. So we don't have the luxury of getting that big up front revenue kick which is usually a sweetener to our operating margins.","On the other hand, we're getting very - a bit much more predictable revenue stream in our SaaS revenue. So between the mix of that business model and our focus on getting those products to market and making sure that those products are sold, I think you'll see the leverage stay with respect to the ES side of the house.","Kieran McGrath","I just add one of the think, I think with our Mainframe I think what we found and discovered over the last year in particular that many of our partnerships, many of the large SI's, give us a lot of flexibility and fungibility in our go to market as well where we can continue to drive our footprint without a very heavy sales and marketing as well.","Michael Gregoire","It\u2019s a great point.","Philip Winslow","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Gregoire for any further remarks.","Michael Gregoire","Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us this evening. I would like to leave you with a few closing thoughts. We're very pleased with our third quarter operating margins, earnings per share and CFFO performance. And as we enter into the fourth fiscal quarter we believe we are on track to achieve our FY '17 objectives.","We continue to make progress across a key number of areas, a lot of them which we've talked about tonight. We will release - we are releasing higher quality products at a faster cadence and we're building integrations across broad product portfolio and we believe this is a significant competitive advantage for CA. With that, I'll thank you and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the conference over to Kelsey Doherty, SVP of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to the team, Mike. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for a Q&A session. These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Tuesday, January 22, 2013 over the telephone and the Internet.

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our fourth quarter Quiet Period begins at the close of business on March 15, 2013.","Before I turn the call over, I'd like to highlight that for modeling purposes, our year-over-year currency headwind on revenue guidance is expected to be roughly 2 points for the full year.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Gregoire","Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. This is the beginning of my third week as CEO of CA Technologies and it's great to be here. While our plan this afternoon is to have Rich take you through the highlights and the financial details of our December quarter, I thought I'd spend a few minutes talking about why I decided to come to CA Technologies and some of my early observations.","When I evaluated taking the CEO position of CA, I analyzed whether CA had the business fundamentals necessary to be a successful company. My conclusion and the driving force of why I accepted the CEO position was that CA had 3 core business fundamentals that provide the company with a clear advantage.","First, addressable market. The total addressable market is large enough and growing fast enough to support our aspirations. It is clear that the value in the IT market is moving up the stack to management automation and security. When I look at CA and the size of the market it currently serves, as well as the changes to the technical landscape going forward, I think we have an opportunity to be the leader in a market that industry analysts expect to be more than $75 billion. Second, intellectual property. CA knows more about managing heterogeneous IT environments, applications, data and identities than any other company. We have more than 6,000 engineers on a global basis with more than $600 million invested per year in organic innovation. This, when pointed in the right direction, is a formidable, competitive differentiator. We have more than 700 patents and close to another 800 under review. By the way, much of this IP is focused on where the market is going and is of the utmost relevance. And we have key positions in markets like Mainframe; Application and Network Performance management; Identity and Access Management; Project and Portfolio and Service Management, as well as Service Virtualization.","Third, distribution. To get all of that technology to market, CA has a global distribution network that is difficult to replicate and I believe can be a big differentiator for the company. CA has relationships with the largest companies in the world. With the right focus on innovation and new markets, we can really increase our growth trajectory in our Enterprise Solutions business.","This brings me to 3 early observations. First, we need to accelerate our innovation curve. The markets we play in are moving very quickly. We must differentiate in everything we do. If we do not differentiate, we will become commoditized and we will not be able to grow. Profitable growth in carefully chosen markets is a clear priority for us.","Second, I believe there's room for improvement in our cost of sales, our cadence for getting things done and the intensity in which we go after our objectives. We have a strong competency in selling large, complex enterprise deals but we do not move the needle quickly enough in some of the new product offerings. We need to ensure that we use our full go-to-market capabilities efficiently to gain significant market share in the key new technology domains. This is not as much about how we interface with the customer but how we interface internally before we reach a customer. We need to be crisp in product management, product marketing and services to make sure our offerings are compelling.","Finally, we have a great balance sheet and we need to use it prudently and as a competitive differentiator by making smart investments. This will include acquisitions but it's impossible to do smart acquisitions unless we have a handle on our innovation posture and our go-to-market model. Just buying a company for revenue and hoping we can operate it more efficiently is a low probability for value creation in today's day and age.","Having known many of you in my previous role, I'm sure that you're trying to calculate what all this means to our financial results. Here's what I can tell you today. Rich will reiterate guidance for the balance of fiscal 2013 and the Board of Directors and the executive management team, including myself, remain committed to the capital allocation program we put in place a year ago, including that $1 per share annual dividend. Beyond that, we're not ready to get specific and like any new CEO, I'm going to do a detailed diagnostic of where we are, compare that where we want to be and lay out a strategic and financial plan of how to get there. While I don't yet have all of the answers, I do have a process to challenge what we do, why we do it and the cost to get it done. At the end of the day, I want to be part of the team that wins and to do that, we need to focus on innovation and execution.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide details of the quarter and guidance. Thank you.","Richard J. Beckert","Thank you, Mike, and let me add my welcome. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that growth rates are year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise indicated. In addition, last year's third quarter results were positively affected by our receipt of a single license payment related to a litigation settlement with a software company. This created a tough compare for our December quarter including a revenue of $39 million reported last year in our Mainframe Solutions segment and in the software fees and other line on the P&L; approximately 2 points of GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin; GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; GAAP and non-GAAP earnings-per-share of $0.05; and cash flow of $39 million.","Moving to our December quarter results. Some Q4 renewals came in earlier than we had anticipated with several deals closing in Q3 that we originally expected in Q4. While this timing difference has little impact on the company's annual results, it gave us a tailwind during the quarter particularly in CFFO. More importantly, the metrics around our Q3 renewals were good. Duration was down, the renewal yield came in where we would expected, in the low 90% range, and we did a good job selling new products with these renewals, resulting in a strong attach rate slightly above our historical average. The renewal is a positive event for CA and we look forward to these transactions as an opportunity to engage with customers and sell new products. We continue to expect FY '13 renewals to be down approximately 10% as compared to FY '12 and to grow next year. Given the shift between Q3 and Q4, we now expect our Q4 renewals to be down mid-single-digits year-over-year.","Underlying our performance, new product and capacity sales were down just over 10% year-over-year or just under 5% excluding last year's single license payment. While better than the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2013, sequentially we saw a large increase in the number of transactions closed with the large new enterprise customers. We still are not where we want to be. ITKO grew new product sales more than 50%; Nimsoft grew more than 80%; and Infrastructure Management grew more than 30%, driven in part by our newly introduced IM 2.0 solutions. This was offset by new product sales declines in some of our a large core product categories. This is the challenge and the opportunity of a large, mature software business, managing the product life cycle and customer relationship while driving for growth. We need to do a better job at this process and a better job of accelerating our new product sales in all of our go-to-market segments.","Total revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, down 4% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This includes a $12 million headwind for foreign exchange rates. Last year, single license payment contributed 3 points to this decline in revenue. In Mainframe Solutions, revenue was $622 million, down 8% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Excluding the single license payment, Mainframe revenue was down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported.","Turning to Enterprise Solutions, revenue was $476 million, flat in constant currency and as reported. Services revenue was $97 million, down 5% in constant currency and 6% as reported. Within new product and capacity sales, the Mainframe results are highly correlated to the underlying renewal portfolio. Though we had a slight increase in overall renewals this quarter, Enterprise Solution renewals were up while Mainframe renewals were down. This contributed to a decline in just over 15% in Mainframe capacity. We also saw a decline in Mainframe new product sales of just under 50%, with approximately 40 points of this decline coming from the compare of last year's single license payment. Enterprise Solutions new product sales were flat. New Services engagements were up 15%.","Looking at revenue backlog, current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and as reported. Total revenue backlog was $7.5 billion, down 8% in constant currency and 7% as reported. Backlog continues to be affected by a weaker first half sales performance as well as the headwind created by contracts burning off the balance sheet in anticipation of an increase in our 2014 renewals. From our non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $428 million, down 9% in constant currency and 10% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Operating margin for Mainframe was 60%. Operating margin for Enterprise Solutions was 11%. Finally, operating margin for Services were 4%.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Excluding the single license payment, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 7% in constant currency and 5% as reported. For the third quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $566 million, up 42% in constant currency and 43% as reported. The increase was primarily due to a $178 million increase in cash collections which includes an increase in single installment payments of $150 million. Q3 single installment payments totaled $257 million compared to $107 million in the prior-year period and included a payment of more than $100 million remitted by a customer that has typically paid upfront.","Total billings backlog $4.3 billion was down 14% in constant currency and 13% as reported. Billings backlog was affected by sales performance in the first half of the year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares for $75 million. We are authorized to repurchase an additional $579 million of common stock through fiscal 2014.","Moving to third quarter GAAP results. Third quarter GAAP operating margin was 31%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $370 million, down 10% in constant currency and as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.55, up 4% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was 30% compared to 35% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012.","Now, let me turn to guidance. While we are not providing FY '14 guidance at this time, remember that new product sales came in below our expectation this year. Given our ratable model, this will cause a headwind to revenue growth over the next 12 months. In addition, although renewals are expected to increase next year, the currently projected composition is heavily back end-weighted.","Regarding guidance for FY '13, as has been our practice, guidance is based upon the exchange rate of the last day of the preceding quarter, or for this quarter, December 31, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.","Our reaffirmed guidance is the following: total revenue is expected to be negative 3% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.58 billion to $4.67 billion. A point of this year-over-year decline in revenue is attributable to the single license payment. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.44. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 8% to 12%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2 to $2.08. Cash flow from operations in constant currency is expected to be in the range of negative 8% to negative 4%. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.39 billion to $1.45 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions.","Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to come in closer to the high end of the 30% to 31% we provided at the outset of the year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 449 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 457 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% for fiscal year 2013.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Kelsey and we will take your questions.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you, Rich. As the operator is polling for questions, I would like to inform you that CA Technologies is presenting at the Oppenheimer London Investor Conference on Wednesday, February 6; the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, February 26; and the Raymond James 34th Annual Institutional Investors Conference on Monday, March 5 in Orlando Florida.","In the interest of time, please limit yourselves to 2 questions.","Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First of all, welcome aboard, Mike. Great to see you back at the helm of an actually much larger company. Great to have you aboard. My first question is for Rich, though. Rich, when a renewal comes up, on average, do you sign a deal at the same annual rate, a lower annual rate or a higher annual rate than the original deal or previous deal? And this would include -- I'm thinking, when including the renewal, any upsell or cross-sell and any price change, any benefit or hit you get from those things. And then the reason why I'm asking this question, as you probably know, is I get asked it a lot. And most of your business, at least for now, is tied to renewals. Given some of the things that Mike said, hopefully we'll see some other, I guess, sources of business. But can you answer that? And if you can give us a percent, I mean, if a renewal comes in, you sign a new deal, even with new business associated with that renewal, is it over 100, is it 103%, 105% or is it 98%? Can you give us any kind of sense of that?","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. So we actually look at, as you know, multiple metrics and the metric you're really referring to is daily revenue. And if you look at it, we almost always have our transactions, the daily revenue actually goes up from transaction to transaction, and that is part of the metrics that we look at. So as you know, people talk about renewals, and that's only the piece that is renewing of products. We have -- when we talked about them in my prepared remarks, we talked about the attach rate. The attach rate is incremental new products that we've put it on top of the renewal and they almost always win, combined at a higher percent. And yes, I know the percent, John, but I will not be sharing that publicly.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, Rich, that's really helpful, though, just knowing that it's greater than 100%, anyway, because, I mean, you're trading at a 4% dividend yield and a 14% trailing 12-month free cash flow, according to our calculations. If it's greater than 100%, then we should -- at least it has been, we shouldn't be worried about a secular decline here. So that's really helpful. I guess my second quick question here for Mike. Mike, I realize you've only been there a few weeks but you still gave us some ideas on the areas you're going to be focused. Can you tell us when you might have some more granularity or more detail on how you're going to focus on those areas?","Michael Gregoire","We do it all day, every day. From the minute I got here, I've been going through a theme of what does a modern software company look like and what are the things that we need to focus on. I spent 4 months interviewing with the Board. They were extraordinarily helpful in giving me access to the strategy department and talking to Rich to get a crisp understanding of the financials. So I felt when I got here the first day that I was prepared. And while I did have trouble finding the copy machine, I did have an idea of the things that the company needs to do to really brush up against its potential. Now, I need to go challenge those assumptions with the team and it's going to take me pretty much until the end of the first -- or at the end of this quarter to do that. We've got a big conference at CA World. That's where we're going to talk a lot about products. As you know, from my past, I'm a big product guy and I really believe in strong organic development. These are themes that I think are important to CA and you should see us moving the company in that direction relatively quickly.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So similar question as far as where you might go. First of all, you come from a SaaS company and this is a company that has some SaaS and cloud offerings, but what are your thoughts about the potential for this company to be doing a lot more on that business model?","Michael Gregoire","That's a great question and I also like the way that you asked it. It's not just a technology play, it's a model play, which means it affects marketing, affects sales, it affects services, it effects partner channels. And coming from a SaaS company, we went through all of the growing pains of figuring out those models over the 8 years I was at Taleo. When I take a look at CA, they started that evolution, but there's things that I think I can bring to the table here that will accelerate that evolution so that we can get there faster with stronger products, with quicker releases and also have a customer relationship that is based upon the relationship a company has with a SaaS company, which is somewhat different than a perpetual license company. So I think that the potential for these solutions are very appropriate as the market starts to morph from mainframes to distributed to cloud. What I said in my prepared remarks is important, I hope everyone caught that, is this company has 700 patents and another 800 under review. When I did a review of what those patents are, they are the kinds of things that cloud companies need. They are based in security, application development, distributing the heterogeneous management of operating systems and applications. These patents, the -- what is extraordinarily important, what SaaS is, is the how. So we need to not only understand how to do SaaS ourselves by how are SaaS companies managing their infrastructure. I don't know of another company that has done as much heterogeneous data management, operating system management and security as CA. So I'm very excited by the intellectual knowledge that this company has and to the extent that we can put that into a platform that is cloud-based so that we can manage cloud platforms, I think that gives companies a great opportunity to manage private clouds, it gives them an opportunity to participate in public clouds, it also gives them an opportunity to integrate their heterogenous networks that are not going to go away in the short-term. So it's a pretty exciting play from a technologist's point of view and it's also a very exciting play from a business model point of view.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Rich, I got a question for you. You mentioned what sounded like just -- I'm trying to put some parameters or some caution around expectations for fiscal '14. Should we be thinking of fiscal '14 given those, I guess, headwind from lower new product sales in '13, should we be thinking about it as a growth year, or is it more of a neutral year as far as sales and revenues and bookings?","Richard J. Beckert","Well, as you know, we're not going to give FY '14 guidance right now but what we were trying to put color on is, clearly, you have somewhat of a headwind when you look at what we've done year-to-date in the large new. And then the second part of that is the renewals which we will have year-over-year will be up, they're back half-loaded, and with the ratable nature of the model, that revenue comes on the back half of the year. So we're just trying to give people a view there.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just actually a follow-up on that last one, Rich. On the back end-loaded nature of the renewal portfolio and fiscal '14, that strikes me as something new, at least in terms of what we were thinking. And I'm wondering, does that have anything to do with the way you pulled contracts into this year, and did we see some movement out of '14 into '13?","Richard J. Beckert","No. There's no -- we didn't pull any in, and when we do, we actually let you guys know when we do. Our contracts are historically always back half-loaded. The exceptions are maybe a large outsource or two that sometimes happen, but usually, the first quarter is the lightest and the fourth quarter is always the heaviest. Next year, just the nature of it, you'd have even more that are more back half than even this year. And as far as this year goes, Walter, we really saw the track the way we thought. The difference is you heard a little bit about some Q4s coming into Q3. We're not really looking to smooth things out such that -- we want it to be a good deal for both us and the customers. If we have to bring things too far forward then we feel we don't get the right metrics that we want.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then just on the product side. I saw the commentary on some of the larger quarters, saw declines. And I'm wondering if you could just go into more details in terms of which areas of the core business on ES side that you saw declines there?","Richard J. Beckert","I think what we saw, specifically, really, APM had a lighter quarter. In the first part of next year, you'll see some product announcements. We think we'll get that positive momentum. They'll talk about those at CA World. Overall, though, we actually have seen some pretty strong growth out of Nimsoft and ITKO. They all had double-digit growth in international, across the board. And the other thing, you've heard us talk about the large new was kind of slow to start. It actually had a fairly strong quarter. Not to say that 1 point makes a line, so I don't want people to get ahead of themselves. But we did see positive momentum in the U.K., France and Germany. And so that was a positive for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho Security.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","You mentioned in your comments that you need to accelerate innovation curve and also re-traded commitment to the capital allocation. I know you don't want to go into too many details but qualitatively or at a high-level, how should we think about your ability to fund those investments that are needed to innovate? And culturally, as you kind of did your due diligence in CA, how well-positioned do you think is CA as an organization to accelerate the innovation curve?","Michael Gregoire","Two things. First of all, we spend a lot of money on engineering and we have a lot of people doing it. So I would be reticent to want to up that at a material fashion in any way, shape or form until I was convinced and the management team was convinced that we were using the resources that we currently spend as wisely as possible. We spend $600 million a year on R&D and I think that we need to make sure that, that spend is done wisely, in the right areas, on the right technologies and it's done to add value to our current customers, as well as get net new customers. So I'm more focused on what we do with what we have, and making sure that, that is lean and it is innovative and it is an area that the management team believes is also about right size for a company with our aspirations. Culturally, I think it is still to be determined but my early initial view is this is a company that wants to play. I think that they have done a lot of acquisitions where they haven't been able to add core engineering to those acquisitions. I think that the tapestry of applications they have needs to be welded together. The concept of a platform in which to build on, especially get into the cloud, excites a lot of the engineers in the company. And the engineers I've met, I think they want to do innovative, creative things. So my initial impression is that we do have talent that can make that happen. On the flip side, I don't think it's sufficient. I think we have holes in our product marketing, product strategy and product management. I'm not convinced that they work as closely together as they need to, to build the kind of products that customers are looking for, especially cloud-oriented customers. Cloud-oriented customers are getting 2 to 4 releases of extremely high quality code a year. We need to be able to operate at that cadence and we need to make sure that those products do what they're supposed to do all day, every day. And when I talk to the team, they want to aspire to get into that level of sophistication and that level of engineering talent.","Operator","The next question is from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Mike, welcome as well. You've somewhat answered this, I think, in the last question, but, I guess, to ask it a bit more specifically, how would you assess CA's Enterprise Solutions, the technology assets and end product portfolio? And I guess, also just wondering if we could potentially see some divestitures going forward or if you are reasonably happy with the portfolio as it stands today?","Michael Gregoire","I think it's too early to tell. I had my first customer meeting last night where I met with 3 customers and I'm doing a tour of offices, meeting people, primarily sales professionals and engineers as well as meeting customers. I'm trying to listen to how they view the company and how they use the products. So it's a little too early to tell but, at the end of the day, we need to put products in the market that are of the highest quality and are differentiated. And that's where this theme of innovation comes into play. I think we are at a very interesting time in the technology market segment. I think everything is up for grabs and that means any incumbent, including us, has got to be a lot more careful and a lot more thoughtful about the products that they put into the market and how those products are going to be used.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then Rich, just a follow-on, on Walter's question and the fiscal '14 renewal portfolio being positive but fairly heavily back-end loaded. Just directionally speaking, I'm just wondering whether that might indicate that the renewal portfolio is expected to be down on a year-over-year basis in the first half or not necessarily?","Richard J. Beckert","As you know, we don't give first half, second half. Overall, as we said earlier, it'll be up next year, double digit.","Operator","Our next question is from Ernie (sic) [Aaron] Schwartz of Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Mike, I know you've sort of touched on this a little bit but if you looked at this opportunity, it sounds like from what you said, you have a lot of access to the company before you came on board, but do you have a predisposition to run the company one way or the other? And so what I'm getting at is there have been some decisions made, a lot of work done in the background with sales segmentation and also the capital allocation planning. I'm just sort of wondering as you think about yourself as a manager, sort of what areas would you look to sort of really put your finger prints on initially? It sounds like you're weighted a little bit more towards the product side, marketing side, but I just kind of wanted to get your views on that.","Michael Gregoire","Well, as you know, you have to get it all right. But to me, it starts with the products. If we don't get the products right, it's really hard to get the marketing right and it's very difficult to sell if the products aren't exactly what the market needs. When I take a look at the company, once again, it has a big spend on R&D, and I think job 1 is to make sure that, that R&D spend is wise. I don't think we can do acquisitions well if we don't have our house clean in R&D world. I don't think that we can do great organic engineering if we don't have a strategy around the products that we need and what the markets we should be in. Coupled with that, it makes it really difficult on the sales team if we are making changes all the time, not understanding who we're trying to sell to, why we're trying to sell to those particular people and having the rest of the company support it. So it isn't about one particular thing. You don't do things right some of the times, you do things right all the time. We need to do that across the board. From the minute we decide that we're going to build a product, we should know the market that we're going to be in, we should know what that product is supposed to do and we should have a vision for the life of that product over multiple quarters. I think we get a little too tactical sometimes based on the product roadmaps I've seen and knowing the company for several years. This is an area where I think if we get the product oriented right, the sales segmentation will follow and we have to wrap that around the rest of the company, supporting both the products and the sales process. So I don't look at it as any one part more important than the other. My primary focus right now is in the products and in the sales. Is that helpful?","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It is. And I guess a follow-up, and maybe it's too early for an answer on this, but something that I find myself having difficulties with sometimes and I get the question a lot, is that CA has a lot of different products in a lot of different areas. I mean, do you think there are too many products?","Michael Gregoire","I don't know the answer to that question. I've been working with the teams here and they're trying to get me up to speed. I know the ones that I've used in the past and I know the ones that are very popular but they do have an awful lot products. And I don't think it's fair to the team, I don't think it's fair to our customers not to have a thorough look at each and every product and understand how it fits within the tapestry of what CA really needs to become, which is a very strong software company that does great engineering and has fantastic customer relationships.","Operator","Our next question from Harry Hayer [ph] of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","I'm actually calling on behalf of Phil Winslow here at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. I was hoping you could actually just discuss margins in the Mainframe and Distributor business, and, also, where do you think margins are headed in the near, medium- and long-term?","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. This is a Rich. So as you know, this quarter, the mainframe margin came in at 60% after a very difficult compare from last year. Just to remind everyone, we had a $39 million one-time event of which most of that fell to the bottom line. So there's 2 points inside of that in the mainframe space. So we felt that getting to 60%, that's about where we expected it to be over time. We are not looking to expand those margins as we talked in the past. There's a right kind of balance, kind of a lot of what Mike just talked about, the balance between how much you need to invest in order to keep that platform viable and how much we want to bring back in. On the ES side, we had an 11% margin that was 2 points of that, though. People should realize, it was impacted by some severance activity. So really, we actually saw expansion in the ES margin as well if you look at that year-over-year. So in the quarter, that kind of expansion, we felt pretty good about. And as we said earlier, we're not really going to talk about FY '14 and beyond expansion.","Operator","Our next question is from Kirk Materne of Evercore Partners.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just, Mike, I wanted to -- well, first of all, I should say this is Matt Williams in for Kirk. But Mike, I just wanted to say welcome. And most of the questions have already been answered but I did -- and maybe Rich, maybe you can speak to this a little bit since you've been there obviously longer than Mike has, but with some of the sales changes that have gone into effect over the last 12 months or so, how is that trending or are you starting to see some benefits from some of those changes? And I guess, Mike, to the extent you've had a chance to really sort of dig into that, realizing that it's early, does that seem like it's headed down the right path? Is that sort of the direction you envision that going? And I'll leave at that.","Richard J. Beckert","So this is Rich. So we would say this quarter, the large new segment we talked a lot, as you know, over the last few quarters on our segmentation, we saw a pretty strong growth in that segment. As I said, Europe had good quarter, the strongest they've had in multiple quarters. The large new segment grew double digit, in all segments sequentially, it did well. We are seeing Q4 and Q1 pipelines start to build. So not to say that we're going to call victory after one quarter of success but what we are seeing is people are getting out to see customers going earlier in the quarter to get a transaction working. We actually saw a closure in the early part of the -- which is different than the first two quarters where we saw some transactions fall out of the quarter. We actually saw them close earlier in the quarter, which allowed us to get some more incremental business in the quarter. So the traction is there. I think what we'll see over time will really tell how much expansion we can get out of that business.","Michael Gregoire","To follow-up, from my perspective, the segmentation strategy is a wise strategy. We basically do 2 things. We have a name-based account model which is a high-touch bespoked process for selling very complex large transactions. We also have a lot of products that customers don't have and we also have a lot of products we'd like to sell to net new customers. The way we go after that is under review. I think that there's opportunities to make it more effective and more efficient and I also think that the -- in order for a sales professional to be predictably successful in our company, we need more marketing support. We have less than sophisticated ways of building pipeline. We do it in a relatively expensive way. I think there's some ideas that we can bring from the SaaS world on how to do pipeline development that is a little bit more impactful and it puts the sales professional in front of a customer that is much more prepared to buy and our products are targeted at a customer need a little bit in a more sophisticated way. So I've spent a number of hours with the sales team here already, just walking through experiences and territory models, walking through experiences in pipeline development and we are playing with a few different ideas but I want to be careful here. The salesforce here is a very talented salesforce. They understand this product and they understand these customers very, very well. It would be somewhat reckless to get in the way of some of those transactions and the things that, that sales team needs to do to make those transactions happen. So this is an area where I think they're pointed in the right direction. I'd like to get a little bit more sophistication in the marketing and the pipeline development and I'd like to make sure that the people that are supporting the sales organizations are actually supporting the sales organizations. There are a lot of people in this organization that don't carry direct quota and I'd like to work with the team to find out if we can get them into quota-carrying roles and the accountability is very clear for all of us to see. Is that helpful?","Operator","The next question is from Kevin Buttigieg of Longbow Research.","Kevin M. Buttigieg - Longbow Research LLC","I'll cut you some slack now, Mike, and just ask Rich a couple of questions. Rich, what were the factors you think driving the early renewals this period? I know that last quarter, in the second quarter, they came in lower than what you guys had been looking for. Is it an indication of a better economic environment as far as you're concerned? I know you mentioned possibly sales for restructuring, maybe bringing some transactions to the forefront that, otherwise, might have been lost. And just secondarily, then, IBM reported a very large MIPS shipment number this period. I know your business is not directly correlated with that but do you or when do you expect that you might see some follow-through in terms of your mainframe capacity business?","Richard J. Beckert","Well, first, to answer the first part, two things. I do think we're doing a better job in the large new, getting out to the customers a little earlier in this cycle and getting to the point where the negotiations start because they were elongated before and they were falling out of the quarter. Those negotiations happen sooner in the quarter and we actually had success. The fact, though, that for most companies, it was a fiscal year end in the quarter, I think they had their own impending event as to why, budget-related, that they wanted to drive some of those to closure. What we did see though, around the world, was an uptick in that entire segment. So that was a positive. As I said earlier, we saw ITKO is an example where we have been seeding the market for the last few quarters. We actually saw some customers come back around with larger transactions which is what we have anticipated. So we're seeing good traction at ITKO. IM 2.0, it's really now been out in the market long enough. Our reps understand that product now and you're really seeing that starting to close as well. The renewals, although we had some come in sooner, so Q4 into Q3, the attach rate there was a little bit higher than the normal average. So that was also a positive. Answering your question on the IBM mainframe, anytime they put new MIPS into the marketplace, it always benefits CA. The fact that they're putting their new box out, it helps the overall cost and price performance of the platform which we participate in. The fact that they put a lot of new MIPS out in Linux is an opportunity for us because we're really the only other vendor that goes across both Mainframe and Linux. So we see that as a future opportunity. As you look out over time, we do have products that today are there and so as more and more customers take that, that gives us upside to the Mainframe business. Although you might see that just so people understand, those transactions will probably be recorded in the Enterprise Solutions because it is Linux but it is the Mainframe platform that will support that.","Michael Gregoire","In closing, first, I want to thank all of the employees of CA that has given me such a gracious welcome here. We had one question on culture and I got tell you, this is a company that I feel wants to play to win and the vibe that I've had here in the last 3 weeks has just been absolutely fantastic. What all of our investors should expect from me and from CA is, first of all, to be thoughtful. I am not, in any way, shape or form planning on doing anything that isn't thoughtful. We have a great team, the amount of data that this company has on why they do things is astounding. There's no reason why we can't make decisions that are very databased and very thoughtful.","I'm going to be focusing on 3 things. Innovation, this is going to lead to an innovative company that has the ability and the confidence to do organic growth. I just don't think that we will brush up against our potential if we don't have the confidence to bring meaningful products to the market that we build ourselves or when we buy companies that we can add engineering based on our experiences in the market. Execution, getting the right people, doing the right things at the right time at the right cost structure. This is an ongoing thing. It should probably be part of our DNA and I'd like to make it part of our DNA as we continue to grow with the company. And then lastly is improving velocity. This is a company that has an opportunity to pick up their cadence and move at a faster pace. They have the desire to do it and they're just looking for an impetus to make that happen and I think the management team is willing to be that impetus as we start making this company roll out innovative products and really focusing on the customer relationships with the right cost structure.","So with that, I'm going to let you go on the call here. Thank you very much for your time, and look forward to seeing you out in the field once I get up to speed on all things CA related. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Traci Tsuchiguchi","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies second quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings call.","Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks and then we will open the call up for Q&A session. These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Wednesday, October 21, over the telephone and the Internet.","The information shared in this call is effective as of today\u2019s date and will not be updated.

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our second quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on December 15, 2015. Let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Gregoire","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in the second quarter reflects the continued improvements we are making in both our product and our sales execution.","In particular, I\u2019m excited about new sales, an indicator of the great traction our solutions are experiencing. Our overall second quarter total new sales were up more than 40% year-over-year.","In the quarter, a greater portion of our new sales bookings were recognized ratably, compared to our historical trends. Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the high-20s year-over-year. Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year.","In the second quarter, we closed the large system integrator renewal that was initially expected to transact in the second half of our fiscal year. The accelerated time to close this renewal was at their request and is a reflection of CA\u2019s strategic importance to the system integrator and its customers. We are very pleased with the outcome of this large renewal, which had a strong yield and a healthy new sales attach rate.","Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the high-90s. This is the best it\u2019s been in recent history. This is a testament to our pricing discipline and the ability of our sales teams to execute deals that realize the value of our solutions.","In today\u2019s application economy, a lot of mission critical data still resides in the mainframe. This is particularly true of the big players, the Fortune 500. As such, it should not be a surprise that there will be quarters in which capacity buys are particularly strong, as was the case in Q2.","Excluding the large system integrator, our renewal yield would have been in the low-90s. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-twenties range, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 36% in the quarter, which was consistent with our expectation and commentary on our fiscal Q1 earnings call. Recall that the full percentage point impact on operating margin guidance for FY 2016 was expected to be realized in our fiscal Q2. This is due to the expenses related to the Rally acquisition and realignment costs.","Our second quarter results were clearly a big step in the right direction, but there is still work to be done. While we are on track for the second half of our fiscal year, it is important to note that we expect it to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter.","That said, I am increasingly confident that our results will reflect our work to deliver innovative solutions that truly solve customers\u2019 problems. Put simply, CA enables enterprises to capitalize the opportunities created by the application economy. In fact, once again, Gartner has rated CA Technologies with an overall \u201cPositive\u201d rating in its latest August 2015 Vendor Rating report.","We remain focused on product quality and execution. Our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer are working in lockstep to ensure continuous improvement on our near- and mid-term product execution, while driving us towards our longer-term Horizon 2, Horizon 3 technology leadership opportunities.","Our strategy continues to stress organic innovation, complemented by targeted, strategic investments that are within one standard deviation of our core. A great example of this is our acquisition of Rally, a leader in the fast growing Agile application life cycle management software market which closed on July 8th.","The rationale for this acquisition was three-fold: First, Rally's products and services are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solutions and strengthens CA's DevOps leadership.","Two, there is ample opportunity to cross-sell given the limited customer overlap. And third, the opportunity to accelerate Agile methodology internally at CA to drive improving velocity of our high quality solutions. Three and a half months into the acquisition, I am very pleased to report that Rally is performing well. In many ways it is doing better than our expectations.","For example, total paid seats under contract at the end of Q2 grew in the high 20% range year-over-year. We defined a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. Q2 saw a particularly large upgrade order from a global leader in networking routers and switches. This customer exemplifies Rally's successful land and expand strategy.","Rally is able to prove strategic value in a small initial engagement and then grow exponentially within the customer. We are encouraged by the opportunity to further engage our customers around Agile.","In terms of integration, just last month we GAed our first release of a bidirectionally integrated combined Rally in CA PPM solutions. This allows customers to combine planning and execution, track progress in real-time and eliminate the need for point to point integrations.","It creates a close loop system that vastly accelerates and improves the decision making process. This level of integration is something with which point solution providers simply cannot compete.","The broad value proposition that we offer in Rally combined with CA PPM and DevOps tools like Service Virtualization and Release Automation, enable organizational transformation rather than small, disparate design teams functioning in silos.","In fact, we often do not compete against point solutions in head-to-head evaluations. Rather, our solutions are deployed as a result of an enterprise decision to scale Agile methodologies across a number, sometimes hundreds, of development groups. Combined with CA\u2019s global enterprise engagement and support model, this puts us in a different class of solutions providers.","Now I\u2019d like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. Our award-winning Clarity PPM platform, which has been one of the cornerstones of our Enterprise Solutions business, grew new sales over 70% year-over year as reported.","With the releases of 14.2 in April and 14.3 last month, customers can now glean powerful management insights from their data, enabling them to view their product portfolios and investments across all platforms, including tablets and mobile.","We are becoming increasingly confident in our ability to outpace the market. We believe we have the right products at the right time with a more seasoned sales force executing multiple six figure deals across geographies.","We are particularly pleased with a major win at a large Canadian bank that was originally an on-premise customer using Clarity PPM for financial reporting. This transaction dramatically expands CA\u2019s engagement as it migrates to our on-demand platform and standardizes its financial reporting, project management, and time tracking. This win displaced both the customer\u2019s internal systems resources as well as CA\u2019s competitors.","Within DevOps, API Management continues to grow at a rapid clip, with new sales up in the high-30s year-over-year as reported. We are a leader in this secular growth space. We are a leader in the secular growth space. We are in a unique position to provide API Management Solutions at scale with a requisite security features.","CA's API Management products enable customers to manage and protect the ever-growing volumes of data traversing across rapidly expanding digital platforms. Our solutions are recognized by both industry pundits and customers.","Our leadership in this space is evidenced by a major win at a large U.S.-based auto manufacturer. This engagement represents an enterprise-wide expansion of our relationship and includes mainframe, API management, and DevOps.","Importantly, it also establishes an initial footprint for CA into its finance division. We also secured a win at an American media company that provides local weather forecasts globally. This win was a competitive displacement, where CA API Management was chosen due to its superior performance and scalability.","UIM, which is foundational to our DevOps portfolio, is a great example of Agile methodology deployment within CA. In fact, UIM was the first group within CA to adopt Rally and was its internal lighthouse sponsor. The resulting improvements with regard to product quality and velocity are notable.","In the quarter, UIM had a major win with a large cloud Infrastructure as a Service company who chose CA\u2019s UIM tool over its parent company\u2019s alternative offering. Another notable deal was a competitive win at a leading athletic apparel company that is embracing the application economy to transform into a lifestyle brand with a leading digital health platform. CA was chosen over a number of competitors for our ability to offer an enterprise-wide global solutions and services view.","Next month, at CA World in Las Vegas, you can expect to see net new product launches, some of which reflect our unique opportunity to bridge between distributed cloud and mainframe.","You will see our heightened emphasis on Agile and better appreciate how CA is in a unique position to benefit as large enterprise data center management strategies evolve to hybrid cloud environments.","Given CA's rich heritage as a trusted vendor to large enterprises running mission critical workloads and providing support around the globe, we have a coveted seat at the table. This point is particularly salient when it comes to the fragmented security space.","Our security business had a very strong second quarter with new sales up over 60% year-over-year as reported. Results were positively impacted by the large system integrator renewal where CA security footprint has expanded considerably. Even outside this large renewal we closed multiple six figure transactions across a number of verticals including healthcare, automotive, technology, and government.","In addition to the technology and expanded product portfolio breadth our recent acquisitions provide, they are also improving our visibility with customers who are increasingly viewing CA as a large committed vendor with staying power in this critically important yet still incredibly fragmented space.","We are very excited about our most recent acquisition, Xceedium, which extends our PIM, or Privileged Identity Management offering. Xceedium positions us well in the rapidly growing network security market as large enterprises have become increasingly aware and less tolerant of dangerous and often very public intra-organizational security breaches. In fact, it appears to have also created a halo effect, lifting sales of existing PIM products as customers embrace our PIM roadmap.","Now, turning to sales execution, I am pleased to report that our decision to separate Platinum accounts from Named and Growth accounts, and to specialize sales by product discipline, continues to yield positive results.","Globally, in the second quarter, our sales teams improved win rates, decreased average sales cycles, improved pipeline conversion rates, and increased average deal sizes. This speaks to the team\u2019s improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity.","In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, our combined Named and Growth sales teams delivered strong, broad-based results. While two quarters do not make a trend, we do expect the second half of the year to be weighted towards the fourth quarter, I am convinced that our sales execution strategy is on the right track.","I invite you to come and see the progress we are making in terms of sales execution, product development and marketing strategy next month in Las Vegas. Please join us at CA World to see our product innovation first hand and hear why customers are embracing CA Solutions to differentiate and accelerate their products and processes in order to thrive in the emerging application economy. Our Financial Analyst track will take place on November 18th at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. We hope to see you there.","In aggregate, I am pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with regard to new sales, which reflects the success our solutions are seeing in the market. That said, we recognize there is still work to do in order to drive the kind of growth that CA has the potential to achieve.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you.","Rich Beckert","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I\u2019m going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","As many of you are aware, overall, the dollar continued to strengthen, which negatively impacts our results and our guidance. Our Q2 total revenue was $1.005 billion and was down 1%. The increasing mix of new sales going ratable compared to up-front, which we experienced in Q1 and again in Q2, has impacted reported quarterly revenue by approximately 1 point per quarter. If this trend persists, it will continue to be a headwind to reported revenue.","Enterprise Solutions increased 3%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. Q2 renewals more than doubled year-over-year both in constant currency and as reported.","Excluding the large system integrator transaction, Q2 renewals would have been up in the low-teens and in the high-single digits as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year changes in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.","Q2 total new product and capacity sales were up nearly 50% and over 40% as reported. This was due in part to the large system integrator renewal previously mentioned and the contribution from acquisitions, with Rally as the most meaningful.","As Mike indicated, excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-twenties, high teens as reported, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year, high single-digits as reported.","Excluding the large system integrator renewal and excluding acquisitions, total organic new sales were up in the high-teens in constant currency and low teens as reported.","As Mike mentioned, Rally\u2019s total paid seats under contract increased in the high 20% range year-over-year.","We disclose this metric because we thought it would be helpful to show how well this acquisition is progressing. However, we do not intend to provide Rally\u2019s seat growth metric indefinitely. This is because in very large transactions, such as the one signed in the second quarter, as well as those we believe we can execute over time with our Platinum accounts, paid seat growth may not be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth.","Renewal yield for the quarter was in the high-90% range. This is the highest it\u2019s been in recent history, and was driven by the large system integrator. This renewal had a positive impact across both our Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions businesses.","Excluding this one transaction, our renewal yield was in the low-90s. The large system integrator renewed for a duration longer than our forecast. As such, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the mid-20s year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up approximately 20% as reported.","Excluding the large system integrator renewal, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the low-single digits, and down in the low-single digits, as reported.","Turning to geographies, new sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator renewal. New sales were also strong in EMEA and Latin America. However, new sales were down in APJ due to the timing of renewals and generally weaker pipeline in the region.","Within our segments, Q2 mainframe new sales including new product and capacity more than doubled year-over-year both in constant currency and as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our mainframe revenue to be down in the low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in-line with the mainframe market.","Q2 Enterprise Solutions\u2019 new product sales were up in the high-20s in constant currency, and up approximately 20% as reported. Enterprise Solutions new sales excluding the large system integrator transaction would have increased in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported.","New sales attached to renewals including the large system integrator, contributions from our recent acquisitions and solid performance in Named & Growth customers drove the improvement in Enterprise Solutions new product sales.","Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services bookings in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long-term, we expect services revenue to decline, as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners.","Total revenue backlog improved to up 2% in constant currency, or down 3% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to down 2% in constant currency, or down 7% as reported.","As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of large deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. In other words, backlog is heavily influenced by time. Given the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio, we expect current revenue backlog to tick down in the coming quarters.","As I\u2019ve said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. ","Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 36% and GAAP operating margin was 26%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 3% for Enterprise Solutions, and 5% for Services. Enterprise Solutions margins were negatively impacted by acquisition and other related expenses, some of which we do not view as on-going.","Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 28% and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 6% year-over-year. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.39, down 13%. Our Q2 CFFO was $43 million, down 32% year-over-year, or down 35% as reported.","CFFO declined year-over-year due to the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and lower single installment cash payments. Single installment cash payments were 105 million and down year-over-year.","We ended Q2 with approximately 660 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $65 million in shares and paid 110 million in dividends. We have 670 million remaining of our original 1 billion share repurchase program.","During the quarter, we issued 400 million five-year notes at 3.6%. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver accessed in conjunction with the closure of our acquisition of Rally.","Subsequent to the close of Q2, we opportunistically took out a six and a half-year, 300 million senior term loan facility at LIBOR plus 150 basis points. The use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes and to provide increased flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy.","As you can see, the terms are attractive and the tenor fits well with our maturity profile. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating.","Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30th, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. The guidance also assumes no new material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full-year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5%, at September 30th rates.","As Mike mentioned, we expect the second half of our fiscal year to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. In other words, as we look to the back half of our fiscal year, we expect our results to be better in our fiscal fourth quarter than in our fiscal third quarter.","Our expectation for a softer third quarter is the result of the expected timing of Named and Growth deals in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, we also expect the trend in mix whereby an increasing portion of deals are going ratable rather than up-front to continue in Q3.","The impact of this is for revenue to be recognized over the course of time as opposed to in the current period. However, associated expenses are recognized in the current period, which negatively impacts near-term margins.","Also, with regard to operating expenses, please note that CA World takes place in November, so the expense of our biggest event of the year will hit in the third quarter.","For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to up-front we experienced in both Q1 and Q2 has created a headwind to our reported revenue. As I mentioned earlier, this shift has resulted in downward pressure of approximately a point of reported quarterly revenue in each of the past two quarters.","We expect this shift towards ratable revenue to occur again in the third quarter. As such, we\u2019d like to provide headlights into our current view of the full year. We currently expect total revenue to be at the low-end of our guidance of down 1% to flat, in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.0 billion to $4.04 billion. Please note that the negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is around $40 million.","We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28%, and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margins will be negatively impacted by the increasing mix towards ratable revenue rather than up-front deals.","Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to come in between 2% to 5%, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.34 to $2.40. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.03.","GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 7% to 11%, prior guidance was an increase of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 431 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares.","Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of 0.97 billion to 1.02 billion. ","And now we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We kindly ask you to limit your questions to one question followed by one follow-up. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mr. DiFucci, if your line is on mute, please take it off mute. If your phone is on a speaker, please lift up the handset. ","John DiFucci","Yes. I'm sorry. This is John DiFucci. I just \u2013 I guess two questions. Rich, the first one has to do with the new ES, new Enterprise Solutions sales excluding the large deal but also excluding acquisitions. What was the growth in that? I mean, I know you said \u2013 you gave us a lot of growth numbers. I don't think you gave us that.","And you talked a lot about Rally and it sounds like Rally is doing really well, so that's good to hear, but what was the growth if you excluded the large deal and Rally? Was it better than the renewal growth?","Rich Beckert","It was mid-single-digits in constant currency so growing a little bit better than the market.","John DiFucci","Okay. Okay, great. And Mike, you said there's still work to be done here and there always is, but I guess can you talk to us a little bit about more \u2013 what are the things that you think of that really need to be focused on and perhaps you can't say exactly what it is but even in generalities, is it more around the sales force, is it more around the product, you have new product leadership there.","Can you just address that a little bit more? And actually with Rich saying it was up in I think mid-single-digits, that's actually lower than I think renewals were up in the low teens if you exclude I think, Rich, the large deal and acquisitions. So I would think that that's the only growth number. You gave us a lot of them. They all sound good. That's the only one that I guess maybe with a little asterisk next to it?","Mike Gregoire","No, I think we were pretty happy across the board with the new sales number, John. Every region, two quarters in a row with our growth in named accounts improved. So we're definitely seeing traction, kind of like what I said in my prepared remarks. Two quarters don't make a trend but it's moving in the right direction and accelerating. So I was pretty happy with that.","But as far as work goes, we still have work to be done. I'm still not completely satisfied where we are with our products. I want to do more organic innovation. We're launching a number of net new products at CA World. So that's a great step in the right direction.","I'm really happy with some of the thinking that's coming from the Rally team. This whole concept of agile. I made my whole management team go through agile training, my direct reports. Next week I'm having the whole senior leadership team which is the top 100 executives then the companies go through agile training.","This is something I think is going to not only improve our products but change some of the ways we think and act and that gets into culture. I really do think we changed the culture of the company where we're getting into a culture of innovation, accountability, predictability, and performance and moving away from a culture of entitlement and complacency.","Between the number of net new people we've hired, the people that existed in the company, and really get it and some of the great people we've been able to bring in from acquisitions, I think we've got more than a critical mass of people that really understand how a modern software needs to operate and just how competitive it is to perform in this market.","So when you have a competitive team that really gets it and we're starting to see our ability to win, win rates went up this quarter, s second quarter in a row, I'm feeling that we're definitely moving forward but I also am very sober to the fact that we've got a lot of work to do.","Rich Beckert","So, John, if I could add to that. The named and growth did very well and the mainframe did very well and that has to do with what was up for renewal in the quarter. So you had the standalone transactions that Mike described in the named and growth really performed well around the world and then in the mainframe had a very, very strong quarter and that's really what the renewals where you can see what products were up for renewal.","John DiFucci","And it's true, though, Rich, that you still, especially with new mainframe sales, they were tied primarily to renewals, right?","Rich Beckert","Predominantly. I would tell you we are starting to see the effect of the box that came out of IBM. You saw they posted another strong quarter of hardware. That's kind of a leading indicator of how customers are taking on the hardware and so we will see that as it goes through the renewal cycle.","We did this past quarter have a couple transactions that were because people had -- were light on what they were renewing, meaning that they didn't put a lot of head room in and they outpaced the head room they had put in so they had to come back to us in between renewal cycles in order to pick up extra capacity. So that's a good sign.","John DiFucci","Yeah. No. Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot, guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Greg McDowell","Great. Thank you very much. Well, just one quick question about the large renewal. I was wondering what caused the systems integrator to want to renew that. It sounds like that was originally going to be a March deal. And sounds like you brought it in early. So I was wondering if you could go through the reasons they did that and I guess the second half of that question is the contract length.","That sounds like it was maybe a little bit longer than you guys expected and I would love to hear about why that is and if you had to give any sort of concessions to get that longer contract length. Thanks.","Rich Beckert","Sure. I would start out by saying the actual renewal, if you remember, we had a very strong renewal yield inside of that SI, so from a concession standpoint there were virtually none. I think if you look at it from the standpoint of the length of time, traditionally they go longer. We had planned not to go a little bit shorter and they came back into their more traditional cycle time of over five plus years.","So that's not always the case. We plan them for less and they actually came in longer. Between the two companies, and I'll let Mike comment on the relationship, is actually very strong and we left that transaction in even stronger relationship between the two firms. So in general, that \u2013 all the metrics were very strong as you could see. High renewal yield, high new \u2013 both capacity, which is a mainframe statement and new ES sales.","Mike Gregoire","Sure. And from the dynamics of the, what prompted them to move early, when you have a large transaction like this the weight of the negotiation goes in our favor. So the closer it gets to the renewal date.","And no large company that's dealing with our stock we\u2019re running mission critical applications, they want to understand exactly what their liability is going to be or what their cost structure is going to be as early as possible. So they're usually anxious to get into the negotiation at least three quarters out of renewal date. We've seen that consistently happen for multiple years.","Greg McDowell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Abhey Lamba","Thank you. Rich and Mike, you guys had plenty kind of strong points this quarter. Love to hear which ones of them are sustainable. New product sales were pretty good. Should we think that we are at a point where we should expect strong performance on a sustainable basis? Also what the renewal \u2013 it was pretty strong. Can it continue? How should we expect rate goes from here?","Rich Beckert","So as you can see our renewal \u2013 this is Rich. Our renewal yield was very strong and even when you backed out the large system integrator you can see it was in the low 90s.","We think being in the low 90s is pretty standard if you look back over the last few years. We'll have an occasion where we drop into the 80s and we usually talk to you guys about. That tends to be more on the side of a company going through a merger or a divestiture than it is them abandoning our products for the most part.","I think when you look at it from the overall success of the business, the way we fragmented that as Mike said in his prepared remarks about platinum named and growth accounts having sustained now two quarters in a row, now two quarters in a row aren't necessary that we've moved beyond but is really a very strong indication that that strategy is starting to take hold around the world.","Mike Gregoire","With respect to sustainability, we're seeing a lot more traction and predictability out of the sales force. I think our sales team has become much, much stronger, I'm much more happy with the sales leadership I think in both named and platinum. They consistently follow the techniques and processes you would expect from a modern software organization. We still have some work to do with our partner community.","That's something we're really paying attention to. And we've got some great products that are really driving high growth. APIM for example is a best-in-class product. We had PPM which is another SaaS product which grew 70% quarter-over-quarter like we put in the press release.","So we have a lot of focus that we put on products and the sales force really understands how to articulate that value. So I'm feeling more optimistic that we are into an upward trajectory. Now, on the mainframe side as Rich talked about, we're going to see some lumpiness based on some of the renewals that we go through which is just natural to our model.","Abhey Lamba","Got it. And Rich, on the current revenue backlog, I know this large deal has been a headwind over the last couple of quarters. But this quarter we got that renewal but your current revenue backlog growth rate is still negative. What needs to happen for it to turn positive, because that is the leading indicator for revenue growth, right?","Rich Beckert","Correct. So what I would say is there's two things. Inside of that you have a little over half a point of our services backlog which is always going to be current and as we've been saying services over time will continue to go down, by design as we build our products that need less and less services. So that drags about almost half of that current point down.","And the second part is really just as you look at the timing of renewals, so you look at the back half has more than the front and then you start to reach into next year and so that's just more timing as we see them come out.","To your point, over time we believe and if we continue to have sustained improvement, we will be able to offset both of those. And so, as we close the gap from prior quarters, we have a few more quarters before that will turn positive.","Abhey Lamba","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please, go ahead.","Jeremy Benatar ","Jeremy Benatar in for Michael. Can you just describe your strategy with the Xceedium acquisition and how do you plan to position it versus competitors like CyberArk? Thanks.","Mike Gregoire","Sure. First of all, if you take a look over the last year, the majority of the large scale public hacks have been the lack of identity management with respect to machines, where a user has either control of root and gets to other machines and imposes their user identity on those other machines, or even inadvertently opens up ports on a machine that allows hackers to get into it.","This is a very important piece of technology. We have a very comprehensive PIM solution. Xceedium just adds to that PIM solution. So this was additive to an already existing portfolio and what we have, which I think is differentiating in the market, we have a much broader solution that covers more used cases with respect to Privileged Identity Management.","There are a number of different competitors in this space. I think it's a big market. I think there's room for multiple players to be successful. I think that differentiating factor for us is that we are not a small company. We have global breadth and depth.","We are continuously to invest large sums of capital into this solution. And secondly, we have adjacencies in and around the PIM solution so when a customer comes to us we're taking a more holistic look at protecting their infrastructure.","Jeremy Benatar","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys, this is Stefan sitting in for Raimo. Thanks for taking my questions. First one just a follow-up to John's question. Could you help frame the mix of sort of the growth versus the more established products within your ES segment? Kind of just where we are as transition moves some more of your portfolio sort of growing faster than the ones that are sort of not?","Rich Beckert","Sure. So if you look at our portfolio and I think you heard Mike talk about, so we had UIM was up, APIM was up. We had a strong APM management PPM, SaaS, and then you get into of course what we just purchased.","So Xceedium and Rally but the entire security portfolio did very well this quarter. So around the horn, we actually did pretty well which is what Mike was trying to talk about earlier. This wasn\u2019t more than just the system integrator having a strong influence on the quarter. We saw a large part of our portfolio perform well and it was fairly balanced.","We had another strong quarter out of Europe and we had a strong quarter out of North America. We had a strong quarter out of Latin America despite Brazil. So it was the rest of Latin America. So really the only geo that was a little soft was APJ. So it was a very good ES quarter and when you put on top of that the mainframe, it was one of the best quarters we've seen in a while.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you. And then so on that system integrator deal, could you help frame how the new product attach compares with one transaction that renewed last. And then I was just wondering given that it seems like most of the metrics came in in-line to sort of better than where you guys were expecting, why wouldn't we see an impact, a positive impact on revenue, given that it's sort of two quarters earlier than what people were modeling on that deal.","Rich Beckert","Sure. This is Rich again. Remember, that's a ratable transaction and that will be spread over five years. So as you see that go out over time, there will be some benefit in the out quarters. It's just muted because of that. When you look at the rest of the portfolio and how well we performed, what we were trying to say is what we saw in Q1 was a slight trend of about 1% of our ES business went ratable more than our historical.","We saw that again in Q2, not that two quarters make a consistent line for Q3 and Q4, but we were giving headlights that if that trend continues it will drive the revenue in near term year to the lower end of our guidance. To the degree they flip back to their historical rate of attach versus not attach, you would be closer to the other end of guidance.","All that revenue, though, is -- we'll capture. Now we're just talking about the timing of when that revenue will actually be on the P&L. So, all in all, we've had a very strong first half. Now we're talking about when that revenue will show up on the P&L. What we're seeing is it's starting to move more toward the out years.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you. And then just one last one if I could sneak it in. And it was sort of with the secular trends that we're seeing in the industry around open source, can you elaborate a little bit on how that impacts CA?","Mike Gregoire","Well, we are excited by open source. We're a huge open source user and we view that a as a catalyst for our business. At the end of the day, you have to remember that the heritage of this company has always been in managing heterogeneous platforms. And we are probably one of the largest manager of open source heterogeneous platforms out there.","If you just take a look at our APM solution, APM 10.1 was launched just last week and what we added into that release was both support of Could Foundry and Docker, two very powerful open source systems that are getting extraordinarily quick traction in the market. I know that we've been managing multiple versions of Apache for years with our APM solution which is all open source.","When you take a look at the UIM product, the UIM product supports almost all the popular open source Linux platforms including Red Hat, SuSE, CentOS, and Open SuSE. And I think that as we see more innovation coming out of open source, folding that into our platform on both APM and UIM, I think that makes once again a differentiator.","We're the only ones that have the wherewithal to invest in multiple platforms as they come out instead of waiting for them to be thrown into either legacy systems or for an open source project to start to manage multiple heterogeneous systems. We just haven't seen a lot of traction in the open source community to do that. I think that's a unique place where we can fill a void.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks, guys. And congrats on the quarter. ","Mike Gregoire","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. I thought I saw in the prepared remarks somewhere when you talked about the backend weighted results for the rest of the year there was talk of timing on some of the named accounts in the pipeline you expected. I'm just curious, did you see any of the deals get pulled forward and close this quarter and this is backfilling into the pipeline or any deals or projects that were being delayed because of any macro or other issues?","Rich Beckert","No, it's not a macro issue. What we've seen, we now have a very methodical approach to how we build pipeline and then move pipeline through the system and our headlights into Q3 and Q4, especially on those single product type transactions where named and growth tends to be we can see what our pipeline is for Q3 and what we believe would be the right yield from that and we see it for Q4. So it's nothing more than sharing with you guys headlights into what we see our pipeline mix between Q3 and Q4.","Sterling Auty","Got you. And then on the duration, can you give us a sense if you back out the longer than expected large renewal, what would the duration have looked like in the quarter?","Rich Beckert","Great. So if you back out \u2013 we would be down to a little under \u2013 little over 4, so 4.1.","Sterling Auty","So that's still a step up from where you've been, right?","Rich Beckert","It is up. Last year it was in the mid-3s.","Sterling Auty","And is there anything to read into that?","Rich Beckert","No. What you see is you had a lot of transactions in the quarter. As I said earlier, you had a very strong mainframe quarter. Some of the mainframe customers want to have \u2013 be locked in because they see the value of this platform so they want to get locked into a three, four or five year transaction. So they're buying ahead capacity in anticipation of growing into that. So it's actually a very healthy statement when you see that type of a mix with the mainframe customer set.","Sterling Auty","Got you. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. ","Siti Panigrahi","Hi, guys. This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of geography, what you're seeing outside United States. And just a follow-up to your last comment about mainframe, could you give some color in terms of what you're seeing in units and pricing as well?","Mike Gregoire","Sure. I'll hit the geographic. We had a very strong quarter in North America as you would expect. It's the biggest market for us to sell in and I was very happy with how the sales team progressed deals and were able to hold the line on pricing as well as get strategic accounts to buy more software.","I got to tell you, I've been very happy for the last several quarters with EMEA team. They've been able to really drive the value proposition. They're getting into the right accounts. They're talking to the right people and they've had strong, steady improvement across the board. We have had rough air in the last few quarters in Latin America.","I was happy to see Latin America really push and do a nice job this quarter but most impressive I was happy with the way that management team attacked the market. Knowing that Brazil is kind of tough market, they repositioned some of their sales capacity outside of Brazil and did a nice job outside across LA.","Japan is a market that we really count on to be able to drive growth. Their quarter was a little soft and the rest of APJ was pretty much in line with what we usually see.","Rich Beckert","From the mainframe side as you had asked, we didn't see any particular price pressure if you're asking from a dollar per MIP standpoint. So that was in line with what we had anticipated. We did see a nice take up though with the capacity people we're looking for which is always, as I said earlier, positive sign and we think we're still in line with our low single digit revenue over time which is in line with the market.","Siti Panigrahi","Thanks for the color. ","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Gregoire, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. ","Mike Gregoire","Great. Well, thank you again for joining us this afternoon, for your continued interest in CA. I'd like to leave you with the following thoughts. First of all, we had a very strong quarter in terms of new sales. Secondly, our renewal yield was in the high 90s, the best we've seen in years. Excluding the large system integrator, the renewal was still in the low 90s.","Third, following our strong second quarter performance, we expect a softer third quarter. And then lastly, our product and sales execution are beginning to show measurable improvement. We look forward to showing both of these drivers and the fruits of our work at CA World in the next month.","Thank you very much and have a great night. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day. "],"4297":["CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Jonathan Doros - Investor Relations","Michael Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer","Richard Beckert - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Stefan Putyera - Barclays","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","Matt Williams - Evercore","James Wesman - Raymond James","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CA Technologies first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Jonathan Doros. Sir, you may begin.","Jonathan Doros","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings call.","Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Wednesday, July 23 over the telephone and the Internet. The information shared in this call is effective as of today's date and will not be updated. All content is the property of CA Technologies and is protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be reproduced or transcribed in any way without the express written consent of CA Technologies. We consider your continued participation in this call as consent to our recording.","During this call, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at ca.com\/invest.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our second quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on September 15, 2014.","Before I turn the call over, I'd like to highlight that for modeling purposes, our year-over-year currency tailwind on revenue guidance is expected to be roughly a point for the full year. The tables and supplemental provided today, reflect the impact of both ERwin and arcserve now being included in discontinued operations.","The impact of recording arcserve in discontinued operations in fiscal 2014 includes approximately $100 million reduction to revenue, $0.05 reduction to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, $0.03 reduction to GAAP diluted earnings per share and $24 million reduction to cash flow from operation. For modeling purposes you can assume that the impact is relatively even on a quarterly basis.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Gregoire","Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. We had an encouraging first quarter, driven by strong performance in connection with our renewals, disciplined operating expense management and good progress towards our long-term goals.","While our overall first-quarter total new sales were flat year-over-year, enterprise solutions new sales were up mid-single digits. This was offset by mainframe new sales, which were down high-single digits, but in-line with our expectations.","Our focus on execution and financial discipline continued in the quarter, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 40%. On balance, we are making progress and seeing signs of traction in many areas of the business.","Since I spoke to you at our Investor Day in May, we've remained focused on the core elements of our strategy to: first, develop and deliver differentiated solutions; second, improve our brand awareness and sales execution; and third, develop and attract the right talent that can accelerate the company toward achieving our goals.","We believe that the application economy, where software and development now sit at the core of the enterprise, presents an enormous opportunity for businesses to take advantage of modern technology, and for CA to be their partner. This is the market opportunity we are going to capture, with a strategy that is clear and we are executing on every day.","Let's talk about the first component of our strategy, product development. As I have said before, innovation is the lifeblood of a modern software company. Through innovation, we will organically build differentiated products and solutions that our customers need, and we will make our software easy to buy, deploy and maintain.","During Q1, we continued to make progress toward improving our efficiency in R&D by shifting our development investment to higher ROI opportunities. In a software application economy, our customers must accelerate the secure deployment of both internal process management and customer-facing applications, regardless of the platform. Our focus on DevOps, security and cloud management meets these needs and positions us to be a partner to businesses worldwide.","As an example of our progress in organic development, in mid-June we launched CA Cloud Service Management. This is an organically developed SaaS-based service management solution that has the best speed to value in the market today. The product is built on the CA platform, and the go-to-market plan leverages the recent lead generation and brand investments we made within the marketing and sales over the last year.","Customers can easily access a free trial version of the product by visiting our website, and when they are ready, seamlessly upgrade to a paid version. We have many customers already up and running on Cloud Service Management.","For example, logistics firm BDP International standardized on both our Cloud Service Management and Clarity on Demand SaaS offerings. While we are encouraged by the initial response from customers, we will continue to focus on creating mindshare and additional demand.","Within our DevOps pillar, our application delivery solutions, which help customers simulate and deploy complex composite applications, showed strong growth in the quarter. We further expanded our technological lead through OEM agreements with Perfecto Mobile and Soasta, which adds increased functionality in web and mobile application testing to our current solution.","During Q1, our Asia-Pacific team signed an eight-figure transaction with a large financial services company that incorporated our full suite of service virtualization and automation solutions, to help improve the quality and speed at which they are able to bring their applications into production.","Also during Q1, with the help of a partner, we signed a multi-million dollar contract with a large government entity to help them improve the quality of a high-profile consumer facing healthcare application.","On the operations side of DevOps, our freemium IT monitoring solution, Nimsoft Snap, continues to gain traction with both existing and new customers. Since its launch, Nimsoft Snap has been downloaded by approximately 9,000 customers, creating a substantial amount of pipeline and lowering the total cost of sale for the commercial version of Nimsoft Monitor.","We are starting to see the acceleration in the progression of that pipeline with a number of nice wins over the past several months. One example of the value of Snap is delivering a multi-million dollar competitive replacement of multiple vendors, in which our sales team leveraged Snap as a cost effective way to allow the customer to quickly test the solution without the need for an initial onsite pre-sales engineer.","In a second example, in an emerging Asia-Pacific country that we do not serve with a direct sales rep, a partner helped upgrade a customer from Snap to a commercial version of Nimsoft monitor. These are the types of delivery models that we are driving toward in order to reach new customers globally.","Within our security pillar, our API management solution is helping customers secure how their applications communicate both internally and with external systems. During Q1, our API management solution had some great wins, including a few that I found particularly noteworthy.","First, a leading Canadian communication and media company signed a deal to leverage our solution to secure APIs that allow for identity verification, and purchases of content on a professional sports mobile application. Second, at one of the largest SaaS CRM providers, we were chosen to secure the communication of APIs for its customers, partners and between applications on its platform.","Third, our API solution is helping one of the world's largest producers of agricultural products secure the API calls between its customer-facing mobile application and the data on their back-end systems. And, in a final example, retailer Dillard, chose CA as a companywide external API solution, when the incumbent proved not to have the functionality and scalability to meet its heightened security requirements.","While the API management market is still early in its lifecycle, we are emerging as the leader from both a technological and market share perspective. An important component of innovation success is focus. That means investing in our core capability, and getting out of businesses that aren't central to our strategy. During the quarter, we further demonstrated our product management discipline with the agreement to divest our back-up and recovery business, arcserve, to Marlin Equity Partners.","Now, let's turn to the second piece of our strategy, market awareness and sales execution. Our continued focus on marketing as a demand engine and tight execution globally through a new and more effective sales model are beginning to show signs of returns.","New marketing strategies with more focused customer targeting are beginning to yield growth. For example, in a SaaS cloud environment, CA.com is a key business development tool. We are seeing repeat visitors to the website, up 39%, and site registration rates almost doubled.","Overall, more targeted marketing campaigns have led to more than 10% sequential growth in our marketing-generated pipeline. Our core brand and lead generation framework is now in place. We are now focused on improving the quality of the pipeline and increasing the velocity, at which an opportunity converts into a sale.","From a sales execution standpoint, I am encouraged by our progress, particularly with regard to early wins with new customers. However, our sales participation metrics by region are still below my expectations, as we remain too reliant on large transactions.","Let me provide some additional color. Our Platinum accounts continue to perform in-line with our expectations in terms of renewal yields and attach rates. For example, during the quarter, we closed an ELA with one of our largest U.S. financial customers that had a healthy renewal yield, mainframe capacity and a good attach rate of new products such as Release Automation, API Management, Enterprise Mobility Suite and Nimsoft.","As we previously mentioned, our Asia-Pacific team renewed a large ELA, as part of a major transformation program around next generation banking and technology, which also included new sales of our entire CA Application Delivery portfolio and Mainframe Cloud Storage for System z. It is clear from these examples that our large customers are partnering with CA to solve their IT challenges.","In our named and growth sales team, we are seeing positive momentum with both existing and new customers. Our named and growth account reps are generating pipeline in-line with our expectations and are beginning to move opportunities through the sales cycle.","During the quarter, we had wins with existing named account and growth customers such as Telephone Data Systems, Staples and Otter Products, and we made good progress adding new logos with wins at America Latina Log\u00edstica, Tata Sky and the National Cancer Institute in Brazil.","With respect to our partner business, we are continuing to shift to a model by which we invest more with strategic partners and help those partners provide differentiated solutions leveraging our software. One area where we are focusing on is service providers, which are increasingly becoming more important to our enterprise clients.","For example, during the quarter, Fujitsu Services Limited in the U.K. signed a deal to leverage CA's server monitoring, network monitoring and automation solutions to onboard and manage a large U.K. retailer's IT infrastructure.","Finally, I'll touch on velocity and talent development. Like any innovative company our people are our most valuable resource. The know-how within our company will be our strongest differentiator. We have assembled an industry-leading team of executives and have added strong talent throughout development, product management, marketing, and sales. We are focused on developing our people, retaining and attracting the best talent, and building a high-performance culture conducive to innovation, execution, and speed.","For example, during the quarter we added approximately 100 developers that have the right skill sets to position the company for innovation. I am beginning to see the environment at CA improve at all levels, and we are operating collaboratively with a sense of urgency and accountability towards meeting our goals.","In summary, the explosion of software driven disruption in the market presents us with an enormous opportunity. Over the past year we've marshaled the company to seize this opportunity, and what you will see from us in the months ahead is great software that delivers what businesses need to navigate through this new reality.","We are building CA for growth, with the type of innovation, execution and speed we need to compete and win. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the months ahead.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you.","Richard Beckert","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I am going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","Q1 total revenue was $1.07 billion, down 3%. Mainframe was down 1%. Enterprise solutions declined 3%. And Services declined 11%.","On an as-reported basis, Q1 renewals were down approximately mid-single digits. The renewal yield during the quarter was in the low 90s. We continue to expect fiscal 2015 renewals to be down high-single digits year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2014, and flat year-over-year excluding the large systems integrator renewal that closed in Q3 of fiscal 2014. We expect Q2 renewals to be down year-over-year and as a result we expect less new sales opportunities related to renewals in Q2.","As reported, Q1 total new product and capacity sales were flat and sales performance was mixed. From a geographical basis we saw improvement in EMEA sales execution. Overall, new sales associated with platinum accounts performed well, but as Mike stated the participation among our sales reps is still skewed toward large transactions.","In addition, while I am encouraged with our named and growth team progress in building pipeline, we need to increase the velocity with which those opportunities are converted to sales. As a result, we expect our named and growth teams to make a more meaningful contribution to new sales in the second half of fiscal 2015.","In our mainframe segment, mainframe new sales including new product and capacity were down high-single digits as reported, and in-line with our expectations. Our mainframe new product sales and capacity growth can vary on a quarterly basis. As we outlined at Investor Day, we continue to expect our mainframe revenue growth to be in-line with the mainframe market.","Enterprise solutions' new product sales were up mid-single digits, primarily due to good new sales performance in connection with renewals within our platinum accounts.","New service engagements were down approximately 45% as reported, due to a combination of weakness in our public sector vertical and a smaller number and size of services engagements as compared to the year ago period. The primary driver of the weakness in our public sector vertical is attributed to a decrease in our non-core government services subcontracting engagements that are not directly related to our software sales. We are refocusing on services engagements that drive new product sales. As a result, we currently expect professional services revenue to decrease more than the total revenue during fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.","From a balance sheet perspective, current revenue backlog was down 1%, and in-line with our expectations. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 40% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our segment operating margins were 62% for mainframe solutions, 12% for enterprise solutions, and 6% for services. In addition to normal operating expense seasonality, we expect an incremental spend related to CA World to occur in our third quarter.","Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, down 15%. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, down 34%. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 30% and our GAAP tax rate was 29%. The decrease in both our non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is driven by a lower non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014, partially offset by operational improvements in Q1 2015.","Our Q1 CFFO was $166 million. Single installment cash payments were $68 million and slightly up year-over-year. Current billings backlog was down 5%.","We ended Q1 with approximately $1.35 billion in net cash. During the first quarter, we paid $111 million in dividends, and repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares, for approximately $50 million.","Turning to guidance. Updated guidance is based on exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2014. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.","Total revenue is still expected to be in a range of negative 2% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.34 billion to $4.40 billion.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is still expected to be in the range of minus 21% to minus 19% in constant currency. This reflects an approximate 20% headwind from tax returning to a historical tax rate in fiscal 2015. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.49.","GAAP diluted earnings per share is still expected to be in the range of minus 12% to minus 8% in constant currency. This translates to a reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.77 to $1.84.","Cash flow from operations is still expected to increase 5% to 12% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.04 billion to $1.11 billion, which includes an approximate $60 million cash outflow related to our fiscal 2014 rebalancing program.","Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlining this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 30%. We expect a full-year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full-year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%, unchanged from our previous guidance.","At the end of the year, we expect approximately 436 million shares outstanding. And a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 441 million shares.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Jonathan, and we will take your questions.","Jonathan Doros","Thank you, Rich. As the operator is polling for questions, I would like to inform you that during our fiscal Q2, CA Technologies will be presenting at the Pacific Crest, Oppenheimer, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank Technology Conferences. In addition, mark your calendars for CA World in Las Vegas on November 9 through the 12. We will be hosting an investor track at CA World on Monday November 10.

First question is, you guys obviously saw some progress on new sales in the quarter in the enterprise solution segment. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there, what you're seeing? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael Gregoire","I think its two things tightly woven together that put us in a situation where we finally got to see some movement in the growth in a enterprise solutions, which has been troubling for the company for an awful long time. First, I go back to where it all this starts, the products.","We did 27 major releases last year and we have seven SaaS products in the market. And of those SaaS products, they are either number one or number two in their field. And having good products that do what they are supposed to do are easier to implement, easier to install, I think provides our sales organization, which operated much better, especially in Europe.","So when I take a look at some of the things that were most troubling, when I first got here, the quality of our products, how differentiated the solutions where, our sales execution, primarily outside the United States, I saw great improvements in Europe and I saw general improvements in sales execution across the board. And the products are definitely resonating with most of our customers as well as net new clients. I think we added 164 net new clients this quarter.","Stefan Putyera - Barclays","And then just a quick question on margins. I think this is the third consecutive quarter that you guys outperformed on margins. Can you talk about the decision to kind of maintain that guidance and not raise it? And sort of where you guys plan to invest a little bit more?","Richard Beckert","A couple of things, the seasonality right now that you see in Q1 that's going to be the lightest quarter of the year. And as in my prepared remarks I had talked about that in Q3, you're going to see us spend all the CA World comes in, in Q3. From the standpoint of where we are for the different element, as we talked back in May, we're pretty comfortable with where we are right now on the development total spend.","As Mike talked, we have a lot of things going on and we are continuing to rebalance and you saw us remove arcserve as we reinvest that into these new faster growing technologies. We will continue to invest in the newer marketing. And the G&A functions will continue over time to come down. We're very comfortable right now with our guidance of 37% margin for the year though. And we think we're right on track as Mike described.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","I guess, Mike, just wondering if you'd talk a bit about -- you talked about looking for more consistency in terms of the sales performance, especially from the named and growth groups. Can you talk about what you see as the catalyst there? Is that simply new products that are coming, there is the lead-gen stuff you've done there? Could you just help us understand what we should look at there to try to gauge whether or not you can do that?","Michael Gregoire","Sure. I think it falls into multiple categories. One, very difficult to measure. First of all in the upper-end of the market, we've been doing that for an awful long time and I would say that we are best-in-class and selling to the large complicated multinational companies. But when you want to find growth, you've got to extend outside of just that group. And in order to do that you have to act like a modern software company where you're doing digital pipeline generation, where you really understand and nurture leads, so you can get them into a sales force.","And then our sales force has traditionally been elephant hunters. We've got a great track record of being able to go after very large multi-year complex ELAs and we're transitioning that sales force where we preserve that skill set, because it's extraordinarily important for a segment of our market.","But as we continue to look for growth we have to extend ourselves. The company is in the Fortune 2000, the 5000, which are very large complex global companies. And our sales force has to culturally understand how to take these lead generation nurturing programs and push them out to smaller transactions that are built up over time rather than a large transaction, and its very complex, they get done immediately.","What I have seen is a definite positive improvement in pipeline generation is going into the back half of the year. And I think of the investments that we've made in our marketing department by really using the science of marketing to generate lead and then coupling that with how our products work.","If you take a look at Nimsoft Monitor Snap, actually if you go to our Investor website, there is two products you can download and try it right now, we have both Nimsoft Monitor Snap as well as Cloud Service Desk. These are products that are very competitive in the market.","They have a very quick time to implement, really easy to understand ROI, and I think that's how people that are buying in that growth market, the Fortune 2000 and the Fortune 5000, that's exclusively how I think they buy software. And the fact, that we have more products moving into that market and we've taken advantage of digital marketing, puts us in a situation where we can find the kind of growth we're looking for.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","And then just on the annualized software maintenance bookings, Rich, it did seem like that the growth rate ticked down with the term length picking up. It wasn't a strong mainframe quarter, it didn't appear. So I am just wondering what -- you usually see that kind of track mainframe. What drove that, and should we expect that that sort of trend continues that we see term life extension?","Richard Beckert","No. So there was one large transaction Mike talked about that distorted that. If you back that out that would be about three year life. And if you look at overall, we're actually -- that was not a bad, even though it looks like its down year-over-year, it's really not bad. What you see underneath that is the growth that Mike referred to in the total ES and the mainframe just had a low renewal within the quarter.","So it's really driven more by just the renewals that were coming due. We actually had a very high attach rate, so we are happy with the attach rate we got, as Mike said. And when you analyze like our top transactions, they actually all grew with the exception of one. So that's all a very positive story for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives from FBR Capital Market.","Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets","I'm just curious in terms of M&A. Is the strategy unchanged from where you surely at, at the Analyst Day? Any changes there, either strategically or target areas?","Michael Gregoire","Our M&A strategy remains consistent. We're in three big broad markets. And we tend to look at things that are in IT, business management, security and also the whole concept of DevOps. We wouldn't want to stretch ourselves, a standard deviation outside of our core. We think that those three markets are very large. There is no clear winner in any of those markets. And to the extent that we saw an acquisition that's fits within our roadmap and our strategy at our price point that we thought that was reasonable. We would definitely be willing to take a look at M&A.","And once again, from an idea perspective, what we are planning on spending in an M&A, same as what we talked about at the investor meeting. We want to make sure we have enough cash to preserve paying the dividend. We are very comfortable with that. Our share buyback program, is put in place. We definitely are supporting that. Then we look at deploying $300 million to $500 million a year in acquisitions, if we thought they were additive and helping us accelerate our growth.","Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets","Just lastly, what gives you the confidence that you will see the second half acceleration of some of the newer products? Just, I'm the missing a certain perspective there.","Michael Gregoire","Well, the confidence is based on the science, the pipeline metrics and the continued execution of the sales force and the quality that we are seeing coming out of engineering. So if you put those three things together, you'll feel much better about Q3 and Q4 and our ability to execute.","I see this across the board on a global basis. Just about every area of the company is executing better, we are not anywhere near where we want to be in areas that we really think that we've put a lot of attention, we're seeing a cultural movement as well as measurable performance movement across the board. I think Rich would like to add to that as well.","Richard Beckert","So the other portion of that is, our renewal portfolio is backend loaded for the year. As we said, if you backed out that large outsource, we would be flat year-over-year, and you'll see that predominantly happening in the second half.","To the earlier question, we had low 90s renewal tax rate, so we are very happy with that. And as Mike said, the pipeline, as it builds out over time, we just need the pipeline to progress, so that it actually closes out. So the renewal portfolio coming in, a nice attach rate that we saw on the renewals, it really is setting up, really a back-half story for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","Certainly, appreciate the added color on Nimsoft Snap as well as the seven new SaaS products. I'm wondering if you can more broadly speak on the APM market and your cloud-based APM product that I believe should be out this fall?","Michael Gregoire","The APM market is a very fragmented market and it really shows up in multiple fronts, and I think it's more from very quickly into a different kind of market. First of all, the very high-end, high-transaction throughput, where most of the applications are written in job and .net, we would be the market leader in that place, when it comes to transaction volume, level of complexity, global scale, global reach. I think that we would be the number one provider in that space.","When it comes to net new languages such as Perl, that functionality that we're adding to the product, it's on our product roadmap. And I think when we have those products in place, we become competitive even more so. But where I think that market is going, is where are the applications being developed? There is still going to be a lot of back-office applications being developed, but primarily most of it's going to be done in mobile.","We are launching at CA World our mobile device management platform, and in that is going to be mobile DevOps. And this is where the rubber really hits the road, where you can instrument applications on a mobile device and get the same kind of functionality and instrumentation that you would get in a big large web serviced application. And I think that's going to uniquely position us in this space. And I think that's pretty much where most of the APM market is going to be driven to, over the next few years.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","And then, from a geographic perspective, in your prepared remarks, you commented that EMEA saw better sales execution. I'm curious, can you give us a little bit more granularity by country? And then, perhaps also comment on Latin American and APJ?","Michael Gregoire","Sure. We have been struggling outside of United States for many years at CA, and tried to peal the onion back behind that very complicated set of dynamics. And what happened last quarter is everything just started to click. We put new leadership in place, in different areas around world, but especially in EMEA, I was very pleased with their performance. Very strong performance in the U.K., very strong performance in the Nordic. We had good performance oddly enough in southern Europe, which is a very difficult place to sell. A little bit of struggling in France, but I think that that bounces back over time.","But overall, the quality of the business, the way the sales team performed. They didn't hang around renewals. They went after net new customers. They did a lot of standalone transaction. They were selling the new solutions. And when I take a look at what that team did last quarter, I was extraordinary happy.","APJ also had a very strong quarter. Now, a part of that, in my prepared remarks, I said we do rely too much on large transaction. We had a very large significant transaction in APJ. It's a great transaction. I'm very proud of the team and how they handle that. But without that transaction, I think that the dynamics in APJ would have looked a little bit different.","And what I want us to do is get into a habit, where we're selling all day everyday, and we get more sales reps participating in the sales process. And even if they're only putting up a $100,000 or $150,000 transaction, I think that if you get, especially our new products in on a small transaction, I think that over time, because I have a great belief that those transactions add an incredible amount of value. I think they expand over time.","And it also leads to our brand promise. You do things right sometimes, you're going to get sometime sales. If you do things right all the time, you're going to get all-time sales. And I want our sales rep to take advantage of the differentiation that we built in R&D and make sure that customers get these products and use them.","Latin America was a disappointment this quarter. They have been great in the last several quarters, and they did have a bit of a slowdown in business. I think that that does rebound according to the pipeline going forward, but there is a lot of attention and focus on Latin America for us going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Williams from Evercore.","Matt Williams - Evercore","Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, hopping on for Kirk. Just one sort of point of clarification, in the comments you noted that you expect the 2Q renewals to be down and subsequently expect less new sales opportunities. I guess, therefore, sort of safe to assume that net new product sales and bookings are expected to be down in that quarter as well?","Michael Gregoire","I think we were trying to give headlights to, because we don't give quarterly guidance, is that the renewals that are due contractually will be late in 2Q year-over-year. And so therefore, there is a higher probability that that attach tax rate will still be the same attach rate that we've seen, but it will be later. Although, even in this quarter, just to be clear, you saw ES grow in the quarter, even though the overall renewals were down, year-over-year bookings down.","So it's definitely a second half story. If you look at the revenue being down 3% and you'll have something similar to that in 2Q and then it builds, so that we get back to our guidance of minus one to minus two in total revenue. So we're comfortable with the total minus one to minus two for the year. But in order for it to be at that level, you'll see it build over time. A lot of the transactions that we closed in Q1 were ratable. So again, that will build out the revenue over time.","Matt Williams - Evercore","And then, maybe just one follow-up, again sort of on the enterprise side more from a product standpoint. I mean is the growth that's coming there or the trends that you're seeing, is it sort of a handful of product that are really leading the way from a growth perspective or are you seeing more sort of broad-based growth and pipeline build across the product portfolio?","Michael Gregoire","It is broad-based across all of the three businesses that we participate in, but there is definitely stronger products in each area. So for example, in IT business management, our Clarity set of products. We're number one market share in that space. And the Clarity on Demand product has clearly become the de facto standard for SaaS deployment of product and portfolio management, really happy with that.","On the security side, our API management has done extraordinarily well. And I referenced it in my prepared remarks, a software company, a SaaS-based software company that I have a deep amount of respect for on a business model as well as technology perspective is using our product pretty much pervasively across their whole enterprise. Whether you're interfacing with their web systems, whether you're using their development stack or whether you're using their mobile application. And that just goes to show how extensive that API management product is, so really happy with the performance there.","And then, on DevOps, I do think we have a multiyear technological lead that we need to translate into a revenue lead. We have a very strong story there. It's a big area of focus for us. The pipeline for that products, that is doing very well. Its performance last quarter is also growing faster than pretty much every other product in our stack.","So when I take a look at the three big pillars that we participate in, we have stars in each pillar. And then you have a lot of our value-oriented products that do the job, great economic value, a lot of proof points, a lot of customer testimonials. It works all day everyday. There is a big partner network that understands how to implement it. And I think that they continue to add value to us as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.","James Wesman - Raymond James","It's James sitting in for Michael. I apologize, if you guys went over this, we've been hopping amongst calls. Just a quick question, Rich, the current revenue in billings backlog was down year-over-year in constant currency. When do you guys expect that to turn back up?","Richard Beckert","By Q4.","Michael Gregoire","With that, operator, I'm going to wrap up here. First, I'd like to thank everybody for taking time. I know there is a lot of calls going on today, appreciate spending time with us.","And just to wrap it up, we're focused on three things right now; develop and delivering differentiated solutions, and proving our brand awareness and sales execution, and ensuring that we've got the right talent and talent that can accelerate our company forward. I feel very confident that we're doing everything we can and getting traction on all three of those.","And it's going to be a very backend-loaded year, but we think we're going to perform well in Q2 as well as through the rest of the year. And we look forward to reporting our results, as we move forward. Take care, and have a great night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

As a reminder this call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Traci Tsuchiguchi, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Traci T. Tsuchiguchi - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to CA Technologies First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Mike Gregoire, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Beckert, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Rich will offer some prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for a Q&A session.","These prepared comments were previously recorded and this conference call is being broadcast on Wednesday, July 27, over the telephone and the Internet.

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release which was filed on Form 8-K earlier today as well in our supplemental earnings materials, all of which are available on our website at, ca.com\/invest.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. Please note that our second quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on September 15, 2016. Let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. Following our solid performance in fiscal year 2016, I am pleased to report that we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2017. Our Q1 revenue grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue improvement was broad-based with growth across all geographies. Our Q1 results give us improved confidence in our ability to cross-over into modest growth for the full year in 2017.","As you read in the press release, Rich Beckert is retiring after a decade of service to the company. Rich joined CA in 2006 and has played an important role in CA's evolution. I'd like to thank Rich for his many contributions over the years. He has been instrumental in implementing processes and instilling discipline that have helped lay the foundation upon which the company can grow. While we undertake a search for Rich's replacement, Kieran McGrath, CA's Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO, reporting to me. Kieran was the finance lead of IBM's $25 billion dollar Global Software Business and brings a wealth of financial, operational and transformational management experience.","We also announced that Adam Elster and Ayman Sayed have been named President, Global Field Operations and President, Chief Product Officer, respectively. This fine-tuning of our organizational structure further strengthens and integrates Sales and Product, two areas that are key to our growth. This level of collaboration ensures that our development and go-to-market efforts are completely aligned to customer and market demand.","Turning to the quarter, new sales were up significantly higher than we had expected. Total new sales increased more than 50% and organic new sales increased in the high-20s. A big driver of Q1 new sales growth was a transaction with a large System Integrator, or SI, that was originally slated to expire in FY18. We are pleased with the metrics of this seven-year deal, which had a healthy attach rate and enabled CA to gain wallet share. Excluding this early renewal, total new sales increased in the high-single digits year-over year. New sales in the quarter also benefited from deals that slipped from Q4 last year into Q1 this year.","Mainframe new sales increased well over 100% year-over-year. Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low-20s year-over-year. From a product perspective, the greatest contributors to new sales growth in the first quarter were Mainframe, Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM, and APM.","Overall, I am very happy with our first quarter results. Our revenue grew nearly 3%. We delivered very good margin performance, despite a difficult year-over-year compare, which drove solid EPS and CFFO. Looking ahead to Q2, please remember that Q2 of fiscal year 2016 included a large SI renewal with incredibly strong metrics, which creates a very difficult compare next quarter.","Turning to products, Q2 marks the anniversary of our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium. Both acquisitions continue to perform well and their performance has accelerated beyond pre-acquisition run rates. That said, there is still ample runway ahead for each of these acquisitions to reach their full potential.","In the quarter, as part of the large SI deal, CA Privileged Access Management, or PAM closed the single largest deal in Xceedium's history, both pre- and post- acquisition. It was selected over competitors to become the standard for the large SI to leverage across its more than one thousand global customers. Separately, CA PAM displaced an incumbent at a large American multi-national telecommunications company due to CA PAM's strength in password management.","Our performance this quarter demonstrates our strategy of acquiring great technology and leveraging our relationships to accelerate growth. This is one of the reasons why we are committed to M&A as part of our 3-legged capital allocation strategy. Clearly, we are very happy with our recent acquisitions.","Meanwhile, we remain committed to cultivating the spirit of innovation at CA. Unified Infrastructure Management, or UIM for Cloud, launched at the end of the quarter. It is a great example of how we're executing to our strategic imperative to innovate organically. UIM is a market-leading cloud-monitoring solution that showcases CA's position as a platform agnostic solution provider. With our new UIM for Cloud release, CA now supports Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, Docker, Nutanix, and PureStorage for private and public cloud as well as on-premise. Many of our customers see CA Unified Infrastructure Management at the heart of their cloud strategy. Our new capabilities supporting Amazon Web Services and OpenStack are essential in helping to optimize customer workloads. We are pleased that IT Central Station, a leading crowd-sourced product review site for enterprise technology, named CA UIM as the number one solution for cloud monitoring.","Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is another area that has consistently been a bright spot and serves as a great example of our organic innovation. PPM had a good first quarter, with new sales up mid-single digits year-over-year. In the quarter, there were a number of six-figure transactions that closed, three of which were brand new customers to the platform. We often win because of PPM's superior functionality, which is encouraging and highlights the value our internal development teams can bring to market. PPM new sales have grown in four of the five most recent quarters. We were pleased that in our first quarter CA was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Project and Portfolio Management Software Applications.","I'd also like to take the opportunity to call out the exceptional quarter Mainframe had in Q1. I am very pleased with both Mainframe new sales and revenue performance in the quarter. As one of the few software solution providers investing in the Mainframe, CA is a trusted partner to many of the largest enterprises around the world.","One of our key competitive advantages at our largest customers is our combined Enterprise and Mainframe Solutions portfolio. Our customers are challenged to manage increasingly complex, heterogeneous public, private, hybrid-cloud and on-premise environments. Our combined Enterprise and Mainframe Solutions segments enable us to strategically partner with customers to develop innovative solutions that solve some of the most complicated problems that span multiple platforms.","Many of our customers benefit from the ability of CA to manage their entire infrastructure stack across distributed, cloud and mainframe. The positive impact this has on our customer is notable. It lowers our customers' cost of ownership and shortens the time it takes to find and resolve issues. From global financial institutions and industrial conglomerates to governments and telecom companies, enterprises around the world employ a combination of CA's cross-platform solutions, and leverage the synergies between our Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions products. The interplay between Mainframe and Enterprise enables CA to cost-effectively bring new innovation to the Mainframe market. This supports our customers' commitment to the platform. It also supports a seamless user experience by making it much easier for customers to manage instead of coordinating a number of disparate point-solution vendors.","There is no doubt that we are continuing to make progress towards our goal of building this company for long-term, sustainable growth. Our development organization continues to improve as we focus on making products that matter with improved user interfaces, that are easy to deploy and easy to manage. Success here will better enable us to leverage channel opportunities and grow through alternative routes to market.","Our sales organization has also seen considerable improvement. For example, looking at our Platinum Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is based on a survey designed to measure the willingness of customers to recommend CA to other customers, our scores continue to trend positively. More broadly, our customer satisfaction scores are also following a similar, positive trajectory. We know that when we are at our best, we are customer-centric, results-focused, self-aware and agile.","While our performance in Named and Growth, or Partner-led businesses, was uneven in Q1, we continue to view this as a significant opportunity for CA to meaningfully expand our market reach. We have just started to scratch the surface. We will continue to make adjustments and be agile in our approach to driving continuous improvement throughout the organization.","Overall, I am very encouraged by our progress across a number of fronts. But as I've said before, progress will not be linear. We've had a very good Q1, but we face an incredibly difficult new sales compare in Q2. We are on a journey to transform this company to one of sustainable, long-term growth. We still have work to do.","That said, I'd like to be the first to invite you to come and see some of the fruits of this work at CA World this year. We will host a financial analyst track on November 16 which will provide a great opportunity to speak with a number of people on our executive team, experience a broad array of our solutions in action, and hear what our customers are saying first-hand. There really is no better way to fully capture the CA picture than to experience CA World for yourself. We will be sending out save-the-dates with a registration link shortly.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for your continued interest in CA.","As Mike mentioned, after 10 years here at CA I'm announcing my retirement. I am proud to have been a part of substantial change that has taken place over the years and to be in a position to leave CA in capable hands. I'm confident that a solid foundation is in place to support the next phase of CA's journey.","As usual, before we get started with the quarterly review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.","Our Q1 total revenue was $999 million and up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported. As Mike mentioned, this was the second consecutive quarter we've grown revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 10%, Mainframe Solutions decreased 1% and Services decline 2%. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were up in the mid-50% and low-50% as reported. Organic sales were up high-20% and mid-20% as reported. Both organic and inorganic new sales were driven by the SI. The large system integrator contributed high-40s to the total new sales growth. Acquisitions contributed high-20s% to total new sales growth.","The increase in Q1, total new sales, excluding the large SI, was primarily due to Mainframe Solutions new product sales. Q1 renewals more than doubled year-over-year both in constant currency and as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.","The large system integrator transaction replaced an existing deal that was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2018. This new transaction provided an incremental contract value in excess of $475 million and extends the agreement an additional five years. As such, we now expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up in the high-teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low-90% range, in line with our long-term target.","Turning to geographies, new sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator transaction new sales were also strong in EMEA. However new sales were down APJ and down sharply in Latin America due to continued macroeconomic challenges in the region. As Mike mentioned, revenue grew across all geographies in cost and currency. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew across all geographies except Latin America where revenue decreased slightly.","Within our segments, Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The largest site transaction contributed slightly more than 100% of the greater than 150% Mainframe Solution new sales product growth. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.","Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low-20% year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI contributed in the high-20% to Enterprise Solutions' new product sales growth. Areas such as Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM contributed to the new sales growth in the quarter. However as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisition contributed mid-30s% to new sales growth within Enterprise Solutions and were a notable contributor to the value we were delivering in large SI transactions.","Services revenue decreased 2% in constant currency and 3% in as reported. Over the long term we expect services revenue to decline as we design our parts to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Total revenue backlog improved to up 15% in constant currency and up 14% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to flat in constant currency and as reported. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining low-90s% renewal yield.","We expect current revenue backlog to fluctuate this year. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 39% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Operating margin declined year over year primarily due to the impact of a variable legal development in the year-ago period. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 13% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%.","Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, down 2% year-over-year and flat as reported. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, down 4% and flat year-over-year as reported. Our Q1 CFFO was $161 million down 10% year-over-year or down 14% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the timing of cash taxes which were lower in the year-ago period. Single installment cash payments were $23 million, down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $688 million in net cash. During the first quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $700 million remaining in our original $750 million share repurchase authorization.","As Mike said, our uneven performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth and Partner-led opportunities are places we are focusing as we continue this journey to transform the company to one that can sustainably grow as we continue to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization.","Simultaneously, we are working to drive continuous improvements across our sales organization so that consistency and velocity trend in the right direction across all geographies. Overall we are getting better but we have not yet crossed the chasm. It is important to note that the current revenue backlog was flat in the quarter consistent with our prior commentary. We expect backlog will fluctuate through the year.","The large SI deal that was signed in Q1 was great for CA with the total deal size, aggregate revenue run rate, associated renewal yield all representing very good metrics for us. While the large SI deal had no impact to Q1 revenue and minimal impact to current backlog, it does substantially shift the renewal portfolio such that FY 2017 is now significantly larger and FY 2018 is naturally much lighter. Consequently fiscal 2018 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year due to the timing of the large SI. Otherwise, the renewal portfolio is substantially unchanged relative to our prior expectations.","As Mike mentioned, Q2 will be challenged by an extremely difficult compare due to a large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. This will be particularly evident in the new sales which are expected to decline sharply. Conversely we had acquisition-related expenses that should create a more favorable year-over-year compare for an operating margin perspective.","Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates of the last day of the preceding quarter which was June 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year. We continue to expect total revenue to be in range of flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect a full-year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a GAAP full-year operating margin of 29% compared to prior GAAP operating margin guidance of 30%. GAAP operating margin and EPS guidance reflect the impact of the increase in our share price on stock-based compensation. We expect our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5%, compared to prior guidance of 3% to 6%. The change in our GAAP growth expectations reflects the impact of the increase in our stock price on stock-based compensation. As mentioned earlier, this translates to a reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93.","At the end of the year we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weight-average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares.","Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 1% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion. For this Q&A session we've asked Kieran to step in to field questions with Mike. I'll be here should there be any particular points where I can offer clarity, but we'd like to give Kieran the opportunity to step into this part of his new role.","With that we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. And Rich, all the best to you, and Kieran, good luck. I have two quick questions. First of all, Mike, can you talk a little bit about the significance of that large SI renewal renewing earlier? Like there seems to be different dimensions that I could think about it, but I just want to hear it from you? And then I had one follow-up.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. With respect to the large transaction, first of all, this was not something that we orchestrated. It was at the request of the customer, and in an effort to support their business. But it ended up being a very tightly negotiated contract that has excellent metrics. We added $425 million worth of net new value. It's a contract \u2013 sorry, it's $475 million of net new value and it takes them out for seven years. And when you take a look at this particular system integrator, this \u2013 our technology is going to be installed in over 1,000 customers. In it is a lot of our new technology. For example, PAM, the Privilege Access Management is part of that transaction, which we think is top of mind for most companies right now. And having that installed in that many particular accounts I think is tremendous for us.","The other thing that's significant is we've locked up our three biggest customers for almost five years now. That gives us a lot of visibility and it gives us an awful lot of software running in an awful lot of customers where we have an opportunity to extend those relationships over time. So it's a pretty significant transaction, as you can tell by the size of it and how it's affected our operating metrics. And I couldn't be happier with the team that negotiated it and I really do like the characteristics of the transaction.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you. Thanks. And then, Mike, in history at some point you will be measured also beside the renewals and the selling into this big contract and on the performance of the standalone business. Can you talk a little bit about too what you see in there? I saw some comment \u2013 you obviously made some comments about Named accounts, et cetera. But how do you see progress there evolving? Thank you.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. On the Named business as expected it's going to be a little choppy over time. The hardest thing for us to do is to sell new software to a net new customer. Almost all of our energy for new on the product side, on the marketing side, on the sales side is equipping that sales team with the tools and capabilities to be able to sell our products into customers where we don't have a significant relationship.","Now the volume of transactions are going up and I'm pretty pleased with that. But we need to have more product and we have to have more customers buying in that space. I think there's things that we can do product-wise. I think there's things that we can do marketing-wise with our compete level, and I also think there's things we can do from a sales effectiveness perspective to make that more repeatable over time.","And this really does lead into how I've changed the tone with respect to product and sales. I think this is not a unique issue with respect to CA. I think this is an industry issue. Customers today, they want to talk to sales professionals that really understand them and their line of business and how our products work in the context of their operation. That's why you see so much focus on try-and-buy and proof-of-concept in the selling motion.","Secondly, if you're building products, especially if you're building Agile, you have to have customers participate in the build very early on in the design cycle. We need our sales teams to have the relationships and accounts where they're willing to participate in our design, because if they participate in our design the probability that we build an application that absolutely solves a group of problems for a wide variety of customers goes up.","At the end of the day, customers want products that are easy to install, easy to upgrade, easy to operate, and having both Ayman and Adam focus on that together, I think is going to have a material impact to our overall consistency and our ability to sell, not just in Platinum but also in the Named and Growth space.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John DiFucci of Jefferies. Your line is open.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. First of all I'd just like to say, I know Zach and I are going to miss Rich a lot. I know Kieran \u2013 it's in good hands right now, but we certainly will miss Rich. I have a couple of questions. And the first, I'm going to ask it around Mainframe, but I think it applies to everything. And I guess the question's for Kieran, but either \u2013 Rich might want to chime in or even Mike too.","You said that you expect this business to be down low-single digits which is what's expected for the industry. But assuming this is all ratable business, you had a big, large, new Mainframe business quarter. Right? I'm curious, did new business in this quarter more than offset attrition in this quarter? Like if you're looking at annualized numbers? And if so, which it seems like it probably did, why couldn't it actually grow \u2013 other than you being prudently conservative in your forecasts, which makes a lot of sense in this business, especially a business that some describe as a melting glacier?","Kieran McGrath - Corporate Controller, Interim Chief Financial Officer, CA, Inc.","So John, it is Kieran. I think the first thing I'd say is, prudent, we are definitely prudent in the business. We've had a very good run of it here over the last several quarters with the Mainframe new sales performance and we've been very pleased with all of our renewal metrics. And we think with the amount of capacity IBM is putting out into the marketplace, we get to populate that.","I do think we would be somewhat na\u00efve if we were to ignore just the overall market trends at this point in time. We think the minus 1% here is a pretty nice improvement that we've seen. If you recall, a year ago we were running at about minus 3% for the first half of the year and we've made steady improvement in that space. Right now from what we can see, low-single digits seems very doable, very manageable and actually very much in sync with where the market is. Obviously any opportunity to do better than that, of course the team will take advantage of that. But that's where \u2013 right now we really just expect it to be down in the low-single digits.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing too, John, that I would add to it is, this is not a business that we're ignoring. This is a business that we're paying very close attention to. I think we're probably one of the only two vendors that are making serious investments in R&D in the Mainframe business. When you take a look at how that product group has done, they've done a fantastic job. They've put out 53 new releases in the last year with zero defects.","And when we talk to that customer base, and as I said before, we are getting very maniacal of listening to the customer, what they want is high-quality releases. These are mission-critical systems running high-transaction throughput. They want software that works all day, every day. And when I take a look at what that team's done, especially over the last year as they've adopted Agile, they have just absolutely gotten better. And I know Rich is very close to this business. Maybe you'd have a couple comments, Rich, on the Mainframe?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, John. The only thing I would add to that is, it is very much what's in the portfolio to renew. If you recall in Q4, it was lighter Mainframe. This quarter was a heavy Mainframe quarter. Next quarter is a difficult compare with the prior year's outsourcer. So yes, if you did this kind of quarter every quarter, you're correct. It would be growing, but that's not how it'll happen. It'll porpoise.","As far as IBM's mainframe \u2013 all the work that we've done internally, they're right on track. They're in fact on an inception-to-date basis, on their current product line, they're probably actually doing better than the previous one, from what we can see. So we are happy with the progress. There's always going to be price pressure, as you know, on the mix that we're putting on the floor. But as Mike said, we think we're poised very well to pick that up, and be one of the two main providers for mainframe.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great, that's helpful on that business. And just my second question, I'd like to turn to \u2013 it's going to really focus on the other business, the Enterprise Solutions business. You talked of uneven performance in Named and Growth business, which is going to be mostly Enterprise Solutions, I think. Can you provide a little more detail around what that means, as far as uneven performance? Because, actually, we hear about that in the field, too. We actually hear of wins that you guys are making, like outside of your existing platinum accounts, and you hear those things, and like, wow, that's pretty interesting. But what do you have to do to make that more consistent? Like you sort of mentioned that in your prepared remarks, that you're going to do that. But what is that Adam's going to put in place, to make that more consistent?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a great question, and trust me, I ask myself that question a lot, and I try to get as many people in the company to provide answers. And what we've come up with is a large list of things that I think we can do better in that space. We had an absolutely fantastic quarter, but we spent an awfully lot of time consistently being agile, taking a look at what we can do better. And the inconsistent performance is \u2013 some of it's people-related, some of it's leadership-related, some of it's product-related, and some of it is industry-related.","You take a look on a global basis, we're spotty. We have quarters where our sales teams are doing a really good job of getting to understand line of business leaders, and really getting tight relationships, understanding their buying process. And we have other areas that they have not been able to penetrate into some of those accounts.","Now some of that is brand and brand recognition. You have to remember that for, we're a 40-year-old company. For 37 years of that, we basically sold to, between 100, 200 customers, and now, we're expanding our TAM, trying to get into the other 1,700 customers that buy enterprise software. And they just don't know CA as well as they should. The brand marketing that we're doing with CNN gets us to be known. The work, especially in Europe, that we've done with Trek and the cycling team has been phenomenal, for people are asking the question, is what is CA?","So we're getting some brand awareness and I think that's helping the sales force. Coupled with that is a lot of product improvements. We've been changing the product to get to where those types of customers want to buy. They want easy to use, they want easy to buy, they want easy to upgrade, they want to understand how that product works before they buy it, and I think that's not a CA phenomenon. That's an industry phenomenon. I think that as you are building out net new product, if it doesn't have those types of characteristics, it's going to be harder and harder to sell.","When you take a look at our product portfolio, we have a number of products that do that very well but we don't have enough of them. And when I work with Ayman and I work with Adam, those are the things that we're trying to drill down on. Now secondly, we've made pretty big investments in digital marketing which has had an uptick for us. But it's still early days with that. When you put all of that focus together I think you're going to see definitely more consistency in the Named segment, but it's a work in progress for us.","We get our revenue from a number of different places, John, as you know. You've got one of the most sophisticated models out there. We know how to do renewals. We're good at that. We know how to upsell in a renewal and extend the size of the wallet in an account. We know how to do that real well. We've been doing a much better job over the last two years at selling outside the renewal and there's always room for improvement there, but we know how to do that.","When it comes to capacity sales that's not something that we get to drive as much as some people would like to think. At the end of the day you either need capacity or you don't. And to the extent that customers need capacity, we absolutely know how to do that. The hardest thing for us to do that we're getting better and better at in each and every quarter is cold-calling in to a customer that we have little or no relationship with explaining what CA is, explaining what it is we can do to help them, and that's taking time and we're going to keep at it all day every day. Is that helpful?","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","That is helpful, Mike. It sounds like you have a lot to do and all of that probably will contribute to, hopefully to success here. Thank you.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is actually Jim (33:21) on for Walter. Just wanted to say congrats, Rich, on your retirement and your future endeavors. I'm sure you'll enjoy the time off. So I just wanted to start off on the SI deal. The $475 million renewal is from the same customer as the $300 million that we were supposed to have in 2018. How should we think about what is renewal, or the extension component with it being seven years, versus new business being sold into it?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, it was a component of both. So from a renewal perspective, we certainly got \u2013 we certainly had a very substantial set of metrics on it. And associated with that, we also had a lot of new sales, both from a Mainframe and from our PAM business, our Xceedium business, which were both of them in there. So it's an extension of a deal that would have expired in December of next year. Essentially it's another five-plus years that we get, so in total now seven years out. But with a healthy mixture of both new sales as well as very, very good renewal metrics.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And then I guess what would you see \u2013 what would be the impact from the merger of HP Services and CSC on you guys? Have you guys kind of thought about that? And \u2013 just looking for your thoughts there.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, if you take a look at it, our three largest \u2013 the three largest SIs are contracts that we have locked up for almost five years. So we have HP locked up. We have IBM locked up. And we have CSC locked up. The contracts that moved with HP over to CSC when they close that deal, those contracts are locked up. That was, for at least another four years. So I think we're very well protected from a revenue perspective, and I'd like to help grow those accounts as they start implementing our software in their SI contracts.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If I could add to that, Jim, I think what you're going to see over the last three major SI deals that Mike just described, we were happy with all the metrics on that. So the overall wallet share, the renewal yield and what new products we put in, both organic and products that we acquired. So \u2013 and the way to view that as the relationships, as Mike had pointed out earlier, are getting deeper and deeper, not less and less. So that's all been a positive for CA over the last couple of years.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Thanks. Thanks, guys. And congrats again, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Jeremy Benatar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Jeremy Benatar on for Michael. Just adding on to Jim's question, I was wondering if the large SI deal that was pulled in from fiscal 2018 could drive further add-on sales this year. And if so, is that accounted for in your annual guide, given the full year guide you've maintained?","Kieran McGrath - Corporate Controller, Interim Chief Financial Officer, CA, Inc.","Yes. So this is Kieran. So first of all, it's because the deal is over seven years, and even though there was upside to the revenue, it's all ratable revenue. It's going to have a de minimis impact on revenue. And there was no impact on revenue in the quarter. And as we go forward it will be very small for the rest of the year. That \u2013 certainly we've got a very close relationship with that group now, and we'll always be looking to sell into that account and find more upside.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If I were to add to that, what \u2013 also what you'll see is they standardize on some of our products like PAM. And any time they standardize as we add to that product either through acquisition or organically, it allows us to just further \u2013 there's a 1,000 customers there. We talk about it as one big customer. It's actually a 1,000 customers that come and go in and out of those three outsourcers. So it makes a great platform for us. And I think as we go forward and continue to build out the security platform, as an example, this allows you just to upsell. Because remember, they only have access to what we have today, not what we build or buy over the next seven years.","Jeremy Benatar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. And congratulations to you, Rich, as well. You referenced earlier an increase in mainframe solutions renewals that were actually not associated with the big SI deal in the quarter. Just wondering if you can elaborate on that?","Kieran McGrath - Corporate Controller, Interim Chief Financial Officer, CA, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, it was the team \u2013 based upon what we discussed earlier with IBM's new product releases that have been out for the last year and a half or so, and all the incremental capacity that's been put out into the field, we've had the opportunity to actually fill up a lot of those slots with increased MIPS. And this is several quarters in a row for us that we've been able to do that as well.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And remember where we lag, they install the product. They don't actually come to us for MIPS for usually like six months afterwards. So although their year-over-year sales are down, they're still putting more MIPS in the marketplace. So that's an absolute number that's expanding. Our installed base is expanding and we pick those MIPS upon the next renewal, unless someone is busting out of the top of their, what they have capacity for. So it's exactly as Kieran said.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Then just, I guess, another question for either Kieran or Rich. You mentioned that Q1 total new product and capacity sales were up, I think, mid-50s in constant currency. And I think within that, the large SI contributed high 40s to total new sales growth and acquisitions contributed high 20s. I presume there's some overlap there just in terms of the fact that the SI bought quite a bit of PAM in the quarter. But just kind of wondering roughly what the new sales growth would be or would have been on an organic basis, if you excluded that one large deal in the quarter?","Kieran McGrath - Corporate Controller, Interim Chief Financial Officer, CA, Inc.","Well, there certainly was a very substantial portion of overlap, absolutely, in the deal. But even with that, organic sales would still have been up in the quarter.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. If you take a look at, as I put in my prepared remarks, product and portfolio management had a very strong quarter. That's all organic. UIM, especially with the new release, was strong again. APM, strong again. Rally was another strong quarter for us. So when you take a look at a lot of these, Rally \u2013 the Rally would probably be excluded from organic. But when you take a look at another transaction we did with PAM, although the product is not organic, there's no way that that sale would have got done without our sales force. So I think that's quasi-organic or inorganic, but it was the biggest \u2013 the second biggest transaction I think PAM has ever done. And it would never have been done without the relationships that we have.","Kieran McGrath - Corporate Controller, Interim Chief Financial Officer, CA, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, we took a business and scaled it, orders of magnitude, from the run rate that the business was on a year ago.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right, absolutely. Just one last one for Mike, if I could. What's your expected timeline with respect to the CFO search, and I guess, as well what are the primary characteristics that you're looking for?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. First of all, industry, we've been meeting with search firms. We'll make a call on that relatively shortly. But based on heuristics, you're looking four to six months. And what we're looking for is a CFO that exhibits a lot of the characteristics Rich has, with respect to rock solid financial performance, the ability to understand our business, ability to grow and nurture a team. And also we're going to do acquisitions. So I want to make sure that, that CFO has the ability to understand the dynamics of doing acquisitions.","And lastly is this maniacal drumbeat of paying attention to customers. Paying attention to customers has to be the focus of everybody in the company. Now the tip of the spear usually shows up in sales and in product, but how you model, how you budget, how you think through all of the things that customers are driving us for, I think a CFO plays a pretty strategic role in helping all of the business units think that through, and make sure that we're organized from a financial perspective to understand that.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Good luck to Rich, as well as congrats to Kieran. So Mike, good performance across the board, a strong performance on the security front. Can you talk to us as to the ongoing success you're seeing in recent quarters? Is it a toxic landscape on the security front, is it the growth in compliance and regulation, all of the above? And excluding the SI contract, did Xceedium still have a strong quarter, on a standalone?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Xceedium's been a big bright spot for us in security. We also have another product that did very well in security. It's called Payment Security. So we are definitely very focused on taking advantage of a number of unique things happening in that security market space. First of all, the market is continuously growing. There's no winner across the board in security. Customers are leaning towards companies that have more scale and more breadth, because they're looking for global service on a topic like this. They would prefer to deal with fewer vendors rather than stitch together the security platforms of multiple vendors. The fact that we've got a very large portfolio and are dominant in the ID management space I think puts us in a very good position to compete.","As we get closer to CA World you're going to see us put out more organic product with respect to security. And I think that the way that we think through security and the way that we're thinking through how the security of the future operates with predictive analytics is unique to the market space. So I'm pretty bullish about what we're able to do in security over time.","Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. You have been front running my next question, but what additional security markets could you be thinking of expanding into? Or the focus is most likely to remain near term on identity and access management?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We still think that there's a lot of work to be done in identity and access management governance, a lot of that work, whether it be in the cloud or whether it be on-premise. The other thing is, ease of use. All the products in the marketplace today are not as easy to use as customers want, and oddly enough this is something that really requires a lot of insight and intellect, because we can lock things down pretty tight. The user experience becomes more difficult the more tighter we lock things down. Customers push back on that and end users push back on it even harder. So the real secret is to make an elegant solution that is very robust, very safe, provides an incredible amount of governance and reporting and makes it easy for the users to do what it is they want to do.","A lot of that is going to be based on predictive analytics. And when you take a look at some of the work we've been doing over the last year in this space, I'm pretty excited about our role, to be able to use that type of technology to help solve that critical problem.","Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. So automation, orchestration, also on the table in that respect, if I'm reading you right?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","With respect to security, once again, the day a new customer or a new employee wants to use any digital service, to the extent that you know who they are, you know where they're coming from, you know what their rights are inside your enterprise, a lot of that work, if you call that orchestration, yeah, absolutely. We are 100% behind that. I just want to make sure that people aren't confused with the word orchestration. Orchestration in a DevOps world means something completely different. Although that's a big part of our business as well, when it comes to security, it's really about ease of use and protection as well as reporting in on behaviors and patterns.","Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. Thank you so much and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, this is actually Fen Hoffman (46:08) on for Kirk. Thanks for taking my question. So we touched on this a little bit, but I just wanted to come back to it, it's been a while since your last acquisition. I know you said in the past, that you generally aim for $300 million to $500 million in acquisitions per year. Can you just give us a little bit of an update on your thinking in terms of the balance you're looking for between capital return and inorganic growth, going forward? Thanks.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. We have a three-legged stool that we continuously talk about, with respect to capital allocation; that shows up with \u2013 as you said, $300 million to $500 million a year in doing acquisitions. And we're all for doing acquisitions, but we're going to be very disciplined. And our discipline shows up in two places.","First of all, is what it is we're buying. What we're buying has to fit in the context of our strategy, and we're very specific with respect to what that is. We wouldn't want to be more than a standard deviation outside of the core tenets of our strategy. We're not chasing revenue, we're not chasing fads. We have an intimate idea of what Enterprise Software's going to look like in the future, and to the extent that we can find great technology that fits that strategy, we're all in.","Secondly is, we're disciplined buyers. We have been very thoughtful, I believe, with respect to what we're willing to pay for technology. And to the extent that we can find something that fits our strategy, and fits our price point, we are more than happy to transact. If we can't solve those two minimal hurdles it's just hard for us to find acquisitions that really make sense.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Parthiv Varadarajan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. This is Parthiv sitting in for Abhey. You mentioned that you now expect the renewal portfolio to decline in fiscal 2018, as the SI deal shifted into fiscal 2017. Can you provide any color on the revenue side of things? I know you're not willing to talk about fiscal 2018 revenue just yet, but are you still comfortable with your directional goal of growth in fiscal 2018?","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, directionally, we're very comfortable with what we've said, mid-single digit growth.","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Low single-digit growth.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Low single-digit growth. And we're not going to get into FY 2018. We're in the first quarter of FY 2017. We'll approach that at the appropriate time.","Parthiv Varadarajan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great, thanks. And as a follow-up, Rich, can you give us a sense of why you thought it was best to transition at this time from your role at the organization, when it seems like momentum is moving in the right direction?","Richard J. Beckert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Well first, I've been here 10 years, five years, as the CFO. I don't \u2013 I want to thank Mike for all the work that we've done together and the board's help in allowing me to have the five years of opportunity. I couldn't have done it without my team. We've built a great team out over the last 10 years. Kieran, I'm sure as you guys get to know him over the next few weeks and months, will find that to be the case.","So I think we're leaving \u2013 or I'm leaving at the right time. It's two quarters in a row of revenue growth and stock's at a 52-week high. I \u2013 allows me to transition into a little bit of time off, honestly. And then I'll figure out where I go from here. So I think it was perfect timing and I think, Mike, I want to thank you publicly for all the three years. We have done a lot a things together as a team and he's built out a great team. So I think it's left in great hands.","Parthiv Varadarajan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Greg McDowell of JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC","Great. Thank you and Rich, I hope you're relishing the last few minutes of your last earnings call here. A few quick questions. First, you called out a couple times the difficult new sales compare from Q2 of last year, and specifically called out that you expect it to decline sharply. I was wondering if you could just help us a little bit in putting some maybe parameters of what declined sharply exactly means, and just to make sure we get the modeling right. That's my first question.","Kieran McGrath - Corporate Controller, Interim Chief Financial Officer, CA, Inc.","Well as you know, we don't guide to quarters specifically, but it was a very substantial deal that we booked last year, from both a renewal and a new sales perspective. So I think just given what we say, and you ought to (50:49) expect that we're going to be down in addition to that, that we will also wrap on our two big acquisitions next year in particular with Rally.","Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC","Right.","Kieran McGrath - Corporate Controller, Interim Chief Financial Officer, CA, Inc.","So it's certainly going to be the most difficult quarter for us for this year. We had a very, very strong Q2 both organically and inorganically last year with the large SI as well as without the large SI. So when we look across the whole year, I mean, this was the quarter that we always thought was going to be the one that was going to be the most challenging for us.","Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you. And then, no one's asked yet about some of the geographic commentary you made and I guess it's always surprising to hear that EMEA was strong. So I was just wondering if you could maybe just give us some more details on what exactly happened in EMEA, what you saw at the end of the quarter in UK \u2013 in the UK, and maybe how the pipeline specific to the UK is shaping up in light of the headlines? Thanks.","Kieran McGrath - Corporate Controller, Interim Chief Financial Officer, CA, Inc.","Yeah. So overall, EMEA actually had a good quarter. We had a lot of strength in our Northern and Central regions. As Mike had said, we do need to see more consistency, especially in Named and Growth. We had some pockets there where it performed well, but in general, could have done a better job there. We actually saw some, some really strong performance at our PPM, UIM, and APM products. And you know, it was great news that EMEA was actually up on a year-on-year basis. As we exited the quarter and going through this year, I mean, right now, we're not seeing anything per se reeling its head from Brexit. But we'd be prudent just to keep an eye on that and to not get too far ahead of ourselves here. But so far, we'd say EMEA was performing fairly well.","Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mike Gregoire, your CEO, for any further remarks.","Michael P. Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all, thank you for joining us this evening. I'd like to leave with a few closing thoughts.","First of all, we're off to a great start here in fiscal 2017 with revenue up for the second consecutive quarter, strong new sales and a solid margin performance. That said, I think we've pretty hammered this point home pretty hard. We've got a difficult compare coming in Q2, especially with regard to new sales.","I'd also like to publicly acknowledge Rich as well. It's been a great partnership over the last three years. He's taught me an awful lot. He taught me the mainframe and he also taught me financial discipline at scale. So Rich, thank you very much for all that you've done.","And lastly, we look forward to updating you as we continue to evolve CA. And as I mentioned earlier, we're a software company. If you really want to understand us, do your very best to get to CA World. We have a lot of net new technology coming out between now and CA World. I think it's going to be our biggest CA World so far. And it's really going to be focused on product and how we're building products that are easy to use, easy to install and easy to maintain.","So with that, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce our host for today, Ms. Kelsey Doherty, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.

Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of potential risks. ","So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William E. McCracken","Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our full year and fourth quarter performance. I'll then update you on fiscal 2013 priorities. Rich will provide details on full year performance, the quarter and guidance for fiscal 2013, and then we'll then take questions. ","Nearly 3 years ago, we set a strategy aimed at helping customers gain the most from their existing IT investments while at the same time benefiting from new technologies and business services that deliver a competitive advantage. We made a series of strategic acquisitions and significant investments in development to produce a portfolio of solutions and services that leverage our heritage in IT management. We also continued to invest in new routes to market and enhance our presence in geographies with growth opportunities around the world. Our fiscal 2012 results reflect progress against our strategic goals. ","For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Five points of this growth in constant currency was organic, while 2 points of this growth came from acquisitions. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. This includes significant investment in the future of our business. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 31%, at the low end of our expectations in January. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% in constant currency and 18% as reported. And finally, cash flow from operations grew 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. ","During the year, we provided segmented financials; sold our Internet security business; acquired ITKO, a leading provider of service virtualization, and Base Technologies, a consultancy focused on the management of IT assets; total return on investments in growth markets led by Latin America and Asia Pacific; announced a return of $2.5 billion in capital to our shareholders through fiscal year 2014. And we finished fiscal 2012 by delivering a solid fourth quarter. ","Year-over-year, revenue was up 6% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 10% in constant currency and 17% as reported. Finally, cash flow from operations was up 20% in constant currency and 22% as reported. We paid our first quarter dividend of $0.25, in line with the annual dividend rate of $1 per year we announced in January, when we increased the dividend fivefold. ","We also launched a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, under which we immediately received approximately 15 million shares of our common stock. This program will continue into our first quarter, and the final number of shares purchased will be trued up based on the average price of stock over the life of the program. Upon completion of the accelerated share repurchase, CA Technologies will have approximately $1 billion in stock repurchase authorization available through fiscal 2014. ","We accomplished a great deal in fiscal 2012, but we know there is more we can do to expand product penetration, to continue to improve our results in EMEA, where full year revenue was down slightly in constant currency year-over-year and to accelerate performance of acquisitions we have made over the last few years. We see a significant opportunity to expand our market reach and grow our business by penetrating new customer segments with new solutions. ","There are several key components to our plans. The first component is market segmentation. We are executing our market segmentation initiative, deploying approximately 300 incremental new quota-carrying sales reps. Approximately 1\/3 of those resources are new to CA Technologies, while the balance are reallocation of existing internal resources. We are selling new products in 3 customer segments: first, large existing enterprises where we get approximately 80% of our revenue today. The market opportunity focuses on improving renewal yields and driving revenue growth through increase account penetration.  Second, large new enterprises. While this market segment includes more than 4,500 potential new customers, we are initially focusing on 1,000 customers selected based on CA Technologies current geographical and vertical strength. We are landing with our most differentiated offerings and expanding through upselling complementary products. ","Finally, we continue to build our presence in the growth market. For us, the growth market consists of companies with revenue between $300 million and $2 billion and in fast-growing geographies like Latin America and Asia. These customers are looking for integrated offerings that are easy to install and use and have a rapid ROI. We are reaching this market with a combination of teleprospecting, inside sales and partner routes to market, offering them technology like our public and private cloud automation solutions and Nimsoft. ","Targeting these large, new and growth market customer segments more than doubles our total addressable market and, we believe, will accelerate our new solution sales in new accounts across all the geographies. Examples of fourth quarter successes include: a record number of competitive displacements on the mainframe, including Duke Energy; more than 50 new customers in our security business, including American Express and Shinhan Card in Korea.  Just under half of these customers were new to CA Technologies. Our security solutions protect the identities of over 150 million users worldwide. Just over 60 new customers added to Virtualization and Automation, including Toyota Financial Services and Fuji Xerox Taiwan, and just under 100 new customers added to Nimsoft. ","Turning to the second component of our 2013 plan. We continue to align our organization to better support these new routes to market, reflect our reporting segments and streamline our business. For example, in the fourth quarter, we aligned our business, both internal business units and some operational functions, to more closely reflect our products and go-to-market strategy. We appointed a chief marketing officer and consolidated our marketing functions into one organization. ","And we continued to enhance our global partner program, which we launched more than a year ago to help partners evolve their businesses and adopt new service delivery models. We are partnering with Mahindra Satyam and Tech Mahindra, an Indian-based systems integrator and service provider, leveraging CA Technologies' broad technology portfolio to provide IT solutions to key vertical markets, such as telco and financial services; Fujitsu, which will incorporate Nimsoft IT management-as-a-service, monitoring and service desk solutions on its Fujitsu cloud portfolio; Cisco and NetApp, which have fully validated CA Automation Suite for data centers for their FlexPod offering; VCE, which has certified 12 CA Technologies software products to run on Vblock Infrastructure Platforms. ","And we have also enhanced our alliances program with major consultancies. With PwC, we are delivering joint solution offerings with products like Service Assurance and Service Virtualization, specifically targeting the financial services and health care verticals. With Deloitte, we are delivering joint offerings with our identity access management solutions for the health care vertical. All of this is being done to support our market segmentation, increase our speed of execution, drive our  performance culture and improve productivity and efficiency. ","Finally, in addition to our broad portfolio of on-premise software solutions, we continue to invest in our integrated SaaS platform strategy that we discussed at CA World in November. These solutions provide customers scalability combined with simplicity and include our monitoring and service desk solutions from Nimsoft. We are confident this approach will appeal both to our growth market customers, who prefer a flexible consumption model, as well as to our traditional large enterprise customers, who can quickly adopt new functionality to complement their on-premise capability. ","In fiscal '13, we will continue to focus on expanding our operating margin to improved execution, increased efficiency and continuing to build sales momentum. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich for a closer look at the fourth quarter and full year.","Richard J. Beckert","Thank you, Bill. Please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. I'll start by running through the details of our full year financial performance. ","Revenue was $4.81 billion, up 7% in constant currency and 9% as reported.  Full fiscal year '12 results benefited from 2 points of growth from the large IT outsourcer deal booked the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and 1 point of mainframe growth from a single license payment received last quarter that will not reoccur in fiscal '13. Non-GAAP operating expense was $3.17 billion, up 7% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.27, up 13% in constant currency and 18% as reported. And finally, cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. On a GAAP basis, our operating margin also improved 1 percentage point to 29% and our diluted EPS was $1.90, up 14% in constant currency and 19% as reported. ","Now for the fourth quarter details. Total revenue was $1.2 billion and grew 6% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Four points of this constant currency growth was organic, while 2 points came from acquisitions. This also includes 21 million products that were newly eligible for upfront revenue recognition in the third quarter of this year. ","From a segment perspective, Mainframe solution revenue was $629 million, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported. Our Enterprise Solutions revenue was $466 million, up 10% in constant currency and as reported. Services revenue was $93 million, up 15% in constant currency and 13% as reported. ","Underlying our results for the quarter, total new capacity and new product sales were up low single-digits. In Mainframe Solutions, new product sales for the quarter were up more than 50%, driven by the competitive replacement and adoption of our Chorus product line. Capacity sales were down in the mid-teens. Quarter-to-quarter capacity will fluctuate, driven by the nature of our customers in our underlying renewals portfolio. ","For the full year, capacity sales were flat. Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up low single-digits. We saw growth in Identity and Access Management and Virtualization and Automation. This was offset by Service Assurance. Underneath these Service Assurance results, we saw growth in Application Performance Management that was offset by infrastructure monitoring. ","Finally, new service engagements were up more than 30% year-over-year. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the low-90% range. The fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio came in slightly better than the 15% year-over-year decline we had expected at the end of January. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we closed a $500 million IT outsourcer deal, which made for a challenging year-over-year comparison. We currently expect the 2013 renewal portfolio to be down single-digits year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that the first quarter 2013 renewals are expected to be a trough for the year. ","Looking at the revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog at the fiscal year-end was $3.7 billion, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Total revenue backlog at fiscal year-end was $8.5 billion, down 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. This decline was due to the IT outsourcer deal signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and the increase in bookings attributable to software fees and other. ","From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $377 million, up 1% in constant currency and 6% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 56%. Our full fiscal year operating margin for Mainframe Solutions was 56% compared to 54% last fiscal year. Operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 5%. This was primarily due to investment in acquisitions and development. Our full fiscal year operating margins for Enterprise Solutions was 8%, flat with last year. Finally, operating margins for Services was 6%. Our full fiscal year operating margin for Services was 6% compared to 5% last year. ","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, up 10% in constant currency and 17% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.03 tailwind from currency. For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 28% compared to 29% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% last fiscal year. We continue to see year-over-year benefits from efforts to improve our approach to taxes. ","Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $776 million, up 20% in constant currency and 22% as reported. Single-installment payments were $208 million in the fourth quarter compared to $176 million in the previous period. For the year, single-installment payments were down, $479 million for fiscal year '12 compared to $542 million in fiscal year '11. Total billings backlog at fiscal year-end of $4.84 billion was down 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported. ","Similar to the dynamics underlying revenue backlog, this year-over-year decline was driven by the IT outsourcing deal signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 and the increase in bookings attributed to software fees and other. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.24 billion in net cash. ","Moving to the fourth quarter GAAP results. Fourth quarter operating margin was 25%. GAAP operating income before interest and tax was $301 million, down 1% in constant currency and up 1% as reported. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.45, up 19% in constant currency and 22% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 27% compared to 35% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 31% compared to 32% last year. ","Now let me turn to our fiscal 2013 guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based upon the exchange rate of the last day of the preceding quarter or, for this quarter, March 31, 2012. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. ","Guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is expected to be 2% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 9% to 12%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.53. ","GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 10% to 14%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.14. We expect the cash flow from operations will grow at 4% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. The guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. ","Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 30% to 31% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 448 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 461 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 35% for fiscal year 2013. ","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William E. McCracken","Thanks, Rich. Looking back, fiscal 2012 was a year that further demonstrated CA Technologies' commitment to consistently delivering innovative solutions and services to our customers, solid revenue and earnings growth and attractive, sustainable returns to CA Technologies shareholders. ","In fiscal 2013, we will continue to focus on improving and consistent execution, expanding our penetration in large existing enterprises and winning new accounts in large, new enterprises and growth markets. We will also continue to follow our strategy that thoughtfully balances investments in the business to fuel will growth with the return of cash to our shareholders. ","Customer success and financial performance do not happen by chance. Our people are the heart of who we are as a company, the value we bring to our customers and the ultimate key to our success. Thank you to all of our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to CA Technologies. You are CA Technologies. ","And with that, Kelsey, let me turn it back to you.","Kelsey Doherty","Thank you, Bill. As the operator is polling for questions, I would like to inform you that CA Technologies is presenting at the JPMorgan Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on May 16 in Boston; the Barclays Capital Global Tech Conference on May 23 in New York City; and the Cowen & Company Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on May 30 in New York City. ","[Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Schwartz from Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on the revenue backlog and how you envision this sort of going forward. And the question is, is that if you are seeing an increase in sort of upfront or perpetual deals, and I think you've talked about a trend of where duration should come down here over the next year or 2, it seems like that could create a situation where backlog could shrink because of these 2 items. I just wanted to sort of get your thoughts on sort of the model longer term with some of these moving parts in the model.","Richard J. Beckert","Aaron, this is Rich. Just a quick note, I guess revenue backlog in total is slightly down. You can see that in current, we are up. That comes with a couple of things. If you recall, we had a large system integrator last year, that dragged about 3 points of that current when you look at it from a year-over-year. And you do need to recall, going all the way back to last July, we will have a tailwind this year as we come through our portfolio into FY '14, which will then turn around and become a strong tailwind for us. So you'll see the backlog burn down, and then, as we go out over time, it'll start to rebuild.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question I had is you talked in the commentary about a desire to accelerate the performance of acquisitions. And I just wanted to see if you could put that in context, because I know you've made a number of changes here in the sales -- or the market segmentation, et cetera. I mean, is the commentary about accelerating the performance of acquisitions now just sort of executing on a lot of the changes you've made here? Or are there still changes to come?","William E. McCracken","Aaron, you know what, I guess a couple of points I'd make. First is that we are getting good return off the acquisitions we have made, and particularly, they've contributed to the ES portion of our business, where we think we grew ahead of the market last year. And as we look forward, as we said at the end of third quarter, too, we're looking to spend about $1 billion a year in development as well as acquisitions going forward in this year. And so we think there will be tuck-in kinds of things that we do, but there's a lot of developments coming out of it and products that come out of our development as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions. First one, on the mainframe side, you mentioned displacements and highlighted Chorus and a few things. And I guess we've failed to hear anybody in the market talk about seeing weakness or being displaced, and I'm just wondering who you think that share is coming from. Is it larger players? Is it smaller players? Any color there?","William E. McCracken","It's really coming across the board as far as the mainframe piece is concerned. In fact, I think, last year, we did discuss we had about 18 of those conversions last year. We had 60 this year. So that also, I think, plays into the large new enterprises we talk about with the segmentation in focusing on that. And then, the other very important piece is we invested in the mainframe now about 1.5 years ago and talked to you about Chorus, and we're seeing an uptake in the Chorus installs on that. So we think that's adding to the mainframe growth as well.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then just maybe a question for Rich. On the upfront revenue, I guess, we're actually seeing most of your peers go the other way, and they're obviously not in a situation where you are where they're almost 100% ratable. But we're seeing more business go that way, and I'm wondering. Your move in this direction, I mean, is it -- do you think it's winning you more business? Because in general, I think it's actually a less predictable model, and you get to go back the customer. You don't get to renew them on the larger contract. I'm just wondering what are you seeing as the positive offsets of a business where there is just more up front with less visibility.","Richard J. Beckert","So remember, inside of the SFO line we have our SaaS business. And our SaaS business year-over-year has grown quite a bit and actually drove 1 full point of growth. Then, you also have the perpetual business that's in there that you just spoke of. So it is a combination of both. The way we go to market, if you recall, the license and associated [ph] maintenance is different than how you actually record your revenue, right, which would be a radical business model. So from a pricing standpoint, we go to market actually in all 3 ways. We have where we rent, we have where we have license up front, we have a SaaS business. So we go to market with what makes sense most for our competition and our customers.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you think you win business because -- it that actually helping you win business? Is there anything you can point to in terms of the numbers that you've seen so far? Has that conversion started?","William E. McCracken","Selling outside of the renewal cycle, I think it absolutely allows us to generate a little bit of a price premium. But that being said, really, the customer and competition will dictate how we go to market more so than how we recognize our revenue.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Pretty strong quarter on bookings. And I think you expected on with bookings, slightly being [ph] down 5% in the year. I think you'd said you expected to be -- your portfolio to be down. It wasn't quite clear what happened. I know that you had one large deal it sounds like you didn't expect. How big was that large European deal? Was that a deal that was outside the original renewal portfolio maybe through next year, so we got it this year instead? So if you could just help us with those mechanics, it would be great.","Richard J. Beckert","Michael, we don't, as you know, [indiscernible]...","[Technical Difficulty]","Richard J. Beckert","So what you'll find is we have the one large transaction that was outside of the renewal cycle in Europe. But look, as you know we won't talk about the size of those deals. That actually was a great win for CA. It allowed us to demonstrate our broad portfolio, and it allowed for the customer who had some capacity needs, it allowed us to be able to close on that a little sooner than it was anticipated. So as you said, we had anticipated a lower year-over-year compare, and we were able to fill some of that in. It was a good win for both us and the customer.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","It looks like you got almost a point of margin expansion into next year.  That's great. Can you kind of break out where it's coming from? Is that mostly because you're coming off having made some acquisitions? I guess I'm just trying to get to, A, how you plan to do it and then, B, how sustainable that is going forward.","Richard J. Beckert","Okay, sure. So we're very confident in our 100 basis points of margin expansion next year. As you'd see when you go through the different segments, you can see the mainframe had a very strong year. Enterprise Solutions was flat year-over-year, so we expect to see those margins continue to expand. But the investments that we did in Q4 and the first half of the year are starting to pay dividends in places like Asia. As Bill talked about earlier, when we talked about moving the 200 people that were overlays into direct sales, that helps with the sales productivity. So although the total dollars being spent in sales and marketing were flat year-over-year, the productivity improves from that standpoint. G&A, we picked up almost 1 point year-over-year, and we expect to continue to see that improve. So it really comes down to we're going continue to execute on our differences. ","[Technical Difficulty]","William E. McCracken","I would also recall for you that we said in July and we reaffirmed that today that 37% margin is where we're going to be in 2015. And when you play that through, that says the margin is holding to advancing in the mainframe area, but you start going to the high teens in the ES area. So we're committed to that, committed to 35% this quarter; 37%, 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So Rich, a couple of quick questions. The first one is -- or I guess, general, it's not just you. On the enterprise sales, with Cisco's not-great statements yesterday in terms of the enterprise business, what's the sense in terms of pipeline, et cetera, in terms of your enterprise deals?","William E. McCracken","What was the last part of that? What about the enterprise deals?","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Get a sense in terms of the -- how you feel in terms of -- are you seeing any weakness in enterprise in terms of either the U.S. or international, in terms of ongoing to the next year, in terms of the pipeline, et cetera?","William E. McCracken","Yes, Mike (sic) [Mark], we see pipeline building, especially in the growth geographies: AP and Latin America. But I think I would repeat what we said last quarter, and that is we see a balanced environment out there, growth in our area, as it's indicated by the industry in the mainframe, probably in the flat to 1%; and in the ES area, probably in the 5% to 7% area. We're not seeing substantial changes as far as decision times are concerned, those types of things. I think we saw that flow through pretty much this quarter as we did last quarter.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And a second quick follow-up to Rick.  In terms of -- Rich. In terms of the cash, how much is now onshore versus offshore? How are you tracking in terms of that, in terms -- in order to be able to delivery of the cash back to shareholders?","Richard J. Beckert","Right. So 36% of that is the U.S., about $1 billion. So we're actually sitting pretty well. As you saw, our Q4 was a very strong results. And as you can see, we're pretty content with the 4% to 6% guidance that we gave for CFFO for next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore Partners.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just 2 really quick ones. I guess, first just on the revenue guidance for next year, can you just talk to me maybe qualitatively about what that implies for the international business? Does the international business have to get back to at least sort of flat year-over-year growth for that to be possible? And then I guess, secondly, understanding that there's a lot of moving pieces with this, but would you guys talk about your longer-term margin guidance? And most of the deals are going to do in the enterprise side are going to be dilutive to some degree. So are you giving us -- is there potential for you guys to outperform, and then the deals will start bringing you back to those levels? Or if you make acquisitions, and you're talking about $1 billion deal, would those be potentially -- would you have to reset sort of the margin guide depending on those deals?","William E. McCracken","Let me come back, Kirk, on a couple of points. What I said on the $1 billion is development and acquisitions. So -- and then as we've said in the past, we're usually in the $600 million range for developments. So that was that $1 billion on that. On the international business, particularly we saw improvement in both Asia Pacific and Latin America. We've talked about Latin America before, that it's running strong. As a geography, it's running strong for us. We saw growth this quarter in Asia as well, too. Now obviously, we know what the macroeconomics are in EMEA. We saw, as we reported last quarter, a flattening of our business in EMEA, and we think that we clearly have the right management in place there and that as we move through this year we'll see an improving environment there. But it'll be back-end loaded as we get through that. So I think that gives you probably a pretty good -- and I'm going to throw it to Rich for the second part of that question.","Richard J. Beckert","So Kirk, the way I would look at this, if you looked at our FY '12 growth of 7 points, we had 2 of those from the large system integrator that we did last year. We had one non-reoccurring from the mainframe. Then we had 2 points through acquisitive growth and 2 points of organic. In FY '13, what you'll see is we\u2019re going to grow the 2% to 4%, which says we're going to grow with or faster than the market in order for us -- so that's weighting of how we go. And just again, clarification, as Bill had said, we spend almost $670 million in development a year, so to give you an idea of that $1 billion that we talked about. Does that clear that for you?","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of John DiFucci from JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bill, that was really helpful going through the market segmentation, how you're focusing the sales force in different segments. But can you just address exactly how these -- how people are being compensated? And it sounds like you have more people -- or maybe less people focused on renewals, and we talked about that before. But can you -- is that the case? And are more people today now being compensated entirely after just going after new business?","William E. McCracken","Yes, John, you are in some good points. We've talked about this in the past with you and agreed with you and we're talking about that now for several quarters. So let me try to split it out. It is in the 3 segment areas. One of the things we did in the area of what would include the renewals on the existing large enterprises, which is about 80% of our revenue, we've delayered a lot of the support folks and other sales support kind of folks that we had in there. A lot of those folks now have been applied in the segment that is the large new enterprises that we'll be driving at. That by design, then, improves productivity, both in large existing accounts, but as you look at the large new, we're also doing that through partnering, so the productivity there is better than the model we've had. And you asked about the compensation fees.  On the large new enterprises, we've taken a bit of a different track there with that, in that we put a 2-year plan in place for our sales reps there to give them the opportunity to build the relationship with the customer, where we'd land with a very high-tech offering which we have, like an ITKO, unique in the industry, and then spread out from there. The compensation on a large existing is similar to what it was before, but the productivity changes and then a lot of the new resource we've talked about, the 300 that we've talked about for the last couple of quarters, has been deployed, and that's going after the about 7,000 accounts from growth that are from $300 million to $2 billion. And that is telly [ph] capability along with partner capability and some direct. So the productivity piece there is substantially different than what the other 3 parts are. Let me stop and see if you have another question with respect to that.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, that was it. That's actually helpful, Bill. So it's -- and it's understandable that at least people focused on enterprise accounts, especially those accounts that as of yet have not been productive, are going to need some time to develop those relationships. But it also sort of begs a second question for Rich. Rich, in your prepared remarks, you said the Enterprise Solutions, the profit margins -- well, they were down. I mean, we saw that. But you said that, that was primarily due to sort of acquisition integration, I think. But I guess was it also due to some of what Bill's talking about here? And is it -- will we continue to see those margins somewhat suppressed? I mean, listen, the overall margins were actually really good this quarter, it was great to see. But should we -- should our expectations for the ES business be -- for margins be somewhat suppressed for a couple of quarters, anyway, or maybe even a few quarters?","Richard J. Beckert","So the way I would put it into a couple of bullets for you. Q4 clearly has seasonality that gets pushed into that, which tamps down the margin growth. But inside of that, we also had ITKO, so it makes it for a difficult compare year-over-year. And then the last part of that is as we grow out of the product cycle either new product, which is what we have had invested in some of the areas, or as Bill just described, the build-out of the sales team, that should -- in the back half of the year and into the following year, you'll start to see that from a revenue growth rate. So the margin expansion -- we're very confident in the 35% for next year, and you heard Bill talk about the 37% as we go out over time. So we think we're on track for that. It's just a rate and pace for us to continue to invest like we did. We started to talk about this in the June, where we're going to move the 300 folks, and now you see them, they are quoted. They're out in the field, and they're starting to sell as we speak. So that's just starting to pay off in the back half of the year.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. And it's good to hear you start to talk about things like 37%, but I'm still waiting for you guys to talk about things with a fore handle on it, but I don't want to push you too hard. One last question for Rich. Rich, you gave -- you put up a slide during the Analyst Day back in July, and it showed -- I mean, you didn't have, I don't think, numbers on it. But it was something that with the renewal portfolio. And I know you said the renewal portfolio will be down next year. But can you just remind us again when we should expect that? And this is just a timing issue.  We all know that in our models. Can you just sort of remind us when we would expect that to reverse?","Richard J. Beckert","Sure. So just to go back at that time frame, we have talked about '12 being down 20%. Then we had told you, we had refreshed that down to 15%, and we actually closed better than that even in fiscal '12. So we're saying now FY '13, it will be down single-digits, and then it starts to come back in '14 and '15. So the reason why we\u2019re seeing single-digits is -- I don't want to put the number out but I did [ph], and then you'll have to walk it down because we will have like the large company in Europe last quarter who decided they wanted to go early. And so that number will move around. They don't move out, they tend to move in.","William E. McCracken","Okay, so let me wrap up, if I can. So as we look at this year with our organic guidance of 2% to 4% revenue, we think we hold and gain share, especially as we look at the ES marketplace. It's going to be done through 3 primary things: one, were going to pay close attention to our segment marketing operations and performance, and we'll see that grow in its performance as we go through the back end of the year. We're going to continue to focus on our margin improvement. We are committed to the 35% margin for this year, and as I said, that'll put us on the track to move to the 37% that we've committed for 2015. And then, we're going to keep continuing focus on the EMEA improvements, as I talked about earlier in the call, and continue our growth from the geographies, both AP and LA.
