At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mike Mullin, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Mike Mullin - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in Flowserve's first quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Roueche, Interim Chief Financial Officer.

Let me begin by expressing how excited and honored I am to be at Flowserve. I've long admired Flowserve for its leadership position in the flow control industry, as well as its comprehensive product portfolio, global footprint and customer relationships. We have an outstanding team of people which have helped the company build its strong reputation over the course of more than 200 years.","This is now my fifth week in my new role and I wanted to share with you what I'd been doing since my first day. In my first two weeks, I conducted extensive business reviews with the operating platforms to gain a better understanding of our products, internal processes and go-to-market strategies. Additionally, I met with each of the corporate functional teams to assess our capabilities and effectiveness to support the business.","The following week, I visited five of our manufacturing facilities in North America to meet our people at the local level and better assess our operational and manufacturing capabilities. And last week, I visited with key customers to better understand their needs and requirements during this dynamic time in our industry. While I've certainly learned a lot during the short period of time, Flowserve is a large global business operating across a complex set of industries and it's very clear to me that I have more to absorb regarding our business and the nature of our downstream markets.","What I can say is that I'm even more excited today about Flowserve's prospects and future of our business than when I accepted the role. There are a number of reasons for this enthusiasm. First, our people are one of our greatest strengths. The employees at Flowserve are passionate, committed and eager to perform. I've met and visited with nearly a thousand associates in the past few weeks. And I am truly encouraged by both the experience and the up and coming talent that we have in this company.","Another key attribute is our leadership position in the industry. I've gained a better appreciation for how strong our product and brand heritage really is. We have a significant installed base with over 2 million pumps worldwide. Additionally, Flowserve has a broad and comprehensive portfolio of pumps, valves and seals that allows us to place products and services in the most industrial applications.","The aftermarket business is especially unique to Flowserve. There is no other competitor in the industry that can match the combination of our installed base, customer relationships and local QRC network. I see the aftermarket business as a key growth enabler by capitalizing on our extensive installed base with innovative services and technologies.","Finally, I find the timing of the macro environment encouraging. We're in the third year of the one of worst cyclical downturns in the industry. While I'm not ready to definitively call a bottom, we are seeing encouraging signs in most aspects of our business. The long-term fundamentals that drive our industry remain very much intact, including growing demand for energy of all types, the emergence of a larger urban middle class, worldwide population growth, and strengthening GDP. I feel like I've joined Flowserve at truly an opportune time in this cycle.","It is also important to recognize that we're still very much a company in transition. We continue to progress our transformational realignment program and are working towards doing so efficiently, while delivering the planned savings. And while the turnaround of the IPD platform is a critical focus area for us, we also recognize the opportunity we have to drive improved operational performance across all aspects of our business.","My initial focus at Flowserve will be on our business fundamentals like ensuring a solid yet lean support structure that provides the foundation for growth, driving consistency in our operating performance and focusing the organization on cash flow conversion. I would also like to recognize the accomplishments of prior leadership, particularly during the challenging downturn, and would especially like to thank my predecessor, Mark Blinn, for his support throughout this transition.","Let me now turn the call over to Jay for more detail on the quarter.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our press release yesterday, Flowserve's first quarter results were solid overall and, in particular, our adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 kept us on pace for our full year expectations. We're also pleased with our bookings growth both year-over-year and sequentially and the first quarter's book-to-bill of over 1.1 is the highest level since the second quarter of 2014.","Our reported earnings per share of $0.11 included our adjusted items such as $0.06 of below the line currency, $0.06 of realignment costs and $0.02 for an inventory write-down in Brazil. Both reported and adjusted earnings included approximately $8 million related to accelerated non-cash long-term incentive plan recognition, as well as approximately $2 million of executive transition-related expenses.","Turning to bookings on a constant currency basis, we delivered bookings growth of 5.3% year-over-year which included the Hengli award we announced earlier during the quarter. This project helped drive original equipment bookings up 7.4% versus the 2016 first quarter. Our aftermarket business remained resilient with bookings growth this quarter up 3%.","Flowserve's quarter-end backlog increased to over $2 billion or up 5.6% compared to year-end 2016, which was supported by a book-to-bill above 1 in all of our reported segments. From an end market perspective, constant currency bookings in our largest served industry, oil and gas, delivered an increase of nearly 37%. While the Chinese refining orders certainly helped EPD, all of our segments saw double-digit oil and gas growth compared to a year ago.","Bookings in the chemical market also increased slightly, while power and general industries saw year-over-year bookings decline. Regionally, with our large award, Asia delivered a 49% increase in bookings and Europe produced its fourth consecutive quarter of growth, up nearly 3% as compared to the 2016 first quarter. North American bookings were roughly flat compared to the prior year, while headwinds in the Middle East and Africa and in Latin America continued with bookings down 17% and 23% in those geographies, respectively.","Moving to the income statement, first quarter sales declined 7.8% on a constant currency basis to $863.6 million reflecting our lower starting backlog in 2017. Aftermarket sales as expected were less impacted, down only 3% on a constant currency basis and represented about 47% of our total revenue for the quarter. As we indicated in our original guidance, we expect each of the remaining quarters of 2017 to generate revenue levels higher than what we produced in the first quarter.","Looking now at our gross margins, at 31.5%, our adjusted gross margin was down 180 basis points versus the prior year's first quarter. Loss of sales leverage and the related under-absorption was the largest factor in the decline. So, when combined with the competitive pricing environment, these headwinds were enough to offset our incremental savings we achieved through our realignment program.","On a reported basis, including realignment charges of approximately $5 million, our reported gross margin decreased year-over-year 190 basis points to 30.6%. We continued to make progress on our disciplined cost management initiatives, although SG&A was elevated in the first quarter. Cost containment remains a key focus area, especially as volume levels are challenged at this part of the cycle.","First quarter SG&A declined $14.9 million year-over-year or about 6.3%. Excluding realignment and other adjusted items for both periods, SG&A declined over $13 million or 5.8%. In the 2017 first quarter, SG&A was negatively impacted year-over-year by approximately $2 million of executive transition costs and by a $1 million increase in accelerated non-cash long-term incentive recognition versus the prior year.","On an adjusted basis, first quarter operating margin declined 240 basis points to 7%, largely due to the loss of top-line leverage and sticky SG&A. Reported operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 5.4%. Our adjusted tax rate of approximately 28.2% in the first quarter provided some benefit to our results as compared to the full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%.","Turning quickly to cash flow, first quarter operating cash flow improved approximately $10 million as compared to a year ago. Cash costs associated with our realignment program were roughly $14 million this quarter. And we continue to expect a total of approximately $140 million for the full year. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders while also investing in our business to drive long-term profitable growth. In the first quarter, we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends and invested $16 million in capital expenditures.","Turning now to our 2017 outlook, with solid first quarter results which included some timing benefits, we reaffirmed our full year EPS target ranges of $0.72 to $1.02 on a reported basis and $1.55 to $1.85 per share as adjusted. We also continue to expect a full year revenue decline between 6% and 11% versus 2016, which includes an expected currency headwind of about 2.5% or approximately $0.10 per share.","As in past years, our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance excludes realignment expenses as well as below-the-line foreign currency effects and the potential impact of other discrete items such as the recently announced planned divestiture of our Gestra business. Transaction is expected to close soon. And once complete, we expect, with all else equal, that it will have a modest dilutive impact to our full year 2017 adjusted earnings but will produce a gain on sale benefiting our reported earnings. The timing of the completed transaction and the balance sheet at closing will determine the final amounts.","We also continue to expect net interest expense in the $60 million to $63 million range for the full year, with a tax rate of 30% to 31%. While Flowserve has traditionally experienced seasonality in our results, we continue to believe the second half weighting of this year's quarterly earnings profile will be more pronounced than in prior years.","With regard to 2017 cash usage, in addition to the anticipated realignment spending, we're also planning for approximately $100 million in dividends for our shareholders, capital expenditures in the $90 million range, $60 million for scheduled debt repayments, and global pension contributions of around $25 million, mainly to cover our service costs as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.","With that review, let me turn the call back to Scott before we open the line to your questions.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Thanks, Jay. Before we open the call to questions, let me finish with a few closing comments. Flowserve has tremendous opportunity ahead. We have a strong team and a great platform and I plan to leverage my experience to capitalize on the opportunities to improve, streamline and simplify processes across the company. We still have work to do, but I believe the company has a great foundation from which to build on.","As I said earlier, my focus will be on driving revenue, profitability and cash flow, while continue to be a value partner for our customers, all while providing a great place to work for our employees. I look forward to meeting many of you in the months ahead. Please note that you have my commitment that our ongoing efforts will be focused on initiatives that drive long-term shareholder value.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Good morning, Mike.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So, can we just talk on the order side and maybe give a little more context to the aftermarket shorter-cycle type pieces of the portfolio? Plus 3% on the order side, maybe some talk about kind of a twofold thing. One, kind of how that trajectory was over the last three, four, five months? And then, secondarily, what the customer commentary looks like in terms of turnaround, service, and if you're seeing more positivity from them on that side?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, Mike. So, as you mentioned, the order books were up about 3% on a constant currency basis. I think if you look at the aftermarket bookings level at $450 million, it's a good zone for us, down from the $500 million to $510 million that we've had in prior high periods. So, this $450 million to $460 million range, I think, is a good area. It's been up in all divisions. If you take a look at the quarter-to-quarter, it was also up sequentially for FLS. So, that's another good sign that we take a look at.","North America, I would say, was particularly strong in the parts business. We are seeing some good North America activity. The bidding activity, particularly in the Gulf Coast, is up towards \u2013 and has risen in the February, March period as we came to the back end of the quarter, particularly in the pump parts, in our seal business. I think customers are still cautious on their maintenance spend. So, we have to put that caution out there. But I would say, overall, a good trend and a good, solid position in terms of Q1.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then second question on the IPD margins. It certainly sounds like you feel much better about the underlying performance there than what was seen in the numbers. Maybe you could talk and help us a little bit with how that cadence works through the year from an improvement perspective, 1Q, obviously the low, seasonally tougher part of the year on top of it. What kind of margin performance and progression can we expect from here and are these past due backlog issues in the rearview mirror at this point?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, Mike. I mean, if you look at the margins in Q1, I mean, I think the business came in at where we expected it to be in terms of Q1 margins. We obviously have a lot of work to do in that business. We've been working in the turnaround mode for the last several months. We're making good progress, I would say, in our manufacturing cadence, in our supplier base, as well as getting our inventory levels where we need them to be, so that we can support the lead times.","What we see in terms of progress is good progress on the past due backlog. So we've significantly come down on the past due backlog since previously reported in 2016, so good progress there. The lead times, which is we track about over 10 to 12 of our products, several of those are at the market levels for the lead times. We're continuing to work on a few others, so that's another good sign.","And I would say if I you take a look at the bookings, up sequentially almost 9% and a little bit over 9.5% sequentially, I would say that's another good sign that we're starting to see some positive movement. We have a lot of work to do. It takes us \u2013 it will take us a long time in terms of going forward, in terms of getting the business to performing at the levels. But I would say if you take a look at the progression with the Q1 being fairly negative, then I would see that progression more positive through the year.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And does that imply positive margins in the second quarter in that unit or is it going to take a little more time than that?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. We're not going to guide on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but if you take a look at the overall earnings \u2013 I mean, IPD needs to perform and needs to perform and progress throughout the course of the year if we are going to get to these guidance ranges that we put out there.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Understand and appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, Scott or Jay, how are you thinking about the large project bookings market moving forward? Obviously, you had a good quarter of OE bookings with a large China refinery related award. But if you strip that out, OE bookings was down. So can you talk about your visibility for the more of these larger OE bookings over the rest of the year on 2018? Specifically in the presentation, I think you mentioned that the ethylene cycle maybe being still going down before it goes up, so maybe you can talk about that, too.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Andy, I'll start and then turn it over to Scott for additional commentary. But bottom-line, over the last two years, the project business has been very challenged for us. The Hengli award that we just received was something that we've been working on probably close to a year. Timing on when awards actually come through is always difficult to predict, but we were delighted to have achieved that award in the first quarter.","And it's safe to say that there is other projects out there that we're pursuing that are of the size maybe not equivalent to Hengli, but certainly it's not the only one that we've been working with E&Cs and customers on that ultimately we expect to come through FID and hope that we're in a good position to win. And so, it's just part of our business. We're glad to see larger project work in our backlog, not necessarily saying one is a trend, but one is better than none. And there is other opportunities out there for us. Scott, I don't know if you want to add some more.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. No, I'll just add more generally. Tom touched on our aftermarket business and we feel pretty good about the health and the robustness on that. And then, in addition to that, we have a base load of business and that seems to be relatively stable across each of our platforms and in each of the markets. But on the project side, we haven't seen this massive robust churn in terms of projects being let and moved forward, but we are seeing opportunities in each of the segments. So oil and gas, there's been several upstream projects that have moved forward and we participated in a few in the quarter, in addition to the downstream side with the Hengli order.","And on the chemicals side, while we don't see massive growth of the projects, we are seeing green shoots of activities. In fact, I was with customers last week in Houston that were talking about their portfolio and they were optimistic about securing additional projects in the chemical space. And on the power side, we're seeing movement on gas-fired power plants in North America and then parts of Asia as well. So I think projects are out there. We need to be very focused to win them and we need to pick which ones we want to win. And in the project market, it is incredibly competitive at this point. And until our competition has higher capacity utilization, pricing will still be challenged. So I'd say we're going to be laser-focused on the ones we want to win and the ones that we can deliver effectively, as we go forward.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's helpful. Scott, you mentioned in the release that you're impressed with Flowserve's extensive installed base of pumps, valves and seals. I think Flowserve historically had some issues measuring and then harnessing the true potential aftermarket opportunity of its own installed base. I know it's early but do you think that (23:37) and do you see a significant opportunity to really improve Flowserve's capability to grow with the aftermarket business off its own installed base?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I would say, well, I'm not ready to launch into what is the strategy for aftermarket. But what we know and we said in the call earlier is that there's 2 million installed pumps out there. And then in addition to that, when we look at our seals business and our valves, we've got a massive installed base. And so any installation that you go to, whether it's an oil and gas or chemical or power, we've got products sitting in critical applications in those facilities.","And what we need to decide is we do a really good job today on parts, repair and services, but how do we take that next step in capturing more of that entitlement on our installed base. And so I think there's a lot to do there. I'm not ready to talk about where we advance to. But it really is around reliability and making sure that our equipment is the most reliable out there. And we can communicate effectively with our customers on what that reliability looks like and what we do when we think that something is going to go in need for service.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Scott, you mentioned capacity utilization and the impact on pricing. I wonder if you guys have any comment on when you think the industry's capacity gets back in line with volume. I mean, I think that's probably the first point in time where we could hope to see any pricing improvement. Just any idea you guys have there.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'll start and then probably turn it over to Tom for some more specifics. But I mean we just looked at ourselves, right. We've got an active program with the realignment to take capacity out and that's really needed right now in the industry. And we know the peer group for us are doing similar exercises. We don't know their detailed plans and how far that goes forward. So, it's a difficult question to answer. But also the other side of this is market activity coming up, right. And so I think there's \u2013 it's twofold. I'm not going to say that we're seeing substantial traction on pricing at this point, but we are optimistic that we've stabilized on pricing and we're moving forward into a better environment in that regard. Tom, do you want to add anything specific?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I would. I mean, if you take a look at our business in three areas, the project business, the aftermarket business, the run rate business. I mean, we've consistently indicated that the project business has always been very price-sensitive. And we see that continuing, especially with the capital spend in the oil and gas and other capital-intensive industries. They're going to look at conserving cash. So we're probably not going to see a lot of larger projects in the next period. So I would expect that to still have some pricing pressure.","The aftermarket business \u2013 it's held fairly, I would say, steady over this period. So that business continues to have the profile that we've consistently indicated in the past. And then the rest of our business, which is the run rate business, has held up pretty well overall in the business, primarily on the oil and gas side and to some extent the chemical side, a little bit less in power as people have indicated. But I think we have a good run rate in aftermarket business, holding in there with the pricing levels.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up is kind of on the outlook for the back half of the year in aftermarket. I know you're heavy aftermarket in refinery, and chemical turnarounds and things like that. Have you begun to have discussions with customers about their plans for the turnaround phase-in in the fall and when would you expect to have a fairly firm idea of what that back half looks like?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","We've recently got some inquiries from customers asking us to add on resources in anticipation of, I think, a resource drain that they may be looking at overall on the business. I wouldn't say we've seen an uptick in any of the forward plans relative to retrofits and revamps coming up in the fall. But what I would say is that, particularly in the aftermarket areas, as I've mentioned already, we have seen some increased activity coming in, particularly in the North America. And then couple that with a better North America distribution piece, there is some \u2013 I would say there's some optimism, but I'm not sure I would sit that out there as a trend going forward.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Mortgage (sic) [Markets]. Please go ahead.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning and welcome, Scott.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So kind of piggybacking off of a couple of prior questions, but maybe a little bit of a different angle, there are \u2013 it seems to me that there are three or four businesses that you guys have historically been in, the large oil and gas projects, conventional power gen fossil and nuke, which just kind of seem like those are businesses that are maybe kind of shelved for some time. And I really kind of want to get underneath the power business in particular.","Tom, this was a business where, at its height, we were doing $800 million in bookings and we're all the way down to this sort of $100 million in the first quarter and annualized $400 million, which you don't want to do, of course. But nevertheless what does it going to \u2013 I guess the simple question is what percentage of your business is now sort of more natural gas-fired?","Because the fossil side and the nuke side do seem to be either deteriorating or in some cases even gone and the nat gas side is much lower content for an equipment maker. So I guess the two questions that would stem from that would be is how big is your natural gas business within power? And when do you see power bookings really kind of bottoming out? They've been weak for some time.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Let me see if I can, Scott, kind of wrap your comments in a context. First of all, in the power business, you still have a large installed base. So you still have that aftermarket annuity both across coal, certainly nuclear, as well as natural gas projects. In addition, you do have a North America, I would say, resurgence in terms of combined cycle because of the low prices. So you have this combined cycle market that is being driven primarily out of the North America area.","As you've mentioned, the coal units are under discussion. Several of them are retiring in North America. But then we also have pockets where coal is still being driven like India, particularly on the supercritical side, to some degree China, even though they're reevaluating those. But then I would say that you have a shift occurring now with renewables. So, even though you have a little bit of downturn on the coal side, you have renewables picking up on the solar side both in terms of Europe, to some degree the U.S., as well as in China.","So, it's a very \u2013 I would say the power market is a very robust but yet challenged because we don't have any single trend going on, but we do have multiple shoots happening, still a good aftermarket basis, but I would say some opportunities in nuclear. I mean they've announced to go ahead with the UK nuclear business. Obviously, we're having some troubles in the U.S. with some of the Westinghouse units in the U.S. which is being worked through. So, it's an industry that I think is going to have some interesting perspectives on the renewables and the natural gas over the next couple years.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, would you say that that all taken together, Tom, means that it's going to be a while longer before that business's bookings bottom out?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","I've never looked at the power business as bottoming out already. I would say the business has been maneuvering fairly consistently over the last several years. And I think the industry is trying to find through the regulations which haven't yet been established dramatically in many countries. They're still trying to figure out where that is.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Fair enough.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","And they're still trying to sort through that. So, I would say, Scott, I don't think it's as evident yet in terms of where that business is going and whether it pops or stays in the level it has for the last several years.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Last question. There seem to have been a number of outages in oil and gas refineries. And I guess it just surprises me a little bit that your customers' inquiries seem to be occurring but that this is not a more dramatic thing than what seems to be a reality out there. How do you \u2013 can you bridge that gap, Tom? The outages have been significant and it just seems like that they continue to find ways to push back turnarounds and otherwise. Could you help us bridge that gap?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. The way I would bridge that gap is I would say that they're still in this mode of managing the maintenance cost relative to conserving overall cash. And I believe we're going to be in that zone for a while. I think we're going to see shoots as we've begun to see them, particularly in the Gulf Coast here in the latter part of the quarter, as evidenced by our uptick in activity. But I would say we're not through that period yet where they're ready to, I would say, release and get to that next level of retrofits and revamps. And they're still evaluating that relative from a cash perspective.","I think if that begins to open up later on in the year, you may see some additional shoots come out towards the back, maybe the second half or early third quarter.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Charley.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. On the realignment program, can you just give a sense, once all is said and done and we get through this year, what your expectation might be for an incremental margin across those three segments or maybe even \u2013 if you're not going to give me that granularity then kind of as a whole? I'm just trying to understand \u2013 and is there \u2013 I'm assuming that that's not the end of the line, right.","I mean, there's got to be some \u2013 as we go into 2018, and maybe 2019, some smaller \u2013 just putting out fires and re-examining what you've got once the whole realignment program is done and kind of optimizing that. Can you give us a sense of kind of what we can expect even beyond kind of the big realignment program you've got going on right now?","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Charley, sure. I'll take a stab at it. If you look at the first quarter of this year, I felt like our decrementals performed a lot better than they did last year for us. When we look at the full year, we also expect decrementals to perform better. The real upside related to realignment is going to be when the market starts to show its turn. I think you've been able to see within our income statements some of the benefits of the actions we've taken thus far. But really, as you know, the markets declined faster than we've been able to take cost out. So under-absorptions continue to be an issue for us.","We think as we get our footprints where we want it to be and get our cost structure where we want it to be, that when you see the business start to turn, you'll see a nice pickup in our incremental margins. If you look back at that 2014 and we could get back to that level of volume within the business and currency where it was at that time, I think, you'd see a substantial improvement in our earnings per share from the $3.76 that we delivered.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And, Scott, I guess, I just want to ask you early days on the job, obviously, but in terms of the M&A and your viewpoint on M&A transactions and how that market looks? You guys have a lot of stuff going on internally right now to deal with integrations, things like that. But is that something that you're actively looking at still or is it kind of backburner and you'll get to it once you sort out the current issues?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'm not going to say M&A is completely on hold. But certainly my first 30 days have not been focused on who do we acquire and what we divest. But what I'd say is from a portfolio standpoint, right, we're always looking to high grade our portfolio of products and services. And so we announced the Gestra divestiture in the quarter and that was an opportunity to move something out of the business and get paid for it and something that we didn't think that we could grow as aggressively as potentially in somebody else's hands.","So, we'll always be looking at those things and we're going to continue to do that and we're not going to stop with my arrival or where we are with our current performance. And so those are ongoing. What I'd say is anything big or strategic right now would be obviously something that we would have to think about significantly. And right now just being 30 days in, right, my real focus is learning this business, understanding it and then developing our long-term plans for the future.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And I also want to pass on my welcome and congratulations to Scott.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you. How are you?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Scott, they always say timing is everything and it's nice that you get to start right at the time where maybe there are signs of bottoming, but certainly the worst of the oil turmoil could be over.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","We sure hope so.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Well, the first question is, look, I know you've been in the seat for 30 days and there's still some learning curve and listening tour that you need to address. But I'd love to have you comment on your confidence and comfort level in the preexisting realignment program. So, you're inheriting this program. How much have you vetted it and might there be an opportunity to make changes or do further kind of capacity cuts or streamlining?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. No. Tom has been really good about giving me an update on that. So, I've actually sat in our war room and met with the team on kind of where we are and status. And, obviously, we had some hiccups in the early days of that realignment program. I'm very confident in what we're doing and how we're doing it now, how we're managing the program and the decisions that we've made.","I do think there's a potential opportunity to accelerate the program. And so Tom and I've been discussing what can we do and what more we can do. Obviously, those are big decisions and we've got to be thoughtful about that as I'm not prepared to do that in the first 30 days. But I do think there is opportunity to take overall more costs out of the business and start to streamline and drive more simplicity in our delivery methods.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then I really like hearing you say right up front that one of the first priority is to focus on cash flow conversion. And maybe you could just share with us your initial thoughts and what the opportunity is and maybe this is also a good time to ask about the CFO search?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Let's start with cash first. Look, I mean, cash is critical and it's super important that we're converting cash flow at the rate that we need to. If we go back over the last two years, Flowserve \u2013 we haven't been able to do that as effectively as we want. To me, the inventory levels are too high and we have opportunity to drive that down. I will add, though driving inventory down in a downturn is not easy.","And so this is not going to happen next quarter or even the quarter after that. But we do need to get very focused on our working capital, particularly inventory, and really focus on inventory velocity, right. How do you see bring stuff in when it's needed and get things out the door on time and quickly. And so we will launch \u2013 there's been ongoing efforts here. We will launch a revised program and be very focused on how to do that going forward.","On the CFO front, we are actively looking for a CFO. What I'll say is we have a few internal candidates as well as external. That search is progressing nicely. And just, for me, what I'm looking for is a business partner that can go through this journey with me and someone that I can trust and has a good understanding of the business. They don't necessarily have to be from our space.","But I would think with the complexity within Flowserve, right \u2013 we're upstream and downstream in oil and gas, we're in chemicals and power, and renewables, and we've got a large geographic presence with a complex manufacturing network. So we're really looking for somebody that can understand that complexity and has got some operational background to help me make the changes that we need to make to, again, drive more simplicity into the business, be more streamlined and get the complexity out.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, everyone. Good morning.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Welcome, Scott.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you, Rob.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So what's the target on when you'd expect to have fully competitive lead times across IPD?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Tom, I think, that's a good one for you.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. We've probably analyzed so far about 12 of our different product lines. And I would say, right now, we're about 70% through with the lead times being at where we need them from a market perspective. I would say we're probably making good progress and we'll probably within the next, say, three months to four months be in a position where our lead times will be at a level that will allow us to participate in the market. But we've made good progress to-date and it's taken us a good five months to get those lead times down. So it's not like not a lot of hard work from a lot of different teams in that area. And obviously maintaining those lead times is important, too.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. That sounds pretty good. Anywhere else this is a factor? I mean, you're doing a very large extensive restructuring, moving a lot of stuff around. I mean, pockets outside of IPD were just given how much you're moving around lead times aren't kind of temporarily where they need to be?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","I mean there's always I would say \u2013 when you move a product from a sending to a receiving side, there is always a certain level of disruption. But I would say we've done good in all of our other realignments. Many of these have been in areas where we're moving capacity from one area to another where we've already had people doing that particular product. So I would say we have in the rest of the realignments not had the \u2013 I would say the broader lead time reductions like we've had in the IPD business.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yes. I'll just add to that. So when we look across the platform \u2013 and I've done a couple of the manufacturing facilities \u2013 other than the ones that are impacted by realignment and primarily IPD, the rest of the business lead times are at or below what's needed in the marketplace. Now, obviously, speed is critical in our business and we'll continue to work to drive that down for further flexibility, but I'm very comfortable with the rest of the business and where our lead times are at this point.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Just one last one for me, maybe just to level set on the earnings cadence through the rest of the year. I think over the last number of years, pretty consistently 24% to 25% of annual earnings in each of 2Q and 3Q. Is that what you expect to also this year with kind of a much heavier weighting the remainder in 4Q?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Rob, as we suggested in our original guidance, we expected the first quarter to be below our historical trends and we're expecting a ramp as the year progresses with the fourth quarter traditionally being the strongest quarter of the year. I don't want to try to get too much into 2Q or Q3 specifically, but very much a ramp is expected as the year progresses, as we drive solid bookings, get IPD turned around, and focus on our cost control.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, John.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, John.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. So I guess just a question on the top line. Clearly, much better performance than we thought and better performance than consensus have in the numbers. I was wondering if maybe what surprise relative to your number, if there was any kind of pull forward, if there's any kind of anything in the distribution channel, or just how to kind of reconcile the better top-line performance.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Sure, John. There were a number of factors there. And, clearly, we were pleased overall with our performance relative to our expectations back in February. I think one of the things that we did see is we were able to pull forward some work that was originally scheduled for Q2. And that has been a terrific change because, as you know, for several quarters in the past, we were talking about customers not accepting product when ready. And now to see them being willing to accept a little bit early, hopefully that will be a trend that will continue. We obviously try to pull forward each and every quarter and it was nice to see it done this quarter.","On the distribution front, we saw a nice pickup in distribution bookings this quarter and those normally turn pretty quick. And so I'm sure that follow through on the sales line as well. And so we knew going into this year that we were starting with a lower starting backlog that was going to have an impact and create an air pocket for us a little bit on the top-line. Frankly, I had to go back and look, but the levels we delivered were the lowest revenue levels since the first quarter of 2007. Obviously, we're expecting revenues to be higher in the remaining quarters of the year than they were in the first quarter.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. No, that's helpful color. Thank you. And then I guess any additional color on the inventory write-down in Brazil to provide?","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","I think, at the end of the day, we've gotten to a situation in Brazil where the work has dwindled down quite a bit. I don't think there's any surprises out there in terms of some of the challenges that our major customers had in the region. As a result, work has slowed down there. And I think, at this point in time, there's very little inventory left and we've got our hands around it and have accounted for it sufficiently.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Giannakouros from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","You alluded to capacity takeout, I think either earlier in Q&A or in your prepared remarks. I thought that was a cost takeout not necessarily a revenue-generating capacity comment. Did I not understand that right? And if it is revenue-generating capacity that is being taken out, do you have an estimate as to how much you and\/or the industry has taken out currently to match a new normal or a through-the-cycle normalized level? Thanks.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, Jim. As we've talked about in our realignment program, the takeout is predominantly footprint, square footage. At the end of the day, we expect that we'll be able to continue to deliver the equivalent of a 2014 level or better with our new realigned platform. There's certain regions that we're moving product to that it's a lot easier to run out a second or a third shift than some of the regions that we're leaving. And so we anticipate we will still have plenty of capacity for growth but we'll have a lot less underabsorption within the system as a result of lowering our actual physical facilities.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you. That's a nice reminder. I thought so. As a follow-up, the China refinery order, understanding I believe that you're accounting for it on a percentage of completion, when should we expect revenue impacts and how does that order and the progression there affect margins on EPD's OE revenues? Does volume carry the day or pricing execution pretty much in line with segment average?","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Well, as I think everyone knows, the larger project work tends to be more competitive. I would expect revenues to start being recognized this year as it's on percentage of completion accounting. I think it's certainly going to be a net benefit for us as we're absorbing costs within the facilities that may have otherwise been unabsorbed.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah. Scott, you know you're coming in at a good time when people are surprised that revenue number being higher than they thought and it's the lowest since first quarter of 2007, so that's a good problem.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","That is indeed.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","I had a question on IPD. You talked a lot about taking complexity out broadly across the portfolio. And my understanding is that like the products in IPD are something like 90% pre-configured and then it's the last 10% that really takes the time. Is there an ability to maybe provide more standard product across Flowserve's product line, things like more stock, less custom tailored to an application? Is that something that is looked at internally?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I think \u2013 I mean, when I say complexity, it's really around our internal process and how do we get the right products to the end users. And there's always opportunity here to rationalize and standardize our offering and to drive systems that can pre-configure the orders that are going to go to our customers. But I'll let Tom finish this because he's the one who's leading and running the business right now. But there are still opportunities to do that and it has been part of our program thus far.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So as Scott and I have discussed \u2013 I mean one of the major initiatives we got going on in the business is automating our run rate in configure-to-order business, as you've indicated, Joe. And what we're doing is we're trying to take it from automating the proposal in our configurators straight into a bill of material generation directly into our ERP manufacturing systems and trying to automate that process. That, I think, is a characteristic of the type of business that IPD has versus a highly engineered product. So that is one of the areas that we have keyed up as one of our growth initiatives going forward that should, I think, bode well in terms of the ability to go out and get market.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Fair enough. And then if we exclude the big Chinese order, when we look at your business in terms of percentage of revenue, I know historically we looked at like a 40%\/40%\/20% in terms of aftermarket and run rate and project. How much are we talking project now in that OE part if you strip out that big number?","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","It would probably be in the middle teens or less.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then lastly, Scott, obviously, early days for you, but is there anything that as you kind of walking the halls there, anything jump out at you as something that you might think about differently than the company has maybe looked at historically, just a different way of accomplishing things? Just what stuck out most over your first month there?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. No. It's been \u2013 I'll just start just the initial observations and I'll go to kind of where I see some early opportunities. But really \u2013 and I've gone to a lot of facilities and met a lot of people here in the first 30 days. It's been incredibly busy. But I'd just start with the talent at Flowserve is incredible. And we've got energetic, we've got smart people and they want to do the right things. And so I'm very impressed with the people and how they go about their business. We're talking about the portfolio and then the breadth of the aftermarket business and then just our extensive capabilities across the industry, right, from upstream, downstream oil and gas and the chemical and power and then the general industries themselves.","And then on the opportunity side, I touched on it earlier. But I do think there is ability to take more costs out of the business and potentially accelerate the realignment. I don't know what that is at this point, but it just feels like there's more opportunity here as well. And then I've said streamline and simplify a couple times. And Tom just alluded to how that works specifically within the IPD business. But I also think it applies here at the corporate office. And so by becoming very focused on what the fundamentals are in a key set of metrics, I do think that we can streamline what we're trying to do and then just provide more clear guidance out to our field and locations to progress on a common set of objectives and long-term goals.","And so I feel pretty good about that. I don't want to go into exactly what's changing. But we are introducing a new operating rhythm and metric cadence on how we go forward. We'll put a corporate calendar in place and we'll make \u2013 we'll be very transparent internally about what our metrics are and be very visible and talk about those regularly to help drive accountability within the organization.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks and good luck.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","No. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Steve.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","The timing of medium and larger-sized project is always a hard thing to predict. You guys did mention a number of things that you're pursuing. What is your base case for the final investment decisions and what have you baked into the guidance?","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Kind of a tough question to answer, Steve. If you look at how we came out with our original guidance, for the revenue decline, it was largely based off a $300 million headwind as a result of the lower backlog. And then our assumption was that we were going to have a consistent book and bill that we achieved in 2016. So the midpoint of our revenue guidance didn't assume any great ramps occurring on the top-line.","A lot of the ramp that we're going to need for the earnings in the remaining three quarters is going to be a result of getting that work that we're forecasting, keeping us on a similar pace to 2016, shipping the backlog on time as it's currently forecast, and then driving the cost savings and getting IPD continue to be turned around.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's helpful, Jay. Maybe just asked slightly different way, I mean, in terms of \u2013 what is the confidence do you have then that some of these mid and larger-sized projects that you have in your prospect list will move forward in the next couple of quarters, two to three quarters?","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","I would be surprised if we didn't see a few of them move forward and a few of them slip. It seems like a pretty common occurrence where customers will lay out their ideal timeline and often things shift to the right. But we've had several years of things shifting to the right and so I would expect to see a few of these start to be left.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance on the IPD business, but can you get to breakeven without 100% of your lead time at sort of market-competitive level or what are the most critical things that have to happen to get to at least breakeven...","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","I'd...","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","On an operating basis.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","No. I don't think all of our products all have to be at target levels for IPD to breakeven. I think getting the manufacturing processes correct and then continuing to win work there and then drive the cost out of the business and a lot of the processes and improvements that Tom spoke of earlier \u2013 those are really the keys to IPD.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great.

While our current outlook is somewhat cautious due to the soft macro conditions in Europe as well as moderating growth in Asia, which together have increased uncertainty in our end markets, we continue to focus on the items we can control to best position Flowserve to capture the infrastructure investment that is needed around the world, including our successful aftermarket business.","This quarter, we delivered solid earnings growth in spite of significant currency headwinds. Mike will provide further details, but as you know, a strengthening dollar materially impacts our reported results since nearly 2\/3 of our business is outside the U.S. and subject to currency translation.","Our bookings growth of 2.3% or 9% when adjusted for currency, included our first large project order of the year. IPD booked over $90 million of original equipment orders to support offshore oil and gas development. We remain optimistic about the medium- to long-term infrastructure investment opportunities in our energy end markets, particularly in North America, the Middle East and Brazil.","Additionally, our focused end-user aftermarket strategies continue to produce positive results. We were recently awarded a 5-year service agreement with Dow Benelux to perform maintenance of its rotating equipment and general machining in its Dutch facility. Our commitment to localization includes the buildout of a QRC to support Dow, as well as other customers in the area. This is a great example of the types of programs our end-user strategies target and the value we can add as customers increasingly look for a trusted partner to help improve the efficiency of their facilities and better manage their smaller service vendors.","Operating margins improved sequentially and year-over-year, in spite of the overall mix shift to lower-margin original equipment. Margins were also negatively impacted by shipments of lower-margin legacy backlog. Our improved margins reflect the operational excellence progress that Tom and his leadership team are making, as they drive on-time delivery, lower past due backlog, manage costs, improve the supply chain and reduce the cost of quality throughout the business.","We believe that we are gaining share in many of our markets, while we simultaneously increase the discipline and selectivity of our bidding process. Also, we continue to see steady progress in IPD as it moves towards its 14% to 15% margin goal. Simply put, I am pleased with the progress of Tom's team, but opportunities remain for further improvement.","Our solid backlog of nearly $2.9 billion, up over 7% since year end, has us well positioned to deliver on our financial targets for 2012 and beyond. We are particularly pleased that the quarter-end aftermarket backlog exceeded $700 million for the first time. And I'm proud that we've been successful in consistently growing our aftermarket franchise, even through difficult market conditions in 2009.","Turning to our business outlook, softening economic conditions in certain regions may push out the timing of some previously expected later-cycle large project investments. We remain confident that these projects will go forward since these investments are needed by the increasing global urban populations. Market uncertainty and volatility highlight the importance of Flowserve's diverse global platform and its ability to mitigate risk, especially through our aftermarket end-user strategies.","During the quarter, we also executed our long-term strategic initiative to improve the efficiency of our capital structure by taking advantage of our investment-grade status and attractive debt markets. We also continue to execute on our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete next year.","Even as we improve balance sheet efficiency, our commitment to increasing shareholder value through profitable growth remains, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. We will pursue opportunities to fill product, geographic and technical gaps in our portfolio using a disciplined process, focused on growing long-term value for our shareholders.","Looking forward to the fourth quarter and full year 2013, I'm confident, as evidenced by our strong year-to-date performance through the third quarter, that Flowserve's combination of operational improvements, the diverse end markets and geographies we serve, and almost $2 billion annual aftermarket run rate position us well to continue to capture profitable growth, margin improvement, share gain and create long-term value for our shareholders, even while considering the continuing uncertain and sometimes volatile macroeconomic environment.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results, with bookings of $1.19 billion, up 2.3% versus prior year, despite the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar and the economic challenges facing Europe. Our consolidated book to bill was 1.02, driven by a solid aftermarket book to bill of 1.04. While we continue to see elevated levels of feed and pre-feed activity through the third quarter versus prior year, we now anticipate the larger megaproject orders shifting to the mid to second half of 2013.","Turning to our year-to-date bookings by end market. We saw strength in the oil and gas, and chemical industries, along with modest growth in the general industries and water business. Regionally, the improvement has been concentrated in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America, partially offset by lower bookings into the Middle East\/Africa and to a lesser extent, Europe. Overall, the oil and gas business continues its broad-based, positive long-term outlook with North American pipeline business positively reacting to increased oil and gas transport activity.","Other areas of pipeline project developments showing promise include the Middle East, Argentina and Colombia, with offshore platform work continuing in Brazil. In August, we had a grand opening of our $37 million Rio plant investment that allows Flowserve to expand our existing footprint in the Brazilian market, including a state-of-the-art test facility.","In the power market, coal-fired plant opportunities in China and India remain on the horizon, as well as the potential for coal-to-gas conversion opportunities in the U.S. for both full and partial conversions. With the abundance of shale gas, combined cycle plants will bear the brunt of providing new capacity requirements.","The chemical market has seen good growth year-to-date, particularly in China and the Middle East. Additional shale gas finds in the U.S. and the abundance of existing shale gas will allow new chemical production to take place competitively in the U.S. for the global marketplace. Fertilizer plant opportunities also continue to drive the market. The mining sector has been mixed with concerns about overcapacity and demand, particularly in Europe and to a lesser degree, in China, which have dampened the short-term outlook.","Turning to the year-to-date sales mix by region. We grew the top line 5.5% or 11.2% on a constant currency basis. We have seen strong activity in Asia Pacific and North America and an increase in Latin America, which more than offset European weakness.","Now let me discuss our segment results for the third quarter. The Engineered Product division bookings decreased $14 million to $554 million, down 2.4%, but up 4.1% on a constant currency basis. Oil and gas bookings increased in the quarter, along with improvements in the water bookings in North America offset by a decrease in power. Regionally, we saw higher bookings in the Middle East and North America more than offset by decreased bookings into Europe, Asia Pacific and a slight decrease in Latin America. Sales decreased $7 million to $568 million, down 1.2% but up 5.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower original equipment sales and decreased sales into Europe and Latin America, partially offset by higher activity in Asia Pacific and North America. Aftermarket sales increased 2% or 7% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 33.9%, positively impacted by some shipments of higher-margin backlog as compared to the first half of 2012, as well as a mix shift to aftermarket sales and the benefits of lower cost associated with operational execution improvements. Operating margin declined 70 basis points to 15.3% due primarily to higher SG&A on increased sales-related expenses. EPD signed a 5-year services contract with Dow Benelux to provide maintenance and machine shop functions in the Netherlands to support Dow's local rotating equipment population of around 7,000 pumps. This maintenance agreement effectively outsources this work to Flowserve.","Bookings in the Industrial Product division increased $60 million to $284 million, up 27% or 34.6% on a constant currency basis, driven by improved activity in the oil and gas industry. This was due in large part to original equipment orders in excess of $90 million to supply thrusters over the next 5 years, which are used to stabilize and position offshore oil and gas platforms. This strength in Latin America, combined with increased North America pipeline activity, were partially offset by some softness in Europe. Chemical orders were also up. Sales increased $28 million to $244 million, up 13% or 18.6% on a constant currency basis. Strength in Asia Pacific, North America and Latin America was partially offset by lower sales into Europe. Original equipment sales were up 23% versus prior year or up 29% on a constant currency basis, as the sales mix shifted 600 basis points from prior year to 70% original equipment and 30% aftermarket.","Gross margin increased to 70 basis points to 24.3%. The improvement reflects continued traction on the IPD operational plan as we improve operational excellence, our on-time delivery, the supply chain and focus on disciplined cost management. Operating margin improved 320 basis points to 10.9% as a result of improved SG&A leverage, increased sales volume and the overall improvement in gross margin due to contract execution. IPD is realizing the benefits of our 2011 realignment activities, ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, on-time delivery, SG&A expense control, disciplined pricing policies and overall contract execution. I remain confident that we have taken the necessary steps to reach the targeted 14% to 15% operating margin by 2015.","The Flow Control division had a tough quarterly comparison to prior year. Bookings decreased $29 million to $381 million, down 7% as reported or down 1.1% on a constant currency basis. While most end markets were down, we did see improved bookings in the power industry, resulting from increased aftermarket nuclear activity in Korea and in Europe. Regionally, bookings improved into Europe and more specifically in Russia as a result of increased repeating [ph] orders, but this improvement was more than offset by declines in the Middle East\/Africa and Latin America.","Sales increased $26 million to $395 million, up 7.2% or 14.2% on a constant currency basis versus prior year. Sales growth was driven by original equipment sales in the oil and gas sector resulting from regional strength in Asia Pacific, North America, Middle East and Latin America, which more than offset decreased sales into Europe and Africa. Gross margins decreased 30 basis points to 35.4% due primarily to a shift in product line mix and a mix shift to original equipment. Operating margin was unchanged at 17.3%. Although operating income was up 7.1% or up 14.9% on a constant currency basis due to higher sales and cost control. SG&A as a percentage of sales was down 60 basis points to 18.2% as we continue to drive operational efficiency in the Flow Control division.","In summary, we are pleased with our progress of our initiatives in supply chain, on-time delivery, contract execution and quality improvements as we drive towards greater operational excellence.  Looking forward to our end markets, the oil and gas markets continue to see long-term growth prospects in the upstream, production and transport areas, with large megaprojects in the downstream area shifting to the mid to the second half of 2013. Power should continue at its current levels over the short term. The chemical market is beginning to show signs of softening to some degree, while mining appears to be mixed in the short term based on concerns about overcapacity and demand brought about by the world economic picture.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Over the last several months, I have met with many of you to discuss our earnings risk profile and the benefits derived from our diverse end markets, geographies and short cycle and long cycle exposures. We view this diversified lower risk profile as a key differentiator for Flowserve that allows us to constantly make and meet commitments and return value to our shareholders. As we look at year-to-date bookings, our focus on end-user strategy and our critical application engineering solutions for our customers has enabled us to drive organic growth above market growth. This is evident in our growing bookings despite a challenging macroeconomic environment.","Overall, year-to-date bookings increased $109 million, up 3.1% or 8.4% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with this growth as we increased our aftermarket capture and grew our installed base above market growth. The increase was driven primarily by the oil and gas and chemical industries, which more than offset decreased bookings within the power industry.","When we look at year-to-date sales numbers, the mix shifted 1% in favor of original equipment, which generally carries a lower margin than the aftermarket business and can pressure the margin profile. Sales increased $178 million over prior year, up 5.5% or 11.2% on a constant currency basis. At the end of last year, we had guided to top line revenue growth of 5% to 7% over 2011, and I am pleased that we are tracking in that range despite the stronger-than-expected currency headwinds through the first 9 months of the year.","Turning to the financial results. Sales for the third quarter increased 3.9% year-over-year or almost 11% on a constant currency basis. The sales increase was primarily driven by original equipment sales in IPD and FCD. Gross margins were down 20 basis points in the third quarter versus 2011, due to a mix shift towards original equipment partially offset by operational improvements. Similar to the first half of the year, there were approximately 200 basis points of margin impact due to low-margin projects flowing through earnings. While we anticipate shipping the majority of the remaining legacy backlog in the fourth quarter, we expect to see margin improvement on increased volume and better fixed cost leverage, which should more than offset this legacy impact. SG&A as a percent of sales in the third quarter decreased 60 basis points to 19.5% over the prior year, primarily due to better cost management. Operating margins in the third quarter were up 40 basis points to 14.2% on lower SG&A, partially offset by lower gross margin I discussed.","As we look at other expense income line, we continue to incur negative currency impacts due to the volatile U.S. dollar. The $0.12 loss below the line is primarily related to balance sheet revaluations in Mexico, the Eurozone and India. Additionally, the stronger dollar versus the third quarter of 2011 resulted in an above-the-line translation impact of $0.18. So on a year-to-date basis, we have experienced $0.85 of currency-related headwinds when compared to 2011, with approximately $0.45 above the line and $0.40 below the line. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 26.1%, which is below our structural rate of 28% to 30% but was still above last year's unusual low third quarter rate of 22.9%. We continue to expect the full year 2012 rate to be at the lower end of the 28% to 30% range.","Turning to cash flows. We had another strong quarter as we remain focused on improving cash flow conversion. We generated $63 million in operating cash flow in Q3 or $123 million year-to-date, which is a $273 million improvement over prior year. CapEx in the second quarter (sic) [third quarter] was $27 million. We have invested $84 million year-to-date and continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the $125 million to $135 million range for the full year.","As Mark mentioned, we made progress in the quarter on our long-term capital structure strategy as we move towards our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1x to 2x. We issued $500 million of 10-year public notes and executed a new $1.25 billion bank credit facility. At the end of the quarter, total debt to EBITDA was 1.2x. The total financing activity resulted in fees and a write-off of deferred financing costs totaling approximately $1.4 million. This more efficient capital structure will continue to provide us with the flexibility necessary to grow the business organically and through strategic bolt-on acquisitions with room to return capital to shareholders.","During the quarter, we repurchased $101 million of shares, which brought our year-to-date buyback total to $534 million. Our $1 billion share repurchase program has $524 million remaining, which we expect to complete next year. We also returned $18 million to our shareholders in dividends in the third quarter and $56 million year-to-date.","I would like to spend some time on how we view allocation of shareholder capital. This slide visually shows the systematic process the management team and our board contemplates when determining how best to use capital. We are committed to profitably growing our business, both organically and through strategic bolt-on acquisitions that provide a tight fit and available synergies. However, when making the decision to deploy capital, our larger goal is to allocate capital to the most attractive alternative that provides the highest risk-adjusted return to our shareholders over the long term.","Turning to working capital. Improving our performance in cash conversion metrics remains a priority of mine. Earlier in the year, we engaged a specialized consultant in this area to work with our Black Belts to evaluate working capital activity at several of our largest sites around the world. The results and recommendations from this work were beneficial and are now being used to drive improvements to the company's working capital efficiency.","In the third quarter, DSO increased 3 days versus prior year to 85 days. We typically see a slight seasonal increase in DSO in Q3. That said, I still see an attractive opportunity with our disciplined focus on cash collection and the improvements we are making on the front-end bidding process to drive DSO into the mid-60s over the next 9 to 15 months. As it relates to inventory, turns decreased marginally to 2.7x versus prior year at 2.8x. With Tom's focus on, on-time delivery, reducing past-due backlog and cost of quality, we believe we will reach our long-term target of 4 to 4.5 turns over the next 15 to 21 months.","As I have stated previously, working capital is receiving a significant amount of my attention, and we will remain committed to this area until we drive these metrics to the targeted levels. So as we take a look at the remainder of 2012, we expect strong performance despite the expected negative impact of currency and the planned shipment of the remaining lower-margin legacy backlog. We believe increased volume and absorption and the effects of our share repurchase program will more than offset the currency headwinds in legacy projects. As you know, we have seen significant foreign currency volatility with the strengthening U.S. dollar during the first 3 quarters versus 2011. We are now estimating a full year currency headwind of approximately $1 to $1.10 versus 2011, slightly higher than the $1 we estimated at the end of Q2 and the $0.50 impact we forecasted at the beginning of the year. This foreign currency headwind should be partially offset by approximately $0.30 of net benefit related to share repurchase activity in 2012, although somewhat offset by higher borrowing costs related to the increased leverage. So all told, we are narrowing our 2012 EPS guidance range to $8.20 to $8.70.","Finally, I would like to welcome Jay Roueche to the Flowserve team as our Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Most recently, Jay served a similar role for McDermott International. I've had the pleasure of working with him in the past and look forward to getting out on the road with him and meeting many of you again soon. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike.","Mike Mullin","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we're ready to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Mike Halloran from Robert Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So on the deferrals and the pushouts that you were talking about, could you discuss kind of the end markets that those are the most prevalent in? And how much of it is you're seeing the deferrals already versus expectations for deferrals based on customer commentary and things like that?","Mark A. Blinn","It think it's more of the latter in terms of -- we note -- we stay in close contact with these customers. You've seen a lot of these projects, oil and gas, some in the power, even some on the chemical side getting booked into the EMCs. But as that process goes along in the feed work and it moves to final bid stage, in talking to customers, you can just see they get pushed out a quarter or 2. This is -- we're not in a situation where we were when we talk about looking forward back in '08, not even close. But it's the same thing. You just kind of continue to have a dialogue. You know these things are coming forward. There's been a tremendous amount invested in them, and so we just stay in touch with our customers.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And if we would have talked last quarter, maybe the quarter before that, you would have said first half next year with some of these larger projects getting led out on the marketplace, it sounds like that's more mid to late next year expectation at this point?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. Coming in last year about this time, we were targeting right around the end of this year, and then we saw them slip to Q1, and now we've seen them slip another quarter. So all in all, they've slipped 2, maybe 3 quarters since we started looking at these things last year.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes a lot of sense. And then an update on the One Flowserve concept and specifically, on some of the cost of quality initiatives that Mike and the team are pushing through with Tom, could you just provide an update there and specifically what the acceptance level looks like in the EPD and IPD pieces where a lot of the focus was being pushed?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, if you take a step back in general, these things certainly do take time, and that's why I made a comment, in my opening comments about work remains to be done. But I think what you've seen in IPD are some of the early signs of the impact of, really, Tom's leadership and his team. I think in general, if you look across our overall margins and our SG&A, you're starting to see some of the impact of the One Flowserve in our -- in that line in terms of fixed cost leverage overall in our business. But in looking forward, I'd still think driving through EPD as we get the legacy backlog and start getting the benefit from some of the discipline that they brought in, that is yet to come. Obviously, there's -- we see more margin improvement for IPD as well. And then also, if you look back and think around the FCD business starting to be able to leverage some of the capabilities we've seen over in IPD and EPD, that is yet to come as well. So there is definitely still work to be done. I think Tom spent a lot of time with the -- his organization that he laid out for you in the Analyst Day. They're getting a good cadence and getting some good momentum.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Makes sense. The last one for me then, just tax rate guidance, low end of the 28% to 30% range is where I think Mike said it was going to come in for the full year. That -- is that the -- I guess, the question's twofold. One, for the fourth quarter, if you're going to get a full year range in that low, low end of that range, it implies something north of 30%, so maybe just clarification on whether the fourth quarter guidance on the tax rate is closer to that low end and then also, what the appropriate level to think about is as you work through '13, '14 and beyond.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, yes, I'd say, Mike, the lower -- for the fourth quarter, we'll be at the lower end of that tax range, that 28% to 30% range.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then for 2013?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I'd -- we'll comment on 2013 in a quarter or so. Just remember, a lot of that, Mike, is driven by mix, domestic versus foreign. So last year, when you saw that higher tax rate, that was because we had strong performance in the United States. As we understand it now, the U.S. has now the highest tax jurisdiction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just back on the project pushouts, I just want to make sure I'm clear. The projects, some of it has been pushed out. Is there any of that in the current backlog or bookings now or is that just stuff that has not been let that you thought was going to be let but now is pushed out?","Mark A. Blinn","Right, it's the latter. It's yet to be booked. So when we talk about -- when we're talking about project opportunities, that's remarks around future bookings.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And just on the EPD, because I know you -- in the prepared remarks, you said the legacy projects impacted margin by about 200 basis points or so. Can you just spell that out just for the EPD business itself? Because you, obviously, had pretty strong year-over-year flip on the OE aftermarket mix, which sounds like it's being masked -- the margin improvement is being masked by this legacy stuff.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think I'll jump in real quick. Mike's comments were -- most of the impact is in EPD but there is some in IPD as well, and even a small amount in FCD. If you recall, back in late 2010, early 2011, there were quite a few projects, big projects, that were led out in the Middle East that were very, very competitive, and all 3 of our units had participated in those. So that's some of what's coming through. And I'll remind you from my comments on the last earnings call, don't associate these with bad projects, associate them with the time in which they were bid and look forward and think about the aftermarket opportunities that they represent.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right, right. On the dollar-to-dollar patent headwind, obviously, $0.15 to $0.25, obviously, in the fourth quarter of that. Can you split that between how much you're seeing those above or versus below the line in Q4?","Michael S. Taff","Charlie, I'd say a majority of that's above the line, 80-plus percent.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So one more and I'll get back on the queue. On the DSO, driving that to the mid-60s. If you were to get to that level, or when you get to that level, I guess, how much -- can you quantify how much additional cash generation that implies?","Michael S. Taff","It's about $13 million, $14 million a day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just first question, you talked about the pushout of these projects not being similar to 2009. Maybe if you could talk about how investors should view current excess capacity in the marketplace. And if you do see these projects, maybe continue to get pushed out maybe early 2014, what do you think the impact on the pricing environment could look like?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Well, it is as you -- our capacity will look multiple years out, and we see these project opportunities as we've talked about before in infrastructure being available over the next couple of years. That's different if you're referring to back to 2009 as to when we didn't know when the cycle was going to abate. We've been through kind of a lower cycle over the last couple of years, and there is need for investment. So that's how capacity is going to look going forward in terms of the project opportunities. It's not going to -- capacity, especially on a long-cycle project, the focus is around 12 to 18 months in terms of being worried about absorption. And if so, if these things push out a quarter or 2, that's not going to have a significant impact. If the market were to come to a view that it could been over an 18-month period, then on the margin, that could start to impact pricing. But we don't see that at this point.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. It makes sense. And then just a follow question on the aftermarket side, are you beginning to see more customers outsource? And maybe talk about what is driving that change from some of these customers doing this in-house and just your view there.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, it's a long discussion, but I'll try to summarize it. Complexity, increased complexity, so the capabilities of customers, local machine shops and everything relative to that complexity is not there. And I think the second thing is you do have an aging population of engineers, particularly in the United States, where they are going to be looking to outsource that bandwidth to companies that can address the complexity and be a responsible rolling a business and then reliability in terms of responsiveness as well. So those are trends you're seeing in the aftermarket business. And you add to that a lot of our end-user strategies. This is moving way beyond where it was 20 years ago in terms of break, fix or just providing quick turn parts into efficiency, quality, reliability of these big, big projects. That's becoming increasingly important. And so as you look around the world, installed base is just that. It is there and permanent, and unless they shut it down, they always need to seek a way to optimize that capacity. And that's really where our end-user strategies are targeted.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Hamza, I would also add that as we start to see more maintenance monitoring taking place on these large projects in plants, we're going to see more of this trend continuing going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I was wondering where you are seeing weakness in chemical. Is that North America and Europe?","Mark A. Blinn","Primarily, over in Europe. I mean, what you're seeing in Europe, even relative to where we were a year ago, is weakness almost in all of our sectors as they kind of work through their financial issues and their uncertainty themselves. In the United States, you still have a market, a chemical market, that's out there, but we're lapping pretty tough compares. There was a big growth last year in the U.S. chemical industry. So as we look forward, there certainly is softness, but there's opportunities to bid projects. There's one in the Middle East. There's opportunities here in the United States that are going to give us opportunities going forward.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Could you also give us an update on where some of the Korean EPCs are showing up around the world as you go out and bid?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, they're -- they bid very actively in the Middle East in '09, '10, '11, and it actually consumed quite a bit of their capacity, so we don't see them moving as quickly as they did before. And you're starting to see that more in the Westerns now that they're reporting some of their project opportunities. They are still fairly active in the power industry. They have been. We expect they will continue to be.","Thomas L. Pajonas","For instance, we're seeing some of the Koreans now looking at the U.K. nuclear market and potentially getting into that market also.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. That's helpful. So the year is tracking pretty much as you guys said from the beginning, which is great. I'm just wondering, the fourth quarter guidance is still kind of, why, and I'm wondering what kind of -- the thinking is behind the lower end, the things that transpire there versus some of the things that come to fruition on the higher end, is it something internal? Is it timing of shipments? Maybe you can lay that out a little bit for us.","Mark A. Blinn","I'll summarize real quick. I mean, the big thing is currency, Scott. You saw $0.30 impact in this quarter, 12% below the line. You saw 17% below the line in the second quarter, and then there is volatility in our tax rate. I think what you've seen has been pretty consistent in our performance this year, it's good leverage on our sales in the operating income line.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. But then, to that end, since it is -- if it is internal, then if we were to just stay status quo from here on currencies, not that they will, of course, but the guidance that Mike provided there on what you guys are expecting for the fourth quarter, does that land you -- if it stays status quo, does that land you toward the higher end, toward the lower end or is that something going right in the middle?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Well, I mean, Scott, we're not going to comment on a precise number there. I mean, I think that's really the kind of the purpose of the range. I will note, obviously, that the midpoint did increase $0.05, so we do feel good about the year. We think Q4 will be a strong quarter as it has traditionally been for the company. But as Mark said, if you ask me what was one of the things that surprised me in Q3, it would have been currency. We certainly weren't forecasting $0.12 below the line, much less $0.18 above the line. So I'd say the $0.50 range just gives us a little bit of cushion for some potential volatility, not only in the euro, but other currencies that we're seeing in Mexico, Latin America, in India and other regions of the world where we operate.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. Last question, a simple one, could you give us the end-of-quarter share count?","Michael S. Taff","End-of-quarter fully diluted share count was 51 285. On the phase of the 10-Q as of October 23, it was 49 9.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Wait, well can you just-- maybe I'm misunderstanding. You're saying the end-of-quarter share count versus the phase of the 10-Q -- oh, I see. I'm sorry for the optional share. I get it, sorry.","Michael S. Taff","No, no. The Q has to bring down the share count to the date of the filing, which is beyond the end of the quarter, which would've included some share repurchasing activity in the first 23 days of October.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just back to the project slippages, just trying to get a sense, I don't know if you said, but where -- within which markets exactly are you seeing the slippages? I think you were insinuating that it was downstream, but I was curious if there was other markets that are showing some of that slippage as well. And also, on the downstream, particularly in the U.S., I know some of these petrochem projects are starting to hit EPC. Are people -- I'm just kind of curious, the nature of the pushout, is it people reconsidering the economics of these projects, is it really logistics, because of the size of the projects? If you could just a little more color on that, it'd be appreciated.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I would say, first of all, primarily on the oil and gas side of the business, and even though the long-term trends are looking good, it's more on the refining business than on the upstream production and transportation. The upstream production and transportation business is not where that pushout is occurring. The pushout is occurring for a couple of different regions -- reasons, just we probably got a little bit of a pause going on relative to what's going on with the oil prices worldwide and project financing and a few other issues. But we're talking about the oil and gas business and on the refining side of the business. But as we mentioned, we're still confident these things are going to go forward. There's been a tremendous amount invested in them.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Brian, I'd say just spending the last 6-years-plus before coming to Flowserve in the EMC business, that's something we see routinely. So the EMCs are-- similar to what you're hearing from EMCs as well, not unusual for these large multi-billion dollar projects to move to the right as they're just going through their pre-FEED and FEED activity. So I'd say no cause for alarm, just wanted to update you on when we thought we would be seeing some of these projects going to market and actually hitting our books. Before we're saying Q1, now I think what we're saying is  Q2, Q3 timeframe next year.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And just on EPD, you talked about higher selling costs, maybe just a little color on what that entails. And is that likely to continue into Q4 of next year. If you could quantify it, it'd be good.","Thomas L. Pajonas","I think it's more just an investment -- primarily, around our end user strategy and some of the aftermarket business, we've had some investment in selling costs. And to some extent, Lawrence had some selling costs within -- being in the consolidated results for our full year.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Can you quantify the amount of headwind you saw in the quarter? And is that expected to continue or no?","Mark A. Blinn","It wasn't headwind. I think what is was saying is we had some increased selling costs to support our aftermarket business and our seal business. And then also, you're just seeing the add of Lawrence Pumps in there, too, year-over-year.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, I got you. And then just lastly for Mike, so you guys did raise a lot of debt during the quarter, obviously, allocating it to buyback. At $1.2 billion, are you kind of settled with that debt balance for now or do you anticipate you might have some increase in the next few quarters or so?","Michael S. Taff","Well, we're -- I'd say we're at the lower end of our target range of 1.2x debt to EBITDA. As you know, we said we want to operate in that 1x to 2x range. So we will continue to monitor that. I mean, at the end of the day though, as we talked about, we firmly believe our job is to allocate capital to the most accretive method possible and all, and that's really a decision we'll make quarter in and quarter out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could I just get a clarification on the share count there? You said 51 285 was the end-of-quarter diluted share count. The 49 9 on the  cover is a basic share count, correct?","Michael S. Taff","That's correct.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I was just making sure you hadn't bought back 1.3 million shares in the last 23 days.","Michael S. Taff","I don't think so.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, cool. And I guess a question for Tom, FCD has had a couple of negative order quarters in a row. I know a fairly large portion of that goes through distribution. Have you seen any impact there from distributor de-stocking or OEM de-stocking, for that matter?","Thomas L. Pajonas","The distribution business has held up quite nicely in the year-over-year compare and sequentially. I would say that the distribution is one of those businesses that is more prone to more GDP-type changes in the marketplace, but it's held up quite nicely. As a matter fact on the sales side, the sales distribution business was up very slightly year-over-year.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So what do you attribute the bookings weakness in FCD then?","Thomas L. Pajonas","I mean, we had a very tough compare. I mean, we have one of the highest bookings last year. It's almost $409 million, so that's one of the reasons. But with some softening on the chemical side of the business, we did have, as I mentioned, some good district heating in Russia. We did, again, have some good aftermarket business on the nuclear side. And then the oil and gas business on the -- let's say, shorter-term business was down slightly.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And Mike, on that balance sheet, you're talking about 1x to 2x gross debt to EBITDA. But at the pace you're going to complete this buyback by the second half of next year, you're only going to be spending about as much cash flow as you're generating, if that much, and your net leverage is probably down closer to 0.5 turn or something like that. Isn't it more realistic to focus on what your net leverage is?","Michael S. Taff","Well, I mean, I think you can focus on multiple metrics. I think we just -- we chose to focus on the growth metric. But I will tell you that there's a lot of opportunities out there for investments, and we continue to monitor those inorganic or bolt-on type opportunities out there. We're seeing various deals on a quarterly basis. Obviously, we haven't done anything this year, to date, but that doesn't mean we won't and all with the right fit, with the right synergies and all. So we'll just -- as I said before, we'll continue to monitor capital deployment in the most accretive ways.","Mark A. Blinn","Nathan, one of the reasons we don't look at it net is there is a frictional element to cash that's overseas.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And I guess seeing as we're talking about M&A, how is the pipeline looking at the moment?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, we're active out there looking for things that fit. I mean, we like things like Lawrence Pumps that we had last year. It's something we can integrate fairly quickly and provide a return to our shareholders, so it's good. You've seen some assets change hands in the marketplace, and so we certainly keep an eye out for things. But what we want to do is make sure we evaluate all of these things in terms of what's the best return for our shareholders.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just slip one more in, I'm going to see if I can get anything out of you about next year. I understand currency has been a significant drag on the actual dollar bookings numbers. Year-to-date, orders are up about 3% over last year and backlog's up about the same amount. Is that 3% order in backlog growth rate kind of the way we should be thinking about an organic revenue growth as a baseline for 2013?","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, there's a lot of our business that comes in during the current year, particularly as you look at our aftermarket business and some of our shorter-cycle business as well. So it's not necessarily all long lead time type projects that you can use that to map revenue for next year. And some of it, as you look next year, is going to be what the impact of currency is. It could still provide an additional headwind to us next year. But our focus is on, and I made this in my comment, the market growth opportunities that are out there in general and how we participate. One of the things that we talked about was we see opportunity in oil and gas, power relatively stable and the chemical markets some softness, but with opportunity in there. And then what we do to drive share gain in those particular sectors as well and then the benefit that we expect to see in terms of some of these larger long lead time projects that are out there. So keep in mind, if we book a big project towards the end of the next year, typically we won't see the revenues until the following year. But that's -- probably the best way to think in terms of our revenue is what our markets are going to provide, driving our aftermarket growth, as you've seen us do up to this point and focus on share gain. We also have the benefit -- we'll get the incremental benefit of Lawrence Pumps growing some of our other acquisitions, some of our product introductions as well. We've been spending money on R&D. So what you're getting a very short synopsis of kind of how we go through our planning process and think about how we're going to grow our business next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry from UBS.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to comment in the deck about expecting the legacy backlog to be removed as a margin issue in 2013. I mean, just order of magnitude, is that about a 200-basis-point tailwind?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, we've talked about it during the course of the year, 100 to 200 basis points if we walk through. And I think Mike's comments for this quarter were 200, so it's a good way to think about it.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just given the way it's tracking, I mean, would it be fair to say that the biggest year-over-year delta from that stress would be kind of weighted to the first half, where the absence of that stress on the margins?","Mark A. Blinn","No, it'd actually be more towards the end because you're -- it started out and actually, the pace of shipping, it has increased during the course of the year. And then also, we talked about, on the last call, some of these things were waiting on basically some supplies from some suppliers, if they don't come in, in the end of year, it could go over into the first quarter of next year. But for the most part, we will have executed on this legacy backlog in 2012.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Another question on margins in EPD, I think there was some mention of higher selling-related expenses there, and I just wanted to drill down on what that was, if that was sales force investment or what it is and then how long it's going to stay elevated.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, it is a couple of things. When you talk about these long lead time projects that are -- we expect to see next year, you have to start building some of the capabilities to support bidding those and executing on those, so that's one area. Another area is we've seen good growth in our seal business, and a lot of that is because of the sales force we've dedicated to it as well. And then finally in our end-user strategies aftermarket, a lot of which is in EPD, we've invested in some resources and including QRCs, folks basically on the ground to drive that business as well, and I think the last thing in the SG&A line is just the inclusion of the Lawrence Pumps' SG&A year-over-year.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you, got you. Okay. And then just a couple of housekeeping items. The interest expense, of course, that surprisingly tracked higher this quarter. I mean, just for modeling purposes going forward, is the 3Q level or maybe a little bit higher kind of level we should be using quarterly?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, and I think it's pretty fair. But the range we're at for this quarter is directly in line with what you'll see kind of in future quarters.","Mark A. Blinn","You did have -- as Mike mentioned, you did have that deal cost in there. Just keep that in mind, Robert.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm sorry, how much was that?","Mark A. Blinn","$1.4 million.","Michael S. Taff","That's $1.4 million, but also you'll have a full quarter of the volumes in there as well next quarter, so kind of I'd say directionally where we are for this quarter would be where we will be for Q4 as well.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally on the repo activity, I think you did just over $100 million this quarter. Is that what the expectation would be for fourth quarter as well?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I think we'll be in that. We may be slightly higher. I'd say we'll kind of be in that 120 to 140 range or so for Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sid Panda from for RBC Markets.","Sid Panda - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The first question I had was regarding the share buyback. Earlier, you had said that it will be completed in the 6 to 12 months' timeframe. And now the press release says 2013. So has there been some moderation in the plan to buy back shares in 2013?","Mark A. Blinn","No, I'd say no moderation. I mean, we're pretty much right on schedule. We talked about last quarter in the conference call that we'd be in the 200 to 240 range for the next 6 months. This quarter, we purchased $101 million. And as I just mentioned, I think next quarter or Q4, you'll see us in the 120 to 140 range.","Sid Panda - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the next question I had was on the DSO and working capital targets. Could you give some specific examples of steps being taken to reach the DSO goals? You talked about an expert being brought in and some steps being implemented. Could you elaborate on that a bit?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I'd say overall as it relates to just the working capital project in general, we did have a specialized consultant work with us this quarter with a number of our black belts and go out and visit several of our large sites. I'd say the results and findings were kind of threefold. One was revising some of our existing processes, implementing some new procedures and also, just some cultural issues among the operations and all. I think we addressed those overall. You'll start seeing some improvements. So now we're kind of going from the assessment phase to the implementation phase. We'll start that in the latter part of the Q4, and that will carry us through a longer period of time into next year as we implement these recommendations.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I think virtually everything's been answered. I have 2 follow-up ones, though. One, just to be clear, no orders have been canceled. Is that correct?","Mark A. Blinn","That's correct.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Secondly, the cash flow statement implies, based on the third quarter, that about $3.7 million was the FX impact -- noncash FX impact. You'd mentioned the balance sheet valuation has an impact below the line. So that $3.7 million, how much of that was below the line?","Mark A. Blinn","Mike?","Michael S. Taff","I'm not sure...","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Or maybe I can rephrase that. On the balance sheet revaluation or the below 9 -- below-the-line number, how much of it was actually a noncash impact for you?","Michael S. Taff","On below the line, I mean, typically when you're marking the balance sheet or any one of your hedges, it's noncash.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Right, so virtually all of it's noncash.","Michael S. Taff","Yes. Think of it as noncash. David, let me clean something up from earlier. We do have, from time to time, immaterial cancellations in our projects. They're very, very, very small.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, and the market hasn't suggested a material change?","Michael S. Taff","No, no, no.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. I just wanted to clarify that. Okay, so we can look at that -- of $3.7 million noncash item then, how would that be divided between above the line and below the line?","Michael S. Taff","I'm not sure, David. Let us -- we'll get back to you on that.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly on that FX front, with the new treasurer in place, what sort of steps can we see to kind of control that volatility in the below-the-line number? I mean, can you intimate what you plan to do for next year?","Thomas L. Pajonas","That's a great question. That's something we're going to look at. I mean, that's certainly a big challenge we have when you have really 2\/3 of your business that occurs outside of North America, and so we are going to review our overall hedging policies and make sure we're doing everything we can do to preserve all the economic value possible in our interim business.","Mark A. Blinn","Keep in mind, David, I mean these hedges are designed to actually reduce cash flow volatility and cash earnings volatility. The reason the volatility is created is typically the hedged asset is sitting in backlog, and you have to mark the hedges every quarter, that's just the rules. So when the accounting rules changed 10 years ago to where you -- around hedge accounting, you had to start marking your hedges every quarter. So what I want to definitely convey is we do -- we run these programs to mitigate risk and to basically hedge the economics of a project that can take 1 year to 1.5 years for us to process through and ultimately collect the cash. So it's -- I think there's going to be volatility typically, and you see it in other companies as well, as long as you see there's tremendous volatility of dollars relative to foreign currencies.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","You called out the pipeline business, specifically in North America, as favorable for not only Lawrence Pumps, but your valve division as well. Can you provide some additional color there and really your exposure to underlying pipe, primarily long haul?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think, I mean, what you're seeing is a tremendous amount of investment in midstream. The legacy piping business was typically around natural gas, but increasingly now what you're seeing is increased piping into the liquid parts of the world. That's gas to liquids are actually oil movement around the world, larger storage facilities. And this investment, which is installed based on the midstream side, presents opportunities. Really, broad-based opportunities in the valve business, to your comment earlier, because whether it's gas or liquid, we have the opportunity on the valve side. But as there's more investment on the liquids, that's where you have rotating equipment.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then given the midstream going into downstream, which is your bread and butter, if these potential projects that you're talking about continually do get pushed out, is it possible, maybe in a quarter or so, if we don't see them really come to fruition, that we do get an announced increase in -- announcement on additional restructuring initiative?","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, no, we're -- we don't want to certainly comment on anything like that at this point in time. What we're doing here is we're sitting here thinking about how to invest in our business. We'll always look for ways to improve it, Bill, always in any instance. But what we see right now and we're still confident that these projects are going to move forward.","Operator","We have reached the allotted time for the question-and-answer session.

Following our commentary today, we will begin the Q&A session. ","Regarding any forward-looking statements, I refer you to yesterday's earnings release and 10-Q filing and today's presentation slide deck for Flowserve's Safe Harbor statement on this topic. All of this information can be found at Flowserve's website under the Investor Relations section.","We encourage you to read these statements carefully with respect to our conference call this morning. ","Now I would like to turn it over to Mark to begin the formal presentation. Mark?","Mark A. Blinn","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our solid first quarter results and proud of the work our employees have done to create shareholder value by taking advantage of our improving end markets, including our long cycle business, for the first time in several years. ","The first quarter played out largely as we anticipated. Back in February, we talked about how the first half of the year would be challenged by a tough 2011 compare due to the now stronger dollar and some large low-margin, delayed shipments going through backlog. We expect those challenging factors to also impact the second quarter, but we see improvement in the future quarters as our business cycle improves. ","Our first quarter bookings represent our strongest quarter since the third quarter of 2008, in spite of the stronger dollar. The booking strength was broad based across our end markets, most notably in chemical and oil and gas, while our water markets remain challenged. ","Our commitment to aftermarket end-user strategies and localization continued to pay off, with increased aftermarket bookings of 7% or 9% on a constant currency basis, resulting in an aftermarket annual run rate approaching $2 billion. ","If you recall, we remained committed to growth investments during the downturn, as well as realigning our business to growth opportunities, and as a result, are now well-positioned to capitalize on what we believe is a key differentiator. ","We are pleased to see our longer and later cycle project business activity begin to pick up, as demonstrated by the impressive EPD original equipment bookings. ","I am proud of our employees' commitment and focus as we capitalize on the strengthening cycle. Our strong first quarter book-to-bill of 1.16 resulted in our highest first quarter backlog in 4 years. I will also emphasize that the expected margin going into backlog is improving as a result of firming markets and Tom's effort to intensify our discipline and enhance our processes. ","We have also made progress on challenges around working capital and delivering our past-due backlog. Work remains, but I'm confident that Tom, Mike, and our operations leadership are driving the necessary operational improvement to improve margins and bring our working capital to more efficient levels. ","Looking forward to the balance of 2012, I am encouraged about how the cycle is progressing. We see increased quoting levels and progress on long planned mega infrastructure projects, in spite of lingering macro uncertainty and market softness in Europe. ","We are optimistic that this increased activity will result in increased booking opportunities towards the end of the year and into 2013. ","Energy development opportunities in emerging regions continue as anticipated while the unexpected chemical renaissance in the U.S., driven by shale gas development, provides additional support to our optimistic end market views. When we look at the impact shale gas is having on the energy markets globally, we have seen significant increase in the number of projects announced to take advantage of this low-cost feedstock, with increased project announcements for combined cycle power plants and chemical processing plants in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Asia. ","As it relates to power, regulatory clarity in the U.S. may provide the necessary stability to enable significant investments in domestic power to move forward. And while desalination projects have been slow to move forward over the last several years, improving macro and political environments in key regions should support long-anticipated investments. ","While we are optimistic about the present state of our end markets, a meaningful impact on our reported financial results will likely lag, given the long cycle nature of many of these projects. ","In addition, although these jobs provide attractive, long-term aftermarket opportunities, we must still work through some lower margin, large projects in our backlog in the second quarter of 2012. But our first quarter bookings and bid levels give us increased confidence in our ability to meet our financial goals this year and to obtain profitable growth in following years. ","Finally, I'd like to update you on the progress I have seen from our new One Flowserve leadership structure. Tom will highlight some of the initiatives, but I can tell you, I am encouraged about what has been accomplished in a short time. ","I'm already seeing enhancements in leverage across many of our processes, including supply chain, R&D, complex project management, project bidding and contract execution, cost leverage and increased coverage of our customers. ","While we are early in this current phase in our progression towards One Flowserve, I am confident in Tom and the ability of his leadership team to make the necessary improvements across all of our operations to deliver on commitments to our shareholders, customers and employees. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the numbers, I'd like to update you on the progress we made on our new operating structure we discussed in February. ","The operating leaders are in place, and we have intensified our efforts towards operational efficiencies, reducing our past-due backlog, on-time delivery, as well as low-cost sourcing opportunities, pricing discipline, win rates and other costs, including selling, general and administration costs, that have an impact on our overall cost position in the business. ","Over the last few months, we have driven processes to better serve our customers. R&D is done centrally across the business, as we have established common processes. We have leveraged global proposal and contract execution capabilities. We enhanced our focus on customer satisfaction through our on-time delivery commitment focus and our pursuit of obtaining a high-quality product every time, the first time with our customers. And I have added a senior quality person, reporting to myself to align our customer base and provide a central focus here. ","I am excited about this progress and the operational efficiency initiatives we have planned. As Mark discussed, we are pleased with our strong Q1 bookings of $1.25 billion, or an increase of 7.1% versus prior year, resulting at a strong book-to-bill of 1.16. We saw strength in the chemical and the oil and gas industries, partially offset by a decrease in water. The aftermarket business remains strong, as we continue to concentrate on this important aspect of our business. ","While the OE market, in particular the longer cycle OE market, continues to remain competitive, we were pleased with our overall OE growth rate. ","In the oil and gas markets, Canadian tar sand activity remained high, with several other tar sand projects continuing to progress the various levels of funding and permitting approvals. Also, quoting activity on Brazilian offshore projects remain strong. A decline in natural gas prices is driving the end user to focus on oil and liquids in their drilling programs. As reserves and natural gas continue to grow, there is the real possibility of increased U.S. activity as an LNG exporter. ","Upstream and downstream, oil and gas projects remained strong in the Middle East, with gas projects seeing increased activity in Russia and shale gas projects in China. ","In spite of uncertainty in the nuclear market, several countries continued to move ahead with their nuclear plants, including China, the U.S. and India, in particular. The U.S. has most recently received NRC approval for both the Vogtle plants in Georgia and the SCANA plants in South Carolina. The increase in natural gas reserves and continued low price of natural gas is driving more combined cycle natural gas plants in the U.S. This trend may also increase throughout other regions of the world as more natural gas is tapped. ","China and India continued to balance their power needs across a wide range of technologies, including nuclear and fossil applications. The chemical market continued its overall growth pattern, with broad-based, year-over-year growth. As more natural gas is discovered around the world, it should create opportunities for low-cost gas feedstock for chemical plant applications. ","The water business decreased, but we see potential activity in China and the Middle East. Mining and pulp and paper, although a smaller contributor to our general industries, continued to grow. Mining should continue to be a good growth sector, based on increased global demand. ","Now I would like to turn to our segment results. The Engineered Product Division grew bookings 11.3% in Q1 versus prior year, to $671 million, resulting in a healthy book-to-bill ratio for Q1 of 1.25. ","Book-to-bill for the OE business was 1.59, while the aftermarket business, it was 1.05. A strong OE book-to-bill works to increase our expected highly engineered installed base, and ultimately, increases our aftermarket opportunity. ","The bookings growth is notable, considering Q1 of 2011 included nearly $90 million of bookings related to one major order. Aftermarket bookings increased 9% or 11% on a constant currency basis. Our continued focus on the aftermarket, particularly in customers focusing on energy efficiency, operating cost reductions and reliability, continued to build momentum. ","Bookings growth in Q1 came from the chemical, oil and gas and general industries, including the mining business, and to a moderate amount, the power business. ","Sales were up 2.1% on the quarter versus the prior year or 4.6% on a constant currency basis to $535 million, driven again primarily by sales originating in EMA and North America. We continue to invest in the emerging markets with 3 ongoing capital investments at our new Xuzhou greenfield facility, our greenfield Brazilian Rio facility and the addition of our third greenfield block in Coimbatore, India. Also in January, we completed the acquisition of EMCOMET, an Argentina-based business, specializing in bearings and seal lube oil systems and electrical control panels used in pumps and seal support systems. ","Gross margin was 34.3% versus prior year at 35.9% was negatively impacted as we continued to work through lower margin past-due backlog and sales mix shifted towards lower margin OE. ","Operating income was 17.2% versus prior year at 17.5%, including a gain on sales of replaced assets and appropriate overall expense control. ","We continue to work on any internal business unit, which has performance areas that are not up to Flowserve's high standards. We have a group of quality black belts that are driving key initiatives across these plants in a methodically detailed program. We also have visibility in our backlog of our projects, and review each operational backlog regularly. ","I would also like to update you on the performance of Lawrence Pumps, acquired in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding noncash purchase price accounting effects, Lawrence got off to a strong start this year. This reflects our ability to leverage our aftermarket capabilities and global sales network to benefit from an acquisition, which fits us well with complementary Flow Control products. ","The Industrial Product Division grew bookings 3.1% from the previous period Q1, or 4.9% on a currency neutral basis. The overall book-to-bill ratio was 1.09 in the present quarter. ","OE book-to-bill was 1.12, while aftermarket book-to-bill was 1.03. The OE aftermarket bookings mix remained essentially the same, while the sales mix shifted 300 basis points towards original equipment in Q1 2012. ","Growth came from the chemical, oil and gas and other businesses made up of mining, and to a lesser extent, food and beverage. ","Regionally, the largest growth came from North America, Latin America and the Middle East, offset by a negative growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific. ","Sales grew 20.9% in Q1 to $213 million as compared to prior Q1. Sales by definition grew substantially in North America, Latin America, the Middle East and Australia. Aftermarket sales were up 11% versus prior year Q1. ","Original equipment sales were up 27% versus prior year Q1. Gross margin was 23.3% for Q1, as we continue to work off lower margin projects in the backlog and the mix shifted to more original equipment sales. ","Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 8.2%. SG&A expense was essentially unchanged from prior year, which resulted in good SG&A leverage on the increased revenue. ","Overall initiatives on driving operating margins and on-time delivery improved steadily. We continue to drive for core operational efficiencies in our business units in order to meet our goal of steadily improving performance in this segment to deliver on our targeted operating margin of 14% to 15%. We are driving low-cost sourcing opportunities here, along with process changes in some of our IPD plants to drive this performance goal. ","Flow Control Division bookings of $380 million were up 0.7% versus prior year, or 2.6% on a constant currency basis. The overall book-to-bill ratio in Q1 2012 was 1.04, with the aftermarket book-to-bill being 1.04 in Q1 2012. ","Bookings in the aftermarket business grew 2% versus prior year Q1. Bookings aftermarket mix of 15% was unchanged from prior year. Bookings increased primarily in chemical, with a more moderate increase versus prior year in power. ","The pulp and paper business also saw a favorable increase versus last year. Regionally, North America, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific overall saw increases in bookings from prior year Q1, offset by decreases in Europe as a result of the macroeconomic uncertainty in several countries. ","Sales grew 7.8% to $364 million from prior year Q1. Also, the growth regionally came from North America, Asia-Pacific, most notably China and India and Latin America. Sale splits between the OE and aftermarket remained the same at 85% and 15%. Gross margins grew 80 basis points to 35% on the quarter. SG&A, as a function of sales, reduced 60 basis points from prior year to 19.9%. ","Gross margin continued to improve, as pricing actions taken in 2011 materialized, including low-cost sourcing, improved absorption and cost control initiatives. Operating margin increased 120 basis points from prior year of 15.3%. ","Overall, the Flow Control Division will continue to focus on high-quality growth strategies, like automation, plus emerging market growth in Russia, India, China and Latin America. ","In addition, the Valbart acquisition continued to provide FCD additional penetration in the oil and gas market, with accompanying pull-through opportunities for some of our other products. Additionally, FCD focused on continued execution excellence, as demonstrated by its on-time delivery of over 91%, as well as its efforts to drive customer quality initiatives in all of its products and services. ","And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. First, taking a look at bookings, the first quarter bookings of $1.25 billion was our strongest quarter since the third quarter of 2008. ","Year-over-year bookings increased $82 million, up 7% or 9.4%, excluding negative currency impact of approximately $27 million. The increase was driven primarily by EPD original equipment orders in Asia-Pacific, with notable strength in the chemical and oil and gas industries, partially offset by a decrease in the water industry. ","The strong bookings, notably in our highly engineered long cycle products and improving end markets, supports our confidence in our 2012 forecasted revenue increase of 5% to 7%, as well as our longer-term expectation of 8% to 10% revenue growth through 2016. ","When we look at sales for Q1 of $1.07 billion, we saw an increase of $78 million from the prior year, up 7.8% or 10.1%, excluding negative currency impact of approximately $23 million.","We also had a mix shift on sales, where original equipment revenues increased from 57% to 59%, which had a dilutive impact on margins. ","Turning to the financial results slide. Gross margins were down 150 basis points, in part due to a mix shift in sales in EPD and IPD towards original equipment. ","Additionally, as we discussed at the end of 2011, we also continue to feel the impact from a few lower-margin projects booked during the downturn, which are cycling through. Q2 will be similarly challenged, and as we previously guided, we expect to see margin improvement in the second half of the year. ","SG&A expenses decreased by 170 basis points to 20.6% for the quarter, with strong fixed cost leverage on the higher sales and the continued tight cost controls. SG&A was also impacted positively by a gain on the sale of an old manufacturing facility in Brazil, as we began the transition to a new, more efficient facility later in the year. ","Operating margins for the first quarter of 2012 were up 20 basis points to 13.3%. ","Let's take a few minutes to look at the other expense income line. In Q1 of last year, we posted an $0.11 gain from a transaction standpoint below the line, whereas this quarter, we saw a $0.06 loss resulting in a $0.17 swing. ","As we have discussed previously, this line item is driven by sequential changes in exchange rates, as we mark our foreign currency hedges and balance sheet items to market. The slight strengthening of the euro was more than offset by the impact of higher volatility in the yen and Mexican peso. ","Briefly, on our tax rate, it came in at 27.5%, which is slightly below our stated structural rate of 28% to 30%. We expect the full-year [ph] rate to be in the 28% to 30% range, excluding discreet items. ","Turning to cash flows. Q1 has typically been a significant user of cash due to seasonality. On a comparative basis, we saw a significant improvement versus the first quarter of 2011, despite increased inventory levels associated with a strong book-to-bill ratio for the quarter. ","CapEx was $29 million, about $5 million higher than last year, as we continued investing in growth markets, including increased aftermarket capabilities. ","Also, in accordance with our announced policy to return cash to shareholders, we distributed $17 million in dividends and repurchased $22 million of stock during the quarter, which is roughly $10 million more than Q1 of last year. ","We continue to focus on improving our levels of working capital, but work remains. Inventory increased in-line with a strong first quarter book-to-bill and resulting backlog growth anticipated for our 2012 forecasted revenue growth of 5% to 7%. ","We made progress towards reducing our legacy past-due backlog, which we discussed at year end, and expect to work through most of the remaining balance in the second quarter of 2012, with some residual in the third quarter, which we expect to have a diluted impact on margins, but clears the way for margin improvement in the second half of the year and beyond. ","I am confident that through the improvements we are implementing in our front-end bidding process, as well as our disciplined focus on cash collection, we can drive DSO into the mid-60s. ","Taking a look at our outlook for the remainder of 2012. Following a solid first quarter start, we are reaffirming our 2012 full year guidance of $8 to $8.80 per share, including $0.50 of a negative foreign currency impact above and below the line. ","As we have discussed previously, we continue to expect 2012 earnings to be second-half weighted due to the increased backlog, currency impact and delayed project margin pressures, as we continue to work through the remainder of the low-margin legacy backlog in the second quarter. ","As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect revenue growth of 5% to 7%, in spite of the currency headwinds we have outlined. I am also confident with the growth in our markets and Tom's operational improvements, we will deliver margin improvement and progress towards our 1.5% to 2.5% operating margin improvement target over the next 2 to 3 years. ","We expect CapEx to be between $125 million and $135 million in 2012, as we position ourselves for growth and continue to execute on our end-user strategy. Working capital issues will receive a significant amount of my attention as we focus on bringing these metrics to more appropriate levels. And now let me turn it back over to Mike.","Mike Mullin","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we are ready to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Jamie Sullivan.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Question. Overall, it sounds -- you sound incrementally positive on your end market, particularly long cycle and chemical. Is there anything that you're a bit more cautious on based on what you see?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, as we commented earlier, I mean, we're waiting for the water markets to start to recover as well and see what occurs there. I think, also, we're keeping an overall eye on the power markets. They've been relatively flat. What we talked about in the U.S. is if we can free up the regulatory environment. Also, as they start working through the -- each country is going through their nuclear evaluation. Some of them are starting to clear the way, some of them are still working through it. And then, again, there's always the wildcard of what goes on in EMA. It still seems to change from day-to-day. It seemed there was more confidence a couple of weeks ago, and now there's concern with what's going on in Spain, and that does impact our business.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then in the general industries area, I know that's a diverse end market for you. The bookings sounded stronger in EPD, maybe a little bit softer in some of the other segments. Just wondering if you can talk about what's driving the differences there?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, I guess, in the general industry, keep in mind, you've got mining, pulp and paper, some of the aspects of that, and we saw some improvement overall in the mining business. But also, you have some of our orders that goes through distributors that are in that segment. So what you might see -- what you do see is as distributors start to stock again -- stock again in their inventory levels, you'll see the benefit of that in the GI side.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that's what you're seeing?","Mark A. Blinn","We're seeing some -- yes, we're seeing some of the stocking activity overall. I think it's just generally as markets start to improve, if you -- where we were at this time last year is we were still talking about choppy and competitive, and what we do is we see some of these projects coming more and more online. Our distributors will see the same thing. Generally, industry will see that as well, and that'll tend to reflect itself through all aspects of our business.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. Then one last quick one on oil and gas. So outside of the positive long-term fundamentals you're seeing, what -- maybe over the next year or so, what areas do you see the most activity occurring?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, Jamie, this is Tom. One of the good areas and bright spots is the LNG market. And as we mentioned, because of the shale gas prices in U.S., you could see the LNG become an exporter out of the U.S., so that's a significant bright spot. Also, the Canadian tar sands' activities has remained high for us, given the overall price of oil. So that is also doing well. And the Brazilian offshore is another growth area for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you quantify how much margin pressure was caused in the quarter in EPD and IPD due to these low-margin projects moving through?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, Robert, it's Mike. We'd estimate that to be somewhere between 150 to 200 basis points for the quarter. And I think you'll see similar effect in Q2, and then some -- a little run-on in the Q3 as well.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And that 150 to 200, that's both for EPD and IPD?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, majority of that was EPD, but that's a consolidated number.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then, as we get into the back half of the year, should we expect things to kind of snap back once those few projects move out? Or is it going to be more of a gradual improvement?","Michael S. Taff","It's more of a gradual improvement as you kind of come through it. The same thing you saw -- I mean, Robert, just going back in time, our order book peaked really, particularly in EPD, in around the late summer of 2008. And you saw their margins hold well into the late summer of 2010 and then start -- you started to see the impact as that business rolled off. It occurs the same way when you start to build your margins back, but it starts with improved volume levels so you get better absorption overall in the business and also, the pricing as well. But that's how it tends to come back. This is typical of the cycle. And our long late cycle business, this is what you're seeing in EPD, as it -- as we kind of wrap up what we saw really in 2010 and some carried over to the early 2011, when we talked about the markets being choppy and competitive.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I just wanted to differentiate between the low margin backlog and the past dues? Because -- and I believe some of it is interrelated, but I think, Mike, you had alluded to something even slipping into 3Q. And just to be clear, is the low-margin -- the few low-margin projects, are they kind of moving through as planned and scheduled to be out after 2Q, and it's the past dues that you think might linger into 3Q? Or -- I just wanted to be clear on that.","Mark A. Blinn","Mike and I'll take this together. I mean, there's a couple of things. There were projects that are not past due that were taken for aftermarket reasons, particularly in the Middle East, where it's very competitive. That didn't have a necessarily good margin profile that will come through backlog over this period of time, that are important to us for the aftermarket side. And then, I think, there is definitely a correlation when things become past due, either because of manufacturing supply chain or the customers don't want it. It does tend to erode margins, so it's a little bit of those. But I think, Mike, you want to carry it from there on terms of when it's rolling through?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, I mean, I think, Robert, in a way, it's -- there's certainly some consistency there and one and the same. I mean, because you can have some legacy backlog. And when we refer to these legacy backlogs, these were really -- the projects were booked in the downturn at much lower gross margins. And they may or -- may be on schedule, they may be part of the past-due backlog. When we are referring to past-due backlog, it's really more of a working capital concern, as well as margin concern. Because, as you know, when a project reaches the past-due backlog phase, then you start getting into some additional costs, such as liquidated damages and things like that.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. Just one housekeeping item. Is it possible to just break out the revenue and bookings impact from Lawrence in the quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","It was -- we really didn't report that separately, but it was relatively small. I mean, their revenue was in-line with what you saw on the business profile when we announced the acquisition. But I think Tom's comment was what we did see, excluding the impact of purchase accounting and typically these type of acquisitions, they'll tend to drag on your earnings -- literally on your earnings, and therefore, of course, on your margins as well until you clear through the acquired backlog. But absent that, aside from that, we saw very good leverage in the business, so we're pleased with it. Same thing we saw with Valbart as we worked through it, but what we're focusing on is growing the bookings and the top line of that business. But we saw a good margin pull-through, absent purchase accounting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charlie Brady.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just want to focus on EPD for a minute. And so there was a pretty wide difference between the mix on OE bookings and OE sales in Q1. And I guess, I'm just trying to piece together the impact of what that means on margins later on this year, when you couple that with the fact that you have a kind of a natural margin lift from this lower market [ph] backlog kind of coming off-line or rolling through. Is there -- is the headwind -- or do you expect the headwind from the OE mix to be that much of a headwind on margins in the second half and offset the lift you're going to get from having the margin backlog move out, or not? And what do think the mix looks like OE aftermarket as we go through this year?","Mark A. Blinn","I think I understand your question. Let's set aside what we call the legacy backlog and just talk about the business from here going forward. And you saw this in the past, '06 and '07, a couple of things occur. When you do see these book-to-bill levels in EPD, of course, what that means is, over a period of time, you'll see a mix shift to more original equipment business. But keep in mind, our aftermarket business is a lot bigger in EPD than it was back then. So all other things being equal, sure, mix does tend to put pressure on your margins. But I think another thing, if you look over the last couple of years at their sales levels in EPD, they've been running, on average, in bookings and sales, $225 million or less in sales on the OE side. So as that starts to grow, you're going to get better absorption and fixed cost leverage in the SG&A line. So how it works out, mix shift does tend to impact margins, but growth in the OE is good from a number of aspects. One, you get better absorption in your plants, fixed cost leverage on the SG&A line, and then, also, that's an indicator that your markets are starting to get traction and you can drive better pricing through overall in the business. So those are going to be your margin impacts going forward.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just so I'm clear, it sounds like what you're saying, then, that we should expect -- because the mix shift had gone, good mix [ph], heavily toward the OE that doesn't necessarily mean we get a significant downtick in margins in the second half because of the fact that [indiscernible]?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, overall, what -- the margins, at least in the first half and some in the Q3, will be more around the legacy backlog. And then, as you go forward, you -- as this kind of works out what we're [ph] go on aftermarket business as well, you'll see some impact from more OE going through mix alone, but also a benefit from absorption in SG&A as well.","Michael S. Taff","Charlie, it's Mike. Another thing to keep in mind on EPD obviously is on those OE orders. They have a runway of 12 months plus, so something we're booking today really starts flowing through revenues -- 3 or 4 quarters down the road.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, okay. And then my next question would be on the SG&A line across the segments. That's obviously come down on a year-over-year basis nicely. Can you give us a sense of kind of what your SG&A targets are for the business segments? What are you thinking of that, too?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, I think, overall, we're still trying to -- as a business, drive it to 20% or below. If you look at EPD, a lot of that as a percentage overall, is going to be what we just talked about. As we start to grow the OE business, we're going to get better fixed cost leverage. You're seeing the same thing in IPD, they had good cost control year-over-year, and they're starting to grow their top line. And FCD has always done a good job in managing that. And then corporate, corporate has been relatively stable now for a couple of years. So what we're looking is to continue to leverage SG&A as we grow our business. And do keep in mind, this SG&A run rate does reflect investment in QRCs that we'll still realize a benefit from, hiring of engineers, putting a lot of programs in place to drive growth overall in our business. So we'll get the leverage, not only from cost management, but to start to realize some additional returns from the SG&A we've invested in our business.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Charlie, I would also add, I mean, if you look at what we've done structurally since the beginning of the year, we've centralized the research and technology function so that should give some good positions going forward. We've also centralized global projects, both on the proposal stage and the contract stage. That should help along with the quality overall initiative for the company. So those process changes will also add to the position that Mark mentioned.","Michael S. Taff","Yes. Charlie, Mike. Also, I mean, just to note related to SG&A. We mentioned, our overall goal over a 2- to 3-year period is to get that net percentage to 18%. So that's -- we're driving towards that on a consolidated basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg [ph].","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just coming back to North America. Obviously, it seems like there has been quite step change in the activity going on in the market. I'm just curious, as we look forward, do you anticipate you're going to require more investment to serve the opportunities that you're seeing? And separately, as far as timing goes, when do you start to see kind of a pickup in activity related to these projects that we're hearing about in chemical and oil sands and others?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, as -- I mean, as they start to let these out, we -- if you look at our business over many, many years, we have a well-established presence in the United States and in EMA. We've done a lot to drive efficiency in that over the last couple of years, as we reposition our business to emerging markets. But we have ample resources in North America to support the growth, not only from domestic capabilities, but also a lot of our strategies to do some low-cost manufacturing in our facilities around the world. So as you look at these projects, as they come on line, be it the -- on the nuclear side, some of the chemical plants with the natural gas feedstock and the impact to natural gas itself, right, you're seeing movement from gas to liquids and the impact that's going to have, pipelines, all of those things still represent opportunity out there. I think on the power side, as I mentioned in my comments, we're going to need to see some clarity around regulations. But as that starts to free up -- but there is demand for all of the things that I've talked about, so they'll need the infrastructure for it. But from our investment stock side, it doesn't require significant investment to support our current and our future markets in North America.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. And just as far as timing, when do you anticipate that opportunity starts materializing into a more significant run rate of revenue -- orders in revenue?","Thomas L. Pajonas","I mean, it's going to -- it's obviously going to vary, depending on the industry. I think the good thing is, is we see good growth across many of the infrastructure areas. So if you take nuclear, I mean, nuclear, I would say, is imminently here because of the SCANA project that they've just announced and the Vogtle previous project in Georgia. So that one's going along good. You're going to see opening up on the combined cycle power plants because of low price of gas. Because of the EPA requirements, a lot of fossil units are going to require some revamp in the environmental equipment on the back end in order to comply with the EPA requirements. You're seeing several customers announce several -- or chemical plants on the ethylene side of the business in various parts of the U.S. So I think that's probably got a little bit longer runway. And then, probably, the last thing which has some good growth prospects going forward, but a little bit longer term, would be the LNG as an export as a result of the low price of natural gas.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And if I may, just one last question. On guidance, you kept the range, which was still fairly large, $8.00 to $8.80. Curious, why is it still so wide? It sounds like you do have more confidence in what you're seeing in the market. Maybe if you could just discuss what are kind of the big swing factors here?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, a couple of things. I mean, normally, if you've followed our cadence, we've maintained our guidance typically into the fall. You also have big volatility in currency. Look at the impact it had year-over-year just in the first quarter alone of $0.17 overall. So that's part of the reason that we do it. And it may be $0.80, but it's a 10% range. It's not uncommon that companies have a 10% range overall in their earnings guidance. But we -- as we drill down towards the end of the year and get more information, we always try to put it out there to the street.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Maczka.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","On pricing, there's a comment about actions you took in 2011 on FCD. I'm just wondering if you can talk about pricing in general on the OE side? And is it fair to say that it's the past-due backlog and the bad [ph] margin backlog is pressuring margins by 200 basis points now, that current orders are coming in and closing that gap?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, the comment that was in the script was on the FCD side of the business. And what it related to was a number of different initiatives that go into pricing, one of them being our lean initiative there, our -- and then issues in terms of low-cost sourcing, which we feel pretty good about on the FCD side because it's a pretty high percentage of the business between 30% to 40%. We've had a number of other initiatives going on in terms of just material costing. We've continued to maneuver things around our worldwide asset base to capture the overall margins. So those initiatives that we took at a very detailed level are now beginning to bear fruit as we execute those orders.","Mark A. Blinn","So I mean, part of that comment was just, for Tom to help you understand how he's running this business, and we think that's important for folks to understand. If you go back to where we were a year ago, a year ago plus, when we talked about choppy and competitive, you were looking as we've commented then, about absorption in your factories filling your factories. Sometimes you had to take projects that had no margin in them to make sure you could absorb your factories. As we started talking about our markets firming up, as we did towards the latter part of last year, what that said is that some of the capacity in the industry was starting to get picked up. And now as we roll into this year, we talked about firming, yet still competitive, markets but a lot of what Tom's doing relative to some of the initiatives on the front end to drive pricing. I think to take it even further, Mike's comments earlier is, you'll see the benefit of a lot of these initiatives over the next 3 to 4 quarters.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Got it. And then shifting gears to the working capital with the inventory increase that we saw. And I understand that bookings were up and revenues were up. But at some point here, should investors be expecting that we start to see some of that actually liquidate and not grow less than revenues are growing, but actually declines in the inventory levels?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, Kevin, good point. And no, you're absolutely right. I think traditionally, more seasonal growth in inventory year-over-year. You saw the similar thing last year where we had inventory effect of about -- a use of about $107 million this year on the statement of cash flow was about $112, $113. So -- but no, that is one of the top priorities that I have, and Tom and I are actually working together to improve on-time delivery to get this past-due backlog off and to increase our inventory turns. Some of the things we talk about every day here and I'll continue to talk about those. So big focus on working capital. I still believe there is several hundred million dollars that we can monetize out of our working capital balance between accounts receivables inventory and accounts payable, just better management of that and that's our long-term goal. We'll get it done.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just really one question, and this one's for Tom Pajonas. I'm just wondering, what are some of the things that you're working on right now? I know Mark rattled through a couple of things that you were doing that were starting to have an effect and maybe what are the 2 or 3 big buckets that you're focused on in improving the operations and when will we see their benefit in the margin?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, I mean, that's a good question. I mean, if you look at -- since I took over, I mean, the first thing I would just say structurally, it may not seem like a lot, but we have the people in place. We got the structure in place. People know what their goals are. They know what their runway is here in terms of hitting those particulars goals. I would say very good clarity on getting the business set up. In terms of the specific initiatives, I mean, obviously, the customer focus one is the one that is extremely powerful in the organization here, especially the on-time delivery and cost per quality. Those are 2 areas that we'll drive religiously here in all the different units. And I think you're going to see some good effects as a result of the initiatives in those areas. Michael already mentioned the working capital, so I won't go through that. But other areas like centralizing, casting buys for the whole business -- across the business so that we get very good at specification development, expediting vendors, making sure that when we put something in the vendor shop they have the capacity. So we're looking at centralizing several of those items, including motors. And then, I would say, 2 or 3 other areas of research and technology, we brought that under one head. So I would expect to see a much more robust process than what we had in the past there. And then proposal and contract management, where we can now begin to centralize on terms and conditions differently. We can begin to centralize on how we cost the job and so on will, I think, reach some benefits going forward.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. Just the only other question is, with respect to the implementation of these initiatives, have you found the need to move people from Flow Control where you run that business for so long and so well into the other operating units to kind of get the point across?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, that's an excellent point. Yes, we -- I mean, we will -- we constantly look at moving people around. But I would say, first, is one individual that we did move around towards the back end of 2011 was the Vice President of supply chain moving from the Valve group into the Pump area. And that was, I think we mentioned at that time, to kind of get out some of the low-cost sourcing initiatives that we have. Plus he's a good commodity strategist relative to the motors and the castings here that we have. So that was certainly one area that we have. And then, we have -- we have moved people, I would say, at a much lower level in their organization on the project side of the business. But we'll continue to drive that across those platforms now that we have an easier mechanism to do that from a structure standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Halloran.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So could you guys talk a little bit about utilization levels, both for your facilities, as well as what you guys are seeing in the industry and with the little bit better order trends that you're seeing this quarter? Maybe also a commentary on how you expect that utilization level to track through the year?","Mark A. Blinn","I think where we're -- the focus really in what you're seeing is on the highly engineered rotating equipment side around capacity utilization, and there's a couple of things that have happened with capacity. If you saw last year, some of the capacity has changed hands into companies that have a lot of certainly a tremendous amount of discipline. A good example is the ClydeUnion assets going into SPX. SPX well run, good discipline. So there's -- the assets have become more disciplined and utilization is starting to go up. Overall generally in the industry, you saw a lot of capacity come online in 2010 and some in 2011, but that's starting to get claimed with projects that came through, primarily in the Middle East in '10 and '11, but also, with some of the things that we're seeing. So as we look over the horizon in the engineered rotating equipment side, you're seeing the industry do it as well and start to think about how they want to use capacity over the next 18 months. So it's starting to pick up.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's encouraging. And then when you think about the margin improvement potential, on a qualitative basis, could you just talk about where you see the biggest opportunity in buckets in terms of pricing, leverage or kind of internal operational-oriented improvement?","Mark A. Blinn","I think the -- I mean, market-driven, there's going to be certainly -- the pricing opportunity as things firm up on the EPD and the engineered side. And leverage is going to be around the fixed cost leverage absorption in the SG&A side, and so I would say they're balanced really across all 3 of those, if you think about it. And that is we spent a couple of years realigning our business, driving a lot of the front end and investment to emerging parts of the world. And now what Tom is focused on is we've had a -- we've got a lot of talent capabilities in this business, is bringing that efficiency and driving execution across the business to leverage margins overall in our business. So we look at all 3 of those really as being able to leverage our margins going forward. And that's what we talked about 150 to 250 basis points, it comes really from all 3. Because if you looked at, historically, back in the '07, '08 time period, those were pretty much very high-priced environments, where people were paying for manufacturing slots. We don't need that environment again to get to the 150 to 250 that we're talking about. Really, it's just driving the 3 things you talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Last quarter, you gave us some idea in terms of how much you've monetized of the lower margin past-due backlog. I believe it was approximately $60 million. And you sort of indicated that you like to bring down the total below $200 million. Want to quantify what we did this quarter and are we on track?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, good question. We are on track. We made some improvement on our past-due backlog. And I'd say we're probably about halfway of where we need it to get to from that quantification of that $60 million or so. So we improved it, I think somewhere in that $10 million to $20 million range or so. Not quite half, but we made improvement and we certainly feel confident we'll get there by second quarter into the third quarter.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's the reason why we're sort of approaching the third quarter here a little bit. Okay. And then my other question is on the EPD segment. The sale of the facility, so to back that out -- I want to confirm my numbers here. So my adjusted operating margin comes into the range of about a 15 plus there? I just wanted to confirm that with you.","Michael S. Taff","Yes, that's about right.","Mark A. Blinn","Right.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are there any other facilities that we should be thinking about, longer term, that this should be the objective of management in terms of completely selling them off and then ramping up a more efficient line?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, we talked about -- we've had a facility in Brazil for quite a number of years, but it was very constrained. One, because of where it was located. It was constrained in terms of manufacturing and transportation test size capabilities. And so to respond to the market there in Brazil, we decided to build a new facility. But this sale opportunity, if you think about it, we got a very good price for our old facility. It almost covered half the cost of our new facility, which is much larger, has more product offerings and more capabilities. So it -- we're always going to do what makes sense in terms of overall in our business. And we were able to sell this facility, monetize it, pay for almost half of the new one and start the migration process to our new facility. So if in terms of being able to drive good efficiency in our business and make the right long-term decisions for the company and our shareholders, you can expect the management will do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Rose.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick ones. You had mentioned a couple of items that were driving improvements on the front end of the business, particularly the backlog. As we look at the backlog and we're trying to get a little bit more comfortable with the backlog going into a higher margin level in the back half of the year, what sort of KPI should we be thinking about? And maybe give us some examples of how that backlog improves? Because I get the pricing standpoint. You mentioned FCD, for example, and on-time delivery, I think you gave us a 91% number. Are there particular KPIs that we should be looking out for both EPD, as well as IPD?","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, I think, when we discuss operational metrics, there is a correlation between on-time delivery and margins in almost all instances. So I think, as you follow around on-time delivery. But I think, as you look at some of the things we discussed, a leading indicator of margins is certainly going to [Audio Gap] far, a long leading indicator is going to be our commentary around the markets, especially on the large projects and firming markets, which tend to give you some power in terms of absorbing your facilities and getting the fixed cost leverage. I think, also, the pricing that we talk about, it's still competitive out there, but as markets start to firm, pricing comes around. So that's probably one of the longest lead indicators in terms of margin. One of the shortest ones, in terms of bookings in the sales line, is going to be our aftermarket business. As that grows, that's high-margin business and very stable margins. So if you look at our order book, those are probably your indicators from longest to shortest from the -- and going back to Mike Halloran's comments earlier from the SG&A side, it's just margins on around how we're going to leverage SG&A. Cost controls, how we're going to leverage our SG&A overall in the business. And then, I think, finally, the operating metrics because we can drive efficiency in our business and efficiency correlates to margins. So I'm just trying to lay it out for you in terms of our commentary in this press release and following the business over the last couple of years, that's how you can follow the margin profile of our business.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. I was just really trying to understand, is how do we get more comfortable that backlog won't have some of the same headwinds that the first half did, and that was really getting the backlog out the door, I mean, on-time delivery.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, I think it is. But that's one of the most important things is to clear this, as you see at the end of the cycle and as we start clearing the backlog and driving some of the initiatives that we have. Some of the comments you've heard us talk about on our long lead time projects now we'll start to see over the next 3 to 4 quarters. But I think the ones that'll have the more immediate impact that you can watch are going to be our aftermarket growth in our business, our SG&A leverage and then our periodic commentary about operational leverage that we're getting in the business. I mean if you take a step back -- I mean, I know we just talked about EPD's margins, well, in the highly engineered pump business, those are the strongest margins that are out there. And so we continue to drive those higher and higher, but we'll refer to operational metrics and things that we're talking about. Those tend to have an immediate impact as well.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then lastly, Mark, on that note on aftermarket bookings figures. When we look at the figures, how are you thinking about the comparisons in Q2 2012 versus Q2 2011? If I'm not mistaken, the EPD and IPD have easier comparisons than Q1. Do we still think about it in terms of year-over-year comparisons?","Mark A. Blinn","Let me make sure I understand your question. In terms of aftermarket, is your question in Q2 of 2012 versus Q2 of 2011. Was that your question?","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes. I mean, if -- Q1 2011, you had a fairly significant increase, so your comparisons look tougher. So do you think about it that way? Do they get easier in Q2 versus last year?","Mark A. Blinn","We typically look at it -- this is a comment back from years ago, not being quarter-to-quarter. And a good example is, this year, you look at FCD's bookings and relatively flat, slightly up on constant currency. But if you look at last year, it was up 30% over the prior year. So we really look at long-term trends overall in our business. We'll look at rolling 4 quarter because there is seasonality to our business. I can tell you, if you look at order books and sales in the third quarter, particularly in EMA, a lot of folks are on vacation. So we tend to look things over a rolling period of time. What we like about the aftermarket business, is it's approaching $2 billion. It's been high-margin, stable business and we've been growing it at a 7% to 8% clip. And if you look at the global installed base around the world net, it does not increase by 7% to 8%. It's actually less than that. So what we're doing is we're not only taking care of the incremental installed base, but gaining share through our end-user strategies. That's how we look at it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stewart Scharf.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","I was wondering if there is any impact you're seeing or you expect to see from some of the consolidation in oil and gas business, Sonoco and other recent energy transfer partners acquisitions and some private equity? And whether you see that having any impact on the pipeline operation and refinery, so forth?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, it's early to tell with ETP and Sonoco, what's going to happen. But if you take a step back and you look at what's happened in the oil and gas industry and particularly in our industry, some of the efforts over the last couple of years, it really supports the thesis that energy, oil and gas, power, and even water, has a strong secular growth cycle, and that's why these folks are making these investments, that's why industries are consolidating to get leverage, to be able to get access to the capital for the investment that's required. So it does support our long-term trend assumptions in our business over the next 10 to 20 years about the growth opportunities in the energy side of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Moore.","John R. Moore - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Just one question on the orders, and this is probably a follow-up to the one asked previously. The order growth in EPD was obviously very impressive this quarter and bodes well for that division here later this year and into '13. And I realize the IPD and FCD divisions face some more difficult comps, but would you say the strength in EPD you saw this quarter is actually an indication that IPD and FCD orders should accelerate from here? Or are they facing some other kind of end-market trend that EPD isn't?","Mark A. Blinn","No, no, I mean, we talked about the short cycle business. And again, I'll just caution not to make a call on a quarter. There could be a compare issue to last year, one project. You certainly saw that in EPD. You take a step back and think about Tom's comments, we had a very large project that came through. It was very competitive, but will offer great aftermarket opportunity for 15 to 20 years. And that was in the order book last year in EPD. So what it does tell you on, if you see sustained growth in the long cycle business, that's indicative. And it's later cycle, it indicates that, that long cycle business is starting to come back. What that means for our industry is that capacity starts to get utilized to the question earlier, that also you're starting to get better absorption and pricing through. What it'll do is that'll tend to run on for a period of time. I mean, if you think about it, EPD's long cycle business stayed in our P&L 'til really, the latter part of 2010. So that's what that means overall for our industry. It also means -- but it brings long investment in the short cycle business and brings long aftermarket opportunity. So that's the way to think of it, and if you think about our commentary, we've seen firming markets and we see opportunities for some of these projects that you've seen engineering and contracting firms talk about to come our way towards the end of this year beginning in next year. So this is typically how it feels when things start to pick up overall in our industry. On the short cycle business, I would always say, you need to look over a couple of quarters and look at growth rates, because that can fluctuate certainly from quarter-to-quarter. But we like what we've seen in our short cycle business and we're looking to grow them.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jeff Beach.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Beginning of the presentation, you highlighted shale gas, tar sands, LNG opportunities. My question is, are all of these large enough in size to actually grow that slice of the pie in view of your growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East, aftermarket, so many other drivers. Can you actually increase that percentage going into, let's say, North America energy?","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, we can on a relative basis. But one thing I always comment, Jeff, is not any one of these things is going to become a predominant part of our order book or our revenues. We're diversified across multiple applications. But I think what I -- the theme is consistent. You're seeing these more complex applications come to market, and that's where our technology and engineering capabilities are able to respond. What we didn't talk about was our increased presence in the thermal solar. We've seen increased orders in some of our molten salt pumps. That came from basically very little to nothing a couple of years ago. So these are all applications that we're able to take our capabilities in our global manufacturing and address these markets. Clearly, one notable thing you've seen in the United States. And I do think if you look at our North America growth, it will have a notable impact, is with gas being at this cost it's becoming a low-cost feedstock and it's bringing investment on in the chemical industry. Which we saw the chemical industry basically, I think it was about 4 years ago as it started to really cycle down hard. And when you saw it come back, which it typically does with GDP, but this is kind of an added boost in North America, being that it's a -- natural gas is a low-cost feedstock.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then, specifically, within this midstream infrastructure in North America energy, is there one division that benefits more than the others? And what would be a couple of the major products?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, yes, I think they all 3 benefit on midstream application, and this is even a further enhancement from the One Flowserve. Clearly, the type of rotating equipment that goes on to some of these pipeline structures, particularly the liquid ones, are supported by EPD and IPD. But also, you have, for safety reasons, you have valves that are at certain locations. They're either modulating the flow, or for example, in our trunnion-mounted ball valve that are actually safety valves, that it can isolate a piece of the pipeline to make sure if there is any problem, it doesn't spill over into other parts of the pipeline. So we do -- a lot of our products are able to go into these pipelines, particularly on the liquid side. And now with -- what Tom was talking about, now we can even bring more of an opportunity to bear when we go to pursue these opportunities.","Thomas L. Pajonas","And I would also add one other thing to that. A lot of these pipelines are adding capacity so we have a lot of aftermarket growth opportunities in the pipeline area also.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn it back to Mr. Mullin for closing remarks.","Mike Mullin","Thank you, Kim, and thank you all for joining today.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone.","Overall, we delivered strong operating and financial results for the fourth quarter, which ensured a solid full year 2014. We operated at a very high level throughout the year, and I am pleased that our employees have strengthened their customer focus and demonstrated commitment to raising the bar through our Performance Culture initiative. These efforts are delivering value for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders.","Equally important, I believe our actions in 2014 will better position the company for 2015 and beyond. Even though Flowserve is currently operating at its highest level of performance, there remains heightened market uncertainty following the rapid decline in oil and headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar. While we can't influence the markets, we are focusing on what is within our control, namely, continuing to deliver for our customers, operational excellence, tight cost control, pursuing disciplined investments to drive sustainable long-term growth, and returning capital to our shareholders. This formula served us well in the past market cycles, and we believe it is the logical course now. Additionally, we expect this current market environment will provide us additional opportunities to grow our market leadership from a position of strength. With the strong results and improvements that we've delivered over the past few years, we have full confidence in Flowserve's operating platform.","In light of recent commodity price movements, I believe it's important to clarify our exposure to oil and gas. In 2014, what we label oil and gas represented about 43% of our consolidated bookings. Our largest oil and gas exposures are in the mid and downstream markets, accounting for roughly 75% to 80% of our total oil and gas exposure.","Even more relevant, the over 80% of our company's revenue is aftermarket in what we call run-rate original equipment, which both entails serving existing permanent assets in place and relying more on maintenance budgets than capital spending. We expect current price levels will significantly reduce demand for new upstream oil and gas projects, as we've seen from recent customers' CapEx announcements. However, this type of project represents only a modest portion of our total oil and gas exposure. Considering the oil price decline is not primarily a demand issue, but rather supply driven this time, our midstream and downstream customers continue to operate their facilities at high utilization rates, and their out-of-service cost far exceeds that of proper repair, maintenance, and replacement that our aftermarket and run-rate activities represent.","This is not to suggest we're immune to market dynamics and commodity price. However, we believe the current market and its impact is very different from 2009, when virtually all industries were impacted. And we continue to believe our company's overall diversification remains one of our greatest strengths. For instance, many of the industries that comprise the other 57% of our consolidated bookings can actually benefit from lower oil and gas prices.","Additionally, in 2014 we experienced solid activity levels, demonstrated by a book-to-bill of 1.06 and a near $150 million increase in backlog. On a currency neutral basis that better indicates actual activity levels, bookings grew about 8% for the year, including over 11% in the fourth quarter, with December serving as our strongest bookings month. I believe our employees' focus on serving the customer led to this strong performance.","Our full-year bookings growth was primarily driven by our oil and gas and chemical markets and to a lesser extent general industries. Geographically, we delivered growth in all regions except Asia-Pacific. Strength in North America continued through the fourth quarter. And while Europe declined in the quarter, it follows several prior quarters of year-over-year growth, implying it is mainly a timing issue. The Middle East returned to growth in 2014 following two challenging years, and we expect the region to continue investing to increase higher-value downstream production.","Growth in Latin America for the year was driven by a very strong fourth quarter. As Tom will mention, this required some significant redirection on our part. And we believe political and currency challenges may continue to present headwinds for certain national oil companies.","Asia slowed in 2014, representing our only regional market that declined for the year. We continue to expect long-term growth in Asia, and our objective remains to further increase our presence.","Turning to our end markets, while the visibility into our oil and gas customers' spending plans for 2015 remains limited, as I previously mentioned, we believe the announced CapEx reductions will have a lesser impact on our aftermarket and run-rate activity and midstream and downstream spending in general as opposed to upstream CapEx driven projects. Long term, we believe in the upstream markets, and will continue to pursue growth opportunities in this area.","We see growth prospects from our chemical markets in 2015 and would highlight the ethylene expansion in the Gulf Coast region as a leading indicator, since those projects have yet to significantly reach procurement stage for many of our offerings. While power markets have been competitive over the last few years, we continue to expect Asian investment to support growth.","Fourth quarter bookings strength reflected nuclear activity in China as well as solar investments in Africa and Latin America. The growth and quality of our backlog and its broad exposure to industries and geographies increases my confidence that Flowserve's diversified model is the right one to pursue.","I also want to emphasize the highly synergistic nature of our original equipment and aftermarket activities. Our 200-year-plus history of installed base provided the opportunity for us to grow and build the $2.1 billion aftermarket franchise as well as the run-rate business.","Likewise, our aftermarket capabilities and our global footprint now serve as a competitive advantage when selling original equipment, and then the process repeats. These two aspects of our business truly do leverage each other, and they are critical together for our ongoing success.","In addition to solid bookings, Flowserve drove meaningful gross margin expansion, which drove operating margin improvement in 2014. This level of operational excellence demonstrates the success of the initiatives we've undertaken to drive results from within the four walls of Flowserve. The progress we've delivered provides the foundation that underlies our disciplined, profitable growth plans for 2015 and beyond, including R&D expansion, new product development, aftermarket acceleration, leveraging the recent SIHI acquisition, and increasing market share. As top line growth returns, Flowserve has good opportunities for SG&A leverage that would provide further operating margin growth.","Even in the current macro environment, we have industry-specific plans to grow our business, including in chemical and emerging market power. And with our solid capital structure, we will continue to evaluate and pursue disciplined M&A opportunities. And I am confident that our operating excellence strategies, including One Flowserve, and our culture of continuous improvement has positioned us to capture synergies across our business, drive further margin expansion, expand organically, and leverage our operating platform to efficiently integrate any bolt-on acquisitions. We will remain committed to disciplined, profitable growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders.","And in periods of market uncertainty, we will focus on the areas we can control. We believe we can capture more value from our $2 billion-plus aftermarket franchise, which has consistently demonstrated resiliency even through challenging project environments. Our diverse geographic and end-market exposures should again serve us well as we flex the business to areas with greater market opportunities when others are challenged. While we will take advantage of opportunities to adjust our cost structure and operating platform, our vision is long term, and we will remain focused on investing in the business and our people while we advance our culture of performance.","In summary, we expect to profitably manage and grow our business to create long-term value for you, our shareholders.","Let me now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","I'm also very proud of the performance we delivered in 2014. We continued to strengthen our operational foundation, building upon our long-term strategy to increase our operating excellence, efficiency, and flexibility. As Mark indicated, the Flowserve engine is operating at a very high level. This is a clear testament to our employees and their embrace of our strategic vision, execution focus, and service to our customers.","We were very pleased with our ability to flex the business across Flowserve's diverse end market and regional exposures while tightly controlling our cost structure. Although the larger project work did not materialize during 2014, which limited our revenue growth, we still delivered meaningful margin improvement at both the gross and operating line, largely just from the run-rate business and aftermarket franchise. In fact, we reached the top end of our three-year margin target in spite of the continued project delays and increased macro uncertainty in some of our markets. The operational performance we delivered truly highlights the competitive advantage that exists in Flowserve with its diverse end markets and geographies.","While pleased with the operating levels we have obtained, I am also confident that potential for further improvement remains. Our culture of performance positions us to capture additional identified opportunities through quality initiatives, project management, supply chain, low-cost sourcing, and new product introductions, to name a few.","Our continued effort will enhance our performance, better serve our customers, drive profitable organic and inorganic growth, and ultimately deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Over the last three years, we have made investments and progress to increase our operating platforms, low-cost manufacturing capability and flexibility. This effort results in an improved ability to shift with the changing activity levels within our served regions and end markets.","Latin America in 2014 is a market that epitomizes this flexibility. For instance, we experienced lower activity levels from certain customers in Venezuela and Brazil during the year, which would have otherwise presented headwinds for us. However, we successfully shifted meaningful parts of our Latin America business to Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile, which overcame the other countries' decline and drove solid results for the region.","Turning to our growth outlook, our strong fourth quarter bookings reflected solid activity levels across all of our end markets with the exception of water, which is only a modest exposure for us. We ended the year with a backlog of $2.7 billion, a near 12% constant currency increase over 2013 year-end levels. More importantly, the quality of the backlog continued to improve throughout 2014, which provides our confidence in reaffirming our 2015 targets today.","As you have heard, we intend to continue to drive growth in our aftermarket franchise. In 2014, our initiatives to greater utilize our aftermarket business delivered strong full-year bookings, with growth of nearly 9% on a constant currency basis, including the fourth quarter's record level bookings of over $550 million.","Our aftermarket footprint and capabilities also provide a competitive advantage when pursuing original equipment work, where we delivered constant currency bookings growth of over 7% during the year. With the larger OE projects still on the horizon, we again derived the vast majority of our OE bookings from run-rate activity.","Turning to our end markets in more detail, oil and gas growth continued in the fourth quarter, as bookings increased over 12% on a constant currency basis, even with the sharp oil price decline that was occurring during the period. We also saw the continuation of 2014's year-long trend with increased aftermarket bookings in the southern U.S. and Gulf Coast regions during the fourth quarter, as downstream players were catching up on prior deferred maintenance.","As Mark discussed, with most of our oil and gas exposure in the mid and downstream markets, we expect less of an impact from the oil price. While we recognize the overall pressure being exerted across all phases of the oil and gas industry, we continue to have opportunities in selected regions for upstream, midstream, and downstream work, particularly in our run-rate and aftermarket businesses.","Upstream OE project work, which represents a modest exposure for us, faces the most risk at current commodity levels. And this portion of the market has certainly seen some increased delays and cancellations. However, even with our upstream work, we continued to see aftermarket activity mainly from our exposure to oil sands production and FPSO vessels.","Of course, we do not say that we are immune to the commodity price or the energy complex, but we do feel pretty well positioned overall and even expect some of our other industry exposures to benefit from these low prices, such as the chemical and power markets.","As the energy markets digest the current conditions, our improved operations and the flexibility I spoke of earlier provide opportunity to capitalize on the investment that does take place around the world. For instance, Mexico plans to increase its production. The Middle East desires to climb the value chain further into refined products and clean fuels, as well as other refining activity in certain Asian markets provide just a few examples.","In the chemical market, fourth quarter bookings increased over 15% on a constant currency basis. New capacity projects in North America continued to advance with six of the 12 planned ethane crackers currently under construction, with the remainder in various stages between feasibility to permitting.","As discussed, the pace of bidding activity has been deliberate by our customers and most of the opportunities are still ahead, but these could remain tempered by the general macro conditions. We continue to expect to participate in these new capacity additions on the Gulf Coast as the procurement process has yet to reach the stage that includes many of our products.","In the Middle East, expansion efforts continue. Meanwhile, Asia and Latin America are reassessing their chemical plans based on slower economic growth there and competing opportunities in the U.S., while some European capacity is expected to utilize U.S. ethane.","In January 2015, we increased our chemical presence substantially with the acquisition of SIHI. While it is still early days, we believe the integration process of this business is progressing well and that our potential to leverage top line and cost synergies is significant. We are excited about the possibilities with SIHI as part of Flowserve.","The power market delivered particularly strong fourth quarter bookings, with a 19% increase over last year. Strong nuclear activity in China and solar projects in Africa and Latin America provided part of the pickup. North America power remains challenged for most fuel sources given the current slower growth environment and ongoing regulatory uncertainty. However, the low price of natural gas and the announced CO2 reduction guidelines are helping drive the U.S. combined cycle market, subject to adequate pipeline capacity.","Longer term, we still believe that new generation is required globally. China, India, and Russia are indicating they will pursue fossil-based projects. Our recently completed Block III in Coimbatore, India will provide a platform to capture power market opportunities in their country. Parts of Europe are even investing in fossil-based projects as certain countries retreat from nuclear power. The Middle East also sees increased needs both in conventional and solar power.","Nuclear power remains in transition. But China, Russia, and South Korea see continued development, and there are discussions on new capacity in some regions of Europe. India's new proposed agreement with the U.S. that will limit nuclear suppliers' liability could potentially be a meaningful catalyst for work in that country.","Europe's aging fleet also may provide us future work as life extensions over the next several years take place. Following their new safety standards, Japan is getting closer to restarting a portion of its nuclear capacity, which has been idle since 2011. Finally, natural gas combined cycle plants remain a global opportunity.","Wrapping up, we believe that Flowserve's high level of operational performance and diverse exposure provides us a level of resiliency and flexibility to adjust to target and capture market opportunities where they occur even in times of increased uncertainty. We will execute initiatives to accelerate our aftermarket and chemical growth and target opportunities in emerging power markets such as India and China, regional upstream oil and gas opportunities, particularly in the Middle East, and then mining. In addition, I am also confident that our operating platform supports our acquisition strategy of efficiently integrating bolt-on businesses to drive long-term profitable growth.","With that overview, let me now turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Mark and Tom have discussed our operational overview and business outlook in detail. So let me finish with a quick discussion of our financial results. Our results finished at the upper end of our preview range that we provided in late January. I'll provide some additional details, then discuss the 2015 guidance.","As you have heard, Flowserve finished 2014 performing at a high level. With sales of nearly $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, we grew constant currency revenues by over 5%. For the full year, constant currency revenues were up modestly, but this level was below our original expectation. Essentially, large project opportunities did not occur when anticipated. We divested the Naval business and experienced some customer-directed shipment delays, which all had an impact on revenue recognition.","Turning to margins, 2014 was the first year that each quarter delivered gross margins over 35%, exceeding even our expectations. For the fourth quarter, gross margin was 35.2%, an improvement of 130 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, our gross margin improved 110 basis points over prior year, averaging the fourth quarter level at 35.2%.","SG&A dollars decreased for both the fourth quarter and full year by nearly $9 million and $30 million respectively. As a percentage of sales, SG&A declined by 60 basis points in the quarter and by 30 basis points for the full year to 18.2% and 19.2% respectively. We will continue to work towards our goal of lowering SG&A as a percentage of sales to 18% over the next few years.","Solid gross profit improvement combined with a reduction in SG&A drove a 200 basis point improvement in operating margins for the fourth quarter to 17.3%. For the full year, we delivered a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins to 16.2%. This level reached the top end of our goal we originally set in early 2012, which was to increase operating margins 150 to 250 basis points by the end of 2014.","Below operating income, our fourth quarter tax rate of 29.4% and full-year rate of 28.4%, both which were generally in line with our original tax rate guidance of 30%.","Turning to cash flows, we finished the year strong, reflecting the typical seasonality of our business. Flowserve generated $445 million in operating cash flows in Q4 alone, an increase of nearly 18% over prior year. For the full year, our cash flow from operations of $571 million represents a 17% increase over 2013 levels. While I am pleased with this strong performance, we will stay focused on improving Flowserve's cash generation. Our goal remains to consistently generate free cash flow near our net income level.","Our capital expenditures for the year of about $133 million was well below our last updated forecast, as some of our spending on the new Chinese valve facility slipped into 2015. However, even at the reported level, our spending level was above our rate of depreciation. This investment demonstrates our commitment to invest in organic opportunities for the long-term growth of our business, including increased capabilities to serve the emerging regions.","Returning capital to shareholders is also a key priority. And in 2014, we returned $332 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing about 64% of our net income. This was a result of our strong cash flows and as we increased allocation to repurchases at attractive values in the final quarter of 2014. We maintained substantial financial flexibility at year end, with a gross leverage ratio of 1.3 times EBITDA and well within our stated one to two times range. This capacity in our range enables us to pursue investment opportunities that generate long-term profitable growth such as the recent SIHI acquisition.","Turning to working capital, Flowserve made modest progress. We reduced our dollar inventory by $60 million. Inventory turns improved to 3.6 times, a 0.1 turn improvement over 2013, and we increased our on-time delivery and drove the past-due backlog below 4%.","Our focus on receivables produced a two day DSO improvement versus 2013 levels. With our project management team focused on improving the working capital processes across our operating platform, I remain confident that Flowserve will make meaningful strides in 2015 towards reaching our targeted DSO level in the mid-60 days.","Moving to our 2015 outlook and EPS guidance, we are reaffirming our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.60 to $4.00 a share. This range includes $0.20 per share of above-the-line currency impact using year-end 2014 foreign exchange rates. Obviously, the dollar has strengthened from year end. And should this level continue throughout 2015, it would result in an impact larger than $0.20.","The adjustment in our guidance for 2015 excludes primarily the dilutive impact of the recent SIHI Group acquisition and any below-the-line currency impact.","Similar to recent years, 2015 should reflect our traditional seasonality, with earnings more weighted to the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect the first half of the year to experience the largest year-over-year comparable challenge due to the stronger U.S. dollar, last year's $12.6 million first quarter gain on the sale of Naval, and potential oil and gas spending pressure.","We remain committed to executing on our strategy of efficient capital deployment, including annually returning 40% to 50% of our two-year average net earnings to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At year end, $464 million remained available under our current share repurchase plan authorization. As evidence of our commitment, earlier this week our Board approved a 12.5% increase in the quarterly per share dividend to $0.18 per share for the next quarterly payment. This represents our fifth consecutive annual double-digit increase in our per share dividends.","Including 2014's carryover amount, we expect to invest $150 million to $160 million in capital expenditures during 2015. At this level, we will continue to profitably grow our business organically and to further increase our capabilities around the world.","On a final note, we announced this morning that I will be leaving Flowserve in the coming weeks. I have very much enjoyed my time with the company, and I am proud of the finance team we have in place today and their many accomplishments. However, as some of you know, I have maintained my residence in Houston throughout my three-plus year tenure at Flowserve, commuting back and forth each week.","I believe that as Flowserve enters this new phase of its growth plan, this serves as a good time for new finance leadership to take the helm as I return to my family full time and pursue future endeavors back in Houston. Clearly, I will continue to do whatever is needed to ensure a smooth transition and I will remain a proud Flowserve shareholder as I believe this company has a very bright future ahead.","Let me now return the call to Mark.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike.","On behalf of the Board, the senior management team, our employees, shareholders, and other Flowserve constituencies, we very much thank you for your service with the company. You're leaving the finance organization in better shape than you found it, and we very much appreciate the finance leadership team you have assembled. Our leadership team is confident they will rise to the occasion as we patiently search for our new CFO. Our standards will be high, looking an operationally focused financial leader who has bandwidth for further career progression. It has been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the times ahead.","Operator, we will now open up the call to any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Charlie.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Mike, sorry to see you go, but I totally understand the reasons why you're doing that.","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","A quick question on IPD and the bookings that were down. I know in the slides, you talked about some of the end markets. But maybe you can go into a little more detail on what you're seeing just within industrial products. And on the flip side of that, obviously the margins there were pretty strong. Can you talked about what drove the margin performance there, anything one-off that pushed it higher that may not in the near term?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, Charlie, just some of you folks may have had difficulty hearing that. The question was around IPD bookings Q4-over-Q4 and then the margin improvement. So if you look year over year, it was really the compare to 2013. We had some smaller projects that booked in the IPD segment in the oil and gas in the fourth quarter of 2013. And if you look at the bookings quarter by quarter, a small amount like that can have an impact. It's better to look at the full-year trend. Remember, as we came into 2014, we said good progress on the margin improvement. Now we need to start working on growth, and I think the SIHI acquisition is a great example of that.","As to the margins, the primary impact is what we set out a number of years ago is to improve the business, which has been a priority. In fact, it's probably fair to say that's been a priority for the last three years at Flowserve is to improve the platform, and in fact you saw that. There was a little more aftermarket. And also keep in mind with the Innomag acquisition, we had purchase price accounting in Q4 2013. That was a much smaller impact in the improvement. But in fairness on the compares, you need to consider that as well.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks, and just one quick follow-up. In relation to Brazil specifically, are you guys seeing any customer issues down there? There was another company out today talking about some E&Cs have gone bankrupt. They've taken an accounts receivable hit. I was just wondering if you guys have looked at that. And within the backlog, is there anything in it that's maybe at risk because of what's going down in Brazil specifically with what the government is doing down there with anti-corruption? Thanks.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Again, we're still optimistic on that region in the world long term. Keep in mind, they've got quite a few reserves and they do need to monetize them, and we're there to support them. But in the short term, we do continue to monitor that. And we haven't had a material impact in our financial statements, but that's certainly something that's ongoing down there.","As Tom talked about, we have that from time to time. You see that in Latin America. There can be impacts down there, but we are able to shift. You do have \u2013 while you have challenges there, you have strength in Mexico. But we certainly monitor that very, very carefully and our exposures as well, and I haven't seen anything impact yet, but we're keeping an eye on it.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","And I would add to that, Mark, that obviously Petrobras is going through a reassessment of some of their projects based on some of the issues that they've had with the FTCA, which has been publicized in many of the papers.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","Mike, the best of luck to you. You're definitely one of the good guys out there.","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","We agree with you.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","I'm sure. I'm just wanted to ask you, Mark, about the bookings. You've indicated that December was the strongest month of the quarter, which obviously for a lot of us gives us the wow, why's. Just can you talk about what areas of the company was stronger in December? And then maybe as we turn the calendar, if I could attach this question onto that, what do the oil and gas bookings look like now halfway through the first quarter?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","We don't give intra-quarter indications. We'll wait until things pan out because, as you saw in the last quarter, we saw a lot of activity at the end, in the last month. This is similar in what we've talked about before. By that time we get to the bidding phase of a lot of these projects, typically there has been a substantial amount of investment. And so as that activity was working through last summer, it continued to follow through.","The thing that we need to keep an eye on, Scott, going forward is some of the projects. And you've already seen some in the news that aren't at the bidding phase but are still in the conception phase or in the early phases that they may say hey, look, we've going to delay this, or you saw the big project in the Middle East, the LNG one, where they said they were going to cancel it. So it's usually the longer lead times that we tend to take a look at. So that's in effect what you saw is they don't turn these projects on a dime, especially when it comes to bidding our equipment because there has been a lot of investment at that point in time.","Also, I think it's fair for everybody to keep in mind. Here we are on the other side of discussion, where there was frustration over the last couple years as when are the big projects coming, when are the big projects coming. The fact is we haven't been real reliant on these big projects for a couple of years. We saw one I think back in 2012. In the third quarter, we saw a couple of other smaller ones. So as you look forward, we haven't been reliant. We were looking for them to come.","What does this environment mean? It means it's going to remain competitive in pricing. I do think as suppliers look out there, they're going to try to get visibility as we are, and it could put some pressure on pricing on some of these projects as well. They'll certainly continue to take a long-term view, but that's the lay of the land.","So what that indicates in December is, as it is in our industry, when there's even an abrupt change like that, it's not that everybody stops in their tracks because there has been so much. There are reasons these facilities are getting built. There are usually secular drivers that are behind them, and they follow through on their commitment. What comes into play are projects that are on the horizon.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","Okay, fair enough. So then essentially \u2013 and I want to read this carefully. You're essentially saying that your first half is much more difficult comparables due to the: A), FX environment; and B), the consternation that you're expecting in the first half surrounding the decline in oil prices. So what I think I hear you saying, without you having said it specifically, is that you are concerned about oil and gas bookings in the first half of the year.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's some that are on the project side. It's something we're definitely going to monitor on a big portion of our business. You're going to have your seasonality trends around maintenance, as for example in the United States they start repurposing some of the facilities for different types of gas during the course of the year, some of the brownfield opportunities. Keep in mind, refiners are starting to see an advantage right now on the downstream side because you have low oil. And if you think about Midwest refiners, they have an opportunity because of the limited transportation, and you can't export out of United States, to really make good profit on refined product at this point in time.","The other thing to consider, Scott, is there are projects that are still occurring in the Middle East and various parts of the world that are ongoing. And these are clean fuel requirements. For example, we talked about before; in certain parts of the Middle East, they supply into regions of the world that now require reduced sulfur content, so they have to get these facilities in place.","The message here is certainly short term, people can defer some spend. We saw that happen in times past. On the margin, some of these complex projects, like LNG is a fairly complex project. They may say look, we need to see how the various constituencies of oil are going to play out over a period of time. Let's reevaluate this. But the core processes, the core refinery, the core production where it makes sense and it's financially viable will continue. So the world's not going to shut off the oil and gas spigot. So hopefully that's helpful. But we have seen in the past and this is our commentary; everybody can pause a little bit short term. A quarter or two in our industry is okay. These are long-term projects.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","Okay, I guess what I was just trying to get out was that the full-year guidance did contemplate some type of change in the bidding environment and the booking environment for oil and gas, and I think I'm hearing you say that. So...","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","The guidance was based on what we knew in January. The variables are \u2013 and if you could tell me where currency is going to go, you and I could do very well on currency trades. But it is what we saw at that point in time. And if you think about it since January, if anything, oil has stabilized a little bit. But it certainly did consider that; it considered what we've experienced before over the short term. But it also considered a couple other things. We have a higher backlog coming into this year than we did last year. And that is intact and we know we're going to deliver that over the period of time. It also considered that we have a good program in place around driving our aftermarket growth.","It also considered factors that we have been working a lot on our sales organization to get additional penetration in the business. We have plans. We're not going to sit still and necessarily just wait and see what the market does. We're going to focus on what's in our control, and that is further penetration in the sales organization. We've been developing products in R&D and bringing them to market that have driven revenue growth. We've been growing our aftermarket business. We're looking at all channels to market in terms of how we can enhance them. So our guidance does include that because we have a lot of plans in place that we intend to execute this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Alan Matthew Fleming - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Guys, good morning. It's Alan Fleming in for Andy today. How are you?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Doing fine, thanks.","Alan Matthew Fleming - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Mark, maybe I can ask you a question more broadly on backlog. You guys did a nice job growing backlog in 2014 while I think, like you said, there was very little contribution from the large OE project-based business. And then I think you touched on December being the strongest month for you in the quarter. So maybe you can just talk about your confidence broadly in being able to grow overall backlog in 2015. And is that something that you think you can still achieve on the strength of the aftermarket and the run-rate business?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Where we have confidence is on what I just talked about, and that is to continue to penetrate on the aftermarket side. One thing to always keep in mind with aftermarket, although we haven't seen a lot of projects, is there is a small component that is tied to projects that are called commissioned spares. But in general and you look at our underlying aftermarket trends, and it's really around strategic initiatives that we have, the other aspects I mentioned earlier around really the work we're doing on our sales organization that just started a year ago in terms of how do we better penetrate markets; some of the initiatives we have that we've talked about in the chemical industry, in the power industry as well. So those aspects give me confidence.","What I will tell you what we're uncertain of is where some of these project opportunities are going to pan out over a period of time. Again, we haven't been highly reliant on them, but they are out there and we do plan our business around them. That's the area where as you look over the horizon, we need to get better visibility into, especially the ones that, as I talked about, are probably more costly. And the returns on investment may be a little bit longer in those. But there are still plenty that are right down in the middle of the alley. What I talked about in the Middle East, if you actually heard, in Saudi they talked about their commitment to investment in the Middle East.","And I think that's a message for everybody is I don't think anybody views that demand is going to be significantly destroyed over the next five to 10 years. As a matter of fact, I think the views are that demand is going to continue to grow, and supply is going to have to respond to it. So people think about that because you can't turn a project on a dime. If you decide you want to put it in place, you're not going to have it in place nine months from now or a year. These projects take many, many years.","Alan Matthew Fleming - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe I can follow up with a question about your mix because I looked at your slide deck. And I see that in recent years, the mix has trended something like 10% to 15% of the OE business, whereas traditionally I think it's been closer to 20%. So will that dramatically change in 2015 as you think about it? Will it actually maybe even \u2013 will that 10% to 15% go down a little bit as you wait for some of these larger projects to hit? Maybe you can just talk about the mix as you guys are expecting it to play out in 2015.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Forecasting mix wouldn't make any sense at all. That will depend on the markets, our presence, the aftermarket. When we look at a project, we think about the long-term opportunities around that project and our ability to deliver. I think the important thing for you to consider relative to a couple of years ago is we have a stronger operating platform that we think we can be very competitive on projects. So what we're going to do is be opportunistic. We don't want to govern any of the mix. We don't want to constrain any of the mix. What we want to do is be balanced and grow this business profitably. It wouldn't make any sense to forecast mix at all.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Nathan.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","If we could, just talk a little bit about the project work on the Gulf Coast that you're waiting for. You talked about the six ethylene projects that are currently under construction. They must be getting closer and closer to being bid out to I guess the pump guys first.","Can you talk about the expectation that you have on when those are going to be let out?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","So the question was what's the expectation on the Gulf Coast projects. I would say a couple things. There have been about 12 ethane projects. About six are currently under construction and we've been participating in those. And there are six more that are under various stages from feasibility to permitting, so those are yet to come from an OE standpoint.","And I would say the second thing is we've been particularly strong in the Gulf Coast and southern U.S. in our aftermarket business both on the oil and gas and chemicals, so that's come through very nicely for us. So I would say those are the two primary drivers in that region.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Could you then talk about, just for everyone's education a little bit, the cycle that progresses after those ethylene projects with the chemical plants that need to be built after that, and how long that cycle lasts for you guys?","Thomas L. Pajonas - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Ethane is one thing in the stream. It starts obviously with oil and natural gas, and then it's broken down into different constituents, of which ethane is one of those. And then it goes on to further processing. So I would say we have further opportunities for further processing on the chemical side of the business.","You've also seen us mention the fact that on the ethane that, for the most part, the Europeans use naphtha, which is their process that they have going into their chemical plants. We even see a potential for exporting that and them turning some of their plants over to U.S.-based ethane. So there is a continuing process for downstream further refinements of these chemicals.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And just one question on margins. You did comment that 35% gross margin was better than even your expectations for the year. Is that a level that you think is sustainable long term, taking out the noise I guess in the near-term from oil prices, something that you think can expand or something that you think is not sustainable?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","So if you look at the base operations of the business, what is primarily reflected in that gross line is the operational improvement that you've certainly seen in the business. And, Nathan, you've got to take mix aside because project work tends to have lower gross margins but ultimately benefit, so mix neutral. And you're right around the noise in the pricing environment and everything. But underlying that is an improvement in the operations. And the reason we think it's sustainable is because we still have some opportunity to improve it. I would tell you we're about 60% through our five-year journey, about three years into bringing this company to the level of performance that it needs to be and that we can see.","I also \u2013 I think we've talked about from time to time. We have some under-absorption in our factories that we're going to start to get at as well. You do that after you get the operations up and running and we're going to look at that going forward as well. So those are just two examples of things that we think we're going to focus on to drive overall margin improvement. And if you look at margins overall in the business, we got a little benefit from fixed cost leverage last year in the SG&A line. So as we drive our growth initiatives over the next couple of years, that should benefit for us.","Thomas L. Pajonas - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","One thing I would add to Mark on the absorption side, we've had a whole program on the lead center and the secondary manufacturing center, which is all about shifting our manufacturing base around the world to low-cost centers. So we now have in place, as you've seen previously, a strong Indian component in our Coimbatore facility. We have Santa Clara in Mexico as a core. We have India and we're beefing up \u2013 excuse me, we have China. We're beefing up China further with further capital spend, as Mike mentioned, on the valve side. So we've got a good low-cost sourcing platform. And now we're moving with LPO\/SPO strategy those products around the world, which should bode well for the future.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","So that's three examples of why we have confidence.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, guys, congratulations on a great quarter and sad to see Mike go.","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for all the help over the years.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Mike is a good executive and a good friend.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on market share and pricing dynamics because what we've been hearing this quarter from some of your competitors is their numbers have not been as good as yours. People are talking about pricing pressure, some talking about repricing of the MRO. Can you just describe what it is you are seeing in terms of your tier versus maybe people who are not as strong? What are you hearing about customers, about pricing, the business model? And what are you seeing in terms of market share?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think it's tough to calculate share because share gain and loss is determined on every project that you bid relative to a competitor, and we win some and we lose some. But as my comments earlier, what I will tell you is the industry always looks at its capacity over the long term and with the uncertainty that I've talked about over the horizon. So we see the activity levels over the short term, then they'll look at their capacity, their load over a period of time, and they can do a number of things. They'll either book their capacity to make sure that it is absorbed, or they may look at their capacity and say can we rationalize some of it, or they'll do both. So it's really going to depend on each company out there over that period of time. Obviously, we're going to look at both, so I think from that standpoint.","But also another thing to keep in mind around these projects is there are technical capabilities, delivery times, quality. All these things that we talk about still factor in. I will tell you for the most part customers value that a great deal. The one exception I've always pointed out is in the Middle East. A lot of it really does come down to price. But increasingly, they're getting focused on your ability to respond, respond with quality, and be able to support it over a period of time.","So what I don't want to suggest as you look at project opportunities is that all things are equal. I've always maintained we have good competitors out there with certainly good capabilities. But increasingly these are things that customers are looking at when they let out opportunities. Because a customer could save X% on the price of the equipment but if it's not on time, if it's not quality and you can't support it, it becomes far more expensive than your savings.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So let me ask you another question. I think it's no secret we're quite a bit more bearish on the end market than you guys are. But the question I have, given your exposure to energy, and that is your core business, if things weaken beyond what you guys expect, you do have obviously, given your performance in the previous downturn, I think your cash flows will remain quite robust. Would you consider investing more in energy to take advantage to bulk up your business during a downturn? I'm talking about M&A.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, if it makes sense for our shareholders, absolutely we would because nobody on this phone call or any other phone call believes energy is going away. And again, it's interesting how these conversations change so quickly. We were apologizing for not having enough exposure to upstream, and now all of a sudden nobody is interested in it. We are very interested in it because we think long term that's going to return a tremendous amount of value.","So your point is right. These are times, and let's go back to our statement. In our tone more than anything, what you hear in the confidence is the strength of our platform, what we've been able to accomplish, the performance level, and then we'll focus on what's within our control. And to your point, that is something that is certainly within our control. And it gives us the opportunity with a strong platform, a strong balance sheet, we're delivering, we're returning value to our shareholders. So we don't have to trade things off. We can play offense in this type of environment, and one of those components of offense is going to be the inorganic opportunities.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Mike, best wishes certainly. And can you maybe clarify the FX impact? I know you said the current rates would have a bigger than $0.20 headwind. Can you maybe just give us some order of magnitude of that impact if the current rates hold? And are you planning on any kind of offset to those incremental headwinds if they do materialize?","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll jump in real quick. Roughly, you can do the math. Last year's average currency versus the guidance range, it would be another $0.08 to $0.10 of impact, absent any change. But it's important to take a step back because there has been a lot of focus with multinationals around currency impact. And it is certainly out there, but there are other sides to that equation. If you think about it, for example, the acquisition we just made in SIHI, our German manufacturing now there has become much more competitive. These things will sort themselves out over time. So currency tends to have a short-term impact, and folks that are focused on the short term will certainly be aware of that. But long term what it does do is it balances out our manufacturing and certainly makes it more competitive.","I just want to remind everybody of that because I don't want everybody to get short-term focus. There's a lot of noise in that around the world. But it does give multinationals the opportunity to leverage some of their now lower cost capacity with very competitive products out in the global arena.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great, that's helpful. And then, Tom, I know you said it's early days on the SIHI integration. But I was wondering if you're seeing any opportunities to reduce that $0.25 dilution impact this year","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","No, this is Mark. We're still working through all that. A lot of that is purchase price accounting. But also there are some cost synergies we're going to bring to it as well. If you think about it, I think I mentioned on the call and it was early days, but they have some good capacity that we're actually going to be able to leverage. So when you looked at our acquisition multiple and our forward multiple, a lot of that was the opportunity to take some cost synergies. And there's a short-term cost to that but a strong long-term benefit.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great, thanks very much.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Chase A. Jacobson - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Chase A. Jacobson - William Blair & Co. LLC","I guess most of my questions have been asked here, but one clarification. On the revenue guidance for down 1% to up 3%, does that include the currency headwind?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","It includes the year-end rate, but as Mike mentioned, not any adjustments up or down since then during the course of the year. We have to pick a point in time because otherwise every day the guidance range could change with the volatility of the dollar index. So we picked a point in time towards the end of the year. But that range does include that. It does not include the impact of the CE revenue.","Chase A. Jacobson - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Tom, I think you mentioned that there's potential for further actions on the cost side. And you talked about a few things like low-cost sourcing and project management. I was wondering if you could give any more color there, and how quickly Flowserve could react if we were to enter a period where the CapEx environment from your major oil and gas and energy customers was going to remain lower for longer than just 2015.","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Obviously, we've been working on cost reduction plans for the last several years, which is one of the reasons why you see some of the margins the way they are. But relative to, for instance, low-cost souring, as I mentioned earlier, we do spend a lot of time looking at our manufacturing network of almost 70 plants in determining what is the most efficient way of manufacturing that product as we get a project in. And there's an expertise there and confidence that we continue to hone in and result in additional reductions. Mark mentioned absorption. We're looking at obviously that on a regular basis.","Our supply chain, we spent a lot of time looking at China and India and developing that in Eastern Bloc countries the supply chain, so we have a very aggressive supply chain program going on. Project management, a couple years ago we put that in full force effect to take a product\/manufacturing business and turn it into a very responsive customer-focused, project management driven organization. And we've made progress, but we have a lot to go on that in terms of schedule development and core execution. And so I feel very comfortable with where we are at there, but we have things to go there.","We started to shift from Six Sigma quality initiatives more to Lean initiatives in the business, and we're in the early stages of shifting to Lean. So as Mark indicated, there are a lot more levers to pull in the business. I mentioned just a few of those. But I can certainly go through different lists here. Notwithstanding, all the work that we've done on the sales side to drive alliances differently and re \u2013 I would say constitute our sales force to go after our chemical and industrial business differently.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Let me just give you an overall summary I think around short term. Our focus is we're going to continue to invest to grow this business because this is not the type of market that anybody wants to abandon by any stretch of the imagination. Now to your point, are there some high-return cost actions that we can take that we plan to do? Absolutely, I think we've started talking about that last summer that over time, we have the opportunity to reduce our under-absorption, to certainly reposition capacity and take advantage of that. If the market dictates, you accelerate those things. If the market is strong, maybe you smooth them out over a period of time because remember; at the end of the day, we still have to take care of our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, so I just have one. And by the way, Mike, you will be missed as well.","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","I appreciate all your help throughout the years. Your assumption on margins, can you provide us some basic assumptions in terms of material inflation or deflation? Are you expecting any tailwinds? Are they embedded in your margin assumptions?","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Do you mean going forward or...","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Obviously, we haven't given margin guidance beyond where we were. And keep in mind, we set out margin guidance three years ago, and we're basically a year ahead of schedule. And what that means, that's what gives us confidence to start going on to our other initiatives, driving growth, and some of the other things that I've talked about here.","But as you look forward, that's an aspect of it around material cost, keeping in mind, and we've talked about this before. We don't use a lot of base raw material and therefore take direct commodity risk. Typically, especially on the large lead-time projects, we're sourcing components, and those components are oftentimes priced contemporaneous with bidding the project. So we know the margins at that point in time. It's not to say were immune from commodity costs, certainly on some of our shorter cycle where we use bar stock on our seal faces, but you can adjust price fairly quickly. So what you've seen in our history is there isn't a tremendous amount of commodity exposure to our benefit or to our detriment. Typically, that's in our supply base.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group. Please go ahead.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. All the best, Mike, I appreciate your time.","Michael S. Taff - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bill.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","My question is based upon the $2 billion-plus franchise in the aftermarket. Mark, what's possibly the next step there? You're doing a fantastic job worldwide with your QRCs, servicing your end markets. Is it possible maybe you go into maybe an additional leverage there of that base to other maintenance functions, possibly pipeline integrity for the downstream? Is that like the next step here?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think we want to continue the steps. So if you look at the compound growth rate over the last couple of years, actually through the cycle, we want to continue those steps as well.","I think some of the investments we're looking at, if you think about it, is to continue to index and inventory our installed base. There is a lot of installed base out there that we need to understand where it is and take care of it. That's what our customers want. And actually, if you think about it, that's one of our big investments this year. I talked about we're going to continue to play offense and grow. That's one of the things we're looking at because if we know where it is, then we can call on it and take care of it. That's core.","The other things to look at in our business as well as is asset monitoring, some reliability. We've been starting to scratch the surface on that, continuing to drive more of that in our business. And some of the other \u2013 as our products get more complex, also keep in mind around that business with the SIHI acquisition, we're going to look for ways to better support those products with our aftermarket business.","So we've certainly been very pleased with the growth over the last couple of years, but we do have some initiatives where we're really trying to enhance the growth in that business, I think one of the best of which is going to be finding out where we can serve our customer with our own product that, if you think about Flowserve, our product has been around for 150 years. I'm not saying they all have a 150-year life, but there are quite a few of them that have been out there many, many years that we need to go and take care of.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Thank you, gentlemen. That's all I have.","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Building on the last one there, how would you judge your aftermarket capture rate versus a year ago? And are you gaining only on your installed base, or are you picking up share on other competitors' installed base, and what's the competitive dynamic there?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think we talked about this before. Our primary opportunity is really around the customer who is doing the work themselves, is bringing that in-house, having us do it. And with the advent of a lot of their maintenance folks starting to retire, that is going to present an opportunity; also being as responsive as what we call the local machine shops, the local repair shops. But it's not only just about service and repair. It's also about going in there and talking about performance. How do we increase and improve performance in the product?","I think the real opportunity as we look forward is what I commented on earlier, and that is getting a better handle of our installed base around the world. And we're going to have to invest in resources this year to do that because it takes people, it takes systems to do that. But we think there's going to be a high payoff on those investments in years to come.","So I'd say the existing installed base is still an opportunity. The strategies have been paying off around how we improve reliability in the systems. And our timeliness and responsiveness are going to be what present and have presented the opportunity around our customer maintenance, their capabilities in-house, and also responding to some of the local repair shops.","Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","I agree. That's great color, thank you. And then lastly from me, if we look at the top end of your organic guidance on the revenue side, 3%, what needs to happen to hit something like that? And what level of project activity maybe on a year-versus-year basis are you contemplating in that scenario?","Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Part of what we look in that is, again, we came in with, and I believe this was already currency adjusted to year-end rates, $150 million more backlog. So if you're just planning that on and nothing else were to occur, that would drive near to the top end of our growth.","So with that, there is some forecast around project opportunities similar to last year. A lot of our run-rate business is brownfield, but some of it does attach to new CapEx spend. So I'm not suggesting it's just as easy as just executing on our backlog, but the fact is that does give us a revenue tailwind. So what we're going to have to do underneath that is continue to drive our aftermarket business, penetrate additional areas on our run-rate business, and the projects that are out there that are going to continue to forward, execute on them, get them and execute on them.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you, Paulette, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in our call today to discuss Flowserve's third quarter 2017 financial results. Joining me this morning are Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Lee Eckert, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the line up for your questions. And as a reminder and as Paulette said, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available. Also note that our earnings materials do and this call will include non-GAAP measures. You can review the reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to our reported results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in both our press release and earnings presentation.","Finally, this call and our associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management as of November 2, 2017.

I'm very pleased to have Lee with us today after only being in the role for a few short weeks. I'd also like to thank Jay for his time as the interim CFO for the last eight months.","As we noted in yesterday's press release, Flowserve's third quarter adjusted earnings of $0.37 per share were largely in line with our expectations. While the results were essentially what we expected, they certainly are not where they should be or where they need to be. The performance of the IPD platform continues to be the largest issue for Flowserve with negative operating income in the quarter.","Our aftermarket franchise continued to demonstrate its resiliency by delivering year-over-year and sequential revenue growth with bookings essentially flat, despite the disruption and business delays in the Gulf Coast related to the Hurricane Harvey.","After six months in the role, I am pleased with the actions that we have taken. While there is significantly more work to do, we are making changes and I believe we are poised to accelerate the transformation that is needed here at Flowserve.","Here are a few of the areas where we are making progress. The new Flowserve leadership team is taking shape. In the last 90 days, both David Wilson and Lee Eckert joined the company. I'm very pleased with David's early progress in IPD and I have no doubt that he will lead the turnaround of this platform.","Lee became our CFO just a few weeks ago and he is already digging in and asking the right questions. I'm convinced that Lee will be a great partner for me and someone who can drive significant change and create value here at Flowserve.","In addition to David and Lee, we further built the team with new leadership in supply chain, IT, marketing and technology, and operational excellence, as well as new leaders at several of our site locations.","I have increased confidence in the IPD turnaround effort. While this isn't translating to our financials at this time, we are making solid operational improvements in the business. The issues in IPD are limited to a handful of locations. However, the turnaround effort in these facilities is large. The challenges in IPD are process-oriented in nature. They are fixable and we now have the right team in place that is aggressively taking the necessary actions to drive improvement.","David and I were recently in Europe and we saw firsthand the progress that's being made. I look forward to further improvements as we continue to execute our plans to restore IPD to being a solid contributor for Flowserve. We have also advanced our cost reduction efforts and we intend to complete the realignment programs that preceded me. Additionally, we have initiated new actions to reduce SG&A, to simplify and flatten the organization, and to create more flexibility in our cost structure.","Finally, we have begun the cultural change that is needed at Flowserve. We must ultimately change the mindset and culture within Flowserve to achieve our long-term goals. There are two fundamental changes that need to happen. Today, we are very much a collection of products and facilities, and we need to have an enterprise-wide mindset that puts the greater organization ahead of the local facilities. By doing this, we can leverage the scale and breadth of the enterprise and drive significant efficiencies and cost reduction.","The second is to create a culture that is accountable and results focused. To do this, we have developed a disciplined operating cadence, focused our teams on the most critical KPIs, and clearly communicated our expectations and the need for accountability across the organization. I've laid the foundation for this cultural change, but this will take time and significant reinforcement from our leadership team. The initial feedback we have received from our associates has been positive, and I'm confident these efforts will help our teams to move forward with greater clarity, ownership and support for our transformational journey.","All of our actions are intended to improve our operational performance, and much of this progress is part of the Flowserve 2.0 program that we are building. I'll talk to that in greater detail shortly, but first I'll comment on our bookings and our markets and then let Lee cover the detailed financials. In total, Flowserve delivered our third consecutive book-to-bill above 1 and maintained our solid backlog of 12.5% versus year end 2016.","While these metrics are positive, we had expectations for a higher level of bookings in Q3, which would have provided better revenue visibility into the fourth quarter in 2018. We need to continue to refine our focus to ensure that we are winning the work we deserve to win in this challenged marketplace. So looking at bookings on a constant-currency basis and excluding the impact of the Gestra divestiture, bookings were down approximately 8% in the quarter, driven almost exclusively by original equipment. While we continue to believe we are at or near the bottom of the cycle, we continue to operate in an environment where delays in project spending are normal. While we achieved several small project wins in the third quarter, no award was greater than $10 million.","We remain encouraged by the solid level of quoting activity that we're seeing on several medium to large project opportunities. However, these projects are increasingly looking like 2018 awards. So, we remain optimistic about growth in 2018, but we expect our bookings in the fourth quarter to look more like they did in the third quarter.","I'd like to provide some color on our end-markets, starting with oil and gas. Bookings declined approximately 12% year-over-year, driven primarily by EPD. We were pleased with IPDs increased approximately 17%, which included a small project award in North America.","FCD's oil and gas bookings were essentially flat for the quarter. While it's difficult to quantify aftermarket oil and gas bookings were negatively impacted in the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Harvey disruption and deferrals of maintenance, as facilities came back online. We continue to expect a slight uptick in repair activity related to the hurricane damage over the next two quarters.","However, given the freshwater nature of the flooding, many customers have chosen to flush their equipment and put it back in production without major overhaul or repair. Our chemical markets decreased approximately 8%, again driven primarily by EPD down approximately 14%, but also impacted by the disruption in the Gulf Coast.","While chemical demand continues to grow globally, utilization remains relatively low and is unlikely to drive a significant increase in capital investment in the short run. Opportunities are progressing in Asia, but these remain very competitive. The second wave of North American ethylene crackers continues to move forward at a deliberate pace, driven by the lower oil price environment.","Power bookings decreased approximately 8%, driven by EPD and IPD, while FCD's bookings were essentially flat. New build fossil opportunities remained very competitive and are primarily in Asia. Nuclear installation builds continue in China, but nuclear remains a depressed market for us as countries are investing further into natural gas facilities or other renewable sources of energy.","General industry bookings were essentially flat, with solid IPD mining orders and distributed bookings strength in FCD and IPD, largely offset by the decreased general industry activity within EPD. Regionally, we delivered bookings growth of nearly 8% in the Middle East and Africa, where we saw the largest project bookings of the quarter.","Europe, our strongest region in 2016, continues to be challenged with bookings down approximately 18% in the third quarter. In Latin America, bookings were down approximately 30%, as challenges continue, particularly in Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. Asia Pacific bookings declined approximately 8%, where 2016 third quarter bookings were the highest of that year. Finally, North American bookings were generally stable and down less than 1%.","Let me now turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Before I walk through our third quarter results, I would like to take a minute and let you know how pleased I am to be taking over as CFO at such an important time in Flowserve's history. As many of you know, I joined right after the third quarter ended, so I've only been here for a few weeks. I was attracted to this role because I recognized the current challenges, the need for change, and the significant opportunities available at Flowserve. I truly believe I can make a meaningful impact.","Scott made it clear to me during my recruitment at Flowserve, that Flowserve has terrific attributes to work with, including extremely talented and committed workforce, a strong brand with customers, and a global footprint and install base that is market leading. In addition, Scott highlighted the significant opportunities that exist to improve the operating model and our financial results.","After my short time here, my initial observations align with Scott's assessment, and I look forward to working closely with the leadership team as we embark on the Flowserve 2.0 journey to drive change and improvements, to deliver sustainable and profitable growth and value to all our stakeholders. With that background, let me turn to the numbers.","For the third quarter, reported and adjusted earnings per share were $0.36 and $0.37 respectively, in line with our expectations. On a reported basis, EPS included adjusted items such as gains on business divestitures and income from below-the-line currency, which were largely offset by $0.11 of realignment and $0.01 of PPA. As we indicated in the press release, both reported and adjusted EPS were negatively impacted by $0.04 for certain discrete accounts receivable and inventory reserves.","Third quarter revenue was slightly below our expectations, down 6.6%, but up 0.7% sequentially, which reflects a modest impact due to weather in the Gulf Coast region and less progress on our past-due backlog than we'd have liked. Aftermarket sales, by contrast, delivered solid growth of 6.4% and represented 50% of our total revenue for the quarter.","We continue to expect sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, supported by our solid backlog. Through the first nine months of 2017, our backlog benefited from a 1.07 book-to-bill ratio. We delivered and produced a 12.5% backlog increase since year-end 2016.","Looking now at gross margins, at 31.9%, our adjusted gross margin was down 90 basis points versus the prior year's third quarter. Loss of sales leverage and the related under-absorption, combined with increased variable incentive compensation, was only partially offset by cost savings and a 600 basis point mix shift towards higher-margin aftermarket.","On a reported basis, which included a reduction in year-over-year realignment charges, our gross margin increased 90 basis points to 30.3%. The company continues to pursue disciplined cost management initiatives. For the quarter, however, adjusted SG&A increased $4.4 million to $202.5 million, driven by a variable incentive compensation benefit recognized in the prior year.","Over the last few months, we have systemically reduced run rate costs, but clearly more work is needed as we transition the business to become more enterprise-focused, while leveraging global scale and best practices. Third quarter adjusted operating margin declined 300 basis points to 9.3%, due primarily to loss of leverage on revenue declines and a swing in incentive compensation. On a reported basis, operating margin increased 840 basis points to 8.4%, due primarily to the 2016 Venezuelan receivable reserve. Both reported and adjusted tax rates were slightly below our guidance at 28.7% and 27% following the second quarter's highly elevated levels.","Turning to cash, operating cash flow for the quarter and year-to-date were $26 million and $72 million, respectively, including working capital improvement of $35.9 million year-to-date. While we were pleased to achieve the year-over-year operating cash flow improvement, our working capital is still not where it needs to be and will be a major priority to improve.","Moving to the realignment program, cash costs were roughly $22 million this quarter, and we now expect a total of approximately $100 million for the full year. In the third quarter, we also returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends and invested $11 million in capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a cash balance over $500 million.","Turning now to our outlook, based on our results through the third quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, on a reported basis, we increased the full-year EPS target range to $1.05 to $1.15 per share and now with our adjusted EPS guidance to $1.30 to $1.40 per share.","We also tightened our full-year revenue expectations to a decline of 7% to 9% versus 2016, which now reflects minimal currency impact but roughly a 2% headwind as a result of business divestitures. We fully expect full-year realignment charges of approximately $100 million, including approximately $60 million through the third quarter.","Our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance excludes realigning expenses as well as below-the-line currency effects and the potential impact of other discrete items such as the gains on divestitures of our Gestra in both businesses, as well as a sizable Latin American asset impairment and inventory write-down we incurred in the second quarter.","We also expect 2017 net interest expense of about $60 million and a fourth quarter adjusted tax rate in the 30% to 31% range. In addition to anticipated realignment spending, other expected full-year cash usage includes approximately $100 million in dividends for our shareholders, capital expenditures in the $70 million to $80 million range, $60 million for scheduled debt repayments, and global pension contributions of around $25 million, mainly to cover our ongoing service costs as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.","That concludes my financial update. I'm excited about Flowserve's prospects ahead, and I'm confident that our strategy will deliver meaningful long-term growth. While my near-term priorities include getting fully up-to-speed on our business, working with the leadership team on Flowserve 2.0, identifying further cost reductions, improving working capital and cash flow and driving enterprise-wide accountability to enhance the predictability of our financial performance. I also look forward to being actively engaged with shareholders and the financial community in the future. Taken together, my number one priority is driving long-term value for our customers and our shareholders.","Let me now turn the call back to Scott for his closing remarks.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Great. Thanks, Lee. As some of you know I had the opportunity a few weeks ago to spend time with many of our shareholders and analysts in New York. During my presentation, I introduced a vision for Flowserve 2.0, which is really about transforming our operating model, while capitalizing on the foundation the company has built over the previous 20 years.","The current decentralized and entrepreneurial organization delivered well in the prior periods of cyclical growth, but as we've experienced recently, the model presents challenges and down cycles as it limits the ability to quickly scale the business and leverage the entire enterprise.","While we're still finalizing the work of 2.0, we expect the outcome will position Flowserve to better capitalize on its scale, operate as a single enterprise and provide more value to our key stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.","No one is satisfied with the current performance of Flowserve and my leadership team is fully committed to driving the necessary changes to transform Flowserve. I've spent the last six months visiting customers, plants, QRCs and with our associates to better understand the challenges at Flowserve.","We have a clear vision of where we want to be and we're developing the plan to get us there. I don't want to understate the magnitude of this change as we overhaul each of our functions and how we run the company.","This will require changes around our people, our processes and the systems and tools to conduct our work. This change will take time and will be a multi-year program. However, we are making decisions and taking action each and every quarter, and I fully expect that our efforts will materialize in our financials.","For those who work with us in New York or weren't able to listen to our presentation, the key components of this new model include, ongoing rationalization and optimization of our manufacturing footprint. The realignment program being executed over the last three years was necessary. But this is a competency that will be embedded in our annual strategic planning and will continue but as a normal part of our operations.","We will also develop consistent business practices across the enterprise in the form of a Flowserve operating system. Common global systems are essential in order to drive a centralized approach to how we deliver products and services to our customers.","Third, we will invest in product technology and innovation. Flowserve has always been a technology leader, and we need to reinforce this with new offerings and technically-differentiated solutions for our customers. We have already reorganized to improve our processes to deliver advanced technical solutions to our customers.","And finally, we fundamentally need to think about our markets and our customers differently. We will be more proactive in our approach with a disciplined review and understanding of where we should and should not compete. We will be market-led and our efforts will be fully aligned with a better customer service delivery model.","While change is clearly needed, make no mistake, Flowserve is a great business. And we are excited to make it even better. We have the foundation to start the change, including a customer-focused culture, employees who are committed and want to do the right thing, a well-respected brand, and a significant installed base built over decades.","But clearly, as a company, we had been operating sub-optimally for a period of time. We are intensely focused on driving the change to best utilize our solid foundation and achieve the full potential of Flowserve. With the leadership team now largely in place, we are deep into our strategic planning process, developing detailed initiatives to drive the changes to our operating model and the results envisioned by Flowserve 2.0.","Ultimately, we want to make it abundantly clear that Flowserve is the leader in the flow control industry and it drives substantial long-term value for our customers and shareholders. All of us at Flowserve look forward to delivering on that objective.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from. Citi Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Good morning, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Scott, how long do you think it's fair to expect improvement given new leadership in IPD? Clearly, the bookings have stabilized and even improved in the segment, so does that mean your delivery issues have improved enough, so the customers are now giving you more bookings and consequently we should see some evidence of improvement here in the business over the next few quarters?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I would just say, it's a journey with IPD and we've probably been a little overoptimistic in the last three quarters about how quickly we can turn this, but we're seeing positive signs, right?","I'll just start, you highlighted the bookings. And certainly, continuing to keep flat to slightly up bookings is a great sign given our longer lead times and our inability to deliver on time. So, I'm actually very pleased with that. And on lead times, they're now back into the order of magnitude where they need to be. And so, I think we have opportunities to continue to grow this. Now, on the operational side, I've talked before that this is limited to a handful of locations.","David and I were there two weeks ago and kind of went through the whole program and what we're doing and we've injected a lot of talent in these locations. And what I can see is that we're clearly making progress there and the problems have now shifted from the frontend of our manufacturing process now into the supply chain and the delivery. But it's very clear that we're working our way through this system. And so, I have a lot of confidence in David and the team in making this happen, and I've seen the progress firsthand. And the question just is, when does that translate into the financials? And I just think it's not a giant step change every quarter that we get substantial results. But we will start to see improvements and we should see those quarter-over-quarter, but I would say, it's a gradual progression and not major step changes.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Okay. That's helpful, Scott. And then you mentioned that in your prepared remarks that you're still optimistic about growth in 2018, but you also talked about bookings remaining muted for longer at least through the end of the year. Aftermarket has obviously been more stable. So, could you talk about your confidence level that you can grow constant currency and revenue in 2018. (24:39) talk about it, but any color you could give would be helpful.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'll just start with, bookings were not great in the third quarter and that's going to give us a little bit of challenge and headwinds on revenue into 2018. You said it but the aftermarket continues to \u2013 at that foundational level of $450 million a quarter and so that's exactly what we need. We talked about IPD bookings being stable. What we didn't get in the quarter were really the OE bookings on the EPD business. And it's a project business, as everybody knows and we didn't \u2013 we weren't able to bring in the project in this quarter and what we're seeing is a lot of those bigger ones that we're tracking are now slipping out into 2018.","So, it really just depends on the timing of those bookings. If we can get those early in the year then we can translate that into solid revenue in the back half of 2018. But that's what we're watching. And, I don't think \u2013 I think our teams were focused. We didn't lose anything major in the quarter and in fact year-to-date, EPD is essentially flat 2016 to 2017, but we really need to sharpen our focus and we want to start to grow that EPD bookings base. And so, we're going to be focused on what we should win and get the teams highly motivated to do that with incentive plans and making sure we have the proper reviews and the proper guidance to go out there.","But on the general market side, I think that we're seeing traction. We're just not seeing the projects get to FID within Q3 or even potentially into Q4.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Have you seen any improvement in the markets themselves as oil has improved here or not yet?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I think we're seeing stability. I'm not seeing improvement. Now the upstream oil and gas markets particularly in North America are doing quite well. But our product portfolio, we've just got a small offering in that space. And so in that space, we're seeing growth, but it's such a small percentage of our business that it's not moving the needle overall. But, no, I think traction with oil between $45 and $55 is something we need, and that's going to drive \u2013 ultimately drive bookings growth for Flowserve across most of our platforms.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Charlie.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Charlie.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Can you just elaborate a little bit about \u2013 on the commentary about as we look towards 2018, some additional restructuring? And what really you're doing to drive the SG&A expense down? And what extent can you do that given, kind of, the volume level that you're running at right now and probably when you run into at least the first part of 2018?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure, Charlie. So, SG&A is obviously a problem. We have been working at it. There's been actions historically and then since I've been here, we've taken actions as well. What I'm seeing now is we're getting to the point we keep taking cost out and I keep asking for more cost to come out. And it's just \u2013 it's becoming more challenging without through process change and potentially systems change. And so, I'm not going to say that we're not going to keep working on this, but we're not going to get the true leverage we need until we start to fundamentally change the way we do things.","And so that's part of this Flowserve 2.0 that we keep talking about. And I just \u2013 I don't know \u2013 I know we don't like the SG&A position today. What I don't know is how far we can get to without doing the structural and process change. And so, we're in the process of developing that now function-by-function and what are the actions and the changes that we need to make to ultimately get the SG&A reduction. But we're very focused on this. We're in the budget process now and we've got some pretty hard goals to try to attain. But we keep nibbling around the edges, and now, we've just got to focus on process change to get the bigger prize.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then kind of turning to the commentary on the large projects that are out there, can you \u2013 I mean, are those kind of $10 million to $25 million size, or are you looking kind of even larger than that from a target perspective?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","No. Sure. What I was meaning before, I was really trying to quantify it at over $10 million. And so, in the quarter, we booked \u2013 we had one project that was kind at the $9 million to $10 million range. We had nothing greater than $10 million. And when we look forward, anything \u2013 when I say large projects, I'll say it's probably over $10 million. We're not seeing a large volume that we expect to book in the fourth quarter, but we are building our project, our large project list into 2018. So I would expect awards in Q1 and Q2 of the large project nature.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right. And can you just go back to the working capital commentary? We had working capital targets put out there in the past on different iteration of restructuring for the past seven or 10 years. What's kind of the current thinking on where working capital ought to be and kind of maybe a timeframe to get there?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. This will be a good one for Lee, and then I'll jump in on the back of his.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for softball there.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Softball for Lee.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, listen. It's obvious that working capital is not where it needs to be when receivables are 86 DSO and inventory is turning 2.5 times. That's clearly not acceptable. When I was going through the interview process, so I made the insightful comment to Scott that his working capital is not where it needs to be, and he agreed. So, listen, it's going to take work like everything else. I think on the receivables side, we're providing, I would say, more of an enterprise view and looking at our receivables, collections and our processes across the portfolio.","For the fourth quarter, we've launched a process where, every week, I have a team coming in and discussing progress on past due and what we're doing, what we're trying to do to collect receivables that are about to be issued and driving transparency and systems around it.","Inventory, it goes back to Scott's remark. It's really a reflection of how the business is run. Scott's mentioned in the past, the business is operated like a bunch of stand-alone businesses and not an integrated enterprise. There's not an integrated, what we call, an SOP process.","And to get true inventory performance, to shift it to your classic 10 turns, for example, we've got to reengineer how we do our forecasting, how we do our buying, what the safety stock levels look like across the enterprise, and drive intense focus around it. Right now, inventory turns are not necessarily in the playbook, and that's something we need to build across the enterprise. So I suspect we will probably make quicker improvement on receivables. Inventory, it's going to take more of a process change.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. But, Charlie, there's no doubt about. There's a couple hundred million dollar prize here that we just got to start attacking. And we're going to start with receivables. It's a hard drive because it's not just customers not paying us, it's things that that we did where our documentation wasn't straight, or we didn't deliver the right quality program to them or something. So we're working now to go through all of those issues and start to collect on a lot of receivables that are outstanding. And so, that's what Lee's leading. He's got a weekly call and it's going to be a lot of hard work, but it's leadership led, and we'll grind through that and make progress.","On the inventory side, there are some quick wins there with just the discipline and the focus, and we're tracking the right metrics there. But it's also going to require a lot of training and a lot of process change to really get the benefits that we want and get the inventory turns in a ballpark that make a lot more sense than they do today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Nathan.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Nathan.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Just like to follow up on the working capital question there. It's clearly been out of hand for a number of years at Flowserve. If you go back about a decade, you had about 20% of sales in working capital. You're up to about 40% now. Is there something structural that would stop you getting back to that 20% level over time, because that's more of a prize than the $200 million that you were talking about there.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Look, Nathan, it's going to be a journey, but I think 20% of working capital for the nature of this business is a good starting target. So I don't see any reason why we shouldn't have the ambition to get there. And I said a couple hundred million, not two.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. A couple must not be $200 million. Another question \u2013 another comment that you made in your opening remarks was focus on the most important KPIs. Can you maybe give us a little more details around the top three, four, five KPIs that you guys are focused on internally?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Absolutely. And so, I mean, we've got a handful of operating KPIs and then the financial ones. I'll touch on financials; if you want me to go to the operating one, we can. But one of the big things that we started was just revenue predictability. And so, it sounds a little basic, but really setting the cadence that says, this is the revenue that we expect at the beginning of the quarter, and this is how we're going to achieve it month-over-month, is something now that we are locking in and making sure that we obtain that.","And then, going through the P&L, revenue is the number one thing and then we're looking at the controllable spend by each of the platforms. So the amount of cost that they control at the platform level plus the functional level. And then we've added in the accounts receivable and the inventory position, which ultimately gets us to the cash flow. And so, really it's around revenue predictability. And then it's the costs that they can control. And then the two that are driving cash flow. And that's the ones that we're most focused on. We've got a secondary group and a longer list as well, but those are the ones that we're spending a lot of time on right now.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And on the operational side?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. On the operational side, it starts with safety for me. So we've got a big safety focus and we track safety in a number of different ways, but we spend a lot of time talking about the safety metrics. And now, from that, we look at our \u2013 how do we perform with our customers, so it's our on-time delivery and the past-due backlog. And we're getting more sophisticated in that past-due backlog to say how late are we and how aged are we and how do we work through that. And then we've got nice quality metrics that we're looking at to make sure that we deliver the right products to our customers, and when they get there, they're actually working.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Hi, good morning.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey. Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wanted to talk a little bit more detail on this EPD bookings number, which if the aftermarket was kind of flattish for the company would suggest that the OE bookings in the EPD were down closer to 20%, 15% to 20% call it. I guess my question here is that, we've been seeing the bookings in this business down pretty big for more than two years. And I guess at this point, I would have thought that there would have been sort of an in-quarter plan B developed by sales. And certainly that has not been the case because these bookings decelerated again this quarter.","So, it would seem to me that, that's got to be a front-and-center focus for you. It's your biggest business with the worst bookings. So maybe talk a little bit about, Scott, why this number was as bad as it was and kind of what you're doing about that today?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Sure. No, I mean we said before, we had one booking that was around the $10 million mark and that was it in that business. And so, that's not sustainable and it's not where we need to be, but it is a project business. And so we track projects. We didn't lose any major ones in the quarter that we were targeting to win. What we're seeing is that, they're just being delayed and moved out into 2018. But I would agree, right. This is now something that we're watching very closely. I'm having a lot of discussion with the leadership on both the sales side and the platform side.","And we've got \u2013 not only do we need to win the focus projects and the large ones, but there's a big base business here, right? So, this would be kind of the less than $5 million awards, and we make pretty good margin on the smaller bookings and smaller numbers there.","And so, a lot of the focus and attention and discussion with me has been how do we make sure that we are winning our entitlement on that base business. And so, these would be replacement pubs, brownfield expansions, and things like that, that we are seeing continuous spend from our customers.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Scott, the one thing I would probably go ahead and add to that is, yes, the quarter EPD, OE bookings was certainly soft. But if you looked at it on a year-to-date basis, EPD OE bookings are actually up 1% constant currency.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, I do understand that, Jay. I guess that we've seen this before and my point again was that I guess, during the quarter, I would have hoped that by now, there would have been sort of a plan B to this. And I guess more specifically, customer acquisition, new market penetration, pulling different levers just to make sure that we don't \u2013 because now, this affects one to two quarters out. So, now then you have problem here and now you have a problem two quarters from now.","And I guess I just thought that your sales guys having seen these push-outs before would have, at this point, had developed a sort of a, as I say, again a plan B to kind of mitigate some of that. It looks like EPD's journey into distribution is actually working.","I guess I don't fully understand why even though it's a project business why we can't bust out our addressable markets there? And makes me wonder if you have enough intelligence to go after the \u2013 identify the projects so you can go after them in the first place?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. No. I agree with you. It's a concern and it's a large focus for us going forward.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Well, can we maybe just turn to a quick one? The flow control margins, kind of maybe tell us what happened there this quarter?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","In terms \u2013 I mean, so we came up slightly from where we were in Q2. So, Q2 had a little bit of an unfavorable mix and then I'd say in Q3, we started to rebound with a better mix of products. So, primarily, our higher margin, some nuclear shipments and some other large projects that we had juicy margins on it came through in the third quarter. But I think it's just as simple as mix and you just \u2013 I would just blend Q2 with Q3 is probably the best way to look at it.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, I guess, what I'm saying is that it was essentially flat in the first quarter, down 200 basis points in the second quarter and down more than that in the third quarter, flow control.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Year-over-year, that's true and mix would be probably the biggest explanation.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, you're saying mix is negative because I thought I just heard Scott say maybe it was improving.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'm sorry. I was talking about sequentially from Q2 to Q3.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. It's improved sequentially but year-over-year predominantly mix.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, it's been nice to see the aftermarket be pretty steady here for a while. What do you think it's going to take to get that breakout to a higher level? That requires the increase in sales of OE or can it be some other fundamentals getting that to go better or something strategic.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. Certainly, the more installed base that we have out there, the faster our aftermarket business is going to grow. In addition to that, we just need operators to free the first strings on their turnarounds and in some of their investment in refurbishing the facilities. And so, we're optimistic that that happens at some sort of time. We've got a little better visibility to turnarounds into the fourth quarter and into 2018 than maybe we've had in the past.","But at this point, we don't have anything that shows that we're going to drive substantial growth in this business and then in the next two or three quarters. But I just think at some point, right, we had pent-up and reduced spending on the maintenance side and at some point that catches up to folks.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as it relates to technology, when do you think we could start to see the initial impact of your focus on this and what do you envision for the role of digitalization and data in your offerings?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. So technology is important to me and we really want to keep the Flowserve name as the technology leader in this space. And so, we've reorganized the marketing and technology group and we're putting a lot of focus and effort on really understanding what markets we should play in, where do we want to invest in our technology, and then what's that product that best serves in that attractive market that we want to pursue.","So we've just launched this organization in August. What I will say is on the valve side, we've had some real nice technology moving through the system previously and we're actually starting go-to-market strategies on two to three different product lines in 2018. So we should see some early results there as we move forward.","And then on the digital side, we do have an offering around condition-based monitoring in Internet of Things. And we feel pretty good about what we're presenting to the market. But it's \u2013 right now, we're in the concept and the prototype phase. And so, we've got a couple of systems now working with some preferred customers, and we need to get to the results of that prototype testing before we're ready to really talk big about what our ambition is or what we're trying to do.","But it is something that we feel is important in this space. At the end of the day, in major refining and petrochemical installations, reliability and uptime is really what they are after that drives significant economic advantage for our customers.","And so, if we can deliver a system that is providing better reliability, we think we've got something that really differentiates Flowserve. And so, it's a big focus for us. We have some pretty slick technology there. We're in the prototype phasing, and I'd just say more to come on what we're going to do in that space.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Andy.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Good morning.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. I'm just going to go back to this EPD OE orders. And the question I have, historically, when I spoke to you guys, the issue was EPD and the value is that you have very complex value streams. And I think the reluctance to really restructure this business had to do with the fact that it's just hard, right? It's very complex, and that's where a lot of value the Flowserve has comes from this complexity.","And I guess the question I have historically, if I looked at Emerson Process orders, if I looked at SPX Flow orders, if I use the Sulzer orders, you guys were very, very tightly correlated. And the question I have, as you have restructured EPD, do you have a sense that the business is functional? Did you break something? Look, if this is a timing issue, cycle is turning, that's not a problem. But I'm just wondering as you look at the business, is something broken.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. I think that's a fair and a good question. Where we are in the realignment on EPD is still in the very early phases. And so I'm not sure the realignment has broken anything. But what I would say is the bookings are where we want them to be and we needed very much, provided the attention and focus on how to start to drive bookings into this business. It's critically important to us.","And so we're working through that with the head of sales and the head of the platforms and to making sure that we've got the right products at the right cost where when these opportunities present themselves that we're winning this business. And then as we're working through the EPD realignment, we've got to make sure that what happened on the IPD side does not happen in EPD.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. And then just a follow-up question on sort of on KPIs. You sort of mentioned ability to forecast revenues is something you're striving for. How long do you think \u2013 if you look at the systems, how long do you think it will take you guys to put in the systems in place that you feel comfortable versus the previous management where you do have a good visibility on revenues? Thank you.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. So, we've already \u2013 I mean, I implemented the changes on the operating rhythm and the KPIs in my first month. And so we are seeing progress in our ability to be more predictive about our financial results, and so we're making progress on that.","And that's \u2013 while it'd be great to have automated systems and everything else, I mean, really it's around knowing your business, understanding what you can do, and then putting realistic expectations on what our revenue and delivery should be. So, that's improving and I expect that to continue to improve as we go forward.","Now, we are looking at more advanced systems here, and I'll hold that discussion now. But we do have a fragmentation or a highly variable ERP system landscape. And the idea would be to get to something that's much more harmonious and allows us to manage the business much more consistently than we can today.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No and I appreciate, guys, that you've been inherited a lot of it into tough cycle. Good luck.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Picariello from KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","James A.

Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","...just on a regional basis for Europe, I mean, it's almost 25% of revenue. You guys call out that bookings growth last year is helping to drive some nice revenue growth this year. Orders down 18% in the third quarter, just wondering what the year-to-date trend has been on orders in Europe, and is there an air pocket position for next year now? Thanks.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Jay, do you want to \u2013 do you have that number, the trend there for the year?","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","I don't have year-to-date on Europe. Mike, do you?","Mike Mullin - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. It was up in the first quarter a few percent, down about 20% in the second.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So, we've been up in the first quarter, down in the second. And year-to-date, we're going to be down \u2013 probably up 5% from where we were last year. So, Europe is a challenge. I mean, so moving projects and business forward in Europe has been a struggle. In addition to that, a lot of the IPD concerns have been in Europe, and we think by fixing that, we've got more opportunity to drive European bookings.","James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. Did you quantify the impact that Hurricane Harvey might have had in the quarter or maybe on bookings, particularly? It sounds like EPD's aftermarket orders might have suffered a bit from the storm. Thanks.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. No. I haven't talked a lot about Hurricane Harvey and we certainly didn't quantify it. What I'd just say, specifically it's very difficult to quantify what we got or didn't get from the hurricane, but I'll just give you \u2013 I can put it into context for us, though.","So we have nine facilities in the Gulf Coast that were all impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Those facilities themselves were offline on average about a week. When we look at our customer base, there's over 400 installations in the Gulf Coast. About 30 of those were certainly impacted with 15 being severely impacted. And then what we saw was customer spending in those locations essentially stopped for about two to three weeks.","And so it absolutely was disruptive to us. What I would say is it wasn't anything material for our aftermarket business or in our new business. But there were delays in spending both on the OE side and the aftermarket. And so, now what we're really struggling with is \u2013 or trying to figure out is what's the upside from that? Most of the damage though was freshwater, which caused electrical damage and so we're getting some work with our actuation and positioners on the valve side. But it wasn't necessarily the pump or the valves themselves. And so the upside is less than what we were originally anticipating. But we will get an uplift on the aftermarket business here in Q4 and potentially into Q1.","James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate that color. Are the actuators lower mix? Was that maybe the cause of lower margins in FCD despite modest core growth?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","No. That wouldn't have changed the entire mix there.","James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Lu - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, everyone. This is David Lu on for Deane.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, David.","David Lu - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey there. Last quarter, you cited a target for reaching high-single-digit margins at IPD within the next 12 months, so roughly 2018. Is that still the goal today, and what kind of exit rate do you now expect at the end of this year for IPD?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","David, I don't see that substantially changing, right? And so, we've got a lot of work to do to get there. But I think the exit rate needs to be high-single digits for IPD. And ultimately, that business has to be a teens business. And so, we're working hard to get there as fast as we can, but I think exiting 2018 at a high-single digit is something that should be achievable for us.","David Lu - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And at your meeting in September, you isolated the challenges in IPD to three key underperforming facilities. Can you provide us an update on that? Are those still kind of the main focus for the turnaround? How much progress have you made on those facilities? And were any of these inventory write-downs this quarter related to IPD specifically?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","No, sure. It's still three. It hasn't expanded beyond the three. Like I said in my prepared remarks, both David Wilson and I were there two weeks ago and visited all of these locations. And so, I feel good that we're making the operational progress in those facilities. It just hasn't translated to the financial results. And then, yes, the inventory write-down was associated with one of those three facilities.","David Lu - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Good morning, John.","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I guess a modeling question here for next year. Is $30 million still the right number for the restructuring drop-through savings to be thinking about?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Roughly, that would be right, John.","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, as we think about this part of the cycle, clearly, we're not seeing it in your orders. But as other people alluded to, we are hearing that we're kind of coming off the bottom and seeing a bit of an inflection from your \u2013 in terms of the market. What is kind of your normal incremental experience that you've seen as we try to think about calibrating going forward? So I guess the drop-through on kind of the organic ex the restructuring; how do you think about incrementals at this point in the cycle?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","So you're saying the margin expansion potential as we grow revenue?","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Exactly.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. We have so many issues right now. I'm trying to figure out \u2013 fight those fires and try to get back to something that is a little bit more normal and we can think about what a normal margin expansion would be as we go forward. But I mean certainly, as we grow our business, right, we should be able to leverage our cost structure and leverage all the good things that we're doing to expand margin. And so I'm not ready to say what's normal. Right now, what I want to do is stop the bleeding in IPD and fix a couple major issues that are a drag on the financials. And then, as we get into a little bit more stability, then I'm happy to talk about kind of what we think our entitlement is there.","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Thanks. This is Mike DeLalio on for Rob.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Okay. Hi, Mike.","Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Hey. So, sales in IPD were down by only $14 million, but the margin was a lot weaker. Can you unpack what drove that a little more specifically?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","You're talking year-over-year, Mike?","Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Yes.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So, there's a long list of challenges in IPD. And really, we started to see that there at the end of Q4 and it's come to roost here in 2017. And so, these are our three facilities that, quite frankly, are not contributing at all, and we're working through those operational challenges, and ultimately we'll start to see financial improvement there that drive our results.","And so, in the third quarter we were negative, but we've essentially been at the same level now in Q1 and Q2 and into Q3, which is a breakeven or a flat business, which is not acceptable, and we've got to fix these three locations to start to move back into the territory that we were in in 2016.","Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Okay. And can you disclose the booked gross margins on the order you got this quarter in IPD versus a year ago?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","No, we typically don't give that out, Mike.","Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Can you say if they were up or down?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Well, I think we're seeing good bookings in there. And generally we haven't seen a massive degradation in our ability to get price on IPD. And so, we're \u2013 I would say, no major change over the last couple of quarters in terms of what we're doing there.","And in fact there's parts of IPD that we're attempting to get price increases and we're seeing a little bit of a traction on a move that we made a couple of months ago.","Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, how are you.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Good.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Want to start \u2013 I know bookings came in lighter than you'd expect, but I think I heard a couple of times that, overall, this was \u2013 the quarter came in kind of in line with expectations. And I just want to reconcile that with a slight cut in the guide and I just want to \u2013 how susceptible are we to, like, head fake? Do you feel comfortable now six months in that you have your hands around this for the most part and then there's not going to be another surprise around the corner that maybe it takes time to get materially better from here, but that you've identified all the major issues and that you kind of have things ring-fenced here?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Well, I'll just say it's been a wild six months and so, I'm not going to say I have my hands around everything. I've been operating the company for two quarters now. But I am pleased with \u2013 we did deliver Q3 largely in line with what we expected with the exceptions on the bookings side.","So, I feel better in our confidence to be predictive on what our revenues are going to be and we're controlling our costs in the fashion that makes sense. The guide down for the full year which is essentially the fourth quarter was really around the IPD turnaround. And I'd say, a quarter ago, we were probably too optimistic on what that looked like and that would have gotten us to the high range of the guide down, and we pulled it down into something that we think is more realistic given where IPD is in this quarter.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. I know you're not going to throw any employees kind of under the bus or anything, but when you look across your organization and there are certainly market forces that work to get you to where you are, but some of it has to be people on onsite dropping the ball or not having, I don't know, there's going to be some element of not having enough pride in the work to an extent, and how much kind of reshuffling of people or flow of new talent into the organization have you seen since you've been around?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","No. It's been substantial, right? And I have this in New York. I mean my leadership team and the positions that are on our staff today, it's 60% different than what it was a year ago. So, we're definitely taking action and making changes with people. And in my opening remarks, we talked about even at the local facilities we've begun to change out some folks that we think needed to move on and bring folks in that share our common vision and purpose to moving forward.","So, I \u2013 for me, to start any change, we've got to have the right leadership and the right people that are on board and are willing to do the heavy lifting of doing that change, and we haven't been afraid to put the right people in the right places.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Maybe if I could have one more on just the general industrial comment of flat bookings there, I guess that surprised me a little bit. We're seeing \u2013 most of the companies kind of seeing an acceleration in that market. So, anything, do you feel like you're missing out on something there or is it just \u2013 how would you kind of put that into context?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I would say just given the operational issues that we've had, I'm actually pleasantly surprised that we've been able to hold our own on the industrial bookings. So, this is IPD specifically. And so, what I think is as we start to make improvements, we've got our lead times now into a more respectable level of as we earn back the trust and confidence from our customers that we can deliver, I do expect to grow IPD bookings.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey. Good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Just on some of the bookings commentary that I think you've made earlier in the call about maybe fourth quarter looking a little bit closer to 2Q. Maybe this is a little nuanced. (1:00:12) but if I look at that framework for EPD seems like you would end the year kind of flattish, up a little bit. Orders last year were down 11%, 12% probably where you're going to end up down revenue this year. Is that an unfair way to start thinking about 2018? I mean, I guess aftermarket will be shorter cycle, but is that just kind of limit the amount of growth that you can get without the big aftermarket (1:00:41)?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Josh, there's a lot of feedback on the line here. I didn't quite get the heart of the question there.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Sorry. The question was if 4Q bookings look like 2Q, which I think you mentioned earlier on the call (1:00:57).","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Just for a clarification on that. We're saying that the fourth quarter bookings will look more like the third quarter bookings.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","More like the third quarter, okay.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yes.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","So, if EPD is down this year roughly what bookings were down in 2016? Is that a conceptual way to think about 2018 or does aftermarket really start to accelerate year-on-year?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, again, Josh, there's a lot of feedback on your line. I'll try to answer your question though. So, with the backlog in EPD, that's probably our biggest concern for revenue growth. And so, we're watching that carefully but given the bookings in the third quarter, it'll be a headwind for 2018 revenue growth. And to offset that could potentially be an uptick in our aftermarket business and additionally, if we can book some projects early in the year, we'll be able to get that revenue in the back half of 2018.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Roueche, you may begin.","Jay Roueche","Thank you, Operator and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today to discuss Flowserve Corporation's first quarter 2015 financial results. Joining me on the call this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Pajonas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Malcolm Platt, our Interim Chief Financial Officer.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the call to your questions and instructions will be given at that time. While I expect most of you have reviewed our earnings materials by now, I will note that we filed our form 10-Q, issued a press release and prepared an earnings presentation and all of these materials are available on our website at Flowserve.com in the investor relations section.","Before I turn the call over to Mark, let me cover some housekeeping items. As a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available later today. Please also be aware that this call and our associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements which are based upon forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of April 30, 2015. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties including many that are beyond the company's control and except to the extent required by applicable law, Flowserve undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements.","We encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's press release, slide presentation and our form 10-Q as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information. Additionally, our earnings materials do and this call will include non-GAAP measures. Among the non-GAAP figures cited include our adjusted earnings per share metric which excludes the impact of our recent SIHI acquisition, below the line currency effects, the Venezuelan currency remeasurement impact as well as certain other specific items.","We have reconciled our adjusted EPS as well as other adjusted metrics to our reported results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in both our press release and in our earnings presentation. We encourage you to review those materials.","I will also note that our revised guidance metrics which reflect quarter end FX rates and current business conditions, are also on an adjusted basis and include numerous assumptions based on information available to management as of April 30, 2015. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Mark Blinn","Thank you, Jay and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2015 results were challenged by a broad based capital spending decline originating in the oil and gas markets as well as currency headwinds caused by a stronger dollar. Going into the quarter, we anticipated some customer hesitancy and reduced activity due to oil price volatility but did not foresee the full extent of the reaction both in our downstream and midstream markets as well as in other served industries.","We also saw restrained spending in our customers' repair and maintenance budgets occur in the quarter. This market slowdown was further compounded by economic and geopolitical conditions in Latin America and the Middle East and by strikes at several U.S. refineries. Specifically in March, we did not experience the typical uptick in activity that we usually see towards quarter end.","Reflecting these challenges our first quarter bookings, excluding SIHI, were down roughly 13% on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned, the strengthening U.S. dollar against most world currencies also provided a significant headwind in the quarter as roughly two-thirds of our revenue is generated outside the United States. Looking out to the rest of the year, we expect maintenance and repair work to begin to improve from first quarter levels considering this activity cannot be delayed indefinitely.","New project opportunities are expected to be very price competitive with fewer projects being released for bid and customers closely monitoring all project costs. We believe our differentiated products and services will prove beneficial in this new bidding environment and we plan to remain thoughtful and disciplined. I should also note that while competition for new awards remains high, we have not had any material discussions about repricing our existing $2.7 billion backlog.","Considering the current market environment and quarter end FX rates, we have updated our 2015 guidance as indicated in our press release and earnings presentation. Malcolm will provide additional details on this shortly.","While current market conditions are challenging, I take confidence from the fact that we have successfully navigated similar cycles in the recent past. More importantly, Flowserve's operating platform is performing better than ever. In fact, even in the face of tough market conditions, our first quarter's adjusted gross margin was flat with last year and better than the sequential quarter.","We also carefully managed our SG&A spend which declined over $20 million from last year excluding the impact of the first quarter's adjustments and last year's divestiture. This type of discipline that we have instilled in the organization over the last few years provides us the flexibility to successfully operate in current market conditions.","We're approaching every new award opportunity using a balanced approach considering price, low cost sourcing options, supply chain opportunities, lead time reductions and additional value add features such as our LifeCycle Advantage strategy.","Additionally, Flowserve's effort to expand its geographic and end market exposures over the last few years allows us to drive business towards areas with the greatest market and profit opportunity. Our solid operational foundation also enables us to take advantage of market conditions that position Flowserve to be an even stronger flow control company, maintain solid margins and enhance our competitive position going forward.","To better align costs and improve long term efficiency we're targeting $100 million in investment to reduce high cost capacities and workforce levels that generates cost reductions of over $70 million in annual run-rate savings. This effort will include a reduction of approximately 5% of our global workforce.","We believe our cost savings initiatives will not impact Flowserve's ability to provide best-in-class customer service or limit our ability to capture new business opportunities. And the cost savings will better position us to achieve our long term goal of 18% SG&A expense as a percent of revenue.","Accelerating already existing manufacturing optimization combined with plans to further drive supply chain savings will further improve our long term competitive position. Manufacturing optimization is one of our core strategies and not a market reaction as these plans have been in development for quite some time.","As we have previously highlighted, we have made significant investments over the last several years developing a low cost manufacturing footprint, primarily in Asia and Latin America. These facilities are now preparing to take over for some of our higher cost facilities and we're using this time to accelerate our plans.","In addition to our cost saving initiatives, we're continuing to execute our growth strategies including targeting select end markets where we see opportunity such as Asia and power, chemical and aftermarket just to name a few examples. Likewise, we're enhancing our go to market approach with our customers through aligned selling, expanded distribution sales and product bundling to better leverage our comprehensive flow control portfolio.","Lastly, I will mention our R&D efforts and new product development program. We invest over $40 million annually in these efforts and they are generating solid returns. As our products and our customers' needs get more complex, Flowserve continues to distinguish itself from others by remaining an innovator and solution provider for the industry.","Flowserve is unique in having the most comprehensive suite of flow control products and services across our industry including our diversified business model and global network of quick response centers. Despite this quarter's volatility, we believe our portfolio remains advantaged over time as we pursue our long term growth strategies and deliver on our customers' needs across the large and attractive end markets we serve.","Similarly, we continue to apply equal rigor to our capital allocation policies and priorities. Returning capital to our shareholders continues to be a high priority with over $100 million returned in the first quarter through dividends and share repurchases.","Since we announced our distribution policy in late 2011, we have returned almost $2 billion to our shareholders including share repurchases of almost 35 million shares at an average price below $48. At current prices, we continue to view Flowserve stock as an attractive investment and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase shares.","Consistent with our strategy, we will also continue to evaluate potential inorganic opportunities leveraging our successful track record while maintaining our disciplined approach. I am truly excited about our new prospects with SIHI and its products. As an update, the business is performing in line with expectations, Integration is progressing well and we have identified additional revenue and cost opportunities beyond our initial expectations.","We will evaluate any future inorganic opportunities against our disciplined standards and shareholder focus, adhering to established hurdles and evaluating potential acquisitions against further organic investment opportunities and additional returns of capital to our shareholders.","Finally, I want to mention how pleased I am with some of the recent additions to our team who will help us drive some of the initiatives we have discussed today. We're attracting outstanding industry talent to the Flowserve brand. We recently brought on experienced seasoned leaders for marketing, distribution and manufacturing optimization.","Additionally, I want to highlight the recent announcement of our new Chief Financial Officer. Karyn Ovelmen is a talented professional bringing solid financial leadership and strong operational orientation and experience in many of our customers' industries such as refining, chemical and plastics. I know you will look forward to hearing from her in the near future as we welcome her to the Flowserve team starting June 1. Together, these new leaders will add tremendous value in helping drive our strategic and operational improvements forward to produce growth.","To wrap up my prepared remarks, we recognize the current state of the markets but we have successfully weathered through market cycles before and we have specific action plans well underway to position Flowserve for success in a challenging environment. We will be using this cycle as an opportunity to make Flowserve even stronger for the future. I have confidence in the strength of our business model, our strategy and most importantly, our people who are focused on delivering meaningful value for our shareholders and customers. Let me now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Pajonas","Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, we're continuing to drive our long term strategic initiatives while at the same time being responsive to our current market conditions. As such, we're accelerating some of our longer term initiatives as we rebalance priorities.","In this volatile market period, our strong operating platform, our diversified product and asset base that serves industrial infrastructure and our after-market capabilities, developed through our localization efforts, will help us emerge as a stronger company to better serve our client base. The Flowserve business model has led to strong results and we continue to believe we have the right strategy in place for the long term.","To put the 2015 quarter performance in perspective, we began the year coming off a very strong Q4 2014 performance that saw increases in virtually all our industrial end markets and significant regional growth in North America, the Middle East and Latin America. In addition, our aftermarket bookings at over $550 million were at record levels. This performance occurred despite a quarter where the oil price was in rapid decline.","As we progress through Q1, in addition to a volatile oil market and currency challenges, there were a multitude of other factors that emerged late in the quarter. We increasingly saw larger project work not materializing, increased macro uncertainty in China emerging, Latin America continuing to experience issues and a more uncertain Middle East environment.","Q1 bookings on a constant currency basis, finished down across all of our end industries and was down in all regions, with the exception of Middle East and Africa which was up 2.7%. Uncertainty in upstream market increased and resulted in a general pause that also carried over in our mid and downstream oil and gas markets, as well as other served industries, as customers took time to assess their plants.","The pricing environment was characterized by fewer project opportunities, more customer initiated cost reduction pressures and cost pressures being driven deeper into the value chain. For instance, we saw over $150 million of project work originally expected for release to our industry shift from the first quarter to later in the year. We also saw about $50 million of our ready to ship projects deferred by our customers to a later date as they were slow to accept product.","We do see signs of some activity ahead as oil has stabilized, albeit at a lower level, but recognize the market will be competitive and not all industries will move in sync. Customers will remain deliberate and driving value for them will be increasingly important. We have the capability to drive their short-term and long term value.","The strong margin progression over the last four years demonstrates the success of our commitment to operational excellence. Our operating performance remains at a high level which given adjusted gross margin of 35.3% for the quarter is flat with the prior year Q1 and up sequentially to Q4 2014, positions the operating divisions to address current business conditions.","While we continued investments in quality, new product development, project management and low cost sourcing, we will continue to drive top line and operating performance. Recent commitments include adding expertise in manufacturing optimization, growth oriented marketing, route to market distribution and alliance selling to name just a few. Each of these furthers our strategic initiatives to deliver on our long term growth plans at attractive profitability levels.","In response to market conditions and to improve margins and competitiveness, we're driving cost reductions and manufacturing optimization. We have launched and are accelerating existing initiatives that identify targeted opportunities to improve absorption and reduce expense through the consolidation of our manufacturing footprint with increased capabilities in the emerging regions. Our assets in China, India, Brazil and Mexico will begin to serve as core manufacturing centers to address many of our customers' long and short-term drivers. We still anticipate the aftermarket business to be more resilient as compared to the original equipment products.","In addition to the significant currency headwinds and customers tightly managing their maintenance budgets, the refinery strike that began in February affected the U.S. market and delayed scheduled plant maintenance as operators perform minimal maintenance. In addition, we saw our large retrofit business also affected during this period as customers assessed their overall capital plans. Lower OE bookings also had negatively affected aftermarket this quarter as we saw decreased activity in spares tied to new units.","Even as we anticipate some of the deferred work to come back and improve from this quarter's level of aftermarket activity, we continue to execute on plans to increase our aftermarket capture through the further identification of installed base and increased localization efforts. At the same time, we will be improving the capabilities of some existing facilities and in other cases, we'll look for opportunities to combine QRCs in overlapping regions. Growing our aftermarket remains a top priority and opportunity.","As Mark mentioned, we're also targeting growth through greater expansion into the power markets of Asia, better coverage in the chemical space and improved focus our distribution channels. The power market in China will be a longstanding opportunity. Our plan is to localize various pump product lines to maximize our China power market potential in addition to the buildout of our new valve facility.","The chemical market requires products with quick lead times and go to market strategies that are enhanced by establishing product portfolios and a distribution network to address customer needs. We will continue to update you on these initiatives as we progress. Looking at our end markets, during the first quarter on a constant currency basis and excluding SIHI for a clean comparison, the oil and gas bookings declined over 16%. We saw large project activity slow significantly by customers even in the mid and downstream areas reevaluated their investment plans in this new low price oil environment. Additionally, refiners taking advantage of improved spreads combined with the previously discussed U.S. workers' strike, created incremental challenges in this key downstream market.","Looking at the other oil and gas regions, Latin America headwinds continued as Petrobras worked through their issues and the financial crisis of Venezuela constrained Petrovesa. In the near term, Mexico remains an opportunity as foreign investment comes into play in Mexico's oil and gas business. In Middle East and Africa, oil and gas bookings were up 2.7% continuing the growth we experienced in 2014, albeit at more modest levels.","National oil companies in this region appeared to delay less of their investment decisions versus the multinationals which delayed significantly more. We have also seen increases in our proposal activity in the latter part of the quarter, particularly in the Middle East which supports some of the above statements on an ongoing basis.","As we discussed last quarter, with most of our oil and gas exposure in the mid and downstream markets and with our customers' maintenance and repair activities, we believe as the year progresses that various aspects of the market should begin to approach a less volatile and more normal level. As part of additional proposal activity we have experienced lately appears to validate that some projects in the industry are beginning to move forward though timing at competitive environment remains less certain.","In the chemical market, first quarter bookings decreased roughly 14% versus a strong compare in 2014. We continue to expect ethylene expansion in North America with the derivative plants related to the new capacity expected to come online over the next few years. Although the current strong dollar is partially offsetting the advantages of the low cost U.S. natural gas and may be a cause for a delay in some derivative plants. Middle East chemical expansion efforts looks to be a potential in the future as well.","In January 2015, we increased our chemical presence substantially with the acquisition of SIHI. The integration process of the business is progressing well. We're accelerating realignment efforts and have identified opportunities beyond our initial plans. For instance, we have seen substantial opportunities in providing systems for flare gas required by new environmental regulations.","Our power market bookings were down 14% versus prior years' quarter. While the rollover of activity into Q1 was slow, coal retirements and low-cost natural gas are driving the momentum for combined cycle plants in North America.","Asia continues to invest in fossil based plants where our increased local capabilities improve our competitiveness. In March, China began improving new nuclear plans, the first since 2011. We have been providing nuclear products on reactors currently under construction for some time and view the recent shift in policy as an important opportunity. Nuclear power remains in transition for China, Russia and South Korea see continued development and there are even discussions of new capacity in some regions of Europe.","India's new proposed agreement with the U.S. that will limit nuclear suppliers' liability could potentially be a meaningful catalyst for work in that country. Following the new safety standards, Japan is getting closer to restarting a portion of its nuclear capacity which has been idle since 2011.","General industries was down 14.7% with distribution and developed business also down versus the prior quarter. This is an area where we have added additional capability in terms of resources and strategic direction.","In summary, Flowserve has a strong global footprint, localized aftermarket capability, a diverse product portfolio and a strong operating platform. The investments in manufacturing optimization, quality and new product development will drive future opportunities. We believe that our core business is performing and provides us with a solid base. Also that we have experienced navigating similar market conditions and that we have solid long term strategic plans in place in terms of manufacturing optimization and growth plans.","We will continue to execute these long term strategies while accelerating others and at the same time increase our focus in accelerating our short-term initiatives to respond to the current market conditions including cost reductions. We will balance these initiatives with a view towards driving profitable growth for the long term value of our shareholders. With that overview, let me now turn it over to Malcolm.","Malcolm Platt","Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. Mark and Tom discussed our operational overview, strategic plans and business outlook in detail so let me finish with a quick discussion of our financial results. Flowserve began 2015 with sales over $1 billion in the first quarter which included approximately $67 million from our recent SIHI acquisition.","Turning to margins, excluding the negative impact of SIHI resulting from purchase price accounting and realignment as well as a modest amount in the Venezuelan remeasurement, adjusted gross margins were flat with year ago levels at 35.3% to affirming our operational performance remains on track. Again excluding SIHI as well as last year's benefit from our Noval gain on sale, SG&A dollars decreased year-over-year by approximately $21 million continuing to reflect Flowserve's commitment to cost containment.","Turning to our adjusted operating margins, the year-over-year reduction is largely due to reduced sales, excluding SIHI's impact and the other adjustments as well as the benefit we received last year from the gain on sale of Noval, operating margins declined 40 basis points. Our GAAP first quarter tax rate of nearly 50% is elevated due to the non-deductibility of the Venezuelan remeasurement and certain exit taxes associated with the SIHI integration. Adjusted for SIHI, Venezuela and other discrete items, our adjusted tax rate was in line with our guidance at 30.1%.","Turning to cash flows, as is typically the case, the first quarter was a seasonal user of cash. Increasing our cash generation remains a priority with our long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow near our net income level.","Our capital expenditures for the quarter were elevated to almost $84 million as some of our planned 2014 spending on the new Chinese valve facility slipped into 2015 and we also had an opportunity to purchase a long term license which will provide good opportunities to increase our aftermarket business both in addition to our regular organic investments. These investments are examples of our continued commitment and the investment in attractive organic opportunities for long term growth.","Returning capital to shareholders is a key priority for Flowserve and in the first quarter we returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At quarter end, approximately $384 million remained available under our current share repurchase plan authorized for this purpose.","We continue to have the financial flexibility necessary to pursue our initiatives. During the first quarter, we raised EUR500 million of seven year senior notes in the European markets that's an attractive 1.25% coupon. Use of proceeds were to fund the SIHI acquisition as well as our general corporate purposes. This additional funding increased our gross leverage ratio to 2 times EBITDA or 1.6 times on a net of cash basis. Further, it creates a natural hedge with our SIHI purchase and other Euro entities.","Primary working capital as a percentage of our trailing 12 month sales, improved modestly to 26.6% versus 27.7% a year ago. Our effort to improve our working capital continues to be an area of major emphasis. As Mark mentioned, we have revised our 2015 guidance ranges primarily due to additional expected FX headwinds as well as the current market environment. From an FX standpoint, we now expect a 10% revenue headwind and a $0.40 EPS impact for the year as compared to full-year 2014 results.","We now see 2015 revenues down 8% to 12% year-over-year not including the revenues from our SIHI acquisition. On a constant currency basis, this new guidance equates to revenues in the range of down 2% to up 2% and is supported by the 11% constant currency backlog billed during 2014.","Our adjusted EPS also excludes SIHI and also below the line currency impacts as well as other specific one-time events such as the quarter's Venezuelan remeasurement, future realignment and the like. Our revised adjusted EPS range is now $3.25 to $3.65 reflecting the $0.40 year-over-year FX headwind as well as current market conditions.","Similar to recent years, 2015 should reflect our traditional seasonality with earnings more weighted to the second half of the year. While performing in line with our expectations, SIHI follows a similar trend. We continue to expect the first half of the year will experience the largest year-over-year comparable FX challenge due to the stronger U.S. dollar. We continue to expect that SIHI will have an approximate $0.25 dilutive impact on GAAP EPS in 2015. With over half the total expected one-time costs occurring in the seasonally lightest quarter, we took a disproportionate amount of SIHI's delusion in Q1.","Finally, with the first quarter's high level of capital expenditures, we now expect to invest $170 million to $180 million during 2015. At this level, we will continue to profitably grow our business organically and to further increase our capabilities around the world. Let me now return the call to Jay.","Jay Roueche","Thanks, Malcolm. Operator, we have now concluded our prepared remarks and we would like to open the call up to questions from our audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mike Halloran","So first on the restructuring announcements. Could you just give us some help on how the benefits, those $70 million worth of benefits flow through? I am assuming a portion of it is this year but the majority of it is next year with the full run-rate at some time next year or into 2016?","Mark Blinn","That's about right. As we talked about, a lot of these in our mature markets and it takes time to implement them but we do expect to see some this year depending on implementation and get to run-rate during the course of next year. Mike, let me jump in real quick. We lost power in our main room and had to move so we had a bunch of people shuffling around so sorry for the disturbance.","Mike Halloran","No problem at all. Then on the downstream decision making process. Obviously, you saw some of the upstream oil related pressures shift into the downstream side. What do you think reinvigorates that decision making process for some of your client base as it stands today? The discussion is not going to be as connected to oil price machinations as it is on the upstream side. What are the conversations like today and how is that thought process materializing from here?","Mark Blinn","Well it's really I think the long term plans are still in place for mid and downstream. On the upstream you can variablize it easier. If you look at what can occur in our market is, think about where we were in February and March and half the pundits were saying oil was going to be at 30. The other half said it was going to go back to 80. At that point in time, it's difficult to implement an investment decision. I think what reinvigorates it is some stability and visibility in oil prices. Keep in mind, in certain regions of the world even at current levels, it makes sense to put additional capacity on.","So if you think about that from a project standpoint and then you step back again and look at what happens on some of our run-rate and aftermarket business, again, the environment we're in in the first quarter is people are uncertain about their capital budgets. If you look at the integrated oil companies, they're focused on cash flow. What that will cause folks to do is wait and see and develop their budget and certainly defer maintenance. We saw that in the beginning of 2009 but you can't defer it forever. So we do expect that to stabilize over a period of time.","Again, in our industry, a couple of months doesn't change things but if you look at some of the project development opportunities in the Middle East, they need to bring those things online. So we think the discussion starts to normalize and stabilize when people have visibility into oil prices, there is some stability. But when you see the volatile reactions and people don't know where oil is going over the short term, it pays - you see it in all industries, they wait. As a matter of fact, we did that in our own business. We were trying to see how the first quarter panned out. We held on some decisions. These are long term decisions.","Mike Halloran","One follow-up there. You referenced the aftermarket side and the deferred maintenance. How long can customers realistically defer that maintenance and can you put that in the context of what you did see in that 2009 time frame and then also what customers are telling you today?","Mark Blinn","On the maintenance side, it really comes down to a safety issue. For those aspects of the basic maintenance and operating condition, you can defer it for months but you can't defer it for quarters and years especially around safety issues. The other aspect of that Tom talked about, if you talk about the upgrades or the focus on efficiency, in any market people are going to look for ways to get more yield out of downstream. Keep in mind a lot of our - where aftermarket falls short in the mid and downstream business is where they shut a facility. We did see that happen in 2009.","It's not like an oil well where they cap the oil well or shut the oil well for a period of time or the production platform. They continue to operate these downstream facilities in good times and bad. In good times and bad they're looking for ways of course to keep them maintained and operating for safety purposes but also, they're looking for ways to drive additional efficiency.","As we look out, we can see and have seen before, where budgets - again, think about the environment that the oil and gas industry was in and it did spill over. They're saying we don't know where oil is going. Let's just wait and see. You also had the refinery strikes. People were uncertain as to how budgets were going to get allocated, particularly in integrated oil companies. So you can see that they'll defer it for that period of time. Also, we have seen when refinery spreads increase significantly they try to run them a little longer to capture some of the benefits. So even in that type of environment they will defer but you can't defer in perpetuity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Brady from BMO. Please go ahead.","Charley Brady","On your comment on the increased focus capture rate on the installed base, that's something you guys have talked about in the past. I am wondering can you remind us where you are today on what you think your capture it on your own install base is and what you are doing really to go after that and where you think you can get to over time?","Mark Blinn","We have been consistently below 40%, 45% on the capture rate except for in our seal business, it's higher. If you think about it and look at our legacy and heritage brands and how often these products can be at the market, years and years and years of installed base. Part of what we need to do is a sales person can only call on a facility with our installed base if he knows it's there.","One of the efforts that we've been doing is to inventory and category that installed base. That's part of the investment we have already made. That is people, that is systems and it takes time to inventory that and then you roll it into the sales organization end-user sales plans. So that's one of the things that we're doing. Also, some of the systems we developed and the conversations around efficiency and upgrades. But one of the big initiatives right now is just to go out and catalog our installed base. We have years and years of installed base around the world that we aren't servicing right now.","Charley Brady","I will go back on the prior question on the $100 million in investment, did you say that you expect the full run-rate in 2016 or are you getting most of the run-rate and full run-rate in 2017?","Mark Blinn","Well, we'll see a lot of it, a substantial amount in 2016. Again, keep in mind where we're implementing these takes time. There are things you have to work through to implement them. I think as you take a step back and look at the actions that we're taking, these are things that really position this company long term. And if you think about it and Tom referenced this, we're getting after our under absorption, we're getting after manufacturing cost, we're driving additional volume in some of our new state of the art facilities. This is really repositioning our business and we think this is what our customers are going to demand over time.","As we take a step back and look at this market and I think I have talked about this before, when factories are loaded and you are producing, it's very difficult to move product capabilities or actually shut a facility down during that period of time. What we do is we look at our long range planning and take the opportunity now to start to move some of our product capabilities to some of our higher volume low-cost parts of the world.","That's a core part of what we're doing right now is accelerating some of the plans that we've laid in place to really reposition this company to be even more competitive in the markets and take advantage of when things start to cycle up. They always do.","We have been through many cycles and one thing we know for sure is that this industry has a good secular underpinning and the markets will cycle back. There are some aspects of it that are more short-term and you can tend to realize those benefits quicker but as we look out we see this as a great opportunity to improve this business.","And what that will mean long term is we'll be more competitive, we think we can take more share, we'll drive more margins in the business. I think another distinction to keep in mind is the $100 million and the SIHI efforts are separate in terms of the way you look at them from a financial standpoint. But they are integrated in terms of how we're going to implement them and look at our global capacity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","So Mark, just curious on the restructuring. How much of the $100 million in costs and the related $70 million benefit, how much of that is new versus plans that you already had in place? Then specifically across the business units, where do you see the biggest opportunity?","Mark Blinn","Two-thirds of it is really pulling for our strategic plans in terms of that cost. About a third of it is what I'd say is more short-term market reaction. Having said that, we're also designing that component to be sustainable and long term. What I mean by that is, it's more than just variablizing headcount to the market which we have done some of that. We continue to do some of that outside of this program. We do have a lot of temporaries that we use to variablize in market increases and decreases. That's separate from what we're talking about. So two-thirds of this is really designed to reposition the business longer term. What was the second part of your question, Joe?","Joe Ritchie","Just specifically, what business units do you expect to benefit most from it?","Mark Blinn","Okay. A lot of this is going to be a lot of our engineered capacity. If you look at the legacy and the history of Flowserve, a lot of the businesses have been in the mature markets, a lot of the engineered capacity. That's the type of capacity we have been building in the emerging parts of the world. As you have heard us talk before, we have gotten those plants up and running mainly to serve those local markets. That's the way we like to set up new facilities. Build the facility, build the capabilities, build the leadership team and then over time, you migrate products into those facilities to serve the local markets and then also to serve and support markets around the world.","So what we have done is we made a significant amount of investment over the last four or five years in these facilities. They take a while to get up and running. These things don't come up or go down very, very quickly. A lot of this is going to be in our engineered and if you look in - but it's across all three segments. Really, we're going to be taking the opportunity to really improve all three segments of our business.","Joe Ritchie","And then maybe one follow up on the organic growth. You started off the year down three. The guidance is about flat at the midpoint for the entire year. Two questions there. One, where did you see the biggest change in your guidance? Because the number was closer to plus 6 before. Was it upstream, midstream, downstream? And then secondly, how much of the business that you were unable to ship this quarter do you expect to ship and is included in getting closer to the flat guidance for the year?","Mark Blinn","So currency aside, the adjustment on the revenue has been, one, we came into the year with on a constant currency basis, 11% incremental backlog. That's what, in a sense at the point in time gave us confidence around our growth. If you think about that constant currency was almost $300 million. Obviously, there has been a currency impact on the existing backlog and any future bookings that come in.","As we look forward, a lot of the decrease was around market conditions. What we see now is people will push off their decisions. As to my comment earlier, the refineries that need to be built in the Middle East need to be built there and we fully expect that they will be implemented. We do understand as markets are in the current condition it becomes more competitive, so most of the decrease is driven by market conditions.","The other thing in terms of when you look at a year in our business, as things start to move out, both from a booking standpoint and a revenue standpoint, we now expect that those things will start to move into next year. So those are really the two aspects that we see impacting the revenue guidance. Primarily, it's the market. And it's just - Joe, it's the way we see the market right now.","What's happened in the market is we have seen some normalization in the aftermarket side. There are projects out there but nobody is rushing to get them to market. So we'll just have to wait and see. In general, when you look at what can drive this, people need to see some stability in oil markets and certainly the currency markets as well, because while there is tremendous volatility and they don't know where things are going to move they're going to sit and wait.","We saw this again, back in 2009 and then again the oil and gas market came on fairly strong for the reasons that we think long term there is going to be spend in the oil and gas market. Hydrocarbons are finite. Consumption will go up over a period of time. People are urbanizing. They need more power, more energy. All these things are going to drive our markets long term but when you see a disruption like you have seen oil being cut in half and even a little bit further over the short term, people are going to pause.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","I want to also speak to the organic guidance because you know I guess what I am looking at is the bookings versus past history and believe me I know that there is nothing linear about bookings and sales. But we really haven't seen the level of sales come through versus the bookings. It's been actually fairly nonlinear. If I look back after - excluding this quarter, three out of the five previous quarters organic bookings were up double digits and into the teens.","Obviously, on an organic sales basis we didn't see anything near that type of level of sales growth in the last six quarters. So why would we think that an increase in organic backlog by 11% is going to produce kind of a different dynamic than what we have seen? Obviously we have seen a lot of pushouts. So why do we think that we can get to a flattish organic in this environment even knowing that the bookings that we have seen in the backlog have continued to get pushed out on the delivery side?","Mark Blinn","Scott, I think that's it. When the book-to-bill is greater than one over periods of time you are building backlog and that supports sales growth and future periods. So what you see, it's a leading indicator. Book-to-bill greater than one will tend to drive, all things being equal, tend to drive sales up and then book-to-bill less than one obviously, will drive sales down over that period of time. But there are other factors.","One of the things and this is really a credit to our operations, is that we've been executing better, more available and on time delivery. Now increasingly we find that when our product is available, the facility is not necessarily ready for our product. I think we have seen that fairly consistently over the last four or five quarters. That's not a bad thing. That means we're keeping our customers happy. That's the aspect of what Tom has been talking about is we see things spill over to the subsequent quarter.","For reasons of execution, we hope that continues because that's certainly a good thing. As you look at our guidance, I think Scott, really the driver in terms of where we're, if you think we're too aggressive on our guidance is going to be that constant currency backlog. Obviously, if the markets deteriorate further from here, that's certainly going to put pressure on our revenues, absolutely. Obviously, if they increase as well, this is all currency aside, it could have the other affect.","Scott Graham","So I'm assuming that you are obviously very privy to all of the delivery schedule dates for what you have in the backlog, but that you also took a haircut on that number for the 2015 guidance, yes?","Mark Blinn","When we look at things again, this is a point in time and they can change, but absolutely. We look at our plans. We look at our delivery plans. We know what the dates are that we need to deliver to our customers. And a lot of our forecasting, it comes from the bottom up, anticipates that. Of course, we'll sit and try to maybe work that a little bit in terms of market conditions but for the most part, we try to keep the rigor around what we're hearing from our sites because they are the closest to the customer.","Scott Graham","Understood. The other question that I had was about the margin development that kind of gets you to the midpoint of the guidance range. Obviously, we'd be looking at margins to on a year-over-year basis look better going forward than they did in the first quarter and I understand the first quarter the $150 million of sales, I understand all of that.","But was there anything other than that in the first quarter where it was a pretty weak margin number that we saw in the quarter. Was there anything other than the push backs of sales that impacted the quarter? Was there anything, mix or even some pricing? Because obviously, the guidance does contemplate an improvement in the year-over-year comparisons and margin going forward.","Mark Blinn","You know, Scott, you and I have come a long way when we're saying 13.8% margins in the first quarter are low. To that point, I think if you see one of the things that drove it is lower fixed cost leverage in our business. So part of what we get around SG&A leverage and we really haven't seen that for the last five quarters, is top line drives that fixed cost leverage in the business.","So part of it is we do expect on a comparative basis relative to Q1, if you look at our revenue guidance, to get some of that fixed cost leverage as well. There are continuing efforts around operational improvements. But the other thing to keep in mind, aside from the $100 million we talked about, we haven't been sitting still in the first quarter. We've been pulling levers around some costs, managing costs very tightly relative to where we were last year, all with a desire to drive margins in our business.","Those are really the three things, but I think the important thing is, don't just look at the $100 million in isolation. We're doing other things to make sure that we try to drive growth in our business and margin improvement, comparative margin improvement, in our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones","If we could just go over to the inorganic opportunities that you alluded to a little bit in your prepared comments, I know over the last few years you'd been looking to focus internally and then the SIHI came along and you bought that. With the $100 million in restructuring, where do you feel like the bandwidth is to take on additional inorganic growth at this point?","Mark Blinn","That is absolutely a factor we consider in terms of when we look at an opportunity is the ability to execute and integrate it. As I've referenced at a high level and Tom did specifically, a lot of the issues around the $100 million we've brought in some notable talent to help us execute that.","What I would say is excluding businesses that are busy integrating right now, I mean IPD is busy on an integration, we think there's certainly bandwidth if we see a good opportunity. I think that's probably the important thing to note, is the way we see the inorganic market right now is memories are long in terms of the pricing environment of last summer and it takes a while for that to work its way through the system and so, if you look at and we have certainly seen this before.","So, we consider the bandwidth. We consider the pricing environment. We also consider the alternatives of allocation to capital. If you look at the $100 million with the $70 million return that is a great return on that investment. And honestly, if we see more opportunities like that in our business we will prioritize that. We also see a good opportunity and we have continued to return value to our shareholders. So we'll balance all of those at the end of the day but bandwidth is something we'd consider and when we look over all at our businesses. For example, you look at our valve business, it's certainly fragmented. They have been executing at a high level. I'd say bandwidth is available there.","Nathan Jones","Okay and just on the Venezuela devaluation, is that all remeasuring the balance sheet non-cash?","Mark Blinn","Yes, it is. Some of it was above the line because you have to take lower cost to market adjustment. But I think you have seen other multinationals do this as well. It's mostly non-cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","I was hoping you could expand on the comment that's in the release that you are seeing customers focused on price competition. I know you said that there has been no backlog repricing, that's real important and that's good to see. Just maybe within the business that you're booking this quarter, are there price concessions in there?","Mark Blinn","As we look at opportunities, absolutely. Our customers are certainly very savvy and they say we see the market environment right now. We see that these companies want to fill their factories book business in and we're going to take advantage of that. We saw this last time. It actually persisted from a very price strength in our industry at the end of 2008 to it flipped very quickly in 2009 and persisted for about a 1.5 years during that period of time. That's certainly what customers do.","Keep in mind Deane, at the end of the day, they do value quality. Lead times are very, very important in the business as well. So for the most part, our customers understand the ability to deliver a quality product that meets the process conditions that you can support over a period of time but I definitely don't want to ignore the fact that price comes in. My comment earlier is okay, that's the market.","We need to respond. We need to drive price out of our business. Part of this realignment strategy is to do just that, to further drive to our low cost manufacturing so we can respond on price not only in this environment but when the markets have more pricing power for our industry to be able to drive more margin in the business.","Tom Pajonas","Deane, I would add to that, that we have been approached by several customers and we have approached several customer in terms of taking the overall cost out of the value chain itself. Things like cycle time reduction, while that may not result in a product cost reduction on our side, it could result in a significant change for the customer as we work through specifications available with them, as we work through product simplification and take out time in their overall schedule.","We're also looking at project bundling that will cut down on their overall project spend and project time which will bring their overall cycle time down. There is more ways to get at that value added other than just cost although there is general cost pressure across the industry.","Deane Dray","Are any of your non U.S. competitors now using the stronger dollar as a weapon and how they compete for business?","Mark Blinn","You know, as you look - a lot of our costs where we manufacture are basically in Euros. I mean, they're in other currencies as well. That's the benefit of having a global footprint. We have the ability to do work in low cost regions of the world or there are certainly other parts of the world. I would tell you Deane, if you look at currency movements, over the short-term they do impact multinationals but over long term things balance out.","What I mean by that is if you think about where we were four or five years ago, the Euro at 150, it was very difficult even in a good market at that point in time, for our European facilities to compete in the global arena. Now look where the Euro is right now. It's easier for them to compete. That's the way things work over the long term. But typically as a multinational industrial you have to get over the year-over-year compare on the currency.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin Maczka","Can we just go back to SIHI for a minute? I understand why you are stripping that out of the guide for the year because with the one-time purchase accounting and other costs it will be $0.25 diluted. But I think that business last year was doing about $350 million growing mid-single digits. Can you just give an update on your expectations there for the year? Is it being impacted in terms of the bookings rate the same way that the base business is?","Mark Blinn","You saw the bookings in the first quarter. In general, they are certainly being impacted by currency as our other businesses are as well. Again, we just acquired this business. Part of the reason we acquired it is we thought we could grow and think we can grow their top line opportunities but we need to get that thing online and driven.","So we see the opportunity to grow the business over the short-term. It too has been affected by the markets as well. I mean it's a leading provider of vacuum pumps into the chemical industry which was impacted short-term during that period of time. It is not immune from our markets.","What we think we can do over the next couple quarters is drive some of the growth opportunities we saw by having our global sales platform. So the way I will say is it is on plan. It is as we expected over on the business. I really don't want to start breaking out any sub businesses or anything and start guiding revenue from that point in time especially when we're only two, three months into the acquisition at this point. But I can tell you, relative to our expectations, the integration is on track.","We have seen some additional revenue opportunities in the business and some cost opportunities as well. Again, being in Europe, these things will certainly take time but we have actually seen the opportunity to take some of our capacity and leverage theirs as well.","Kevin Maczka","In terms of accretion, Mark, I think your original view and I don't know that you have changed it, was that it would be accretive immediately in 2015 but it's of course $0.25 dilutive with all the onetime costs up front. Is that still at least the way to be thinking about this? Excluding the one timer that this is a nicely accretive deal this year and then it grows after that if things go well?","Mark Blinn","The underlying business is profitable, if that's your question, absent all the purchase accounting and the realignment costs associated with it. The underlying business is profitable. It too, like us, tends to have a slow start in the beginning of the year, our entire industry does and ramp up towards the end of the year. So it will have the same cadence. We hope to change and enhance that cadence in years to come as we drive more sales through our sales organization but the underlying business is profitable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry","So I just wanted to start with a follow up on the guidance question. It looks like the midpoint of the constant currency revenue came down by about 6 points but the midpoint of the earnings guidance ex the currency adjustment only came down $0.15 which seems like somewhat of a disconnect unless there is material margin improvement. I was curious about how you explain that?","Mark Blinn","One of the comments I made is around the earnings side there are things we're doing below revenue line to drive earnings. I think the levers that we pull over on the business. Another thing to keep in mind is part of the revenue impact is in project original equipment which tends to be lower margin overall in our business. Those are two of the aspects as well. So if you look at it, we have been responding overall and we do anticipate that if the original equipment comes down we'll see more aftermarket mix in our business.","Robert Barry","Got you. When you say below the line, are you referring to things like repos, stock repurchase.","Mark Blinn","No, sorry. I am talking about below the revenue line. You said hey, here is what's going on the revenue line tell me how you get down to the bottom. And I said, we're doing a lot of work starting at cost of sales through SG&A and certainly, our repurchase plan does as well all the way to the EPS line.","Robert Barry","Got you. Maybe just a little bit bigger picture. Many of the other pump and valve players with oil and gas exposure started to see weakness earlier in Q4 even through Q1 and it sounds like you really just started to see it in a material way in March. I was curious how you would explain that lag.","Mark Blinn","Well as Tom referenced in his comments, we saw a strong Q4 overall in the business and typically, we often expect a slower start in January and February in our industry, particularly if you look at some of the national oil companies around the world. Often their budgets aren't approved into January or February. It's just the way their political system works in the business.","So often times, historically, we have seen good upticks in March and we're anticipating some of that and it didn't come through. Again Robert, I think as I've said earlier, is if you think what was occurring in February and well into March is there was a lot of volatility and uncertainty around the price of oil and an investment decision and a budget $30 which is half the pundits we're saying, versus $80 is significantly different and so they'll hold in that part of the business. But part of it is we saw a strong Q4 in our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes, so actually most of my questions have been answered, maybe just a little bit more on the aftermarket. Are you seeing any increased competition on that end of the business or is there any trends towards in sourcing of some of that work potentially to save in the near-term? I don't know if the customer base has that capability or not. If they do, have you seen any of that happen?","Mark Blinn","Not really. Over time we actually expect that they're going to continue to outsource. A lot of it is because some of the engineering talent frankly, in the mature markets is retiring as we have been looking at that and our ability to be able to respond quickly. Really the reason they will in source is either they feel like they have the critical mass to support a maintenance group or they're concerned that they can't get the responsiveness from an external provider over all in the business. But we haven't seen any in sourcing.","That wasn't really what impacted the business overall. Again, it was more only maintenance that we really saw that was done what was had to be done. Optional maintenance and the efficiency upgrades, those were curved back. Again, just the other things is if you look at the refinery strike, that will certainly slow down spend significantly around maintenance.","Brian Konigsberg","Maybe secondly on the orders, so down 13%. Can you quantify how much of that decline was driven purely by price?","Mark Blinn","Most of that was volume in terms of activity. There was some price impact over all the business but most of that was volume, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","The first question on these refinery maintenance pushouts because we ever been told that some of these pushouts actually are going to materialize during the summer or fall simply because to your point you can't really not maintain refineries. Can you quantify what kind of pick up you are going to see over the next couple quarters from some of the pushouts actually happening?","Mark Blinn","Yes. Last thing I want to do is start guidance specifically on our aftermarket other than to say if you look over time, it has been relatively stable. You have seen whereas Tom talked about, commission spares and I think I have referenced these before. Part of our aftermarket business is when you sell a new project, you sell spares that will sit there when they start up the facility because things naturally need to be replaced during that period of time. But you're right, it is a deferral around maintenance and they will not defer into perpetuity.","I can tell you, you have seen where if refinery spreads GAAP out real quick, they'll try to extended run-time because that's profit. They're going to take advantage of the profit while they can. If there is big uncertainty they'll defer it as much as they can. Having said that, they can only go so far because then it becomes - basic maintenance becomes an operational or a safety issue.","Andrew Obin","The other comment what we're hearing a lot from big energy companies and then percolating down to companies is the fact that there is a little bit of a cash flow. There is something of a cash crunch in the energy industry for various reasons. How do you guys respond to that in terms of your service model? How can you accommodate your customers to keep the market share and maybe to grow the market share in this environment? Are there any changes that you are making to the terms of your service projects, not necessarily pricing, but what else are you doing to accommodate your customer base? Thank you.","Mark Blinn","Sure. If you look on the cash side, the cash they're conserving and rationalizing tends to be on the large capital projects. That's where the big dollars are. The big dollars are not in maintenance aftermarket and then you think about also retrofits and upgrades. Those are comparatively small in terms of the large projects. If you think about our aftermarket business, from time to time, like we saw in the first quarter last year, you will see a notable $6 million, $7 million upgrade package.","For the most part these are small ticket items. The projects are the big ticket items. If you are hearing it from E&Cs and you're hearing it from customers, those are both in the areas where you are seeing the big ticket items. What they will do is look in terms of their cash deployment and when those will ultimately come online and that's how they manage our cash. They've been doing that now, some of the integrateds, have been rationalizing cash for probably about the last year.","Tom Pajonas","One of the things that obviously we can do is work on the lead times. We can bring the overall project lead times down through some of the things that I previously mentioned. That would help in the overall cash position hanging that cash out there over a longer period of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Chase Jacobson","Just one housekeeping, did you give the organic backlog, excluding the SIHI contribution, on the constant currency basis?","Mark Blinn","I think in some of our comments, it would be in the press release, we told you rolling it from Q4 the impact of currency and the impact of SIHI. I think they in effect offset each other.","Chase Jacobson","Okay. I'll take a look back at that. And then just one more on the pricing competition. You have given good color on it but I was just curious if you are seeing any specific competitors go after price a little bit more aggressively? I know you saw it in the last cycle. So you guys are pretty disciplined but I am just curious if there is any market share risk? If there are any domestic or international competitors taking it more aggressively than others?","Mark Blinn","We do see competitors from time to time and for different reasons be very competitive on price. That does occur as it did last time. In general, what I'd say is most of our mature competitors seem to be fairly rational overall in the business. I think we have talked about, years ago there was a competitor that was in a sense up for sale and owned by private equity and they filled a lot of their backlog. But for the most part we have seen reasonable behavior. What does that mean? That can apply to us as well.","You look at absorption in your factories and you make a tradeoff between do I want to absorb it or do I want to rationalize the facility over that period of time? Sometimes to absorb it you have to go aggressively after a project. Another example is, on one of the Middle East projects that we booked years ago it was very, very competitive. We were able to get it, secure the pumps and the seals in the business and I can tell you, it still pays a very strong aftermarket annuity.","I think what I am pointing out is in general, this environment will cause people to be more aggressive on price. Part of the message you are hearing from us is we will stay balanced and disciplined and take advantage and take the opportunity to really start driving cost out of our system, manufacturing costs, out of our system long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen.","Joe Giordano","To follow on what you just said, how would you judge the margin inherent in your incremental backlog that you are building today versus what's flowing through currently based on what you booked last year?","Mark Blinn","Well you should expect overall the projects, the margin is going to be less than it was before all other things being equal. How do we offset some of that? We turn to our supply chain. We're still continuing to improve our operating platform. We do things like take under absorption out of our business, drive costs out of our business. I want to make sure the message is clear. We're not just letting the market drive us. We can't control it but we can respond to it. But you should expect when projects become more competitive, all other things being equal, impact margins.","If you look at the aftermarket business, that's held relatively stable high level margins consistently through cycles. We don't expect that to change. Then the run-rate business can be impacted on the margin side but a lot of that is being able to respond very, very quickly and respond not only to delivery times, the process conditions and be responsive. But the run-rate business is not immune from having margin pressure in a down environment.","Joe Giordano","One more question on aftermarket more strategic and we talked about in sourcing earlier. Part of your strategy and you've talked about it a lot in the last couple of quarters, has been going after your existing customers and trying to take that business that they're currently doing in house and to me that seems like a really [Technical Difficulty].","Mark Blinn","I can't hear Joe.","Joe Giordano","Can you guys hear me?","Mark Blinn","I can hear you now.","Joe Giordano","Sorry. What you've said in the last couple quarters on aftermarket and your strategy of actually going after your customers' business that they are doing in house and that seems particularly poignant today when I assume most of your customers are very wary of fixed cost. And I was wondering if you've seen any, if that's been a good development recently?","Mark Blinn","That's been a continuing development. I think what we're trying to do to accelerate that and this was in response to the first or second question, is we have to know where our product is to go and take advantage of it.","So there are a lot of customers that we aren't serving that are either doing their own maintenance, it could be a local machine shop that's taking care of these products. We need to know where they are and where the product is, what type of product it is to go and actually call on them. So that's part of the investment that we're making right now in terms of capturing that.","But on a continuous basis we're looking for ways to get customers to provide us with the ability to service the equipment and not only does it come in the form of an alliance agreement where we'll take on a multi-year obligation to do that or just the one off. Go in and calling on the customer.","We have engineers that go on site that say look, I can bring some efficiency. It is not just repairing and maintaining it. It's also going in and saying we can improve the efficiency of the operation of this overall facility because if you think about our equipment, our equipment drives the facility. It's what energizes the flow control process. In effect, controls the flow control process and also protects the environment in terms of our ceiling solutions.","Tom Pajonas","I mean we fundamentally believe that we have a lot of opportunities in the reliability and availability aspect of the customers' plants. So we have plans in monitoring and diagnostics, asset management, optimization programs and then as Mark mentioned, the whole area about establishing the databases in terms of where our products are and categorizing that in many of our plants around the world. That will present another opportunity.","And then a third aspect, is on the sales side where we're driving account based sales programs in the aftermarket similar to what we have done in the new equipment side of the business over the last couple of years. We're going to be doing that on the aftermarket side of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","David Rose","Just two quick ones, most of mine have been answered. If we can go to the CapEx side, what was the component for new way air bearings license? And what does it mean for you?","Mark Blinn","Are you talking about in our cash flow statement, the additional CapEx?","David Rose","Right.","Mark Blinn","One of those was the bearings but we also entered into another license agreement really to enhance our aftermarket opportunities to get access to products so we can provide aftermarket services. So you saw the bearings one. That's a real opportunity around our ceiling solutions but we also entered into another one. Some of them we put press releases. Sometimes some of our partners and everything like that are more sensitive about that but that's basically what you saw.","David Rose","So there were two transactions. And ballpark combined those versus the China plant expansion?","Mark Blinn","Yes, you also saw that as well. If you look at our CapEx this year, a big part of it was those licensing relationships we talked about that drive revenue growth. Also our China expansion, both on the valve side but also in the China power that we talked about earlier and expansion in India and Latin America.","So we're to this point, we're certainly aware of our markets but we're leaning into them and taking advantage of the opportunity to drive and create even more low cost capacity for our business long term. And you should expect that we're accelerating plans now to migrate into that capacity and we will continue do that over the years to come. That's how we position this business to be more competitive.","David Rose","And maybe just a last one, given where you are in the quarter, this is seasonally a down quarter in terms of cash flow, but you have also made an acquisition. I think you are at the highest debt to cap in quite some time. What do you expect the debt to cap ratio to be at year end?","Mark Blinn","Well I mean obviously, you can model out our cash flow and look over where we going to be over the period of time and we expect to generate cash as we have historically. And the other aspect of it is return value to our shareholders as well. So in general, we think at this point we're kind of at the top end of the range but we're also, to your point, where we're in the year where we're drawing most cash out of our system and it will end to generate and it will take that leverage down.","Specifically, where it's going to be can depend on a number of things. It will be just really around our capital allocation policies. If we see opportunity to drive value for our shareholders through capital allocation we will take advantage of that and that will impact our leverage ratio. The important thing to remember is, you look at the deal we did, the European deal, we have access to the capital markets. We've got a very, very strong balance sheet. This is what you want to see.","You want a company that's positioning itself in these type of markets, is to have a strong balance sheet, a good operating platform, a strong leadership organization and the ability to lean into these markets and take advantage and reposition the business. That's what we're doing.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We have reached our allotted time. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Janine. I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.","John Roueche","Thank you, Janine, and good morning, everyone. we appreciate you participating in our conference call today to discuss Flowserve's 2019 third quarter financial results. Joining me this morning are Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Eckert, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for questions. And as a reminder, this event is being webcast, and an audio replay will be available. ","Please note that our earnings materials do, and this call will, include non-GAAP measures and contain forward-looking statements. These statements are based upon forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of October 31, 2019, and they involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. We encourage you to fully review our safe harbor disclosure as well as the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to our reported results, both of which are included in our press release and earnings presentation and are also available on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Robert Rowe","Great. Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Flowserve again delivered good quarterly results while continuing to make progress on our Flowserve 2.0 transformation journey. As we approach the halfway point of this strategic program, I am encouraged by the increasing momentum we are seeing in our operations and in our financial results. Additionally, our employees' engagement and enthusiasm to drive sustainable changes to the parent at all levels of our organization. Ultimately, we expect to build an organization capable of performing at a high level in any business environment. We are well on the way to making this a reality. ","Let's turn to the financial results for the third quarter. We executed well, delivering 4.6% revenue growth; improvements in adjusted gross and operating margins of 60 and 100 basis points respectively; and adjusted EPS of $0.59, a 20% increase over the prior year. Flowserve's reported EPS was $0.52, up $0.31 year-over-year and representing nearly 90% of our adjusted earnings. This reflects a significant improvement in our quality of earnings. ","As a result of our strong performance thus far in 2019, we increased the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.15, while keeping the upper end in place at $2.20. We feel confident in our ability to deliver the full year within this range. ","I would also like to highlight our free cash flow improvement. We continued to make progress in this area and have now delivered over $120 million more in year-to-date free cash flow than last year. Better operating income, reduced realignment spend, disciplined capital spending all contributed to the cash flow growth. ","Moving now to our segments. The operational improvement in FPD continued to flow through the segment's financial performance. In the third quarter, FPD grew revenue by 5.4% year-over-year and delivered a 24% increase in adjusted operating income. Adjusted gross and operating margins both improved 200 basis points. ","While this performance included a 2% aftermarket mix shift benefit, it was primarily driven by our ongoing improvement initiatives, including continued progress in legacy IPD facilities, ongoing value engineering in our product portfolio, improved planning processes, better productivity and inventory management as well as initiatives to drive lean manufacturing deeper into our operating footprint. FPD's third quarter bookings increased 6.3% year-over-year despite 330 basis points of currency and divestiture headwinds. ","Turning now to FCD. The third quarter largely played out as expected and how we communicated on our second quarter call. FCD continues to be impacted by the slowdown occurring in the North American short-cycle MRO business and the distributor destockings that began earlier in the year. Third quarter revenues were essentially flat sequentially, and I am pleased that FCD's adjusted gross and operating margins improved by roughly 150 basis points compared to the second quarter, considering the mix and the market dynamics were largely the same. On a year-over-year constant currency basis, FCD grew its top line by 4.9%. However, a higher percentage of revenues were derived from larger original equipment projects as opposed to higher-margin short-cycle MRO work. ","FCD margins were negatively impacted by this mix shift on a year-over-year comparison as adjusted gross margins declined by 300 basis points. With more focus on controlling our costs, we were able to limit the impact on operating margins to a decline of 250 basis points compared to 2018 third quarter. ","The continued slowdown in the North American MRO and distribution business also had an impact on FCD's third quarter bookings. Bookings in the quarter decreased 10% year-over-year, including approximately 2% of negative currency impact. The end markets that typically have the highest exposure to this type of work saw the biggest impact, including a 21% decrease in general industries, a 10% decline in chemical and a 7% decrease in oil and gas. Partially offsetting the decline was a 61% increase in power bookings year-over-year. We expect the North American MRO bookings to recover in time, but we have yet to see a positive inflection for the FCD business. ","Turning now to our consolidated bookings and end markets. Third quarter bookings increased 1.3% to $1.02 billion, or 4.1%, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures, and represents a book-to-bill of 1.03%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter which we've delivered bookings over $1 billion combined with year-over-year bookings growth. This level of performance continues to be driven by our growth-oriented transformation initiatives and greater collaboration across our pumps, valves and seal projects -- products as we leverage the power of pure play. On a year-over-year basis, nearly half of our bookings have come from customers who purchased more than one Flowserve offering. ","Our year-over-year bookings growth in the third quarter was driven by smaller projects and upgrade work. In the quarter, Flowserve booked 2 projects above $15 million in size. There are 4 of these larger awards in last year's numbers. ","We do expect the progression of energy infrastructure projects to continue. However, there is more uncertainty at the macro level than earlier in the year. Refining, LNG and chemical end markets remain encouraging as large projects in EPC backlogs continue to move toward equipment order placement. The current macro environment makes the timing of large projects awards more difficult to forecast. Whether it's the commodity pricing, trade disputes, Brexit or issues in the Middle East, the increased uncertainty and the current geopolitical situation has driven delays in capital spending. The good news is we have not seen nor do we expect significant project cancellations. We believe the opportunity set of global project will move forward, especially for refineries and chemical plants as they are driven by increased global demand. ","Our original equipment bookings have grown by 13% year-to-date. We are capturing our fair share of the opportunities that are out there, and our teams are focused on building a quality backlog to drive margin growth in the markets, regions and with the customer base we pursue. ","Turning to aftermarket. Third quarter bookings of nearly $500 million were essentially flat versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our commercial intensity program, which is a critical component of the Flowserve 2.0 growth initiative, helped offset the short-cycle market slowdown in North America as we continued to increase our share of our customers' maintenance. And we fully expect to drive growth in our aftermarket franchise through the combination of our growing installed base, customers' increased focus on efficiency, regulatory changes and execution of our proven growth initiatives. ","From a served end market perspective and starting with our largest market, oil and gas. Third quarter bookings decreased 6% year-over-year, including 2% negative currency impact driven by mid-single-digit declines in both FPD and FCD. The 2018 comparative period was challenging as last year's third quarter provided our highest level of oil and gas bookings of the year. Oil and gas markets remained active, particularly in the Middle East and Asia Pacific with a number of $5 million to $10 million downstream and upstream awards across both segments, driven by refinery upgrades and clean air projects, including ongoing work related to IMO 2020. North American oil and gas remains more challenged due initially to upstream spending discipline, which has impacted the region's MRO activity and distributor stocking orders. We did, however, receive another North America pipeline award this quarter, thanks to our strike zone efforts. ","Our constant currency chemicals bookings increased 11% in the quarter, driven by FPD's 24% growth, partially offset by FCD's 10% decline. The quarter included a small project award to FPD in the Gulf Coast. We see a strong pipeline for near-term opportunities in the Gulf Coast region and expect similar opportunities to come in Asia and Middle East, driven by a forecasted global demand growth. ","Our power markets increased 45% primarily due to the lower 2018 compare, which was our lowest power bookings total in over 5 years. While challenges in our power markets continue, we are pleased with 2 awards in the $5 million range, representing a combined cycle plant in North America and a coal-fired plant in Europe. We also remain focused on the concentrated solar power market, with the Flowserve power of a pure-play differentiating offering of pumps, valves and seals provides opportunities in a growing market. We continue to support our global fossil and nuclear installed base with maintenance, upgrades and life extensions and look to participate in fuel switching opportunities in North America and Europe as well as a limited newbuild project set primarily in Asia. ","Third quarter bookings in general industries declined 1% year-over-year, including 2.5% of currency headwinds. FCD's 21% decline was largely offset by FPD's 11% growth. FCD continues to build its global distribution channel, and the third quarter included solid growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa markets. As many of you know, about 40% of FCD sales go through the distribution channel, and much of that is categorized in general industries. So the distributor destocking activity we've experienced was the primary cause of the decline in general industry category. In addition, FCD's percentage decline was also impacted by a large $6 million marine project that was booked last year that did not reoccur. ","Lastly, representing our smallest market, water bookings increased 7% in the third quarter, including two desalination awards, which totaled over $20 million combined, and two awards for water management in North America, each in the $5 million range. ","Turning now to bookings by geography. The strength in the Middle East and African markets continued with 38% growth in the third quarter and is up over 40% for the year, driven by significant refining and chemical investment. North America and Asia Pacific both delivered low single-digit booking growth, while Latin America was flat. Europe remains our most challenged region overall, with bookings down 19% year-over-year. ","I'll now turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results in greater detail. And then I will return for some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A. Lee?","Lee Eckert","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect the progress we are making in our Flowserve 2.0 transformation journey. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 increased 20% year-over-year and about 10% sequentially. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted earnings per share has increased approximately 32% to $1.54 per share. Our reported EPS for the quarter was $0.52, which included $0.06 of realignment and transformation charges and [indiscernible] mainly negative below-the-line currency impacts. ","Looking at the first 9 months of 2019. Our reported EPS of $1.40 increased $0.97 or over 3x the EPS from last year, and it represents over 90% of our adjusted 2019 EPS. On a year-to-date basis, we have reduced after-tax adjusted items by $78 million versus prior year. This reduction demonstrates our continued focus on improving the quality of our earnings. ","Revenues in the third quarter were $997 million, an increase of 4.6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and divestiture headwinds, organic revenue grew 7.4% year-over-year. Third quarter aftermarket sales increased 6.7%, or 9.4% on a constant currency basis, to $488 million and represent 49% of total sales, essentially the same percentage as the prior year. ","Turning to our margins. Third quarter adjusted gross margin of 33.8% increased 60 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially. FPD's 200 basis point improvement year-over-year was a key driver as we continued to deliver operational and productivity improvements, including the further leveraging the combination of our pumps business that we implemented earlier this year. Partially offsetting FPD's strong performance was a decline in FCD's adjusted gross margin year-over-year to 32.8%. As Scott discussed, FCD has faced market headwinds for much of this year, consisting of strong growth in larger project-oriented work offsetting a cyclical decline in MRO activity. FCD, however, did improve its adjusted gross margin sequentially by 150 basis points in the third quarter on a modest sequential revenue decrease. ","On a reported basis, Flowserve's gross margins increased 110 basis points to 33.5%, driven by essentially the same factors I discussed as well as approximately $5 million of lower realignment spend in 2019. ","We remain focused on managing our cost structure and are pleased that our third quarter adjusted SG&A was essentially flat with prior year at approximately $220 million, even as we delivered bookings and revenue growth in the quarter. As a percentage of sale, adjusted SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 22.1%. On a reported basis, third quarter SG&A decreased approximately $16 million, driven primarily by the lower adjusted items versus prior year. ","At the operating level, our adjusted operating margins improved 100 basis points to 12% as a result of our strong adjusted gross margin and tight cost management. FPD's 13% adjusted op margin increased 200 basis points year-over-year, which was partially offset by FCD's 250 basis point decrease. On a sequential basis, both segments' adjusted operating margins improved, including FCD by 150 basis points. Reported operating margin increased 450 basis points year-over-year, which benefited from continued operating improvements and sales leverage as well as approximately $33 million reduction in adjusted items. ","Our adjusted tax rate was 25.9% at the low end of our prior full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 26% to 28%. Considering our adjusted tax rate through 9 months was 25.8%, we revised our full year tax guidance yesterday to a new range of 25% to 27%. ","Turning to cash. Operating cash flows through the first 9 months of 2019 increased $118 million versus prior year, driven by our earnings growth as well as improved working capital management. While we've demonstrated incremental progress in our working capital management, we expect to deliver more improvement over time and are confident in our ability to achieve our goals. A key enabler to truly embedding sustainable systemic improvement within our inventory and order cash processes will be implementing enterprise-wide systems and processes. It is a journey, but I am pleased with the results we've delivered thus far. ","At September 30, our cash balance was approximately $550 million or roughly $15 million higher than last year's third quarter [indiscernible]. This year-over-year improvement comes after approximately $140 million of certain third quarter cash expenditures. For example, during the quarter, we retired $75 million of debt, returned about $30 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, invested $19 million in capital expenditures, and contributed $14 million to our U.S. pension plan. ","Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are pleased with our strong results for the first 9 months of the year and expect solid performance again in the 2019 fourth quarter. As such, we increased the low end of our full year adjusted EPS target range by $0.10 and now expect between $2.15 and $2.20 per share for 2019. This range excludes approximately 2019 realignment and transformation expense of approximately $50 million as well as global line foreign currency FX and the impact of potential discrete items, which may occur. We also increased our reported EPS range between $1.85 and $1.90 per share. ","We expect these results based upon full year revenue growth of approximately 2.5% to 3.5%, including increased full year headwinds now expected from currency of approximately 2.5% and roughly 0.5% due to last year's business divestitures. ","Turning to our expected cash usage in the fourth quarter. Following year-to-date debt payments of $105 million and pension contribution of $20 million through the first 9 months, we have already met our commitment in these areas and do not expect any further payments this year. We do anticipate returning approximately $35 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases. And we'll continue to invest in our business through capital expenditures during the fourth quarter, although we have reduced our full year expected spend to $75 million to $85 million as we remain disciplined in our approach. ","Now let me turn it back to Scott for his closing remarks.","Robert Rowe","Thanks, Lee. I'd like to wrap up by spending a few minutes on outlook and the progress of our efforts. As our guidance indicates, we expect to finish 2019 on a strong note. We are confident in our ability to deliver to the new guidance range, which represents adjusted EPS growth of over 20% year-over-year and nearly 60% better than 2017, my first year at Flowserve. ","Year-end 2019 will also mark the halfway point of our multiyear Flowserve 2.0 transformation journey. I am extremely encouraged by the progress we have made to date, but even more optimistic about the opportunities that remain in front of us. We have made significant investments to drive cultural and enterprise changes and our employees have truly risen to challenge, embrace the changes, and they continue to drive results. I am impressed and encouraged by the level of excitement and the progress that we are making within our global operations. ","To maintain the momentum, we will continue to have a dedicated transformation team throughout 2020. I expect significant progress in 2020 with our operational initiatives, while continuing to focus on growing the company. We are laying the manufacturing foundation to significantly improve our deliverability of products and dramatically reduce our cost to produce. We are well on the way to fully transforming Flowserve, and I look forward to continuing to deliver increased value to our employees, our customers and our shareholders as we continue the transformation journey. ","Operator, we have now concluded our prepared comments. I would now like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Joe Giordano .","Joseph Giordano","So good quarter and I see the stock down more than the industrial sector. So I'm assuming that a lot of that has to do with really negative short-cycle comments we've heard from other companies over the last couple of days, today as well. But our sense is that there's just this -- there's this belief that orders next year have faced this real cliff. So I know you guys have been very kind of dogmatic about making sure what you say publicly is something you're very comfortable delivering on. But as we stand today looking forward, is order growth of like flat to up next year? Like, is that within the realm of realistic possibilities? I think that's a major thing that people are struggling with right now.","Robert Rowe","Yes. Well, I'll start with a very short answer, and I'll give the commentary to it. I think it is absolutely something that we can do. And if we had to pick today, and we're in the middle of our budget process right now, but if we had to pick today, I'd say Flowserve grows in the bookings range -- or in bookings next year and grows over 2019. ","So I'll just give some of the color there, right? I mean there's no doubt, we are in a challenging and uncertain market environment. But when we look at 2019, I mean we've made incredible progress, right? Our original equipment and our project bookings are up 16% on a constant currency basis. We've been able to grow the overall aftermarket by 5%. But we're also dealing with this North American upstream correction that's impacting the valve business and clearly hurting us on that distribution channel and driving some adverse mix there. And then you look geopolitically, we've got uncertainty at almost -- not going to say at all-time high, but it is certainly at a high level, where you've got Europe with Brexit and some of the Spanish stuff going on. You got U.S.-China trade, you've got Middle Eastern tensions and then you've got the Latin America stuff as well. ","But I think when we think about 2020, I'd say the best way to characterize it is we think we're going to grow, but we don't think we can grow at the rate that we grow in 2019. And so I would just say it's a growing environment, but it's decelerated from where we are now. But we still think 2020 is a growth year. ","And so when you look at our project pipeline or our funnel, we've got good opportunities in refining, petrochemical and LNG. We just moved -- we moved to our full force CRM almost 1.5 years ago so now we've got good visibility to that. And I'll say our 12-month funnel has come down in the last kind of 4 to 6 months, but it hasn't come down significantly. It's only come down a little bit or very modestly. So we still feel good about the project funnel. ","On the aftermarket side, we must continue to grow that. We've got to continue to capitalize on the installed base. And then within the transformation, right, we've got 2 major initiatives around growth, and one is commercial intensity. Basically, that's making sure that we get our entitlement on the installed base and basically defining our playbook to capture that installed base and working with our customers. And then the other one's strike zone. And in strike zone, we've had tremendous wins. We booked over $100 million on pipeline awards. We expect pipeline to continue into 2020. We do have other strike zone initiatives as well. So as those kind of play through, we've got the ability to take market share and grow with that. ","And so again, I feel reasonably good about our ability to grow. I just don't think it will be at the rate that we grew in 2019.","Joseph Giordano","That's really helpful commentary there. Lee, you mentioned cash, and that's been a really nice improvement there for you guys for a couple of quarters now. How much of this is still you guys manually doing the work every day, which -- and how -- where are you kind of in that systematic journey?","Lee Eckert","Thanks, Joe. I think we're making significant progress. It's still obviously a manual effort, but there are a number of, I would say, capabilities that are coming online. The one I'm particularly excited about, for the first time, we're launching, I'll say, a new tool where I can see roughly 90% of my invoices in one system. So as you know, we've got over 40 ERPs. And so we basically launched in the last month, a new tool that now give us access to our customers and other invoices averaging across our business. So now we have a tool. Now we got to execute and use it. And so we launched change management and training sessions so people can understand what's there and how to date them on and figure out what's past due and how to collect. ","In addition, we're continuing to move collections efforts to our shared services operation in Hungary, and that also is driving more efficiency. Scott, you want to talk about inventory at all?","Robert Rowe","Yes. On the inventory side, again, it's not a perfect world, but I'd say probably the best way to describe it is, both on AR and inventory. We've driven a significant process change, and now we're in kind of the process adherence phase and then the next phase will be automation. While we've got some tools that are starting to automate and give us better visibility, I feel very good that we are using different process that's going to absolutely drive results, and we're getting procedure adherence now around the world. And so I think this is an area we've made really good progress. And I would say we can continue to make progress as we're adhering to process and we start to automate more and more.","Joseph Giordano","If I could just sneak in one last quick one. I mean given the short-cycle weakness that we've already seen hit FCD on the distribution side, if that accelerates, if there's more of weakness and those markets get worse, how much of the -- how much margin do you think you can neutralize at this point? You've already had a lot of the impact. If we see volume decline further, can you offset that negative impact?","Robert Rowe","Let me just kind of set the scene for everybody on that. And I'm going to talk probably more about our ability to get orders, then I'll go to margins. But -- so basically, our valves business is about 40% through distribution. And a big chunk of that is in North America. And so what's happened with the upstream side of the business with the upstream pulling back, we've got distributors that have carry -- and these are -- I'm talking about destocking distributors that carry our valves in the upstream side and the downstream side. And so basically, as they get the signals where rig count comes down and production and completions start to come off, they really begin to clamp down on their inventory levels. ","And so we saw that really start in Q2 and then in earnest in Q3. Now that destocking though actually has decelerated. And then what we need is, if the environment stays the same, then our business actually has some tailwind because they've got to order product to deliver that. And so I actually feel okay that I don't see this another step down unless activity in North America took a dramatic change to even worse. And I don't think anybody's predicting that. I think most people are saying that 2020 will be similar to the activity that we're in now. And if that's the case, I actually would get a little bit of a tailwind in terms of bookings for FCD. Let's just say that, that doesn't happen and things get worse. I would say that the valve business or FCD is taking the appropriate cost actions within North America, and that the facilities that deliver product there. And we would continue to do that. And so the team is well versed on the levers to drive cost control. We'll continue to pull those as the market goes down. But I would just say, I don't see that as a likely scenario. I actually see flat to slight growth in the MRO business of FCD.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Scott, so just following up on your comment about expecting overall order growth in 2020. Again, not to tease up too much, but how much incremental visibility do you have from your project pipeline versus your own initiatives? You did suggest that your funnel has come down, but maybe you can comment on your conviction on the conversion of funnel that you're seeing today versus your internal estimates. And how additive has strike zone in commercial intensity into bookings now and expected in 2020?","Robert Rowe","Yes. So no doubt, the funnel has come down again slightly, it hasn't come down dramatically. But I just think as we kind of mature with the transformation and our process adherence, one of the things that we're trying to do is develop playbooks and develop competency in all of our functions. And I've actually been really, really impressed in kind of the last 2 years of how our commercial teams and our operations teams are working together. And what I'd say is we're still kind of middle innings on that, and we still have significant opportunity to do better sales and operational planning. Do a better job at reducing our lead times, do a better job of driving costs down, do a better job of getting the right products in front of the right people. And so I just say there's still a lot of self-help that we can do here. We track wins and losses, we track these opportunities. I'd just say, unfortunately, that list is far longer than I wish it were. And there's -- every quarter, we've got things where we go, \"Gosh, if we've just done some things a little bit differently, we could capitalize on that.\"","So the project -- so back to the question, right? The project funnel still looks good. It's a huge number out there. I still believe we can drive market share wins. And if you combine those two together, we feel comfortable in our ability to grow in 2020.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Great. And sort of a related question, the sort of feedback around FCD margin in terms of its sort of pullback here in Q4 as possible. If I step back and just think about the mix issue that you have now and that you could have as OE continues to ramp up in FPD, how easy can you offset that mix headwind as you go into 2020 with these initiatives? You've talked a lot about lean. What kind of impact are you already having in the business from lean?","Robert Rowe","Yes. No. It's a really good question. I think the headwind is real, right? And so just go back to what I said on we've got OE bookings that have grown 16% constant currency. Our aftermarket is growing at 5%. And so by definition, we've got higher margins in aftermarkets than our OE business. And with those -- the verge in growth rate, it absolutely puts pressure on the margin. What we've got to do is offset that with the things that we're in the transformation, with supply chain savings, the value engineering the manufacturing productivity, lean and all that stuff. And so I think thus far, we've done a really good job of that. So even with the mix changes, we're still continuing to be able to drive margins, certainly on the upside. And then FCD has gotten hit a little bit harder with the -- that mix change. But I think we still have a huge opportunity set in the transformation. In my prepared remarks, I said we're about 50% complete with that. As we turn into the second half of transformation, a lot of the initiatives around operations and driving costs down and which will ultimately help us on margin side.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh.","John Walsh","So I just wanted to touch a little bit again on capital allocation and kind of the forward look. I think you said in the prepared remarks, $35 million to return in Q4. Kind of given where your dividend sits, that seems like we're going to see some more share repurchase, which is something we hadn't seen in a while. If I caught that comment correct?","Robert Rowe","Yes. I'll let Lee -- let's go ahead, Lee.","Lee Eckert","Yes. John, that is correct. We bought about 100,000 shares in the third quarter. And our goal is basically to offset some of the dilution that's happening with our long-term incentive plan. So that's the main focus as we were looking at the share count. And we wanted to normalize a little bit for some of the dilution that's been taking place.","John Walsh","Got you. Okay. And then I guess maybe, Scott, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on [indiscernible] costs? Obviously, last couple of quarters, you've gone out selectively in certain product categories to get price. Kind of an update on what you're seeing there.","Robert Rowe","Yes. So just as a reminder, we did 2 pretty significant price increases in 2019. One was at the beginning of the year, and then one kind of in the end of Q1. And I feel reasonably good about our ability to stay on the positive side with this. But obviously with FPD margins pressures, we've got to do more there. And so we're -- we continue to relook our pricing. We will put another annualized increase at the end of this year. And what I'd say is it's a combination of tariff and inflation. And so we've got to make sure that we offset that. And so part of the transformation is a pricing work stream and bringing that analytical rigor to how we price and how we think about pricing. So I think we'll continue to do good things there. ","And then kind of the project side of that, we are seeing, I'd say, a little bit more discipline on the pump pricing. And so as pump providers and the bigger ones that provide the project stuff, I think everyone's getting a touch more disciplined. I'm not going to say we're getting unbelievable discipline in pricing, but I do think it's improved with the capacity levels coming up. ","And then where I say the concern still is, is on the valve side. And so the engineered valve side in particular, is just area, that price is not where it needs to be. And so we're focused on that, but we're probably more focused on how do we take cost out to make sure that we're not eroding too much margin there. But overall, I feel reasonably good at our ability to get price. We've been able to move it up this year. And we'll do -- we'll be pretty aggressive at the end of the year and the first part of 2020 on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray.","Deane Dray","Lots of good color. If you just step back a year ago plus, as to what issues you were addressing on the call, you're now -- it's just getting to be such a more refined story, and you're really pushing the team. And you can hear it in the cadence of both the answers, but also on the outlook. And on that point, I was really interested in you say--","Robert Rowe","Definitely. It definitely feels better, Deane. There's no doubt about that.","Deane Dray","All right. Good. So I love hearing the fact that you do kind of a post mortem on business lost. And in reference to the answer on the valve pricing, when you look at like a Pareto chart of the business that you've missed, is it price? Is it product specs? Is it delivery? Just where do the biggest issues on what has to change?","Robert Rowe","Yes. I don't want to give a road map to our competitors. So I'm going to be a little careful on the answer here but I would say it's a little bit of everything. But the ones that frustrate me are the self-induced ones, right? Where we're not communicating or we didn't do the right thing or we over-spec something that our products at a higher cost than it needed to be to our competitor. Or we do got super conservative on lead times, and we weren't able to deliver on that. But I would say the list, unfortunately again, is longer than we would like, and there's lots of reasons there. Our focus, though, is to mitigate the ones that we can control and making sure that we've got tight correspondence and cooperation between our sales and our operations team. And just by doing that, Deane, we've got pretty significant opportunities. And so we're going to keep working that. And again, as we mature with our playbooks and moving through the Flowserve people I know, I have no doubt that we continue to make progress in our ability to capture more market share as we go forward.","Deane Dray","That's really helpful. And like a year ago, there was lots of consternation about past due backlog, and that doesn't seem to be an issue anymore. Is that all been put to bed?","Robert Rowe","Yes. We're never satisfied, right? And I'll say, we're not delivering on time 100% of the time, but it is not the issue that it was when I came to Flowserve. And so the operational teams are doing a really good job. We're definitely focused on our deliverabilities. But I would say, like there's more work to do there, right? And so as we kind of get better at on time deliveries, and we shipped our focus to lead times and making sure that we'd be even more competitive on lead times than we are today. But in terms of talking about it on an earnings call, past due backlog is not a topic for discussion, but it's always something that we're going to work on to continue to get better at Flowserve.","Deane Dray","All right. That's good to hear. And just last topic for me, I wanted to go back to one of Joe's questions about destocking. And this really has to be one of the most overused terms that we've heard companies talking about or blaming the short-cycle pressure that they're seeing. To us, when we hear destock, it means the sell-in to the distributors is less than the sell-through. And this typically can't happen for multiple quarters. If it does, there's usually a falloff in demand. But your answer really was calibrated where you're looking at the sell in versus sell through. So if you just clarify, for this quarter, do you think that has been at a stage where they have to replenish and what kind of volumes might you see out of this replenishment?","Robert Rowe","Yes. So Q3 was definitely down for us through the distribution channel. And I'm speaking predominantly on the valve business. And so there's no doubt that there's destocking in the third quarter. And to your point, that can't continue in a reasonably stable environment. And so we think at some point, we start to get more orders. And I would say we are getting orders from our stocking distributors. They're just not as high as we've seen before, and they're significantly down from even the early run rates in 2019 or certainly on the year-over-year comparisons. But I think if you go -- think about the North American activity, and if we've got stability in terms of production completions in both the gas and the oil side, then that's going to be a little bit of a tailwind for us, hopefully in kind of a Q1, Q2 time frame in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones.","Adam Farley","This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. Turning to midstream. I know it's strike zone focus for you guys. I think you guys mentioned a pretty nice project award there. Could you provide any color on how that market is doing? Are you seeing any deceleration in projects or any projects getting pushed to the right?","Robert Rowe","Yes. No. It's a really good question because at some point, you're not going to keep spending the capital that they are. But we've got good visibility into kind of Q4 and early 2020 on this. So I feel reasonably good about our ability to continue to get midstream work, both the pipeline side and the storage side. And what I'd say is we're starting to win the work with our entire portfolio. So you're really bearing the power of the pure-play, leveraging the efficiency technology that we have with the pump side. And this is a space that we really weren't in before. And so we're absolutely taking market share. But we feel very good about our ability to do that and win work and I would say expect more works for us. But I'm not na\u00efve to think that this does slow down at some point. But I would say for the next 6 months, we still see pretty significant opportunities in pipeline. And then I think you're going to see some storage build out and kind of -- if you go one more step downstream, you start to see some capital spending there. ","And then the other thing I'd add is we hadn't really focused on the midstream side globally. We are more -- the initiative on strike zone is very much a North American-focused initiative. We're now starting to migrate that around the world. And again, I think we're looking pretty good for some midstream pipeline awards globally here as well.","Adam Farley","Okay. That's helpful. And then just shifting to your water business and specifically, desalination. I know it's a small part of the business portfolio. Obviously, it's not tied to the energy markets. Maybe just some color on how you view the business. What are the opportunity sets there? Just any color would be great.","Robert Rowe","Sure. Yes. So we had a press release about a week ago on two [indiscernible] awards in the Middle East, the Taweelah and the Rabigh project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And so for us, desalination is a nice market and where we have the technology is in the pump side. And so our efficiencies allow operators to keep their energy costs down, which is the largest cost of doing desalination. And so we got some preferred technology there, and it works real nicely. What we're trying to do is do more of a pure-play opportunity with desalination. And so we've got pressure exchange technology. We've got valve technology. And what we want to do is ultimately start to put more products and services around desalination. But as you know, water and particularly drinking water is a huge issue for the entire globe. And we feel very good about the outlook with desalination projects. And so where we're going to keep working hard, this is one of our strike zone initiatives, and we'll keep working hard to win more than our share on desal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Linzey.","Brett Linzey","I just wanted to come back to the pump combination of the two segments. It sounds like you've made some very good cost traction on all of those initiatives. What did you realize from a savings standpoint year-to-date? And how much more savings do you think you can bring out of that as we look into 2020?","Robert Rowe","Okay. So I missed the one part. You said on a savings standpoint?","Brett Linzey","Correct. Just cost.","Robert Rowe","Yes. Okay. Yes. No. I'll just start. The reason we brought the pumps together really wasn't the cost side. It was more about the customer. And so what we're seeing now is a concerted front with our pump team, talking to customers properly and really balancing the supply and the demand more appropriately than we were. And so I'd just say with the two different platforms, we did not have the collaboration and the cooperation as you would expect from 2 entities even within the same company. So that's now completely changed, and that team is working incredibly well together. We are definitely seeing cost savings, right? So there's no doubt, right? We have one team versus two, and so we got immediate SG&A savings there. And I'd say probably the bigger prize will be kind of in 2020 and beyond as we really start to rationalize more of the engineering function and more of the footprint to operate. And so I think we've definitely captured savings, but I'd say there's more savings that will drive gross margin expansion here as we look into the future.","Brett Linzey","Are you able to quantify what you're targeting there for 2020?","Robert Rowe","No. I really don't want to do that in particular. We'll come out with guidance as we always do at the end of the fourth quarter. And then we'll talk about what 2020 looks like from a margin perspective.","Brett Linzey","Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. Good to see a positive free cash flow here in Q3. Conversion is still running a little bit light, I think about 50% as a percent of adjusted net income. In terms of the 75% conversion target for the year, any change in that thinking, though?","Lee Eckert","Brett, this is Lee. No. We are -- we still have a line of sight to the 75% that I communicated earlier in the year, and that's what we're working to. Just in general, there's a significant more focus on cash and the importance in cash. And so this is a metric that we look at very closely, and we still feel good at 75%.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Robert Rowe","All righty. Well, we really appreciate everybody joining us today. And certainly, if you have follow-up questions, don't hesitate to call Mike Mullin or myself. And we look forward to seeing you at some investor conferences in the weeks and months ahead, and thank you all again.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jay Roueche, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.","John Roueche","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating today in Flowserve\u2019s 2016 first quarter earnings call.","Joining me this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Karyn Ovelmen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the call to your questions. And as a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available.","Please be aware our earnings materials do, in this call will, include non-GAAP measures. Please review the reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to our reported results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which can be found in both our press release and the earnings presentation.","Please also note that this call and our associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management as of April 29, 2016.

Flowserve's first quarter results were largely as expected and in line with our cautious outlook discussed on last quarter's call. I will cover a few highlights then Karyn will take you to through our financials in detail.","Let me begin by stating that despite the current challenging macro environment, we remain on pace for the year with our adjusted EPS of $0.39, which included the increased seasonality impact that we expected as well as approximately $0.07 of distinct expenses in the SG&A line.","Our adjusted operating margin fell to below 10% for the first time in a while and included the 140 basis points impact from the distinct SG&A expenses. This margin performance demonstrates that cost efforts lag in a declining revenue environment. And the loss of fixed cost leverage results in increased under absorption in addition to the normal detrimentals.","We do, however, expect our margin profile to improve for the full year particularly in the back half, as a result of the expected increase in volume as implied in our full-year revenue guidance, as well as the building cost savings from our realignment in integration efforts. In the current market environment, we are focused on controlling what we can.","As we previously discussed, we are taking aggressive action through the acceleration of our planned structural cost initiatives to optimize our global manufacturing presence as well as adjusting to current levels of customer capital spending.","Considering the size of our overall investment in this program, let me review some of our efforts. To begin, to simplify the tracking of our realignment programs, we have now combined our 350 million accelerated manufacturing optimization strategy announced last quarter in a nearly complete 50 million SIHI realignment effort into a single initiative.","So we will now refer to 400 million investment expected to generate 230 million in annualized cost reductions once completed at the end of 2017. We made solid progress on a realignment initiatives in 2015 and continued this trend in the first quarter. Well some disruption and delays were expected in pursuit of a program of the size, I am pleased with the focus demonstrated by our employees to minimize customer impact and to deliver on Flowserve's commitment.","During the first quarter, we achieved approximately 16 million of realignment savings compared to our year ago cost structure. And, we remain on track for the plant full-year 2016 savings of 125 million.","Some of the major developments of the program include to-date, we have notified 13 plants of our intent to close, downsize, sell, or repurpose those facilities. Nine were notified last year, with two of the smaller once completed in 2015. And the others expected to be expected to be completed later this year.","This year we have also notified four additional plants including beginning discussions with the appropriate parties on the proposed closure of a French facility and our plan to relocate those capabilities to other Flowserve facilities.","The closure of the U.S. plant whose capabilities will be moved to our Pasadena, Texas location, with expanded manufacturing capabilities, and synergy benefits. Consolidation of two Chinese facilities into one, to generate cost reductions and to leverage capabilities in our newer, Suzhou location.","And early in the second quarter we announced the plant closure of the former SIHI Colombian location whose capabilities will be moved to other facilities in Latin America. As you can hear, since the initiation of our realignment efforts, we have addressed numerous facilities and aggressively focused on aligning SG&A to current market conditions.","We also recognize that these decisions affect our people. And therefore are never easy. So each action we take is thoughtfully and carefully considered. Our facilities however, are not the only area affected. As we also continue to delay or simplify and upgrade, Flowserve's leadership organization, which include some non-realignment severance expenses.","While it takes time to take these costs out, largely due to the regions where most of the actions are occurring, we are proceeding with a sense of urgency. At the completion of our 400 million program, we ultimately expect a 15% to 20% reduction in our global workforce relative to early 2015 levels. ","All in, these actions will help Flowserve to become leaner and more streamlined organization enabling us to expand our competitive advantages and ensure our ongoing leadership role within our industry.","Turning now to the current market and bookings within our served industries. The recent increases in and stability of crude oil prices is generally a positive development for our markets. But macro uncertainty continues to impact our customers spending patterns particularly, as it relates to decisions concerning and the timing of capital investments.","However, we fully expect a longer-term growth patterns, in our served industries to continue to rise. The world's population , urbanization trends and the resulting demand for energy of all types, all demonstrate a solid growth forecast and give us confidence if Flowserve is targeting the right markets.","We are increasingly encouraged by the improved aftermarket activity, we saw towards the end of the first quarter. And we believe that our core aftermarket activities of parts, services, and repairs are stabilizing at these levels as our markets return to their regular maintenance schedules, we expect to benefit.","Now, looking at our served end markets and bookings trends. While the market challenges of 2015 persist with many of our customers tightly managing their budgets, we are generally pleased with our book-to-bill of almost 1 and holding backlog at year-end levels.","Project bidding activity has picked up as of late in some areas and after a slow start to the year March bookings demonstrated improvement. We do, however, continue to expect project opportunities to remain limited and competitive.","So we will remain disciplined in our pursuit. Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 8% year-over-year. Primarily reflecting lower project awards.","Sequentially, however, our bookings declined only 4%, which is significantly better than the typical sequential decline, we experience in a first quarter. We are encouraged by essentially flat constant currency aftermarket bookings as compared to both last year's first and fourth quarters.","Demonstrating the resiliency we expect in our core aftermarket franchise. Project awards were down significantly year-over-year and particularly in IPD. But partially offsetting this were some of the benefits, we've delivered from our commercial initiatives and activities that we have discussed.","Our view remains that the maintenance deferral environment, we've experienced since early last year provides a building opportunity. Since much of this work cannot be pushed indefinitely. We also expect that the longer delays and deferrals will result in a greater level of work required when facilities are actually brought down.","While we did see some of our customers that deferred in 2015, move forward in the first quarter, we continue to expect some 2016 plan takedowns to defer until next year. Large project opportunities remain limited. Although we have seen some pockets of improved bidding activity. However, we expect that those progressing will see an extended timeline to final investment decision and the bidding environment will be competitive.","Looking at specific end markets, we delivered solid growth in power bookings, which were offset by lower oil and gas bookings and to a lesser extent chemical declines. Power bookings increased nearly 19% on a constant currency basis driven by strong combined cycle investment in North America and elsewhere. In addition to meaningful desalination project wins. This quarter, we benefited from our ability to successfully shift certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers.","In our general industry segment, constant currency bookings increased 3% on strong pulp and paper activity in FCD including Greenfield projects in emerging regions and capacity monetization of existing facilities. TI also benefited from some progress in IPD's distributor initiatives. To utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets.","Broadly speaking, we believe destocking has largely occurred and distributors are now maintaining inventory at lower levels. And ultimately we expect restocking to be a tailwind.","Oil and gas markets generally remained under significant pressure. However pockets of bidding activity continue in the Gulf Coast region particularly as it relates to L&G export facilities. These LNG projects are at various phases and approval stages. With some developers pursuing offtake sales agreements before moving forward.","Refining maintenance spend appears to have stabilized and we expect some improvement in the second half of 2016. Middle East activity has slowed in the last few quarters, following its relative outperformance in 2015 particularly in the first half of last year. Chemical markets continue to be impacted by project delays on new as in crackers even as they are supported by low cost feedstock in North America and the Middle East.","And a downstream derivative facilities are also being slowed. Similar to our refining customers, maintenance deferral appeared to have stabilized. And we are now beginning to see some benefit from part spend on new facilities brought online in the last several years. To wrap up, our outlook for the remainder of this year is one of expected market stability.","Our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations and we began to see signs of improvement in certain markets. We expect limited project activity and for those progressing, increased price competition.","We are pleased with the early results on some of our growth initiatives and the progress in our industrial activities. This together with Flowserve's proven track record of navigating challenging conditions, and reacting quickly on the cost front while maintaining financial flexibility, and a disciplined focus on investing for the long-term profitable growth, gives us confidence in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.","Let me now turn the call over to Karyn.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks Mark. As we highlighted first quarter results kept us on phase for their full-year expectations outlined in February. We discussed at the time that our 2016 first quarter would be challenged beyond our normal seasonality due to industry headwinds experienced in the 2015 fourth-quarter which continued into the first months of the quarter.","First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 was driven by a solid level of shipments and continued operational performance. Our adjusted results included approximately $0.07 of distinct SG&A expenses primarily related to accelerated non-cash SG&A accruals in the quarter from modifications to new long-term incentive plan grants.","We also saw negative currency translation of approximately $0.03. Following our announced definition, adjusted EPS excluded $0.07 of realignment expense, $0.02 of negative below the line currency effects, and $0.01 of CE purchase price accounting and integration charges.","Adjusted SG&A expenses appear elevated during the first quarter, but we do not believe this represents a trend. First we are including the 13.1 million of distinct SG&A expenses, primarily related to the non-cash accruals I mentioned, which will not recur in the remaining quarters this year.","We also had some non-realignment severance in the quarter as we look to upgrade certain roles there is also a timing related impact associated with our cost reduction efforts where we've identified current savings but they haven't been fully realized in the quarter.","As Mark discussed many of our actions are in high-cost regions and will take longer to achieve. So, as the year progresses, we expect our adjusted SG&A percentage to be below the 24% we saw in the first quarter.","Turning to margins, first quarter adjusted gross margins were 33.3%, which excluded realignment charges of 7.2 million. Gross margins were negatively impacted by lower volumes increased under absorption and a beginning backlog that reflected the pricing environment of work booked in 2015.","Adjusted operating margin of 9.4% excludes 13.5 million of realignment and 1.3 million of CE purchase price accounting and integration charges. If we further excluded the distinct corporate expenses adjusted operating margin would improve to 10.8%.","Our IPD segment was particularly effective this quarter. A sales decline of nearly 12% with many of its facilities in high cost regions increased our under absorption. We are attacking this headwind, however, through our realignment initiatives. We also saw about 4 million of non-comparable cost this quarter.","Finally, while we continue to be pleased with SIHI\u2019s revenue and gross margin profile, incorporating it\u2019s business performance into IPD was dilutive to the segments operating margins this quarter as reducing SIHI\u2019s SG&A has been pursued methodically and will be more back half weighted.","Our first quarter tax rate of approximately 31.6% was slightly above our full-year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a constant currency basis our bookings in the first quarter declined 7.8% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially.","Constant currency original equipment bookings declined 14.6% as customers continue to delay and defer capital project. And as previously mentioned aftermarket bookings were essentially flat. Regionally we saw a good constant currency growth of 11.5% in Asia-Pacific and a modest 1.4% increase in the still struggling Latin American region. Middle East and Africa experience the largest drop both in terms of dollars and percentage while North America and Europe were down single-digit percentages.","First quarter sales of 947 million were down 6.6% or 2.1% excluding negative currency effects, primarily on strong EPD OE shipments, constant currency aftermarket sales were flat. By geography, we saw significant sales improvement of nearly 35% in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting solid bookings there in 2015. In North America and Europe both declined single-digit percentages while Latin America and Asia Pacific sales declined above 10% on an FX neutral basis.","We've discussed some highlights of our realignment actions and noted the combination of our manufacturing optimization program with the SIHI realignment efforts to simplify reporting.","To be clear, the overall size of our program has not changed versus last quarter. To cover some numbers, since initiation of our realignment efforts in early 2015, we have expensed approximately 130 million, including the 2016 first quarter charge, 13.5 million.","For full-year 2016, we expect total charges of approximately $160 million with the chief savings of approximately $125 million, including approximately $16 million achieved in the first quarter. In total, we expect our $400 million investment to drive total savings of $195 million in 2017 before achieving full annualized program savings of $230 million in 2018.","Turning to cash flow, first quarter operating cash flow improved $85 billion as compared to a year ago. Free cash flow increased roughly $150 million or over $1 per share further benefitting from $64 million of reduced CapEx. Our realignment program used approximately $24 million of our cash during the first quarter and we also return $23.4 million to shareholders through dividends.","Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance, we are reaffirming our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share following the first quarter's inline performance. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 of above the line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. We also expect the second half weighting of our earnings to be more pronounced in 2016.","As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI, and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items.","We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will decline compared to the elevated 2015 level when we increase manufacturing capacity in Asia-Pacific and purchased a license enabling increased aftermarket opportunities. We expect cash expenditures associated with our realignment program of approximately $150 million during the year. We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs, even as the US plan is largely fully funded.","With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay.","John Roueche","Thank you, Karyn. Operator, we've now concluded our prepared remarks, and would like to begin the question-and-answer period at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mike Halloran","Hi, good morning, everyone. So first could you give us some more context around the improvement you saw in the March order rates. Do you think it's a sign that maybe outside the oil and gas space in particular there's a little less fear maybe more willingness to bring CapEx back to the market. Was the trend more than normal seasonality, so just a little more color around that improvement please?","Mark Blinn","Yes, we always see a little pickup in the month of March. Mike, if you remember, mid February, look what happened in the markets and in the price of oil, there was just a complete lack of visibility at the first part of the year. So you typically see a trend up in March as particularly in some of the emerging parts of the world that get their budgets approved and everything. But for us, we saw a kind of not back to what I\u2019d say normal levels but certainly some improvement particularly on the aftermarket side and I've seen it continue into April as well.","So I would say it was stabilization reflecting kind of the current market environment. What we saw towards the end of the year last year and really in the first six weeks of this year, was something more can to what you saw in 2009 in parts. And there was not a lot of visibility.","So process operations have to continue to run and as long as things are flowing through and they have to do that, but there are still times when people kind of stop and wait and see and we saw that in 2009 and we saw it really the last month of the end of last year and first six to eight weeks of this year's as well.","So we're keeping an eye on it. As I made in my comments, you have seen oil certainly stabilize. Remember at the beginning of the year as they were concerned about oversupply, lack of storage and demand destruction in China. So some of those things have certainly abated. You see the price kind of stabilize. It will still move around. But as this occurs than people can kind of get back to life, so to speak.","Mike Halloran","So then when you think about growth and the return of growth, aftermarket starting to become a little bit more normalized for you may be even starting to improve sequentially. Some of that deferment starts -- at least dissipating a little bit, the OE site is starting to stabilize.","So from here to get growth in 2017 what would you need to see different or just a continuation of the trend, may be just talk about some of those dynamics. ","Mark Blinn","As we kind of think of growth in really the three areas we talk about on the aftermarket, it is going to be the pent-up demand being released and not further demand being pushed out. And we talked about that a little bit, but some of that coming back online and then executing on our aftermarket strategies. Keeping in mind that over the last seven to eight years the growth that we've seen has not been -- it's been market driven to a certain extent, but more so around our strategies.","When you look at the run rate business, I think there's a couple of things to that. Executing our industrial strategies we did see some good improvement and some traction in Q1 versus where we were last year.","So executing our distribution, focusing on our channels market, our e-commerce to try growth in that business, also some brownfield activity. If you look at it may be some destocking has for the most part occurred. Maybe there's stock levels that come in and a little more activity around brownfield both direct and through our distribution channel.","And I think the last piece Mike that what we need to keep an eye on is the larger project activity. While typically the lowest margin business that's something that can move your topline the most, what we've seen is projects -- there are some projects that are still out there, some that we had an opportunity to bid on in Q1. We just didn't like the terms and conditions. But they're out there. It's really keeping an eye on what's going on the drawing board.","In terms of next year that may be come to bid. That's where we're still trying to get some visibility. And I wouldn't have expected that to snap back after what we went through in the last six months. But that's what we need to keep an eye on is, are they going to put some of these projects on the drawing board and start to work them up. ","Mike Halloran","Thanks for the time, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys. Mark, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the bookings in the quarter from the standpoint of specifically in power in general industries where's the power stream coming from. I know you cited the line cycle U.S. market is improving, maybe China nuclear is improving, maybe Gulf.","But are you trying to signal that those end markets are getting better here and are you also seeing a bit of inflection in the general industry business. I know it's a hodgepodge of businesses that you mention pulp and paper. Are you seeing better sort of environment for general industry as well quick ","Mark Blinn","I think in the power it is the combined cycle some of the other project. I mean you've seen over the last couple of years power has been challenging relatively flat. Now you're seeing investment go forward. And if you look behind all this, we talk about this oftentimes the secular drivers, I mean people need more power there's not a sufficient amount of power. The infrastructure is aged.","So you know these things will kind of come back around. It's been kind of soft over the last couple of years, but you've started to see some investment generally combined cycle in the U.S. with the focus on fossil fuels and also in emerging parts of the world.","In the general industry there's certainly been some self-help around our focus on our distribution channel. That typically is reported in our general industry segment. Also as you saw a couple of years ago there was investment in the agricultural industry. Pulp and paper is kind of having its moment right now. So these things do tend to cycle through and come around.","In general what you'll see the G.I. is going to track the distribution channel and then also certain other markets as well that will tend to see investment from time to time. But the way I look at that is what strategies are we executing around our industrial side and also in our distribution channel.","And as for the other parts of our business, the chemical side certainly we see investment opportunities as you saw back in 2010 after a market decline. So you'll see investment. The one we've got to watch as the big projects on the oil and gas side.","Tom Pajonas","I would add maybe a little bit to what Mark said. In addition to combined cycle, you have a little bit more I would say push going on with renewable, solar by a mass, waste or energy, so that we\u2019re starting to see just some turning, turn there slightly, and I also I would tell China Nuclear, there is plans for a defined build up over the China nuclear over the next several years and even though the coal market is going through a transition, that may spur a lot of carbon sequestration projects as they look for clean coal opportunities going forward.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it, okay. That's helpful. Can you talk about aggregation of your saving initiatives. I think you reiterated your targets but you recognized only 50 million in savings in the first quarter. Your target is still 125, but I think that for \u201916, but I think that includes CG now.","So concerned should be savings could be pushed to the right or little more into '17 and given by the reason to get cost down its compete in a more difficult pricing environment, how concerned are you guys that margins could get a little worse before it gets better?","Mark Blinn","Well if you look at it a lot of these costs are in the high-cost regions and in a particularly in Europe and it does take time to get those cost out. And so you see times when you are ahead of expectations and behind expectation. At this part of the year, sitting in April, we are still confident that we are going to be able to drive a lot of these costs out or get them teed up to drive them out during the course of this year as we talked about.","But certainly in the first quarter you saw the lack of fixed cost leverage particularly in the G&A line, and a lot of that is just that it takes time to drive it out of the business. But for the specifics Karyn?","Karyn Ovelmen","Let me give you a little more granularity around how this will flow through. So 400 cost approximately 80% of that relates to closures or capacity reductions and that will represent about half of those run rate savings. And then the headcount reductions which really are less than one year type paybacks that's about 20% of that overall cost and about half of those savings.","So Q1, just to roll through here Q1, 13 million, 50% of that cost of sales, 50% of that SG&A, we expect that ratio to kind of range between 50% to 60% as we go through into cost of sales and 40% to 50% SG&A.","So, as we indicated in our comment previously inception to date expenses about 130 million of that remaining 270 million about 55% to 60% and for the remainder of 2016 and the rest will be in 2017. So it will continue and expect that split between cost of sales and SG&A.","The year-to-date savings in 2016, about 16 million and we expect that savings to increase over 2016, so definitely waited heavy in the back half of the year. The run rate savings we expected to be around 230 million by the end of 2017 or early 2018 and expect savings of a little bit more than half that amount in 2016, 130 million and that's all growing to about 85% to 90% in 2017.","Mark Blinn","And so Andy, one other thing to keep in mind the cost of sales oftentimes those savings will take the cost out but they'll be capitalized in the project. So in terms of when hits a P&L.","But I think the bottom line on this, this is an absolute priority for us. This is very significant. We think it's going to really position us very well for the future so we have a lot of resources on this. So that we can achieve the commitments that we talked to you about.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Mark Blinn","Hi, Nathan, How are you?","Nathan Jones","Good. Thanks. So this is about as bullish as I've heard you in a couple of years Mark. So I guess, even potentially a little bullish here on a large project business. Can you talk about maybe what your customers are telling you in terms of their plans to bring some of those things back to market what you're seeing in terms of behavior from your competitors on pricing. Just your general outlook on that going forward?","Mark Blinn","Well you tend to be encouraged when you see some stabilization after the last six months that we been through. Or actually the last what 15 months that we been through. I'm certainly not calling the ball that good times are here like they were certainly two, three years ago or more particularly in 2008.","But we are encouraged by the stabilization, and I think I'm also encouraged it's always good when you see some of the initiatives that you have start to take hold, particular in our distribution and industrial segment.","I think Nathan when we were together we talked about that a little bit. But I do want to make it clear on the project side as I mentioned earlier, there is some activity. These things have been on the drawing board for a while. We expect them to be very competitive, we'll need to be selective because we definitely can compete we want to position ourselves to but we need to be disciplined.","I do want to express just my concern is with oil and gas the way its been, we just haven't seen things going on the drawing board that we want to see. They can come back online but that area we\u2019re still definitely cautious about. From a pricing standpoint on the projects, we expect that to be competitive. Look, we've taken that approach for the last nine months to a year plus, as we saw this market. This is why we\u2019re taking the aggressive action in our cost.","A big part of our cost reductions are in our custom engineered business which addresses these projects. We want to participate in these projects. That's what creates installed base, that's what gets you in front of your customers. But we know that we need to really drive costs out of our business so we can remain competitive not only in this environment, but we can drive good profitability as pricing improves in the projects. So that's kind of our outlook.","Generally, as you've seen with the integrated they\u2019re all focused, they continue to be focused on the dividend and they've gotten a little more I think tailwind to them. But they're focused on price as well so are we. Keep in mind, these projects are competitive, but if you look across the rest of our business we\u2019re turning to our supply base as well. So we're passing through a lot of that on the smaller business down to our supply base. ","Nathan Jones","And I know you mentioned we talked about this earlier in the year. I think it's one of the more interesting initiatives going on at Flowserve and I know you've got a new later in IPD. Can you may be give everybody a little bit more color on that growing distribution for IPD initiative what progress has been made, what kind of opportunity you think that is?","Mark Blinn","We started to see progress this quarter. So I wouldn't necessarily claim victory on that. What you're seeing in IPD is it is shifting truly to an industrial business. If you thought about my prepared comments, year-over-year we saw a significant decline in projects large projects particularly in the oil and gas. So IPD kind of road the -- for many years the oil and gas coattails as it emerged out of the pump business a number of years ago.","But half of that decline was offset by traction in our industrial initiatives and also we\u2019ve been very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen from CE. The top line is held up well and the gross margin has as well. On the SG&A line, we've been very thoughtful in terms of what we do with that we\u2019ve been able to leverage it. Those costs will take time to get out.","So as we take a step back, and think about the products that we brought in there over the last couple of years, we were under utilizing our channels to market.","Both in a mag also we -- and we learned a lot from the SIHI acquisition. So from our standpoint we're encouraged with what we see, we need to grow that business we talked about that a couple of years ago. And that's what we see in the business. ","Nathan Jones","Is there any way to size the opportunity I mean you've talked about that being an unserved market for Flowserve. Can you size the market, can you size kind of what you're going out, going after in that market at all?","Mark Blinn","Market like the industrial market? ","Nathan Jones","Yes.","Mark Blinn","I mean it's -- it addresses the chemical industry. I mean there's multiple applications. I mean much more opportunity certainly in the chemical industry. For example, if you look at the vacuum pumps that SIHI has, they were primarily focused on the European market. So European market is good, but the Chinese market even the U.S. market is strong as well. So the opportunity is big. ","Tom Pajonas","And I would add Nathan to what Mark is saying is I mean the opportunity comes through distribution and the industrial side on the range of products. So increase the range of products that go in through the distribution side of the business. It's a regional play.","EMA was a very good stable growth on the distribution side, and it was because of the new territories that we started to look at in service to our distribution business, including Russia. And it's also a play on the strategy of matching what the customers need there to the type of distributor that you need in a particular territory. So it's a little sophistication on the distributor strategy in those areas, region, products and customer drivers.","Mark Blinn","Its early days on that, Nathan. There's other companies out there that have very good products, very good channels and do quite well and have high margins in their business. That's what we aspire too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Charlie Brady","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on IPD, can you just talk about \u2013 we\u2019re not getting I guess too specific, because you won't, the margin improvement to that business. I mean it took a pretty big hit on the margin Q1 relative to where that business has been and I guess a lot the absorption is hitting that.","But as you go through this year, do you get it back to a double-digit margin and it was again in the 2017, further improvement on that or is it \u2013 structurally it's going to be kind of a slower crawl back up to that.","Mark Blinn","Well, no, this isn\u2019t reflective structurally of that business. What you have in the IPD segment this quarter is a good portion of those discrete expenses were in that segment. And also you have the SG&A burden from SIHI which will drive those costs out in the back half of the year. So it's not really reflective.","Also, if you look year-over-year, the revenue decline, we need to get those SG&A costs out, part of those are in high cost. So there's a lot of things working. The revenue decline, the impact of the discrete SG&A items in the Q1 and as Karyn talked about those don't occur in the other quarters, and also the impact of SIHI. All of those things in a sense impacted margins during the quarter.","But if you look underneath in the business, the gross margins held in there fairly well. The underlying SIHI business was strong we were able to offset some of the significant oil and gas project declines, so that's really representative of how that business looks. We expected it to improve. ","Charlie Brady","Okay. And can you talk on a more macro sense in terms of competitors given the downdraft in some of \u2013 in oil and gas market in particular, are you seeing any different reactions from competitors, either positive or negative to Flowserve's business?","Mark Blinn","No. I mean, it's \u2013 where we see them mostly is going to be on the big project side and that is each competitors making decision for their own reasons as to how they're going to approach a project. It could be absorption; it could be a desire to get the installed base.","If you look particularly in some of our run rate business, it's \u2013 they\u2019re fairly large markets and the real issue there is making sure you\u2019re responsive to your customer, that you can give them the product that they want. What we do like is we have a broad array of products in our portfolio. And you've got to execute well on the channels.","What we found that we've struggled, particularly in our ITD segment, going back to 5, 6 years ago it's when we haven't really taken good care of the customer. So that's really the opportunity that we and our competitors look for and that's why we're so focused on these initiatives.","Charlie Brady","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","Hi, good morning, all. Mark, one comment. I really wish Karyn had a better handle on the numbers. I'm going to have to go back to the transcript to see what she said. I couldn't keep up. I put my pen down. So, very well done Karen.","I wanted to ask you a question about some of the dynamics of the bookings. In both flow control and particularly in EPD, there were some pretty rough and tumble organic booking numbers in the last four quarters and maybe if we start with EPD.","Despite that, we've had organic sales growth in each of the last two quarters and not organic sales growth in the last two quarters in flow control obviously down, but the degree of the bookings decline even there would suggest that really the next couple of quarters, we could see a pretty significant reversion in sales there. Is that the right way to look at it there? I mean it would seem that the booking -- that the shipments are going to have to catch up to the weak bookings at some point in both businesses.","Mark Blinn","In EPD what you've primarily seen is the big project activity. So, as we talked -- that's been the bulk of the decline. So, the underlying aftermarket business year-over-year and sequentially the sales were relatively stable but you saw the project activity that we booked in 2014, those compares across it.","On the FCD, it tends to be shorter cycle businesses and so you feel the impact of the bookings quicker, much quicker in terms of book-to-ship. So, I think if that's answering your question, I just want to make sure it is, that's typically what's driving it.","Scott Graham","Yes. It is in part, but it suggests to me that -- I mean if your sales guidance for the full year is down, seven to 14 and this quarter you were only down seven, it would suggest you guys are bracing for weak, slower year-over-year sales or weaker year-over-year sales declines in at least the next couple of quarters. That's when trying to understand.","Mark Blinn","Go ahead, Karyn.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks. So, I think as you go through the year, you have to look at first quarter and you have to look at it from the percent of revenues that we have in the first quarter.","And so going forward, you have to kind of wait that a bit. But expectation as we move through the year, we will have increased revenues in the latter part of the year. Seasonally that's what we've experienced in the past as well.","The key for us as we go forward, as you drive down through revenues, is looking at margins and looking how the realignment activities and under-absorption starts to improving the latter part of the year.","Mark Blinn","Part of what could help you if -- I'm sorry I'm struggling with your questions because I don't think I understand it, but if you look at the book-to-bill, often that can give you an indicator in a shorter cycle that will help you with the trend on subsequent quarters.","But clearly what you've seen is the book-to-bill in the OE and EPD segment has been impacted by the lack of projects. So, you see that reflect through in the revenue side. That formed a lot of the basis of our revenue guidance this year. Because last year's revenue had a lot of project activity that was booked in 2014.","Scott Graham","Okay. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is that it seems like there has been an improvement in that sort of great middle. Not the project, not the aftermarket, but in fact the book and ship business. That trend line seems to have improved and if it hasn't, then it would seem that the sales declines in at least engineered products, are going \u2013 you'll start to see sales declines in next three quarters in that business for sure. That's what I'm trying to get a handle on.","Mark Blinn","Yes. In the project side, we do expect that and as I said that forms the basis. But even if you look in the first quarter, the book-to-bill in the flow control division was slightly over one. Let's say roughly flat. That's a good sign of things how things are stabilizing can improve over the period, same thing in the industrial segment as it tends to be shorter cycle.","But if I'm answering your question right, a lot of the decline in our reflected in our guidance, is the project environment in 2014, the bidding activity in 2014 versus the bidding activity in 2015 and to a certain agreed the bidding activity we expect in 2016, because some of that goes through percentage of completion.","Scott Graham","Understood. Okay. Thank you. Second question is about the capital allocation policy. Last year you were pretty comfortably over what you've mandated yourselves at. I'm just kind of wondering does that kind of normalizing 2016 or can you stay above that 40% to 45% return. ","Karyn Ovelmen","Well, right now we haven't changed our guidance in terms of the 40% to 50%. As we talked about in terms of our capital allocation priorities, we always look internally and organic first. One of the things that we are very focused on is this restructuring. And that's where a lot of our cash will go to this year in terms of driving that.","So the priority is going to be our restructuring activities, our capital expenditures, which are anticipated to be more modest than last year, but still important growth capital expenditures and then we\u2019re still sticking to our 40% to 50%. No change there.","Scott Graham","That's what it meant 40 to 50. You're so far above that last year and now it will have to probably be tempered little bit more, because of some of the capital that has to go toward the restructuring is that what you're saying?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yes. In the past couple of years, what we do is when we fund our internal initiatives and our priorities, we've over the last couple of years have returned the access to our shareholders, which is very import. So to the extent where those are going to be more cash utilization on the important internal initiatives, the likelihood is that we\u2019ll stick to our guidance.","Scott Graham","That's very good. Thanks. Nice quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Chase Jacobson","Hi, good morning. Mark, I think you touched on it a little bit; I just want to make sure I understand this. But, understood the gross margin was a little bit lower this quarter because of the bookings in 2014 and clearly the pricing deteriorated throughout last year.","So, I guess the question is really how long do those longer cycle projects take to flow through the income statement and is 60% decremental gross margin what we should be expecting as we go throughout the year maybe into 2017 may be given how tough the pricing is been in the level of the OE bookings. ","Mark Blinn","Well, let's say all other things being equal and they aren't because of the restructuring, but let's just start generally with the way to think about it. First you look at the volumes. The volumes in 2015 in terms of project activity were lower than in 2014. The pricing environment in 2015 was more competitive than it was in 2014.","Not to the extent of what we saw in 2008 and 2009 because the pricing didn't get near those levels. So those things flowed through -- started flowing through the P&L and -- last year and are reflective in our compares. So you'll have absorption which you address with some of your restructuring activities and also the pricing environment which you also address with your restructuring activities. But that's working its way through. So the marginal impact or the incremental impact starts to abate because you don't have as much project activity sitting in backlog.","As we look forward in terms of the profile there. We do need to get at the absorption issue. So the cost savings will focus on addressing the pricing environment, and also the volume environment that we're in. And we're designing it to be very, very long-term.","The other thing that is you start looking at mix. If we start driving growth in the aftermarket business, start getting traction in the run rate business, then that can certainly support margins. Those are the levers and those are really the dynamics around our margin profile. But we've seen quite a bit of our project activity certainly from 2014 go through the P&L and we're posting 2015 now go through the P&L. There wasn\u2019t lot of project activity at the end of last year by the way. ","Chase Jacobson","Right, okay. And then Karyn can use clarify the accelerated SG&A expense at $13 million. Can you just talk about that again quickly and how much of that was in the guidance for the year? ","Karyn Ovelmen","Mainly it's LTI. The acceleration its in non-cash accrual. Its really related to a change in our retirement plan. So accounting convention within a change in employee retirement you have to actually pull that cost forward. So really it's essentially taking three years of cost and pulling it forward. So you'll see a modest decline in our amortization of that over the next 36 months. The majority of that sits in our corporate expense and then a portion of that is allocated down to the segments.","In terms of guidance, probably about -- I would say 50% of that was considered in our guidance and then real accounting adjustments were made in first quarter. ","Chase Jacobson","Okay and this becomes a tailwind to next your correct?","Karyn Ovelmen","Slight. It's modest over the next three years in terms of reduction in amortization. ","Mark Blinn","It takes -- what it does is it reduces its subsequent quarters it takes three years to kind of get the full cycle of this. So we will see this impact in Q1, but it will be less significant. But as Karyn talked about it is non-cash. ","Chase Jacobson","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry","Hey, everyone, good morning. I wanted to circle back to IPD for a second, you had mentioned being particularly significant price pressure there. Is that just really reflective of the segments historically higher EPC exposure at the projects? Or is there some other dynamic going on there and is that accelerating recently or has that been kind of the state of affairs there for a few quarters now?","Mark Blinn","So, Robert, I think you said IPD and we haven't seen \u2013 okay, no, we haven\u2019t seen the big price pressure in IPD, what we did see was the reduction in oil and gas project activity. So IPD has some project that can actually be repurposed for other processes as well. But they were able to line it to kind of the balance of the plant for some of these oil and gas larger products.","What we saw was a decline in the bookings activity and these were -- these aren\u2019t huge but there could be $250,000 and above. We saw a significant decline in that year-over-year. Offset by more penetration in some of our other industrial chemical applications and distribution. Where we seen the pricing competitiveness now for really about nine months to year, is in the EPD segment, a lot of it is in the OE portion of that where we seen the pricing impact. Those are the big large projects, millions of dollar projects that are competitively bid.","Robert Barry","Yes. That's what I was thinking actually and so when I saw in the release yesterday this mention that the project booking opportunities were challenged competitively priced particularly in IPD, it\u2019s down for me, but maybe it's competitively priced until you are walking away from it, the net result for you is just lower bookings.","Mark Blinn","Right. I think the comment about project opportunities competitively priced will apply to everything. But the fact is, it was more volume than anything else in IPD. Good questions on IPD, the point there is, we have an opportunity to take the products that we have, we've got a good product portfolio, and much better penetrate the market.","Is what happens when you get these large project activities is it all tend to tilt the entire organization to focus on those. We've made some changes not only in the leadership of IPD, but in our channel to market approach in terms of our sales organization, our distribution leadership to focus on this and we\u2019ve seen some traction.","Robert Barry","Got you.","Mark Blinn","So think of those as, we need to address markets better than we have before and that's what we intend on doing. ","Karyn Ovelmen","As market is indicated previously on the EPD side, in the IPD side, we also have had some projects that we could have taken but for some of the terms and conditions which were extremely onerous.","Robert Barry","Got you. Yes, just - thank you, that\u2019s helpful. One kind of big picture question, lots of discussion about moving capacity to low-cost countries. Not just that Flowserve but elsewhere too, so I was curious as you look at the company and across the industry, I mean to what extent do you think through this downturn and the restructuring and reaction to it, we are actually seeing a lot of capacity being, I guess, simply moved versus actually removed, or cut.","Mark Blinn","Now, that's a good question. This one is much more removed than moved than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Because what we're doing is closing facilities and consolidating that into some of our higher performing facilities even in the OECD countries.","So there's a lot of closures relative to what we seen before, but then, again, what we'll do is we may move the product into a lead product facility into a mature market and a lot of the work goes into a lower-cost facility in some of the emerging parts of the world.","But this is really designed to position the company long-term. In the industry, things we've been really had on the drawing board now for 2.5 years. We just accelerated it. ","Robert Barry","Got you. Okay. I'm in is clearly important because as we think about pricing tightening through the next cycle its obviously better if its being removed than just being moved in the cost lower, okay. Good. Would you say that the 15% to 20% reduction in workforce is kind of a good proxy for how much capacity you're taking out or do you have an estimate for that? ","Karyn Ovelmen","I think we've talked about a 30% of our physical capacity is getting taken out. So actually there's, there's more square footage in a sense then there is resources. And a lot of that is because we're, we're building engineering and engineering centers in India to handle higher volumes. What we're doing with the 30% takeout, what we don't want to do is not be able to address the markets when they become more robust.","So I think the way to think of it is even though we're taking the physical capacity out, I believe we'll be able to handle at\/or higher level of volumes then we been able to handle before. That's important we want to make sure that we can address our markets because we still believe in the underlying secular drivers in the business. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, this is Tristan for Joe today. Most of my questions have been answered. But I was wondering referred some of operators wanting to out for standardization instead of going cast installations in their designs. How would that affect your EPD segment? ","Mark Blinn","You're talking about going for standardization? Actually we welcome that. We work very closely with some of our large customers to drive that because what it helps us do, is to streamline our manufacturing process, our ability to support it from an aftermarket standpoint but more importantly turn to our supply chain and drive value through there.","Keep in mind, standardization does not mean commoditization, standardization means we develop a common and expected set of process conditions under which the equipment will operate. That actually helps us be more efficient. It also helps us get more of a share of the customer wallet as well because when you develop and can deliver the standard, it works well. I don't - - we don't look at that is favorably all we actually encourage it with our customers. ","Karyn Ovelmen","I would add, we've even gone as far as to put engineering talent in EPC facilities in order to drive that overall standardization strategy that they've been embarking on over the last couple of years. ","Unidentified Analyst","Nice this is helpful guys. That's all for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra of Jeffrey. Please go ahead.","Bhupender Bohra","Good morning guys. Question for Mark, you know Mark talked about the FCD bookings especially mentioned about the talking about the distribution channels and kind of mentioned the word restock here. Can you give us a sense of in your FCD I believe 40% of that business goes through distribution channel and just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing there on the restock? Thank you. ","Mark Blinn","We aren't seeing necessarily the restocking yet. What we talked about is we feel the destocking is abated and they're running just in time inventory. Now that\u2019s important, because for that channel to be able to be successful, you've got to be able to deliver in a timely and efficient manner.","And if you look at FCD's performance over the past couple years the fact that it has the margin profile that it does is reflective of their ability to respond to all customers needs particularly our distribution channel. Now what I did make the comments is when we see some restocking occur that should be a tailwind for us but we have not seen that yet.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay. Got it. And just a follow on, on the aftermarket activity can you just go through geographically like how that will look in terms of project versus aftermarket?","Mark Blinn","Well, what we\u2019ve talked about is that the base aftermarket business has shown some stabilization. What we haven't seen that we saw in prior years what we call the small aftermarket projects some of the efficiency initiatives that some of our customers do.","They are still holding onto that spend at this point in time but we're confident they'll do it because it actually improves the return on their operations but it's been pretty much stable what we seen across the board in terms of all the operations globally.","Karyn Ovelmen","Many of these projects that went in 2014 and in the beginning of 2015 are now going into a period where they need spares during the first two years worth of operation. So we are seeing some good activity relative to that in North America, Europe and Asia. Obviously, Latin America is down given the whole political situation there. So that looks, I would say that looks promising.","And we're also seeing in North America because of the deferrals of the maintenance we are seeing some emergency repairs start to kick in. Customers are coming in with very quick turnarounds, so that business is now seeing a little bit different, I would say driver in that business. And our EMA maintenance business in terms of upgrades on flood control, we mentioned desalinization and even the refineries are seeing some positive signs there.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We have reached the allotted time. Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference.

We appreciate you joining us today to discuss Flowserve Corporation's financial results for the second quarter of 2015. Joining me on the call this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Karyn Ovelmen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the call to your questions and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available later today.","Before turning the call over to Mark, I will note that we filed our Form 10-Q, issued a press release and prepared an earnings presentation for our second quarter 2015 results, which are all available on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","Additionally, please also be aware, our earnings material do and this call will include non-GAAP measures.

Flowserve delivered solid operating results in the 2015 second quarter, in light of the current business climate. As you know, the challenging markets we experienced earlier in the year extended into the second quarter, with broad-based capital spending declines, a strong U.S. dollar, low oil prices and heightened pricing pressure on new orders.","Headwinds in many of our emerging markets also increased last quarter, adding to the tough business environment. Although, there were some signs of reduced volatility in the quarter, with oil prices and currency trading in a tight range, overall market uncertainty continued.","Our outlook for the rest of 2015 has moderated with the assumption that current market conditions will persist. With this updated view in combination with our first half results, we've adjusted our revenue and earnings guidance.","Despite these challenges, Flowserve is performing well operationally and is navigating the current business environment. Although, customers remained deliberate and measured in the release of new orders and acceptance of finished goods, Flowserve's adjusted sequential bookings and sales increased by double digits, reflecting our normal seasonal increase.","On a year-over-year basis, our bookings, excluding SIHI were down roughly 15% on a constant currency basis. This was a tough compare period, since as you may recall, our bookings a year ago included a few mid and larger size projects, including our largest award in 2014, which together made last year\u2019s second quarter, our strongest booking period since 2008.","Our aftermarket franchise performed well despite continued maintenance deferrals in some of our markets, and lower parts and spares activity tied to new project orders. Many refining and chemical customers delayed upgrade projects and maintenance to take advantage of current strong profit periods. Even with these deferrals, our aftermarket bookings declined only 5% on a constant currency basis, demonstrating the resiliency of the MRO business.","While our adjusted gross and operating margins declined in the second quarter, as compared to the prior year, primarily as result of lower levels of activity and the currency impact, our operating platform remained solid.","The operating improvement we've implemented over the last few years in product quality, on-time delivery, customer responsiveness and manufacturing efficiency have taken hold, which allows us to focus on Flowserve's next evolution, permanent reductions in our cost structure.","As we announced on last quarter's call, we've accelerated our strategic manufacturing optimization and cost efficiency plans. These type of changes take careful planning and execution to ensure customers are not impacted and to comply with local requirements, but we are aggressively proceeding.","These structural changes will provide us increase flexibility to compete in the current market environment. It will further improve the efficiency of our operating platform and enhance our competitive position when conditions improve.","We are also meeting increased customer expectations through our ongoing efforts to improve our low cost sourcing and increasing our emerging region capabilities, which is where new capacity investment will be concentrated.","This greater geographic flexibility, when combined with our attractive and diverse end market exposures increases our ability to capture opportunity when it occurs. We've invested substantial capital in recent years, increasing our capabilities in emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil. These facilities have now built a track record of performance and are prepared to permanently take work from some of our higher cost facilities in developed geographies.","Turning now to our second quarter activity by regional market, excluding SIHI and currency, bookings were down in all regions, with the exception of the Middle East and Africa.","In North America, our largest end-market, bookings held up reasonably well considering the macro environment and we are down less than 1%, while sales were up modestly. Many of the headwinds I discussed earlier applied to North America, but with all of the infrastructure projects that are underway or in the planning stages opportunities do remain in the region.","Europe was a story of two extremes this quarter, bookings were down over 35%, but sales were up over 20%, as we work through that regions backlog. In last year second quarter, Europe had its largest booking quarter since 2008. So, this year's decline was against a tough compare, that included some of the mid and larger size projects, which we discussed a year ago.","Bookings in the Middle East and Africa region were up over 4% in the second quarter. Even as this region tends to be an oil and gas driven economy, the national oil companies operating there continue to demonstrate a somewhat consistent long-term approach to investment.","Asia-Pacific was down double-digit percentages in both bookings and sales, reflecting slower growth in some major countries and increased price competition from local market participants.","Latin America remains a very challenge region, with political and financial headwinds in a few of the larger countries, which means it could get worse in the near-term. As a result, bookings and sales were both down in the region this quarter.","We remain encouraged by future opportunities in Mexico as a result of the anticipated foreign investment in the oil and gas sector, and we believe that in the long-term this region will return to growth.","While we are responding to current market conditions it is important to also keep a long-term view. When we look at the big picture, we expect that our served industries will return to growth in the long-term. In fact, end-user demand for electricity, refine products and chemicals is increasing, while existing infrastructure continues to age.","Therefore, even as we take permanent actions to improve our cost structure and operating platform, which will further our competitiveness, we remain very focused on growth and future opportunities within our markets.","Last quarter, I mentioned some of our initiatives, including expansion in targeted end-market, such as Asia Power and chemical, as well as our strategies to better align our selling practices with our customers buying preferences, through key accounts, expanded distribution sales and product bundling. Together, these efforts should enhance our opportunities in any market condition.","Driving greater value through our aftermarket platform remains a growth priority. As our products become increasingly complex and in-house maintenance crews near retirement, we believe the value proposition from our aftermarket services will only increase.","As in prior cycles, we continue to make disciplined investments to expand our local presence and target a greater capture of our global installed base. These investments include new QRCs but primarily encompass initiatives to increase capabilities within the existing footprint to leverage our full installed base and to increase synergies by combining facilities where it makes sense.","We are encouraged by the opportunities created from the SIHI acquisition. And we will continue to evaluate other growth initiatives as well as pursue opportunities to optimize within our existing portfolio to drive long-term profitable growth and shareholder value.","Inorganic investments that meet our standards, provide opportunities to leverage our global scale and improve the utilization of our manufacturing and QRC footprint. And private sellers appear to be slowly adjusting their valuation expectations. All of our activities around our portfolio are evaluated using disciplined return requirements with a focus on shareholders, including our commitment to an efficient capital allocation and structure.","Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, there are mixed signs. The second quarter stability in currency levels in oil prices was a positive start although volatility returned to the commodity in July.","The continued high level of utilization of our customer\u2019s facilities combined with the recent deferrals support higher levels of maintenance and repair work in future periods. This type of activity cannot be delayed indefinitely. But the timing is difficult to predict. Additionally, the current level of asset utilization will also tend to support our run rate OE work as customers focus on the efficiency of their facilities and associated upgrades. The challenges to our outlook are primarily fewer expected project opportunities in the near-term with increased price competition in headwinds in emerging regions.","We believe our experience in similar market conditions combined with the aggressive proactive measures we\u2019re taking will position Flowserve for success. Although we have moderated our outlook for this year and have taken a cautious outlook regarding any near-term market recovery, I remain confident in our business model, our strategy and most importantly our people taken together, we're focused on delivering value for both our customers and shareholders as we position Flowserve for the future.","Lastly, I would like to welcome Karyn Ovelmen, our new CFO, to this firm. You will be hearing from her shortly. But I will note that she has hit the ground running during her first two months. And I look forward to Karen's leadership and contributions as we go forward to drive long-term shareholder value while navigating near-term market challenges.","But first, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Pajonas","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. As Mark highlighted, market conditions remain challenging. We\u2019re reasonably pleased in this type of an environment that our book to bill this quarter was close to one, excluding SIHI at 0.97. This helped ensure that our organic backlog remained intact and was even up modestly year-over-year on a constant currency basis, which provide support to our revised 2015 outlook.","Longer term, we continue to believe in the growth opportunities within our industry as the fundamental drivers for the infrastructure business has not fundamentally changed. To respond to the current market, however, and to position Flowserve for the future, we announced last quarter that we're accelerating our planned long-term manufacturing optimization strategies.","These actions are permanent structural changes that will close capacity or reposition activity in many of our existing higher cost developed region facilities while leveraging our significant investments made and our enhanced capabilities in lower-cost emerging markets. As part of this initiative, we will also make greater use of third-party suppliers to reduce our fixed cost structure.","Since that announcement, we have made notable progress towards our goals. This effort will not be a quick or easy transformation but we are moving forward with a sense of urgency.","We also implemented a cost efficiency initiative to reduce our headcount expense structure to align with the current business environment. Together we are targeting roughly $100 million of investment which we expect would generate at least $70 million in annualized savings, once we implement all of our actions in mid -to-later 2016.","In the second quarter, we recognized $24.7 million of realignment charges for these initiatives and expect to execute on most of the remaining actions by year end. Despite these significant changes, our employees have remained focused during this busy period, continuing to deliver on our commitments to our customers. Our on-time delivery metrics, past-due backlog of 4%, and second quarter\u2019s solid margin performance together demonstrated continued efforts and culture of execution.","Looking at the booking environment, the lower-level project opportunities we saw in the first half of 2015 has increased competitive pressure on the business that is available in the market. Customers are seeking greater value from their investment dollar. This conversation typically initiates as our pricing discussion and our initiatives to drive our cost will help respond to this request.","However, we are also demonstrating how Flowserve can support their goals with our unique value proposition beyond price alone. By leveraging our global reach and comprehensive flow control portfolio, we can deliver value to our customers through product bundling, certifying lower cost facilities and collaborating earlier and project design work. We believe this approach is consistent with our focus on leveraging the underlying strength of our platform in driving profitable growth.","From an aftermarket standpoint, we delivered constant currency bookings that were down only 5%, excluding SIHI, which showed signs of resiliency we generally expect. The first quarter labor strikes that affected many U.S. refining and chemical customers have largely ended, which is a positive development.","However, in addition to managing their capital budgets tightly, strong margins of some of these customers are currently producing resulted in continued deferrals of maintenance work to later periods. So that they can capitalize on current period of profitability. Given the combination of these takedown deferrals, lower upgrade opportunities and fewer parts and spares tied to new units, we do expect continued headwinds in our aftermarket business for the remainder of the year.","The good news is this delayed work was not lost. It just represents a future opportunity. Even with the expected near-term challenges to our aftermarket business, we view this franchise as a solid resilient foundation. We continue to invest in and execute on our strategies to increase our aftermarket capture.","Key to this effort is increasing our ability to support clients possessing our installed base as well as assisting in their broader reliability and maintenance opportunities. At the same time, with further identifying pockets of installed base, increasing our localization efforts, including new QRCs, enhancing the capabilities of some of our existing facilities and consolidating all those where appropriate.","Growing our aftermarket franchise remains a top priority and opportunity for Flowserve. Looking at the end markets during the second quarter on a constant currency basis and excluding SIHI for a clean comparison, we have long gas bookings declined roughly 24%. This industry is experiencing both highs and lows.","Offstream customers are suffering from low oil prices. However, the mid and downstream assets remain highly utilized as the demand for the finished product remains strong. Both service predominately mid and downstream supplier of these customer\u2019s efforts to maximize current period profits and delay new work where possible certainly affected us.","Looking at a couple of oil and gas regions, Latin America remain challenged as Mark mentioned. Latin America as a whole got worse as Petrobras works through their issues and resets budgets. And Venezuela\u2019s financial crisis constrains Petrovesa's activity. In Middle East and Africa, proposal activity has remained solid, which supports the thesis that this region would take a longer-term view towards continued investment.","With strong end-user demand from the mid and downstream markets, we believe investment activity as well as maintenance and repair opportunity is building. We will remain on the horizon near-term as we do not forecast a meaningful pickup in the second half of 2015 beyond our normal seasonal patterns.","In the chemical market, second quarter bookings decreased by almost 17% versus a strong compare in 2014. We continue to expect ethylene expansion in North America with derivative plants related to the new capacity expected to come online over the next two years as well as a number of new projects in various preconstruction stages.","Similar to our refining customers, chemical margins are also currently solid for our customers. And while the economic support continued investment, timing is always difficult to forecast. Regionally Middle East and North American chemical expansion remains a solid opportunity ahead. Early in 2015, we increased our chemical presence substantially with the acquisition of SIHI. The integration of SIHI is going well and we remained pleased with the opportunities created from this acquisition.","In the power market, our bookings increased 11.6% versus prior year's quarter. In the U.S. coal retirements and low-cost natural gas are careless for combined cycle plants since expected electricity demand is increasing. Asia continues to invest in fossil based plants and our local capabilities in the region improves our competitiveness for this work. China's new nuclear plans were the first since 2011, creating an opportunity for incremental work.","Flowserve has provided nuclear products for reactors worldwide and our capabilities and end stamp certifications are differentiating factors in a market where safety is critical. In addition to China, Russia and South Korea see continued development in nuclear power and Europe is discussing new capacity in some regions as well.","If India approves limits to nuclear supplier liability, that region could also potentially be a meaningful catalyst for Flowserve\u2019s nuclear work. Following the new safety standards, Japan is getting closer to restarting a portion of its nuclear capacity, which has been idle since 2011.","Bookings in our general industry markets were down a combined 12.8% in the second quarter as increased agricultural bookings and flattish food-to-beverage awards were more than offset by declines in our other markets in this segment. For the distribution channel, de-stocking continued and these customers were slow to restock.","Like deferred maintenance, these orders will return in the future. But in the interim, our customers maintain a cautious approach. We have increased our focus on this channel with the new leader, additional resources and a fresh strategic direction.","Wrapping up my prepared comments, while near-term uncertainty continues to impact many of our customers in end markets, Flowserve will remain focused on what we can control, including increased aftermarket capture, operational excellence, targeted growth initiatives, product development and realignment of our global manufacturing base.","We continue to believe in the long-term drivers of growth in our key energy markets and are confident that the actions we are taking will better position Flowserve when our customers resume their growth investments.","With that overview, let me now turn it over it to Karyn.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to joining the call today. My first as Flowserve\u2019s CFO. From my time, thus far with the company, I am excited about the opportunities ahead and I believe we are well-positioned to continue to progress the company\u2019s made over recent years to further drive value for our customers and shareholders.","Following Mark and Tom's reviews let me now focus on the financial highlights. Following our challenging first quarter, we were pleased with some stability in the second quarter, which enabled sequential constant currency increases in bookings and revenues of 11.3% and 15.6% respectively, excluding SIHI.","Q2 2015 sales of almost $1.2 billion increased 4.8% on a constant currency basis and included $77 million from SIHI. Excluding SIHI, sales were down 1.5% compared to last year on a constant currency basis.","Turning to margins. Excluding the $14.3 million charges related to our strategic realignment initiatives and impact of SIHI, adjusted gross margins were 34.5%, down approximately 60 basis points from a year ago. Our focus on tight cost control was again demonstrated this quarter. Excluding the effect of SIHI and realignment, SG&A dollars decreased year-over-year by over $30 million, reflecting our alignment with shareholders and the ability to flex to current market conditions.","Turning to our adjusted operating margins. The year-over-year decline is largely volume related. Adjusted operating margins were approximately 40 basis points lower than a year ago, but still solid at 15.5%. Our second quarter tax rate of approximately 29% is in line with our guidance of 30% to 31%.","Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.80 includes $0.06 per share of negative currency translations and excludes $0.24 per share of adjusted items comprised of $0.13 of realignment, $0.10 of net SIHI dilution and a penny of below the line currency impact. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.56.","Turning to cash flows. Operating cash flow improved about 52%, compared to the 2014 second quarter. Free cash flow also improved despite an increased level of CapEx spending and represented approximately $0.60 per share. As I mentioned, our capital expenditures for the quarter were up versus prior year, as we continue to invest organically to grow our business.","In total, we invested almost $30 million in capital expenditures during the period, as we made disciplined investments in our business, including increasing our aftermarket strategies and emerging market capabilities to support long-term growth. Similar to prior periods of slower end market activity, we will continue to pursue organic growth initiatives within our business.","Returning capital to shareholders also remains a key priority for Flowserve and in the first half of the year, we returned over $185 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Approximately, $325 million remained available under our current share repurchase plan authorization at quarter end. And we remain committed to our financial policies with regards to returning capital to shareholders.","Primary working capital as a percentage of our trailing 12-months sales improved modestly to 26.5% versus 29.6% a year ago excluding SIHI. With regards to 2015 outlook and EPS guidance, as the company evaluated its prior guidance, we balance the current market conditions against the second quarter\u2019s relative stability in currencies, the price of oil and in our challenging market.","We took into account our first half results, with an expectation for further delays and deferrals in the second half, which resulted in Flowserve revising its 2015 full year adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect 2015 adjusted EPS between $3.10 and $3.40, on revenues that are down between 10% and 15%.","Currency changes are a major year-over-year factor in our guidance. And as we indicated previously, a roughly 10% FX headwind on revenues impacts EPS by around $0.40. Consistent with our previous approach, our guidance excludes both SIHI\u2019s revenues and its expected $0.25 per share net dilution for the year.","Our adjusted EPS range also excludes the expense of our $100 million realignment plan below the line currency impacts, as well as other specific one-time events, such as the first quarter's Venezuelan remeasurement. Our guidance also suggests that 2015 will reflect our traditional seasonality with earnings more weighted to the second half of the year. SIHI has been performing in line with our expectations and is expected to follow a similar seasonal trend.","Finally, we still expect capital expenditures in the $170 million to $180 million range for 2015. At this level, we will continue to position our business to grow organically and profitably by improving our capabilities around the world.","Before turning the call back to Jay, I would like to mention that I am very much looking forward to meeting with many of you over the coming months. Although in the near-term, Flowserve faces challenging markets. Over the longer term, the fundamentals remain very strong.","Our diversified end markets, comprehensive product portfolio and geographic exposures, coupled with our growth initiatives and cost reductions, positions us very well today and into the future. I look forward to discussing with all of our stakeholders Flowserve's competitive positioning and our continued focus on creating meaningful shareholder value. Jay?","Jay Roueche","Thanks, Karyn. Operator, we have concluded our prepared remarks. We would now like to begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","Hey. Good morning.","Mark Blinn","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Graham","And welcome, Karen. I really only have two questions for you. Tom, it sounds to me like you are pulling forward the benefits of the restructuring tag to be about $70 million. Is that a fair way to read your comments?","Mark Blinn","I mean, I would say if you look at the $100 million of the cost and the $70 million of benefit, we are trying to execute that as soon as possible. A lot of is going to -- like we said in the mid to later part of 2016. We will, however, try to maximize that as much as possible. But it\u2019s going to take a direction because some of these initiatives are pretty complicated.","Scott Graham","Understood. Second question is really I think equally as simple and maybe more for you, Mark. The push outs of the deferrals affecting the aftermarket and your services and what have you, obviously those things do have to happen at some point. But you are saying I think you are saying implied in your guidance is that you are not expecting them in the second half of the year.","Is there some type of catalyst? Is there a trigger that you guys are watching here that is okay at time? Is it oil at may be a little bit higher level to hurt those refining margins and to take them off line, because obviously oil at a higher level helps you in one way, potentially down the line but certainly hurts you on a more near-term basis in the other way. Is it the price of oil? Is it the price of ethylene? What are some of the triggers, Mark?","Mark Blinn","Well, it\u2019s primarily going to be the spread between what they can retail and what they can acquire the crude product and that\u2019s gapped out quite a bit. If you\u2019ve been to the pump recently, it hasn\u2019t fully reflected what you\u2019ve seen occur at the price per barrel of oil. So, that'll tend to -- refiners kind of like a bond. They are going to generate as much cash as they can for long as they can. But in no instance will they put the refinery in harms way. So, I'm not -- didn't push it out. And typically these are scheduled take downs, regular scheduled maintenance. So they can push them out for a period time.","I think the best thing to do is -- they make some commentary. I think some of the refiners were talking about turnarounds and expense in the beginning of next year. So, both typically talk about that because they communicate this as a positive. They said, look, we are making a lot of money. We are going to run these things flat out for a period of time. But it depends on a customer-by-customer basis, but typically these are scheduled take downs.","So, I\u2019m not suggesting -- they are putting these things in harms way, but they do need to eventually, efficiencies will start to get impacted and they do have increased risk if they run them for too long. We saw this back in 2009, but if you remember, we will move back up fairly quickly in that block, that deferred maintenance back in. Oil has been down for a fairly sustained period of time compared to six years ago.","Scott Graham","That is exactly what I was alluding to. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin Maczka","Thanks, good morning.","Mark Blinn","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Maczka","Mark, a question on the OEM side as we look out to the back half of the year and into 2016, and I know you are guiding 2016 yet. But I'm just wondering how concerned we should be about that because as I have understood it, Flowserve demand comes somewhat in the middle of in cases of a multi-year construction project.","So things that have been underway maybe are continuing on, but at some point we are going to start to burn backlog and maybe new projects just won't be there because we are reading about the additional $200 billion in oil and gas CapEx cuts coming. So can you just talk about your view and how we should be thinking about the OEM side out into \u201816?","Mark Blinn","Yeah. As we typically talk about, let\u2019s talk about these large projects versus run rate because large projects have been a smaller portion of our overall business. Here\u2019s probably the way to think about it. There will always be projects out there, almost at any price of the underlying commodity because of aging infrastructure. There is a whole set of needs around energy independence, trying to capture more of the verticals, which is what they are doing in the Middle East. A whole host of things that will drive investment and a lot of that is, some of the long-term drivers in our business. Really there is going to be more demand as you look over the horizon. So that\u2019s a general backdrop in terms of the way you think about global capacity.","The fact that the multinationals have been rationalizing CapEx now, I think we\u2019re into the seventh quarter. So on more shorter-term what the industry needs to do is see for example an oil and gas, a price of a barrel of oil that they can start making investment decisions around. And what I mean by that is, certain investments will occur obviously at a 100 and certain investments will occur at 50. And what they are looking for at this point in time is to see where it\u2019s going to settle out and start making those investment decisions as you look in terms of really new project opportunities. So, that\u2019s probably way to think about it.","And there is always -- there is a typically a trade-off as oil has gone down. As the feedstock, as natural gas has become more readily available, it does bring other investment in another area, in the chemical industry and in the combined cycle power industry. So it isn\u2019t again once size fits all. But what they need to see and this is why we talk about volatility. They need to see certainly per barrel of oil, particularly on the upstream side. They are going to need to see some level of stability that they can start making investment decisions around, keeping in mind that even if you look at the US upstream production on the fracking, which we are not involved in, technology has brought a lot of that cost to production down. So it\u2019s not like the industry stands still.","A long answer to question. Now on the other OEM as we talked about more of our run rate business, that tends to be more stable. And as Tom mentioned in his comments, those are some of the areas, particularly in the industrial segment where we think we have a lot of opportunity to grow our business through some of the initiatives that we are driving and that SIHI is a good example of that. Those are good products that are fairly stable on almost any market and we need to start leveraging those on our platforms and also some of the internal development opportunities. So that segment for us really represents a good opportunity going forward.","Kevin Maczka","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I can just ask a follow-up on price. I am just wondering if you can compare and contrast what you saw in the last downturn to what you are seeing now or what you think you will see over the next few quarters, because last downturn price was an issue and we were for many quarters, shipping low price, low margin backlog. How do you compare and contrast this one?","Mark Blinn","Well, in short, we\u2019re a completely different company than during the last downturn. But let me try to lay some things out for you. Headwinds we are facing relative to the last downturn is the pricing environment and the projects and there were more of them was significantly better in '08. You can actually take a step back and say there is probably 300 to 400 basis points of margin that doesn\u2019t exist in this cycle that existed in the last cycle, as we wound through that backlog because the pricing environment was so strong on these projects if you look at it.","The other thing that represents a headwind and we overcome a lot of those two things is if you look at the currency, the dollar in effect relative to where we\u2019re in the last downturn is about 30% stronger, which impacts our financials and we have more international business. For those two things, I think relative to the last downturn are representing headwind when you\u2019re looking at compares. You saw though that we have lived through that lower cost backlog during the period of end of 2010 and 2011.","What\u2019s different is simply put I talked about being the better company. One example is, we\u2019ve reduced our cost of core quality by well over 300 basis points. Those are permanent changes in our business. Our aftermarket backlog and capabilities were significantly better. We have more run rate product, more run rate penetration in our business. We are less relying on this big project. We also if you look forward relative to last period, we have the more opportunity to make some structural cost changes in our business. Keep in mind when we came out of the last cycle, we didn\u2019t have significant amount of low cost manufacturing capacity in this market. These things are up and running and qualified and represent now an opportunity to migrate long-term some of the capabilities over to these facilities. So that\u2019s a high level compare. Honestly, this is a very long discussion in terms of what\u2019s different, but we are much better positioned.","Kevin Maczka","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Mark Blinn","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","I was hoping to get some more color on two of the initiatives that you called out that sound particularly interesting. The first is on product bundling. You all are in a unique position within the flow sector of having important positions both in pumps and valves and seals. But what we haven't seen a lot in the way of bundling initiatives in the market so what might be new there? And then I've got a follow-up question regarding the capabilities to the QRCs.","Mark Blinn","Well, just one example to allude to without naming specifics is the lot of the multinationals have started seven quarters ago thinking about their cost structure and then doing so turn to suppliers and said help us drive efficiency through the entire supply chain. And one of the ways that we can do that is to bring all of our product opportunities to the customer, work with them ahead of time, design specs, enter into frame agreements which we have done and in doing that bring our full capabilities to their capacity needs going forward.","So doing that, what does is that gives us scale in terms of the relationship, scale in terms of our supply base. It also gives them a benefit as well because they know the products that they are going to get, what the expectations are in terms of quality and delivery. That\u2019s one example that you can do it. Another one is more traditional is, if you look at a project opportunities or whatever maybe, typically you had some of our engineered product, but we would also bring some of our industrial product for balance of plan. So that\u2019s typically occurred as well.","Deane Dray","And on the QRC, what types of capabilities are you looking to add and are there QRCs today that have the enhanced capabilities you are trying to model after, or is this new territory?","Mark Blinn","Well, I think I have made this point before. If you look at, part of it is your aftermarket capabilities, the QRCs being just one of them. And we are fairly developed in the Gulf Coast region. What I mean by that is we have QRCs that can support bumps, valves and seals in the QRC itself, some that support -- may support one or more of those products. We have field tax, service tax, a lot of boots on the ground there. The opportunities we look for other concentrations, a processing capacity around the world is to create the same thing in regions in Brazil, certain in Malaysia and China as well.","So the QRCs, the significance of that is it does provide the ability to respond very quickly relatively to the piece of the equipment and that\u2019s going to correlate to size. As you can imagine one of these large pumps were not going to have QRCs deployed around the world to handle those because you need cranage and it\u2019s going to take time to move it anyway. But some of the smaller pieces of equipment, you can pull and move fairly quickly to some of these facilities. So we look at the QRCs relative to what the needs are. Some of them are sealed QRCs and they are right close to the customer.","Deane Dray","Thank you. And just last question for me would be for Karyn. And I was hoping she could -- you could share some of your initial thoughts on where you are focusing for starters and then maybe address some opportunities in working capital and cash conversion.","Karyn Ovelmen","Sure. So I have been here two months and this is a very successful company that is running extremely well. There is an existing leadership team that\u2019s seasoned in-depth industry expertise and has weathered these cycles before and then of course Mark brought in a lot of new talent in a lot of different areas. So it\u2019s a company that I think is very, very well positioned. My focus will be on adding to all the capabilities that are here, looking at the efficiencies, cost reductions, where can we push that in other areas as well as on the growth side of the equation in terms of what markets we want to look at both organically and inorganically. So that\u2019s where my focus will be.","I worked in many of Flowserve\u2019s end markets from oil refining, chemicals, plastics. This is a very customer focused company, on-time delivery, quality, performance culture. So that the company is doing very well within that regard and my hope is to continue that and add to that.","In terms of working capital, I do believe that remains an opportunity for the company. There is a lot of effort and time and some success in those areas. Clearly the quarter showed some good progress on adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales. However with only two months, I do need to dig deeper and fully understand the puts and takes related to DSOs and turns and personally conclude where our targets should be going forward and where we can look at that from both receivables, inventories and payable perspective. So that will be an area that we continue to focus on and I will be looking at that in depth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Mark Blinn","Hi, Robert.","Robert Barry","I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on how broadly the pricing pressure is impacting the business. Is it focused on oil and gas or elsewhere and is it impacting the aftermarket?","Mark Blinn","Not an impact on the aftermarket. Those tend to be smaller activities, fairly stable in terms of the margin profile. Where you see the most competition is going to be in the oil and gas from some of the larger projects. And as expected in the Middle East, we saw this before and it\u2019s typical in our industry that oil and gas in the Middle East is very, very competitive.","Robert Barry","Got you, okay. So it\u2019s mostly oil and gas, not in some of the other end markets? Got you. And then could you comment on the performance of the OE book and turn business in the quarter?","Mark Blinn","You mean the book, the shorter time to OE. I mean, it was little less than expected so that was part of the reason that we kind of trended that out during the remainder of the year. We saw quite a bit of a pause for lack of a better term in the first quarter and saw some of that abate during the second quarter, but still I think people are looking at the budgets in terms of some of the smaller and upgrade projects. So we had certainly our share, but it was less than we expected going into the year. Coming out of the first quarter, we just needed to start seeing some stability there.","But clearly, what I can tell you is what we did see stability within kind of our base aftermarket business, the traditional repair work. What we haven\u2019t seen come back in the aftermarket and even some of the OE upgrades are going to be those upgrades and certainly what we call spares tied to new projects because there isn\u2019t a lot of new project activity.","So those are being in the sense kind of the puts or takes, where we also see an opportunity, and I mentioned this earlier. Remember, our focus in our industrial segment really for four years has been getting the operating performance to where we needed to be, it\u2019s there. And now what we need to do is grow that business.","So a lot of our initiatives around distribution, around e-commerce, around how we organize our sales force, around the products that we offer and bring into the portfolio like SIHI are driven around that industrial product segment. We think that really represent a good opportunity for us, because if you think across our portfolio, the engineered businesses in general, the big OE projects are very, very subject to market conditions. But the industrial products, you really can with our broad product portfolio penetrate many markets in many type of environments.","Tom Pajonas","I would just add to that. Well, the market wasn\u2019t substantially changed towards the back and the Q1 going into Q2. I mean, we were able to both on the OE and on the aftermarket side sequentially increase those bookings. And even though some of that maybe seasonal, it still was at least a good sign that we did have an increase from Q1 to Q2 in both of those areas.","Robert Barry","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. And good morning, everyone.","Mark Blinn","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So, Mark, I wanted to touch on those comments that you gave earlier fully recognizing you guys are a different company this cycle than last cycle. But on the OE side of things, things were pretty good last cycle and pricing was good as well. Just curious on just your OE bookings, what kind of magnitude are you looking at in terms of potential pricing declines in that business today?","Mark Blinn","Well, relative to the last period when we came to the last cycle, is that your question?","Joe Ritchie","I think more generally, just when I think about this cycle versus last cycle, it seems like capacity isn't as tight leading into this downturn. And so I'm just curious on the pricing concessions that you are having to give on the OE side. I am just curious how those conversations are going and what kind of magnitude are we looking at?","Mark Blinn","It\u2019s definitely become more competitive, but I can tell you the pricing change is not nearly as drastic as it was during the last cycle. So we\u2019ve never really said it\u2019s been a strong pricing environment over the last couple of years. So the peak to trough type, we\u2019re not through necessarily the cycle, so I don\u2019t want to call it trough. But the movement in the pricing is not nearly as dramatic.","And I\u2019ve talked about this before, but in the last cycle keep in mind on some of these big projects we\u2019ll buy up to 50% from other suppliers. You really can\u2019t command much margin in most environments. Back then you could get 20%, 25% margin on those and 40%, 50% margins on the equipment that you manufacture. It was a really, really good environment.","So as you look this versus last, the backlog that we -- in the last year with is very good, executable, it doesn\u2019t have the price and we start to realize that, I mean that's why we\u2019re pleased with our margins that we've seen over the first part of this year. It certainly doesn't have the margin in the big projects that we saw last time, but the movement in price from peak to trough is not even close to what it was last time.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. So, that\u2019s helpful. And you brought up the margin point, good execution on the quarter and it\u2019s nice to see the restructuring actions are coming through. I guess I'm just trying to understand just a little bit more clarity on the payback on that restructuring. I know that you talked about $70 million in benefits, but it\u2019s unclear to me at this point how much of the $70 million do you expect to come through this year as opposed to the actions really kind of benefiting you guys in '16?","Mark Blinn","Well, I mean, if you look at the way we even started to accrue, we had 25. I mean, these are structural changes in mature markets, particularly in Europe to take time to execute, setting up the accrual one is one thing, realizing the benefit does take time. And a lot of companies avoid doing this, because it takes so much time in terms of the payback. We think this is a great time to do it.","So really very little of the benefits we expect to come through this year. I mean, we\u2019ll try to pull as many as we came forward, but I think this isn\u2019t an important point. This is real structural strategic change in our business. So we do have some component of it that is responsive to the market, but most of this is permanent. And we\u2019re continuing to look for opportunities.","We want these things to be sustainable. And if you think about it moving work, moving capabilities to low-cost is really the way to play for the future. But I would expect very little of these benefits to come through in this year. We\u2019ll try to drive in as much as we can, but most of it is going to be next year, these things take time.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. So there is very little in that guidance number that you gave for this year?","Mark Blinn","Yeah. Yeah.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Mark Blinn","Hi, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","So, Mark, just following up on some of the comments, you talked about 300 to 400 basis points of margin higher in 2008 than you\u2019re starting from now in terms of price, less relying on large projects, where the pricing pressure is the most intense? You\u2019ve got more structural opportunities to take cost out. It sounds like -- and correct me if I'm wrong that it\u2019s a reasonable expectation for investors to think that you are not going to see the same margin compression in this cycle that you did in the last cycle, is that reasonable?","Mark Blinn","Well, you leave me right in the margin guidance, which we don't give. But, I think, it's tough to -- what I was trying to do is illustrate that there are things you can compare to the last cycle and it's important to do. But underlying this is a fundamentally different company. So, what I don\u2019t want folks to do is just try to take the math from last period and roll it forward, there too many things that are different as you look over on our business.","A lot of that margin profile as we look forward, are going to be the things we talked about, Nathan. Obviously, topline from a currency impact standpoint and just an activity standpoint, even on projects is going to have a detrimental impact on margins.","To the flipside is cost optimization over a period of time is going to drive all of things being equal margin improvement, also as we start to scale the acquisition that we made that should drive that as well. So there are mix in terms of aftermarkets.","So, it's better as opposed to just try to do a linear math from last period of time to just step back and say, on a relative basis, what are they doing to drive margins and what are the headwinds. And I think I\u2019ve tried to align those out for you. But the timing of that and the duration of those things are going to -- they are going to impact margins and that's why we don't want to necessarily start guiding to margins, but it is a better company.","Nathan Jones","Okay. I also understand that a lot of the structural realignment that you're doing is in Europe, which takes more time. Is there anyway you can give us any idea of what of the $70 million you expect to recognize next year and what if it will be incremental in \u201917?","Mark Blinn","I think by the time we get to the back half of next year, we should be pretty close on a run rate to those savings, Nathan. And so, what I don\u2019t want to do is give you a full year number calendar, January 1 to December 31, because the timing of that can impact the amount, it\u2019s really when we\u2019re going to start seeing the run rate on it, it will be in the back half of next year.","Nathan Jones","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. On the inorganic side, you talk there about private sellers starting to adjust some of their expectation. It sounds like maybe there is a few more opportunities out there that meet your criteria. And I know previously you\u2019ve talked about not being interested in large multiyear integrations and you seem to be more willing to do those now. How many kind of SIHI sized deals would you be willing to be integrating at one time?","Mark Blinn","It, well, I mean, that\u2019s a good question. We did like a lot of the SIHI type of opportunities and then we\u2019ll find a way to integrate them to be honest with you. But the fact is they come when they come. I think as we look at our -- as our priorities, the platform is much better. And you can -- as the opportunity come, you can evaluate it against what your options are.","You can do an integration like, right. If it represents a really good opportunity, you can maybe time the integration over a longer period of time and just make sure your returns from a shareholder perspective justify that. So there are things we can look at. But I think we\u2019re going to look at each of these opportunistically in terms of returns to the shareholder and position this long-term.","And again, going back to earlier, things like SIHI are very valuable to us, because they're in an area where we think we have some of the greatest opportunity, our industrial segment.","These tend to be less volatile and market upturns and down. It leverages our sales platform, sales organization, our aftermarket capabilities as well and ultimately, we can also start to leverage some of our low cost manufacturing capacity.","So, we hope to see a lot of these. The fact is Nathan, when you look at these opportunities, you have to take a step back and say, what are my competing priorities in terms of integration? What\u2019s the pricing environment out there? What is this opportunity represent to us long-term and then you just make trade-offs. Obviously, if a compelling asset came that we could get at a good price, we may differ integration for period of time and just take it on our platform.","Operator","And our next question comers from William Bremer from the Maxim Group. Please go ahead.","William Bremer","Good morning, Mark, Tom, and welcome, Karen.","Karyn Ovelmen","Good morning.","Mark Blinn","Good morning.","William Bremer","Karen, look forward to seeing your initiatives on the DSO, that\u2019s first and foremost, I would like to start seeing that come through. I guess my first question is really based on SIHI and we touched upon it, it is on track. Can you give us a sense of what type of restructuring possibly is needed there? And then secondly, with the QRCs, I believe, SIHI pretty much added about \u201815, we are up to about 190 but yet the Q sort of articulated that an earlier some possible combining based upon certain regions, just want you to get a little more granular on those if you can?","Mark Blinn","Well, I mean, example around combining them is, if you look in the North Sea region, we had a couple QRCs that were supporting the North Sea activity. And some of these facilities we've been in a long period of time and actually they were -- we acquired them and they were designed for completely different use. I think one of them actually use to manufacture telescopes.","So what we did is we took a couple of these and built a more of a state-of-the-art facility right there on the coast in Aberdeen to support it. So those are the things that we\u2019re thinking about where we can take some of these facilities, combine them, also combined them for pump valve and seal capabilities to respond to the customers.","The idea is and I always try to tell folks, don't think of these as retail locations like a fast food location that you -- the more you add the more you grow. It's really -- these things are going to be designed to whatever our customers need in the business.","William Bremer","Great. Good point. That\u2019s all I have got.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical. Please go ahead.","Brian Konigsberg","Hi, good afternoon.","Mark Blinn","Good afternoon.","Brian Konigsberg","Most of my questions have been asked, maybe just one more on SIHI. So you are saying the integration is going as you expected. Can you just talk about the topline performance, is that in line with how you anticipated it, it would grow or generate this year and what\u2019s the outlook?","Mark Blinn","Yeah. I mean coming into the year it is as expected, I mean when we looked at this asset over last year, I mean, the markets were different. Hasn\u2019t moved too much from the original expectations, but certainly as we gave guidance this year, it's pretty much in line with expectations. Matter of fact, I think in the first quarter we're little ahead and this quarter we're a little behind.","Brian Konigsberg","Got it. And just secondly, just with receivables, so you have been talking in the Qs about just having trouble collecting down in Latin America, it has been a while now. I mean, at what point do you have to consider start taking reserves against that?","Mark Blinn","I mean we always evaluate that we've seen some progress in the region in this quarter and in third quarter, but that is something we always evaluate in communication with our customers and the like so. But that is something front of mind we always evaluate in terms when we look at.","Brian Konigsberg","I will leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","David Rose","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call.","Mark Blinn","Welcome.","David Rose","First, nice job on executing in the quarter. I think most of us were pretty pleased given the environment. So I had two questions if you may. On the outlook for next year, I know you don't want to go into it but I think as we start to look into next year and given where the bookings are in nominal terms, you got a pretty big step down.","So what do you need to do in terms of cost takeout or conversely at least on the top line in order for you to get to operating numbers that are essentially flat year-over-year? I mean, you have got a lot to make up for so help us kind of think about things that would help you.","Mark Blinn","Well, we talked about the unknowns. And the unknowns are going to be the large project activity what happened with the underlying commodities and certainly currency going into that period of time. We can control those, but let's spend little time on what we can control. What we talked about are some of our structural restructuring activities and we can continue to look at some of those well to drive value. These things will take time. We actually have a multiyear plan. We started to accelerate it. We can accelerate more.","I mean, the other things that we talked about are looking within our portfolio or capabilities and what can we do to improve topline capabilities. I\u2019ve alluded to one a number times on the call, around our industrial product segment. It\u2019s not only integrating the acquisition that we've made but there is other opportunities in terms of how we optimize our channels to market taking advantage of that. Obviously, growing our aftermarket business something we talked about last time.","So what we are going to do in R&D product development, these are all things that we are turning increase focus to not that it wasn\u2019t important before. Just keep in mind, our priority over the last three years has been around improving execution. And you've seen that in our results. In terms of the margins looking forward over time and effort and investments is going to be in relative market share capturing that as well. So the big thing around next year is just the unknown is what\u2019s going to happen to our industry during the back half of the year.","David Rose","Do you think all else being equal if you can maintain the bookings where they are today and again, I don't want to get into guidance -- I do but I know you won't go there? But you've got a $400 million deficit in bookings. Do you think you can pull it off? Do you have enough levers at your disposal? You've got SG&A. The restructuring is really back end waited for next year so?","Mark Blinn","You are going into calendar year versus beyond. As I said, I think we have -- we've already started to execute. We have substantial opportunity on the structural changes. So there's a quite a bit there for us and there are other levers we can pull. But again, we still do depend on project activity in our business. It\u2019s been less of our business over the last couple years and it\u2019s just tough to call. But the things within our control, we can surely add value.","And I don't want to give guidance in the next year but what I don't want to say is, look if you take a step back and if we were operating completely efficiently as we could, which we\u2019re not. And we were fully penetrated in our markets. We wouldn't have any levers to pull at all and I would be saying to you is we\u2019re subject to whatever the market tells us we can do. The fact is we probably have as much or more on things that we can do versus what the market can do to us.","The question is, we need to get after them and we are, and those things take time. And a lot of that is, as Karyn alluded to is some of the leadership that we brought on to help us drive through that. So it's timing dependent but long-term, the way we look at our business is we do think there's going to be demand in our industries long-term. I view what\u2019s occurring in oil and gas right now is more on the supply side.","You\u2019ve got Iran with 40 million barrel sitting in storage, ready to go to the market, the increased production there, Iraq is coming up to speed. There is a lot of things that are occurring, but you also have depleting rates increasing in the parts of the United States to offset some of that. So that will work itself out over the period of time. Investment will find the right opportunity and the right price to bring it back on line.","Also keep in mind whereas, we were having this discussion a year ago and everybody\u2019s saying why aren\u2019t you more upstream, the fact is midstream and downstream does not go away in tough markets. They may rationalize some of the new project activities but it is still operating and there is still need for this type of infrastructure. So, I\u2019d just ask, we take a step back. Let\u2019s take a long-term view because some of the things we're doing to fundamentally change our manufacturing capabilities around the world will take time, but they have very good paybacks to them.","Operator","And the next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joe Giordano","Hi, everyone. Thanks for running a little bit long to fit everyone in here, appreciate it. Just had a question on -- in the downturn here is there an opportunity maybe to look at the entire portfolio of products and streamline some of the lower margin, lower margin products to lever up on a recovery here?","Mark Blinn","In an upturn or in a downturn, we should be doing that. You\u2019ve seen some of the actions we\u2019ve taken over the last couple years and we do. As we take a step back, we will get our products and really primarily look for strategic fit. Can we scale cross our sales organization, is our aftermarket capabilities? And if they don't make the fit then we assume, as you\u2019ve seen with some of the divestitures that we made, that they are more valuable in another people's hands and so we want to monetize that.","Flipside on the M&A and we haven\u2019t talked a lot about that, but one other things versus where we were four years ago is we do have a better platform to integrate M&A. So, we are going to look both on -- primarily on the acquisition side but we always look on the divestiture side and say is there something we have to stop doing or sell to somebody else?","Joe Giordano","Great. And then just lastly, I wanted to touch on valves quickly and all things considered that was a very impressive performance in that segment. And based on what we are seeing in other people reporting, it looks like potentially gaining some share so can you talk about how you are executing there and what specifically if anything you can call out there?","Mark Blinn","They\u2019ve been executing at the high level for quite a period of time. And I think one of the advantages that they have relative to our internal portfolio is that well developed channel of the market both in terms of distribution and some of the other channels as well. So, they are further along and that's why I talk about the opportunity in the industrial segment because there is a tremendous amount of similarities. But I think what you\u2019ve seen is a whole host of things.","We talk about lead product, secondary product, and if you remember that strategy is to have confident capabilities often times in some of our mature markets but start to lever some of the work in low cost manufacturing parts around the world. They probably have one of the more successful examples of that. It is five years into it, so these things do take time that drives great margins in their control valve business.","So there is a good playbook there that we\u2019re using for other businesses, particularly we are going to start using it on the industrial product side and that\u2019s the example that you\u2019ve seen. And you\u2019ve seen good growth in the oil & gas business. Five years ago it was predominantly chemical.","We made a strategic move through Valbart into the oil & gas products. They\u2019ve been able to scale that and lever that into the other products that they manufacture. And then one question that came earlier, this concept around bringing our full portfolio to customers. They\u2019ve certainly benefited from some of the rotating equipment relationships that we\u2019ve had.","Joe Giordano","Great. Thanks so much for the color.","Operator","And we are showing no further question. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"9460":["Flowserve Corp (NYSE:FLS) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call February 17, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Jay Roueche - VP, IR and Treasurer","Mark Blinn - President and CEO","Tom Pajonas - EVP and COO","Karyn Ovelmen - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup","Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Company","John Walsh - Vertical Research Partners","Operator","Welcome to the Flowserve 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Paula, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to the Jay Roueche, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin. ","Jay Roueche","Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participated in Flowserve's call today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results. Joining me this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Karyn Ovelmen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up to your questions. And as a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available.","Please be aware that our earnings materials do, and this call will, include non-GAAP measures. Please review the reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to our reported results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which can be found in both our press release and earnings presentation. Please also note that this call and our associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management as of February 17, 2017.","These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the Company's control. And except to the extent required by applicable law, Flowserve undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's earnings materials, including our Form 10-K filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are all available on our Web site at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer for his prepared comments.","Mark Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our 2016 fourth quarter played-out largely as we expected, delivering adjusted EPS of $0.72 and representing about one third of our full year 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.19. Highlighting the quarter and the full year is the stability we delivered in our aftermarket franchise with constant currency bookings flat with prior year periods.","For the full year, our aftermarket book-to-bill was 1.02 and we built aftermarket backlog during the second half of 2016 even as our customers remain cautious with their maintenance spending. We believe the Company has largely reached the foundational level in aftermarket activity despite a multi-year downturn in the business cycle that's been longer and deeper than most industry participants have ever experienced. Our higher margin aftermarket work at year-end represents over 30% of our backlog mix, well above the historical trend of roughly 25%.","During the quarter, our focus remained on delivering value for customers and shareholders by driving our transformational realignment program. 2016 completed the second year of our three year program. So, we are deep into the heavy lifting of transforming our global operational footprint. This initiative was more than a response to the challenging market environment; but was intended to utilize the declining levels of activity to better position the Company geographically for our customer base; lower the total cost and increase the flexibility of manufacturing; help minimize the annual under-absorption we\u2019ve experienced an over an decade; and enhance our profitability and competitiveness when the cycle turns.","As we\u2019ve communicated the last few quarters, these structural changes to our business have created some disruption in operations, including both the expected and unforeseen. Last quarter, we discussed some of IPDs realignment challenges, which we actively addressed through several leadership changes, including appointing Tom Pajonas to lead the segment. He now directly drives IPDs day-to-day operations and is implementing strong controls, gauge checks and accountability and realignment processes.","I have great confidence that the risk of bottlenecks similar to those experienced at IPD facilities receiving new product lines will be minimizing the future, both from a manufacturing and commercial standpoint. As we have continued to progress on our plan, I'm pleased with our ability to apply and leverage lessons learned from completed actions throughout the enterprise to deliver improvements and help stabilize our past due backlog.","Of note, we have significantly enhanced the governance in all phases of the realignment process, including adding third party expertise, which together, has improved execution and accountability across each discrete project plan company wide. As such, we expect to work through the past disruption early in 2017, which will begin to abate in the second half of 2017 and be behind us going into 2018. Some of our actions during the fourth quarter included initiating the planned closure of an IPD German manufacturing facility, and we are transferring certain product lines from higher cost facilities to Latin American facilities.","Additionally, we closed two QRC operations and consolidated their operations into nearby Asian and Latin American facilities. From a savings perspective, we delivered approximately $93 million of incremental savings during 2016 and remain on track to deliver $230 million run rate savings in 2018. To help achieve this target, we expensed about $104 million for the full year of 2016, and we expect to complete the vast majority of the $400 million investment in 2017, as it represents the heavy lifting period of our realignment program and an operational inflection point for the Company. Our plans are gaining traction, and we\u2019re better positioned in Flowserve for success and profitable growth to drive shareholder value.","Turning to our markets and bookings within our served industries, for the quarter, total constant currency bookings declined approximately 4%, as OE booking declined approximately 8%. As discussed, aftermarket bookings have remained resilient despite the caution we saw in the fall 2016 that continued in the fourth quarter. However, as we mentioned last quarter, 2016 aftermarket sales were behind bookings due to the timing of certain longer lead-time upgrade projects awarded in the first half of 2016, which are expected to shift this year.","Turning now specific end-market, and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis. For the second consecutive quarter, the oil and gas markets were our strongest contributor with nearly 13% growth in the quarter. A positive data-point considering full year bookings to this industry were down approximately 5%. While we are pleased with this improved second half performance in light of a continued guarded macro environment, we are not calling the bottom yet.","That said, if crude markets remain stable, as they have over capacity quarters, we anticipate that many of our customers' budgets may improve, which would increase the likelihood and will return to more normal maintenance and upgrade schedules with operational spending stabilizing or accelerating. Additionally, our efforts to increase localization of certain product lines in emerging regions has made Flowserve more competitive with established local competitors in the industry, which we expect will further improve our market share overtime.","Our bookings also increased year-over-year during the fourth quarter by approximately 7%. Again, this is a positive development considering full year bookings were down 3%. We continue to expect steady combined cycle of natural gas investment in North America as Coal plants retired and nuclear life extensions appear less likely. Also projects continued in Asia and while they tend to be very competitive, our initiative to increase our local capabilities and improved our ability compete profitably. China continues its aggressive nuclear plant where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. Finally, we are seeing increased bidding activity in solar and desalination markets.","In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 11% in Q4, resulting in the 4% decline for the year, largely due to valve distributors managing their year-end inventory levels. On a positive note, we are pleased that our strategic initiatives to increase bookings through the pump and seal distribution channel, particularly outside North America, have begun to gain significant traction, evidenced by solid bookings growth in the quarter and full year. Consistent with our belief that destocking has largely occurred, we have seen signs of some Gulf Coast distributors investing in inventory during the first six weeks of 2017 for all products.","Chemical bookings were up 1% in the quarter, but down 7% for the year. We continued to see delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants, as well as the second wave of crackers. But we expect these projects to progress in North America and the Middle East, supported by low cost feedstock.","Looking forward, while we are cautiously optimistic regarding the relative stability we\u2019ve seen and the potential for improvement in our customers' maintenance budgets as well as improved general sentiment for the overall industrial market, our 2017 planning does not assume a significant recovery in our customers\u2019 capital budgets. Accordingly, the Company will continue its internal focus, controlling what we can. That means continuing to execute on our transformational realignment program, improving operational performance, maintaining a disciplined approach to the work we pursue and leveraging our technology, comprehensive product portfolio and driving strategic customer growth initiatives. In short, 2017 is an important year for Flowserve, and one which we believe will position Flowserve for the eventual recovery in our market.","Let me now turn the call to Karyn to discuss our financial results and 2017 guidance in a little greater detail.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Looking quickly at our 2016 fourth quarter adjusted earnings, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.72 per share in line with the expectations discussed on our third quarter call. Our sequential increase we delivered this quarter included the typical pick-up we see in shipping levels from seasonality. Our reported EPS of $0.50 includes realignment expense of $0.20, $0.01 of Brazil inventory right down, $0.01 of SIHI purchase price accounting, integration and other expenses and $0.03 of negative currency translation.","Turning to our bookings, on a constant currency basis, we declined 4.2% in the quarter. Aas most of you know, aftermarket activity is amongst the most profitable work we do. So we are pleased that the aftermarket bookings remain flat year-over-year and this higher margin work comprise 49% of total bookings.","Original equipment bookings continued to reflect the current industry environment and declined 8.2% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Regionally, strength in the Middle East and Europe was offset by ongoing challenges in the distressed Latin American market. Sales were $1.1 billion in the seasonally high fourth quarter, sequentially delivering a 13.9% increase. However, year-over-year fourth quarter sales declined 14.7% on a constant currency basis. Aftermarket sales were less impacted, down 8.7% on a constant currency basis versus an OE sales decline of nearly 20%. For the full year 2016, Flowserve\u2019s constant currency revenues decreased 10%.","Turning to gross margins, in the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin decreased 20 basis points versus prior year to 33.2%. Loss of sales leveraged, increased under-absorption and pricing headwinds, were fully covered by our incremental realignment savings. On a reported basis, excluding the realignment charges of $22 million and $32.5 million in the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters respectively and $1.4 million of Brazil inventory write-down in 2016, our reported gross margins increased 10 basis points to 31.0%, demonstrating the benefits from our realignment actions and 400 basis points mix shift for its higher margin aftermarket.","SG&A remains a critical focus with volume challenges continuing at this product cycle. Our fourth quarter SG&A declined $36 million year-over-year or 13.8%. Excluding realignment and other adjusted items for both the 2016 and \u201915 fourth quarters, SG&A declined almost $30 million or 12.1% despite a modest variable compensation increase versus prior year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin decreased 130 basis points to 13.2%, excluding adjustments of $34.5 million and $50.1 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively as loss of top line leverage and sticky SG&A impacted results.","Reported operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 10.0%, reflecting lower realignment expense. Fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rates were approximately 25.2% and 28.3% respectively, and were modestly below our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. Reported tax rates were elevated as they included crude exit taxes or site closures of $4 million and $9.4 million for the fourth quarter and full year respectively.","Turning to cash flow, Flowserve generated total operating cash flow of $169 in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the normal seasonality received despite $40 million of realignment cash outflows. Capital expenditures were $25 million in the quarter and $90 million for the full-year as we continue to make disciplined investments in our business to support long-term growth. For the full-year 2016, cash funding for realignment initiatives was $120 million. We also returned $98 million to shareholders through dividends. We paid $16 million in debt and contributed $40 million to our defined benefit pension plans. We ended the year with cash balances modestly improved year-over-year despite the lower earnings profile.","Turning to our 2017 outlook. We are now targeting full year adjusted EPS of $1.55 to $1.85 a share, which includes approximately $0.10 per share of above-the-line currency headwinds. The largest factor in the expected EPS decline from 2016 is derived from lower anticipated organic revenues of down 6% to 11%. As in past years, our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance excludes realignment expenses, expected to be up approximately $155 million, as well as below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other future discreet items which we can't forecast at this time.","Beyond lower top-line and currency headwinds, our 2017 adjusted EPS target range reflects year-end 2016 foreign currency rates, current commodity prices and market conditions, stable to improving aftermarket and book-to-ship, work and annual reset of incentive goals and their increases, and consistent U.S. tax and regulatory policy. We provide our few other guidance metrics, including net interest expense in the $60 million to $63 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%.","While we anticipate continued seasonality in our quarterly earnings profile in 2017, the second half waiting is expected to be more pronounced than recent years. This belief is based on expectations that the first quarter will represent a substantially lower percentage of full-year earnings than in past periods as a result of lower beginning backlog, the loss of top line leverage combined with increased under-absorption and an increased SG&A quarter relative to remaining 2017 periods.","With regard to 2017 cash usage, we expect investing in our realignment program will again be our top cash priority with anticipated spending of approximately $148 million. We also plan approximately $100 million of cash dividends, capital expenditures in $80 million to $90 million, about $60 million of scheduled debt repayments and global pension contributions of approximately $26 million to mainly cover service costs as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.","With that overview, let me turn the call back to Mark for his remaining comments.","Mark Blinn","Thanks, Karyn. Wrapping up, I believe our industry appears to be moving towards better days ahead. While 2017 is largely expected to be a reset year, I believe 2018 and beyond look more promising. We've seen some initial signs that give us confidence, such as last year's performance in aftermarket.","In 2017, we are participating in an improving number of feed studies and customers are beginning to schedule more final investment decisions for projects, which would be a positive catalyst in future periods. The relative stability of oil around the $45 to $50 level for the past couple of quarters has been an encouraging development for our industry, and could potentially serve as the catalyst needed to start releasing pent-up maintenance activity.","Flowserve and others in our industry have taken actions to be more efficient and pricing, while competitive, is rationale. Further, the ongoing macro factors and trends that help support the long-term growth proposition for Flowserve remain intact, such as the growing world population and emerging global middle class that requires more transportation fuels, clean water, electricity and chemical products. Aging infrastructure in developed regions combined with the need for new facilities in the emerging markets and the requirement to service existing assets to maintain production levels.","Finally, there is a general market view that growth is on the horizon. However, it is important to note that Flowserve is a late-cycle beneficiary. In 2017, we expect nearly $300 million decline in revenues from beginning backlog versus prior year, a reset in annual variable compensation performance goals and expect increases in merit compensation, which together make for sizable headwind. While we have identified and expect to implement a number of additional cost initiatives beyond realignment, we still anticipate that our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near-term.","Our 2017 guidance reflects our best expectations at this time, taking all these factors into consideration. We expect the first half of the year to be challenging, but also positioned well for the second half of 2017 and beyond. I've always considered Flowserve's people its most important asset. The last couple of years have been challenging, both due to industry conditions and our realignment program. But our leadership and associates have addressed the situation head-on, professionally and with the sense of urgency. It's been a pleasure working with them over the years. I remain confident that Flowserve has the right strategic plan and the right team in place to build upon its leadership position in the industry while delivering value to our customers and shareholders.","Finally, as you know, last week we announced that Scott Rowe will succeed me as the Company's CEO and President. He is truly an excellent choice. I am honored to have been a part of Flowserve for more than a decade and to work with you. I believe in recent years that we have positioned the Company for a strong future despite current market conditions, and I'm very proud at the organization. I expect continued success from the Company and our employees, and very much look forward to the next phase of Flowserve's performance under Scott's leadership.","As this is my last earnings call, I want to reiterate that I remain confident that Flowserve has the right strategy and the right team in place to build upon its leading position in the industry, and achieve increased profitable growth, while delivering value to its customers and shareholders through the current market cycle and beyond.","With that operator, we would now like to open our call to questions from our listeners.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. ","Charlie Brady","Mark, let me just say congratulations on retirement, and good luck to you in the future. It's been nice working for you these past several years. So, I think you\u2019ve done a lot of good things to the Company since you came on board .So, thanks for that.","Mark Blinn","Thank you.","Charlie Brady","I just want to touch on the aftermarket commentary, I mean, I guess that aftermarket was constantly flat, but if you look, it was really driven by IPD, EPD. I think it\u2019s the second or first quarter where you\u2019re still seeing aftermarket bookings down. FCD had a decline this quarter. So, I guess I'm just really trying to square up confidence as we go forward, the aftermarket really has stabilized because with the exception of IPD, the other two segments are still seeing a bit of struggle on aftermarket.","Mark Blinn","Well, I mean it kind of comes and goes amongst a segment if you go quarter-by-quarter. It is probably better to look at it in the aggregate. And the reason is we do manage aftermarket across, primarily our rotating equipment businesses at a consolidated strategic level. And the point is, don\u2019t look at them necessarily as discrete within the segment, because we manage it from an end user standpoint. So, you\u2019re going to see puts and takes within the segment. I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that. Now, I can\u2019t tell you if you look at the comparison IPD, especially over the coming quarters, we do expect you'll see some good movement, mainly because of the improved execution. Whether its aftermarket, run rate business, projects, if you\u2019re not executing to customers\u2019 expectations they're not going to give you orders.","Charlie Brady","And just as a follow-up, your commentary on the past due backlog out of the door, can you quantify how much of the backlog is considered past due. What the margin impact is from any potential penalties or LDs on that?","Mark Blinn","Well, it spiked up as you\u2019d expect. During the realignment, there is hand-offs, there is some that was anticipated, there some that wasn\u2019t. What I can do is point you to IPD. And if you look at their margins this last year, they were even in this part of the cycle probably 400 basis points to 500 basis points below where they should be. Why is that occurring, because you have bottlenecks in the plants, you\u2019re not getting the top line leverage because customers aren\u2019t giving orders the way they should.","You\u2019re spending more money on reworks, scrap, all the things around cost of poor quality, that kind of feeds into past due backlog. The other thing -- the reason I don\u2019t want to just use past due backlog, I\u2019ll explain in a second. But that\u2019s one way of illustrating that unexpected execution challenges can have a impact and they do take while the work through. The reason I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time on past due backlog is, keep in mind the way we measure past due backlog is to the committed contractual date.","As you\u2019ve heard on prior calls, we\u2019ve said a number of times, customers are won\u2019t ready to receive it. We go ahead and put that into past due backlog. So, we hold ourselves to fairly high standard. I think the issues are we look at it holistically around operational issues, and IPD has had their challenges. The other businesses have as well, this happens when you\u2019re doing this kind of heavy lifting. And that\u2019s why I made the comment that while we haven't called a market turn, we do see a couple of inflection points in the business, and that is we\u2019re getting through a lot of the lifting on our restructuring and the ones that are head or the longer lead time plan restructurings that we can plan better into and you can execute more carefully and slowly.","The second thing is we\u2019ve talked about this for a period of time. Managing your SG&A against declining revenues is difficult. And the fact is companies like us, you\u2019re behind the curve, you cannot be on the curve, it's very difficult to manage to revenue decline. But we do start to see that abate over the next couple of quarters as well. So those are the things that we've talked about, and as you think about our business this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So, maybe Mark or Karyn, can you give us a little more color into the puts and takes of the 2017 margin executions? If we were to strip out incentive compensation and adjust for the realignment savings that you gave us for \u201817, it looks like you\u2019re tracking to 30% to 40% decrementals in the business, and that's with some positive mix expected. So, maybe you can quantify how much of that margin pressure embedded in your guidance is related to price, or is it just lower volume less on absorption?","Mark Blinn","Well, as we talked about in our quarter-one, you are getting into fixed cost leverage challenges because of the ending backlog and the way that backlog is going to roll-out during the year. So, that kind of starts you in the whole in terms of EPS and margin. As you look at over the year, I think what we've talked about before in terms of the incentive compensation. And let me just make a point here. Don\u2019t view incentive compensation as a one-time item. This is completely in line with our commitment to shareholders.","But if you remember when it was a benefit in 2015, Karyn had talked about through the first three quarters about a 100 basis points of margin benefit was an expected 50 to 100 additional for the year. So that kind of helps you understand that impact in terms of margins, which would be a headwind this year. Mix is a benefit as you talked about as our realignments savings. When they are achieved, a lot of these are going to be achieved during the course of the year. And then as I talked about catching up on the curve on SG&A. When you\u2019re behind the curve, it puts pressure on margins when you get out of the curve, it can sustain the margins and then the mix as well.","Finally, we talked about this the last quarter, improving IPD, which we\u2019re looking to start getting some good traction on in the second quarter. Those are all the puts and takes. But right now, when you have fixed cost leverage issues that's going to put a lot of pressure on your margins over the short-term, and your earnings as well.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mark, just following-up on that. Is it fair to say pricing and backlog is again relatively stable in aftermarket and down -- I don't want to put numbers in your mouth, but 10% or something like that on the OE side?","Mark Blinn","Well, we don\u2019t want to over simplify. I look at our business in three forms; there project business; there is run rate business; and there is aftermarket business. Aftermarket has been relatively stable. That doesn\u2019t mean that on some of these project upgrades customers don\u2019t want some pricing concessions, but it's still profitable business. On the run rate, it's been relatively stable. We've seen some pressure. I will tell you a lot of the run rate business is some of our MRO business, and also some of the product that IPD puts out.","And our best pricing opportunity in IPD is going to be execution to the customers\u2019 expectations. If you look at the project business, it is and has been competitive. The project we talked about recently the Helgli project, which is the first one we've seen of that size in a number of years, I think three of four years. That was competitive, but we can still make a profit on it and absorb our factories, and then so as you think about that. The other thing is with lower backlog, even though we're doing a lot of restructuring, it will put pressure on absorption.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Just a quick follow-up here, you hired Scott last week, so it's a tough question to ask. But did he get to see the guidance that you put out today, Mark, given that he is going to be expected to deliver it over the last three quarters of the year?","Mark Blinn","Well, I want to point out. I mean this is the Company's guidance, not anyone's individual. Scott is definitely -- he's finishing up a role and executing that. But he's certainly been engaged in this transaction. But I want you to just take a step back and see. This is the folks around the table here in the Company, 18,000 people that are providing guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","Mark, you've been a great leader and a great representative of the Company, and I wish you luck. You've been, as forthcoming as they come, so thank you for that.","Mark Blinn","Thank you very much Scott.","Scott Graham","The oil and gas up bookings last couple of quarters. Obviously, that's not coming from the base business. Sounds like you're getting into some businesses, which were maybe smaller as a percent of total but maybe just grabbing some opportunities. Can you talk about the interplay between some of the markets that might be small yet still enable you to have enough bookings numbers, for example, in oil and gas and the interplay between that and your network of QRCs?","Mark Blinn","Listen, probably best way to look at oil and gas is to go back to the compare and the prior year, and think about it from that perspective. Because that was a time of great uncertainty, remember oil, this time last year, went into the 20s and market see that. So, when the third and fourth quarters of '15 people were really holding on tight. By this period a year later, they're still very tight, they're still deferring things. But as we talked about, at least, we saw some emergency, repair work and activity occurring. That contributed also our broader footprint as we brought some of that online, we were able to participate in some more markets as well.","So why we like the increase, especially considering the fact that that market has been challenged for a while, I think it had more to do with the lack of visibility in 2015 as a compare. Which is why -- and our comments right now we\u2019re saying, the fact is we're three years into a cycle. This has been brutal, brutal cycle, particularly in the oil and gas industry. The fact is these things come back. So two things happen; one, as time passes, you get closer to the end of the downturn in the cycle that\u2019s just the way the math works; the second thing is some of the things we've seen in some of the distributors, some of the other activities, and some of the fieldwork and everything, indicate that there is a little more comfort. As we anticipated now that oil is stabilized for, we're almost into the fourth quarter of stabilized oil.","So, I think it's more of the compare in '15. There are some strategies that we've executed on that have allowed us to grow those bookings really in all those segments. But if you look at the segments that grew, it had more to do with '15 uncertainty than anything else. Keeping in mind in '15 and we talked about this, we had a couple of big projects like in our valve business and pulp and paper, some things that you don't see certainly on a recurring basis.","Scott Graham","My follow-up question is simply, you and Tom, Tom with his long-term relationship to the valves business, have historically had a pretty good bead on the chemical market globally. What do you think is going to get -- the feed-stocks, they are not going to get lower. What do you think are going to be some of the -- a catalyst? Is it global GDP? Is it U.S. or Europe GDP? What's the catalyst to get some of those crackers going again? I know that the projects have been drawn up, ready to go in a lot of cases, but just put on hold. What's the catalyst in chemical?","Mark Blinn","And Tom will follow-up on this. But global GDP is typically a really good proxy for evaluating those markets. Obviously, you will have pockets based on opportunity. I think just generally looking at the chemical market, the uncertainty that occurred in the last half of \u201915 and the first half of the last year was indiscriminate across industries. And so you would hear all companies just not knowing where things were going. There was so much volatile in markets. So, I think when we talk about the oil and gas industry, seeing some stabilization at least in the feedstock or the underlying crude and of the abating on certainty but not the ambitious spend yet, that apply to all industries. Tom, do you have anything else?","Thomas Pajonas","I would just add that there is a discussion going on within the chemical companies in terms of a next wave of build coming in terms of ethylene or propylene projects. Obviously, they\u2019re weighing that against the capacity that has built up over the last couple of years. I would add one other comment also on the chemical, but the same things applies to the oil and gas that Scott brought up, is we\u2019re seeing a requirement from localization of product in oil and gas area and the chemical area, which bodes very well for our network that we have established around the world for low cost sourcing, as well as localization of the product. So that is a push that\u2019s coming in the oil and gas, and that is increasing in the chemical area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry","Mark, I will echo the earlier sentiments. Good luck. Nice working with you. I did want to just start with clarifying something you said earlier on the incentive comp and merit increases. Should we be assuming in the guide it's about a 50 to 100 basis point headwind on margin? Is that kind of the ballpark?","Mark Blinn","Let me just give -- I\u2019ll put out what is out there is and if you think about headwinds that were specifically mentioned about $0.10 on the currency, $0.10 on the merit across the Company. And what we talked about when we\u2019re receiving a benefit in 2015 is about 100 basis points to the first three quarters and 50 to 100 additional through the year. So, that was what we put out there. And the reason, we\u2019re not trying to -- not go to specific. I think what\u2019s important about variable comp is that it align with shareholders.","The other things that we mentioned, and we\u2019ll give you specifics around, we can put in any terms because they are fairly specific in identifiable. If we don\u2019t exceed our objectives fully delivering to shareholders, it impacts our incentive comp. And it is broad base across the entire Company. I mean over 60% of our folks get incentive comp. So, I think that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re being fairly specific, but that will serve as a guide based on what Karyn has indicated. Karyn anything else?","Karyn Ovelmen","Just as Mark was pointing that 150 to 200 basis points, that's really just to give some context on what it's been as it relates to 2014. If you look at 2015 and \u201916 they\u2019re fairly comparable, \u201916 was slightly higher about 17 basis points below margins, but although both through \u201916 and \u201915, substantially less than what we experienced in \u201814. And as we go through and we look at \u201917, as Mark indicated, compensation starts share, alignment to shareholders at lower earnings, lower variable components and price per share at the higher end. But the actual dollar amount not determined until the end of the year. It's based on numerous factors, so it's not just earnings; it's bookings, working capital, platforms may have different results and accompanies. So there is a range of profitability that\u2019s not linear.","Mark Blinn","And simple way to look at it is if you look over the last couple of years, our initial guidance has been impacted by markets and everything and that has impacted our incentive comp.","Robert Barry","I did also want to follow up on a comment you made earlier that we\u2019re into the very heavy lifting period of executing the restructuring now. Across what percent of the footprint during this time of heavy lifting would you say lead times and on-time delivery are at market-competitive levels?","Mark Blinn","And, if I think about, for example, in IPD a disproportionate amount of their facilities were impacted by the realignment, and in some of the unanticipated inefficiencies. Some of our bigger very profitable plants were impacted. Within the custom engineers segment that has been very organized and thoughtful, that's been a multi-year plan. There has been some impact and less so in the valve business. The primary impact from the, what I'd say, the anticipated inefficiencies have been in the industrial business. And as to my comments earlier, you could see the margin impact versus what it should be at this point in the cycle.","Thomas Pajonas","And Robert, just to add to that, I mean we're also beginning to bring the lead times back-in in the IPD business as we execute our recovery plans for those earlier realignments.","Robert Barry","The spirit of the question, I guess, was just the extent to which the orders are temporarily suffering, because you're just unable to bid for some things that may actually be out there?","Mark Blinn","Quite a bit in the last three quarters of last year, and it's still the case. Right now customers don\u2019t forget overnight. But as you start to improve, they like the product, they like the way you deliver the product. You don\u2019t assume anything, but you can earn them back. And Tom is doing a good job of that now, but we're not going to sound the all clear on it yet.","Robert Barry","So, it sounds like we\u2019re at the trough though, like the lead times are maybe at kind of\u2026","Mark Blinn","Yes, they are improving. They are definitely improving, but not at the levels where they need to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","My first question, I just want to touch on the comments on the substantially lower 1Q, because those comments can leave a lot to the imagination. And you guys called out lower backlog and higher SG&A. Is there a way you can give us a little bit more detail, some quantification on the higher SG&A because some of that I would imagine is one-time as well due to the CEO transition? So any color you can give us there that would be helpful.","Mark Blinn","Well, the best thing I can do is to look at trends the way things have been trending and why they've been trending that way. And what you see in the first quarter is some costs as you just mentioned associated with the transition. We also if you remember last year in the first quarter have the 55 intend to retirement program, which because the way the grants occur are in the first quarter of every year. And until we get into a full year three year cycle, it's going to be an impact, particularly in the first quarter and then it smoothes out, because you're cycling through all the grants at that point in time.","So, those are the two primary impacts that you see in the first quarter of this year, couple of other items. But part of it also in the G&A is as we mentioned in the call, there are some actions that we started taking at the end of the year, which we couldn't do necessarily before the holiday. So, we're implementing a lot of those this year that also has an impact. So, that's on the SG&A line as you walk up the P&L and you look at where backlog is and our commentary around some of this is longer lead time and will be in future quarters, particularly in the aftermarket project.","There is a point in time where you get tied to your fixed cost and every dollar of revenue has a disproportionate impact. And that's what you're seeing in Q1 this year is that impact on G&A, which will certainly not only will that trend abate because of the expenses that I just mentioned to you in the first quarter, but also some of the cost leverage that we're going to get. That's why I referenced the curve on G&A. We've been behind it even in the trend it will be a little setback in Q1 because of the things I just talked about. But we'll catch up with the curve. Companies can't get ahead of the curve, but we'll catch up with the curve during the next few quarters. Does that help?","Joe Ritchie","The color is definitely helpful, Mark. I know historically I\u2019m implying 1Q would imply that, based on your guidance, that you'd be closer to $0.30. And because of the wording and -- I'm struggling with the quantification here. I guess the follow-up I have is are we talking that 1Q could potentially be negative, or is that being a little too draconian based on the cost structure and the backlog that you see today?","Mark Blinn","That's trying to give me Q1, maybe give you Q1 guidance, which I won't give you. But I think the way and Karyn made these comments is you -- again think about fixed cost leverage. You do get to a point where it has a disproportionate impact at downside. But by the way, as you start to lower that fixed cost leverage, you get leverage on the way up. And what we're seeing in Q1 if you looked it historically, it was much more variable to that fixed cost as we were moving down in Q1 because of where revenues were and look at year-end backlog. We're much tighter to that fixed cost point for the reasons we've talked about in Q1. But we'll lever up during the course of the year. So, that's probably the best context I can give you, because we don't provide specific guidance. But we want to just to be clear with you what's going on with the business, especially around fixed cost leverage.","Joe Ritchie","And maybe if I could ask one more follow-on you mentioned that the first six weeks you were starting to see some improvement from your Gulf Coast distributors. That's a really good sign for the first quarter. Is your expectation then as we progress throughout 1Q, it would seem the backlogs should be up or orders should be up at least sequentially. Is it possible that you guys could actually see some growth year-over-year as well, or is it too early to tell?","Mark Blinn","Well, I think as we look at it, we don\u2019t have any frolic assumptions in terms of the order book this year. We remain cautious and that\u2019s what you heard in our comments. We do see some encouraging signs. But I just want to remind you, we saw this and the industry saw this in the summer of last year, and then we were surprised by what happened in September and during the remainder of the year. So, while we see some encouraging signs, I think we\u2019re going to just remain cautious because we don\u2019t want to go through that discussion again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones","Mark, best wishes for the future. It's been my pleasure working with you for the last seven or eight years. Can we talk a little bit more about the aftermarket short-cycle activity? It sounds like that\u2019s trending a little bit better. We have been hearing talk about a material pickup in turnaround activity coming given crack spreads are down a bit. Curious what you are seeing there. A lot of the big refiners have talked about taking downtime on their 4Q calls. Some of those distributors down there have talked about adding significant amounts of inventory. It looks like maybe the turnaround season gets started a bit earlier, just your thoughts there.","Mark Blinn","In the Golf Corse, as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve seen some of the inventories come up in our distributors. And I will tell you, I mean that is a good early sign because they tend to get out of the blocks first, because they have to have it in inventory and ready to deliver when the customer wants it. We\u2019ve seen as with some of the other things in terms of the spend and that\u2019s why we talked about the expectations around normal maintenance levels. What we haven't called for is anything really accelerated in terms of pent-up demand, if that were to occur that is certainly going to be a benefit. I think it goes back to where we were Nathan. A lot good has happened since the election, I think we would all agree in the markets. I think we want just see some of that on paper before we start getting more bullish on things. And I think everybody else is. Stock market seems to be ahead of reality at this point, but reality may catch up.","Nathan Jones","If we were thinking about a normal level of activity for your aftermarket business, wouldn't that imply some fairly significant growth from where you are right now?","Mark Blinn","If you get back to normal activities, absolutely, because what you\u2019ve seen in the order book in the last couple of years is strict cash management from all the way up to the value chain from the large integrated to the smaller players. Just think about it at this time last year, Nathan, folks were wondering if they could issue equity to short their balance sheet, the question was were banks going to start having to adjust loan covenants. I mean it was a completely different environment. And when industry gets into that situation, it\u2019s frightening for them.","And so, you are seeing some of that abate. And as we talked about stable oil price help and a little more visibility perhaps even visibility in the regulation. We\u2019ll see what happens with the U.S. pipelines. They have certainly become much more viable in the last month in terms of discussions than they were before. So I think all these things play well. We just look forward to seeing it in action. But the good early sign as you mentioned originally is some of the distributors in the Gulf-Coast.","Nathan Jones","And then my follow-up is actually for Tom. If we could just get a little bit more detail on the actions taken so far in IPD, you talked about getting good traction there beginning in the second quarter. But margins currently were probably 400 basis points or 500 basis points below where you thought they should be at this point in the cycle. Can you give us some idea of how you would expect those to progress through the year and maybe what exit rate we'd be looking at, at the end of \u201817?","Thomas Pajonas","Yes, so maybe just in general in terms of some of the things we\u2019re doing on IPD. First of all, all the issues, they are not systemic on unsolvable issues. These are all things that we can deal with. I mean if you look at, I would characterize the situation we get into, is a little bit of choking of the businesses. We do have some system changes where we were going from a one SAP to an Oracle change and the billing materials wasn\u2019t done, so these are all solvable issues in the business.","What we're doing is we're mapping out in a very specific detailed form all the things that need to be done on these early realignments. And I would stress that these are on the early realignments that we've done. So our governance now has been, I would say, significantly upgraded with a lot of specifics overall in the business. So I would expect, obviously, the pass-through backlog coming down overtime, and we've already made progress already in last several weeks over the pass-through backlog.","Mark Blinn","And Nathan, you've asked the question on kind of margins. We talked about before getting this business back to where it was before, the 14% to 15%. I've talked about the 400 to 500 basis points just based on qualitative work looking at what it should have been, and looking the impact. When your two biggest plants get chocked, as you use the term, it's very, very expensive in the business. I think the other thing, I do want to remind everybody we\u2019re not calling out SIHI PPA or anything like that because it's integrated into the business, thank goodness. That is a really good company with a good product.","We're a little slower integrating it. And the reason was we found we integrated more into them than originally anticipated. But it's high margin product. It has high-demand from customers. Admirably, one of the plants they got chocked was one of their plants, one of their high-production, high-volume facilities. So, as we look holistically, we are -- life without SIHI wouldn\u2019t be good right now. We are so thankful we have that company.","Nathan Jones","Is there any quantification you could give us, some margin progression or exit rate by the end of the year kind of thing with these improvements that you are making?","Mark Blinn","We have plans for that. What I would tell you is when we get the traction, we talked about in Q2 and I certainly don\u2019t want to lay this out there for future conference calls. But I think that's, if appropriate, that's the time to talk more about what rates will look like. Because I think we're -- you can hear on this call. We\u2019re very thoughtful in making sure that we put out commitments we're going to deliver to you because we don\u2019t take it lightly when we miss them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Mark, congratulations and thank you for your leadership over the years. So, I have a question because I am a tad confused this morning. I went to Emerson's Analyst Day yesterday. They were talking about their project funnel being up 50%. They also stated very explicitly that they now have visibility on MRO for the next two quarters and that backlog just basically inflected earlier than I thought. Earlier today, I listened to a conference call for one of your largest distributors and they are guiding to revenues up 10% to 20%, highlighting how they have great visibility, how turnaround season is much stronger this year. And I'm just a little bit confused because Q1, it seems there's an air pocket and you guys are being very conservative. So are you guys being conservative or are you losing marketshare, because that would be another explanation that, as you said, you are out of capacity, you lost marketshare and you are just not getting the orders? It's a direct question, but I'm just confused.","Mark Blinn","That's fair. And I'll tell you to -- and by the way, Emerson is a fine company and fine competitor. So take this for what it is. I mean you look at our valve business and how it's performed, it's not losing market share. And we've actually seen opportunities where we are. A lot of Q1's pocket is what is in backlog, I think that's the point we need to make. We do have bookings shift, but some of that MRO didn\u2019t book and ship necessarily within a week, some of it does. The distributor you're talking about is the one I think we've referenced in our comments where we're seeing some activity in the Gulf Coast region.","So, not completely different we've talked about the fieldwork. But just keep in mind we are longer lead time items than some of the compares you just enumerated there. And so, the fact is as some of our products are going to take a little longer in these projects to get in. So we do have some visibility around the feed work. And I think the other thing is we just, our approach is when we made commentary looking forward. We want to see things turn. We're not good at calling the day things are going to turn, but the day that we see it we'll be happy to let you know about it.","Andrew Obin","So, just to make sure, if the cycle turns, you are ready to take advantage of it?","Mark Blinn","Absolutely, if we done nothing else over the last three years, we have improved our capacity in terms of localization, where it needs to be, we definitely made it efficient. We are working on our fixed cost leverage. For this business, it doesn't take too much top-line. We\u2019ve talked a lot about fixed cost leverage on the way down. I think we need to think about it on fixed cost leverage when the markets come up, even if it's a gradual incline, we'll get a lot of leverage. If you look at the G&A that has been adjusted at this business, despite merits over the last number of years, despite taking on four or five companies with all of their people organizationally and how we've been able to manage G&A that should give you an indication that while it may look flat over the last couple of years, it's actually a lot more efficient than it was before. And we have a broader footprint a broader product portfolio, and when we the turn we'll let you know.","Andrew Obin","I have just a follow up question. Can you just comment on how short cycle or seals that trending so far in Q1?","Mark Blinn","Generally and it goes to the comment earlier about distribution and everything. We've seen some improvement there. But we don't discuss that necessarily as a separate segment. But the seal business has seen some activity. And there is a reason for that. The meantime between failures of all rotating equipment, the seals tend to be the shortest. So, you will need to act on those regularly but if you have not discretionary, but incremental OpEx, it will tend to go to your seal turnarounds in your business, because if a seal fails your system is down.","Andrew Obin","So, if OpEx goes up, we should say so. So, if I believe OpEx is going up, seals should pick up?","Mark Blinn","Yes, absolutely, seals should pick up. And seals have been, they have been a good stable business as you can see with competitors.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Giannakouros from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Jim Giannakouros","Mark, echoing others' best wishes as well. Aftermarket resilience, the bookings comparison sequentially, I understand; I understand, obviously, higher margin versus OE, that I get; but just to better understand margin and mix implications, how and if you could put some numbers around. How do margins encourage aftermarket bookings compared to last year? And was there a trend that you can call out that occurred through 2016, any shifts there?","Mark Blinn","Aftermarket margins, particularly in the gross margin line, have historically ranged from 43% to 49% through cycles. And that\u2019s remained fairly consistent. So they can move a couple of 100 basis points, up and down, this is on run-rate aftermarket. Some of these upgrade projects you can see a little more dramatic of a move. But the point is aftermarket business is relatively stable. And if you think about why, I mean it is around the critical nature of the operating facility. And being able to respond and serve them quickly, which is why QRCs are important. Where you see the more dramatic price moves are going to be in the large projects, just because of the dollar amount of the project and the competitive nature.","Pricing in the run rate business does get impacted by markets, but again those are a lot about being able to deliver quality on-time. So, if you can execute well, you can command more price on the margin. But aftermarket has been relatively stable. I mean the reason we emphasize it is companies operators have been doing everything they can over the last couple of years to hold on the cash, everything they can. And you\u2019ve seen when companies do that. And so they will push everything they can in terms of repairs as long as possible. They will never put their people at risk in terms of safety.","So, I'm not suggesting they'll go beyond that. But if they can defer a scheduled maintenance, they will. Other things, factors come in crack spreads over the short-term. But over the long-term, the fact is as long as this equipment continues to rotate and flow goes through it, they're going to need repair, they're going to need upgrade, it's just a function of time.","Jim Giannakouros","And one follow-on if I may, just understanding that you are not just consolidating your facilities, you are likely upgrading just flow, et cetera. But smart technologies, other things that you could call out incorporated into these new facilities? To what extent are new processes, technologies driving efficiency gains let's say in \u201918 and beyond? And I guess near-term to what extent does it represent the temporary disruptions to the processes that your leaner workforce now needs to get up to speed on leveraging or just working with new tools introduced in plant? Thanks.","Mark Blinn","It\u2019s a really good question, because if you think in terms of technology within our manufacturing capability, for those of you who joined in a rally a couple of years ago you saw some sophisticated computerized machinery. And why is that important? Well, one because if you think about the precision around the process conditions and the engineering drawings and the castings, much higher level of precision, less graph, more efficiency, better tolerances. I think the other thing is if you look at the labor associated with that, the labor force is changing. We still have some fewer than we did before but we have some old vertical and horizontal lays in our plant and that is an art, and the individual who has been doing it for the 30 or 40 years and the chance for error is higher.","So, yes in our facilities that we've been standing up, we have much more efficient computerized machinery that's doing a lot of the manufacturing for us. If you are talking about technology within our product, absolutely, and we always have maintained the product matters because that's where the process conditions are determined, that's we're the algorithms are created from, that's where you can put the sensors in. I mean it is really the intelligence of the operation that passes along to DCS system. So on both ends, technology has been very important and it will help us both in manufacturing and in selling our products.","The last expansion is just using technology in terms of computers to sell to customers. Increasingly now, especially on the run rate business, customers want to be able to go online, configure the product, order it and our commercial organization and sales organization have been working very hard, it's a big beneficiary when we get in that place it's going to be IPD.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","I\u2019ll echo everyone else's sentiment and say best of luck going forward, Mark. So, a lot of ground covered, but just wondered, given what's going on with the realignment in IPD, are margins up in Q1 relative to the 4.7% from last year? Should we expect that they are up?","Mark Blinn","To my comment earlier, I don\u2019t want to give any quarterly guidance. And we talked earlier in terms of what exit margins could be. I'll go back to, in the IPD business, we still think that we can -- and that is the business it should be at 14% to 15% levels. How and when we get there? I mean, obviously, if the market were to ramp up quickly over the next quarter, that's going to help you. But in terms of, operationally, we have certainly turned the corner but not completely in terms of improving that business and in bring it back to levels it should, keeping in mind that our most, two of our most profitable largest revenue plans were impacted, as Tom described.","So I think around expectations it's getting those processes in place -- let's all the market aside at this point in time continuing to improve that winning back our customers, which will help top line add to the market, driving more efficiency. When a plant gets chocked, it can become -- it impacts margins dramatically. So, I think I just want to give you some context. But I will take a step back moment, the person who is doing this has done this before, and with great success and that's Tom Pajonas.","John Walsh","And then a larger-picture question, one of your competitors actually talked about seeing a little bit more increased China competition on the aftermarket business. Not sure if you\u2019re seeing that, if they\u2019re being more aggressive. Any color there that you can provide would be helpful.","Mark Blinn","Not really. If you look at the some of the equipment that we operate, it's fairly sophisticated. I don't know what competitor you're referring to. But no we haven't seen it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Thanks, Jay, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Flowserve delivered solid operational and financial results in the quarter; with strong bookings, revenue growth, and continued margin expansion. At a high level, I am pleased with the progress we've made to improve our visibility in oversight across our operations. This was the second consecutive quarter that each of our segments delivered on their targets and avoided the type of unforeseen issues that negatively impacted earnings in the past.","Our confidence in our ability to set expectations, drive results, and deliver value for our customers, and shareholders has continued to grow with our progress. We believe we are building momentum heading into next year, as highlighted by our ability to deliver two consecutive solid quarters. As a result, we increased our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.65 to $1.75. We will go into this in more detail later in the call.","We are encouraged by our progress, but recognize that we still have a lot of work in front of us. We're still in the early months of our multiyear Flowserve 2.0 initiative to transform our operating model, and we are now moving full speed ahead with our efforts to build a performance and accountability-driven culture that will drive the enhanced value that we believe is inherent within Flowserve.","Let me briefly touch on some of the highlights of the quarter before going into greater detail. Our adjusted EPS of $0.49 was up 20% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Revenues grew almost 8% compared to the 2017 third quarter, with improvement in both adjusted gross and operating margins. Bookings growth across all segments drove our overall book-to-bill ratio to 1.06 for the quarter, highlighted by strong original equipment and aftermarket bookings. Our end markets continue to strengthen and we now fully expect to capitalize on the opportunities that are in front of us.","Turning now to the detail on bookings. For the first time since the third quarter of 2015, we produced bookings over $1 billion in consecutive quarters. Overall, we delivered broad-based bookings growth in all industries we serve, with the exception of the power sector. Bookings grew 13.2% year-over-year, which includes a 2% headwind from currency and divestitures. Our bookings were primarily from smaller original equipment awards of less than $5 million and are focused on the aftermarket. Additionally, we were awarded some larger original equipment work in the refinery space that was driven by the change in regulation for refined shipping fuels.","After three years of constrained maintenance spend, we have seen increased MRO spending over the last three quarters as our customers look to properly maintain their facilities. Our third quarter aftermarket bookings of $507 million represents the highest level since 2014 and was up nearly 12% year-over-year. An important aspect of our transformational efforts is to further capitalize on our significant installed base and our vast network of quick response centers. While we continue to see large projects move toward FID, Flowserve is a late cycle beneficiary of larger project work. We remain encouraged by the increased visibility we have into those opportunities and believe that many of these will come into fruition in 2019 and 2020.","Over the last several months, our confidence has increased regarding what is in the pipeline and when we'll likely to see increased project bookings. While forecasting any one quarter of bookings is always a challenge, we are optimistic our approved end markets, active quoting funnel, and solid capture rate will continue to support increased bookings for the fourth quarter, generating a healthy backlog going into 2019.","Looking now at the third quarter bookings by end markets, and starting with our largest market, oil and gas, bookings increased 27% year-over-year driven by EPD's 34% increase. We continue to expect increased investment by our customers based on their pre-FEED, and FEED activities, and projects progressing towards FID. Flowserve has also had success with, and provides a unique offering of highly-engineered products that are well-suited to enhance the processes critical to cleaner fuels. We anticipate that many of our downstream customers will pursue this type of investment due to the ongoing regulatory changes such as IMO 2020. FCD's oil and gas bookings contributed nearly 20% growth, including several small, mid and downstream awards, while IPD's oil and gas bookings were roughly flat.","In chemicals, our bookings increased approximately 4%, with all segments delivering growth. IPD led the group with a 12% year-over-year improvement, EPD contributed 4% growth, while FCD's bookings grew 1%. Both FCD and IPD orders benefit from participating in a North American chemical project where we expect to see continued investment both near and long-term. Our project pipeline includes significant expected ethylene investment in Asia, the Middle East and North America as these projects progress towards FID.","Flowserve's power bookings decreased 27% year-over-year, and remains our most challenged market. Each of our segments' power bookings this quarter declined year-over-year by about the same percentage. We continue to have muted expectations in the power markets near-term. There are a few fossil fuel and nuclear opportunities in Asia, but Western nuclear and traditional power generation markets remain challenged and competitive.","General industry bookings increased 3%, driven by strong distribution activity. FCD's bookings grew over 24% and was partially offset by EPD's 18% decline, while IPD contributed roughly 3% growth. The efforts in the distribution channel delivered strength from all regions, with the exception of the Middle East. Mining, food and beverage, and pulp and paper were all up over 5% on solid broad-based market activity, but these markets only represent about 5% of our business. Lastly, the water industry, which represents the smallest category we break out on a standalone basis, was up 67% year-over-year and represented about 6% of our total bookings. While this is a small market for Flowserve, the growth rate is encouraging.","Geographically, Europe and Asia Pacific grew 27% and 26%, respectively. And Latin America continues to improve, up 14%, its third consecutive quarter of growth. North America was up 3%, while the Middle East and Africa declined 6% versus its highest quarter of bookings in 2017.","Turning now to our performance by segment, IPD's performance continued to improve in the third quarter, delivering a 320-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margin, leveraging a modest 5% revenue increase. While IPD is making progress, margin improvement again was restrained by the shipment of low margin past due backlog that we are continuing to clear. We also completed the previously announced divestiture of two non-core and low margin product lines early in the third quarter, which negatively impacted IPD's revenue by about 5%.","We expect another meaningful step in the fourth quarter in our efforts to deliver our target of mid to upper single-digit operating margins. While progress in IPD's turnaround has been slower than we would like, the structural and sustainable improvements we are pursuing are critical to achieving its full potential in mid-teens margin business over the longer term. EPD delivered 10% revenue growth in the quarter compared to the prior year on strong original equipment and aftermarket shipments. That included a 2% sales mix shift towards lower margin original equipment shipments. Continued improvement in EPD's manufacturing process drove an adjusted gross margin increase of 10 basis points despite the mix shift headwinds.","FCD continued its solid operating performance driving significant incremental margin improvement on 6.4% sales growth. Adjusted gross and operating margins increased 210 basis points and 290 basis points respectively year-over-year. FCD's 18.6% operating margin included increased fixed cost absorption, positive product mix shift and continued strong cost control. From an overall market perspective, we are optimistic that our improved visibility to the growing project pipeline provides meaningful late cycle growth opportunities to complement our foundational run rate and aftermarket business.","As we pursue this growth, we intend to continue our focus on better execution, which will result in improved product costs and lower overhead costs. Our transformation actions and operating improvement initiatives position Flowserve to better capitalize on the market recovery, while delivering value for our customers and shareholders.","I'll now turn it over to Lee to discuss our financial results in greater detail, and then I'll return for a few closing comments before we open the call to Q&A. Lee?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.49, modestly above our expectations coming into the quarter. On a reported EPS basis, we earned $0.21 per share, which includes adjusted items comprised of $0.20 of realignment and transformation expenses, $0.04 of charges related to previously announced divestitures, and $0.03 of below-the-line FX expense.","Third quarter sales of $953 million, increased 7.8% versus prior year, which included a modest benefit from the new accounting standard that was largely offset by the approximate 2% headwind from currency and divested assets. We do believe the new revenue accounting standard and the associated increase in our POC accounting has helped to mitigate some of our traditional earnings seasonality. Breaking down our revenue by mix, our original equipment sales increased 11.8% as compared to the 2017 third quarter, while aftermarket sales increased 3.9% to $457 million, representing 48% of our total revenue for the quarter.","Looking now at gross margins. At 33.2%, our adjusted gross margin was up 130 basis points versus the prior year's third quarter and reached the highest level we've seen in nearly two years. Volume leverage, better execution as well as our cost initiatives are key drivers behind this improvement. We are also confident that the quality of our backlog has increased during the year. We know, however, that there are more opportunities ahead on these fronts. Continued tight cost control and improved sales leverage drove a 30-basis-point decrease in adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to 22.6%, more than offsetting compensation headwinds. On a reported basis, SG&A is elevated due to the quarter's transformation expense which we expect to see decline in future periods.","Third quarter adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points to 11% driven by strong 320-basis-point and 290-basis-point improvements in IPD and FCD respectively, which are partially offset by EPD's 40-basis-point decline and a 2% sales mix shift toward lower margin OE versus prior year. On a reported basis, operating margin decreased 200 basis points primarily related to transformation costs at corporate. Our reported effective tax rate of 33.6% was elevated in the third quarter primarily due to losses in foreign operations for which there was no tax benefit. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.8%, again, modestly above our full year adjusted guidance range.","Turning to cash, operating cash flow for the quarter were $83 million, representing a substantial increase of $57 million compared to the 2017 third quarter, driven by an improvement in working capital. This marks the second consecutive quarter with meaningful year-over-year improvement. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $65 million or $0.49 per share and was up over $50 million from the prior year. This total amount represents a conversion rate of over 100% of our adjusted net income. At September 30, we also continue to maintain a strong cash balance at over $0.5 billion. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $80 million, up about $7 million from a year ago. The increase is primarily related to enabling technology investments as part of our Flowserve 2.0, as well as some increased spending on ongoing restructuring initiatives. We also returned $25 million during the quarter to shareholders through dividends.","We are pleased with the quarter's total working capital improvement of approximately $50 million over last year, especially considering our 2018 revenue growth. We know much work remains ahead to achieve consistent level of cash flow conversion that we believe Flowserve can ultimately deliver. While the company has understood the need for working capital improvement for several years now, Flowserve 2.0 will serve as the catalyst to impact lasting change. We are investing in systems and process tools, directed all aspects of our order to cash and sales and operating planning processes. Obtaining a sustainable fix won't be quick or easy but it's an effort worth pursuing given the substantial opportunity available. I look forward to sharing additional detail on our efforts with you at our upcoming Analyst Day.","Turning to our outlook, for the remainder of 2018, our solid results and the momentum gained over the last two quarters positions Flowserve well as we look ahead. Accordingly, we now expect 2018 full year adjusted EPS in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share on revenue growth of 5% to 7%, including a roughly 1% FX tailwind, largely offset by approximately 1% negative impact due to divestitures. Due to the new accounting rules, we don't expect to see the traditional seasonality in the fourth quarter as in years past.","As our guidance implies, however, we do expect to end the year with another solid quarter. From a 2018 cash usage perspective, we expect to return approximately $100 million through dividends to our shareholders. Capital expenditures are now expected in the $70 million to $80 million range. Although our expected 2018 CapEx guidance is down slightly, we do continue to invest in technology to support Flowserve 2.0 as we saw this quarter as well as improving our manufacturing productivity. We also expect full year debt repayment of approximately $60 million and to contribute approximately $30 million to our global pension plans, mainly to cover our ongoing service cost as the U.S. plans remain largely fully funded.","Let me now turn us back to Scott for his closing remarks.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Great. Thank you, Lee. As we wrap up, I'd like to spend a few minutes updating you on the progress of our transformational efforts. Shortly after I joined Flowserve, I laid out the case for organizational, operating and cultural improvements that were necessary to simplify and increase the effectiveness of our business model. Under the Flowserve 2.0 transformation program, we now have major initiatives underway to drive value and improve across six key work streams: operations, commercial, growth, aftermarket, cost structure, and working capital. We have a designated and full-time team leading this effort, and we brought in external advisors to help us build our capability and assist with skill set gaps and world-class thinking.","The team has built our value capture plan and is running the program with the tools that you would expect from an initiative with this scale. While we're beginning to see some initial financial benefits impacting our results, we are still in the early stages of the transformational program. We are confident that Flowserve's performance will improve in 2019 and beyond, and that our efforts will result in significant financial improvement in the coming years. I'm very pleased with the current transformation progress, the engagement and commitment of our associates, and our focus on taking the proper actions to drive value.","In addition to the performance aspect of the transformation, we are also highly focused on the health of the Flowserve enterprise and the engagement of our associates. I truly believe that an informed, engaged and empowered workforce is critical to driving the systemic change that we are seeking for Flowserve. When I joined, our associate engagement levels were not where they needed to be to undertake this type of transformational change. We have seen a marked improvement in this metric and our employees are committed to the change we are pursuing together. The transformation is serving as the catalyst to fundamentally change the way we think, act and operate at Flowserve.","We are clearly gaining traction and momentum, but it's important to remember that we are still early on this journey. I am truly optimistic on what Flowserve can become and the value we can deliver to our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. Flowserve will be hosting an analyst event on December 13 in New York City. We'll provide additional details on the event later this month. We certainly hope to see many of you there as we share additional details on the Flowserve 2.0 and our expectation for value creation going forward.","Operator, we have now concluded our prepared comments and would now like to open the call to any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And our first question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Good morning, Charley.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, just the commentary on the working capital and the systems you're putting in place, can you get a little more granular on kind of what you guys are doing specifically to drive that working capital improvement you're expecting over the next year or two, I guess?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. Let me start and then I'll let Lee go into some of the specifics, but I talked about this before, working capital clearly isn't where we want it to be and we knew we've got to do a lot of things to fix it. Unfortunately, with the decentralization at Flowserve when we started, it's been more difficult than I expected to drive the systemic processes and the systems that ultimately get us to where we want to be. We put this within the Flowserve 2.0 and what I'd say is, in the last kind of year, it's been a lot more around visibility and brute force and we're getting some improvement around that. And now, we're really switching it into a much more of a process focus and the system enhancement. So, Lee, you want to add anything?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'll speak a little bit more about A\/R. I mean, we are pleased with the improvement at DSO year-over-year and sequentially, but we know we have a significant amount of work to do. I would say a lot of our progress to-date has been manual and with a lot of intensity. For example, I do a weekly cash call. We've given cash targets to our business and we track how much cash we should collect every week through the quarter, but very manual and very intense. Going forward with 2.0, our aspiration is to have a more systematic fix, so it does not take as much time for management.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Then on the inventory side, which is probably the biggest prize, we've made progress and we're doing reasonably well and as revenues go up, we've been able to hold our inventory levels. But there's still a lot more work to be done here. We've got an organization now in place that's focused on planning and materials management. And now, we're moving to the process and systems side to really start to drive that in a better fashion than we have in the past.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. And just one more from me, on the refined fuels regulations that are coming into play, it sounds like you guys are seeing some decent pickup in work on that. I'm just wondering if you can maybe expand on the level of activity that you guys specifically are seeing and do you expect any of that to carry \u2013 how farther into 2020, or is it more 2019, just given the timing of when the stuff has to get shipped and then installed?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. So, we've got a really nice product mix on the pump side for taking the refined fuels and making them a little bit cleaner than they are today. And so it is a sweet spot for us. We've got some bookings last quarter and then we saw a pretty significant uplift this quarter in that level of bookings. And we expect that to continue for the next at least two quarters, maybe even three. So, we feel pretty good about this area and what we're trying to do is use some of the technology that is preferred and then start to bundle that with some of our valves and other pumps as they're building out and expanding their existing refineries. So, this is a good space for us and we benefited in the quarter and we very much expect to see future work here in 2019.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Andy.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Scott, OE bookings up 15% year-over-year is the best you've seen this cycle. You already mentioned IMO 2020 bookings. But can you talk about the conversations you're having with your customers? There's obviously a lot of cross-currents out there, maybe more difficult U.S.-Saudi relationship that's (24:23) tariff tension. But it seems like you're still seeing improving activities. So, would you generally characterize your customers as constructive here with getting projects over the finish line? And you did say last quarter that there would be projects that could get to FID by the end of the year. Have you seen these projects begin to move forward?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I think constructive is probably the best word to use. As you know and you said it, there's a lot of challenges. There's a lot of headwinds out there. There's political issues. There's geopolitics and other cost issues, but I think overall, I think the environment is reasonably good for moving forward the big projects. And so, while I think everyone has an air of caution, I think the commodity markets and the political environment is stable enough to where folks are willing to step forward and commit things into FID and move forward. And so, all the discussions I've had points to a 2019 that should be pretty solid in terms of projects and we should see another nice growth from 2018 into 2019.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And just on the topic of 2019, I know you don't want to go into too much color at this point. But could you give us some of the puts and takes when we look at your margin and specifically focused on your adjusted incremental margin. If we assume the base in 2018, it looks like it's something in the mid-20% range. When we look at 2019, I think you've already said that you expect to see better absorption and incrementals, even if OE mix increases a bit, given Flowserve 2.0. So, if I think about that, if I think about price versus cost, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but maybe a net modest positive even though there will be tariff noise. And then incentive comp, I think it's higher in 2018, right, so maybe it's flattish in 2019. So, is there anything I'm missing there as I think about the puts and takes? And so, would incrementals rise then in 2019 versus 2018?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So, I'll just start with we're not ready to give guidance yet for 2019, but we will be doing that. And we're currently in our budgeting process. But I mean you've hit all of the big things that we ask, and are challenging our platforms to deliver. Now, the only thing I would say is in addition to that, we've got the transformation program across these work streams that, in theory and as we've seen this start to work, should be driving outsized benefit than just what we see from the macro picture. And so, my expectation is that we move forward in each of the categories, and that 2019 is a pretty good year for us. But what I'd say is, yeah, we'll do the investor event in December, and we'll outline the bigger picture. We probably won't go in the 2019 details during that session, but then quickly in the new year, we'll provide guidance for 2019.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, and just one quick follow-up on this year's guidance. You mentioned last quarter that your aspirations for performance were higher than your guidance. Is your new guidance closer to your aspiration at this point or your aspiration is still higher?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I would say we're definitely closer. There were some things in the quarter that I wasn't pleased with, and I'd say it's more around the past due backlog and the working capital. But I think on the revenue and the cost side, we're progressing as I would have liked and kind of toward our internal targets there. I think probably the biggest thing in the quarter for us is \u2013 in my first few quarters here, we would have a pretty major surprise each and every quarter. And for the last two quarters, we've eliminated and not had those big negative surprises, so that is definitely a positive step. But I think we're starting to perform like I would like and expect, but we've got a lot of work to go and it's a journey for us.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. Nice quarter you, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more on past due backlogs by segment particularly what you saw in the September month.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","I'm sorry in the September month or in the quarter?","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. Well, in the quarter...","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","...but speaking with the gents last night, it seemed as if and maybe I mistook this but it sounds as if like there were some things that maybe went in the wrong direction in September into...","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'm sorry, let me just talk about as a quarter and you'll get a general idea here. I just said this, I'm not as pleased as I would like to be on our progress on past due backlog and there are a lot of reasons for that. But I'll just start, again, we didn't have a major negative surprise or a significant event that changed our thinking and our progress there. And I will say, we are making progress on past due backlogs but it is not as meaningful or step changes as I would have liked.","And so, basically, if we look at kind of what's going on is we had some large more challenging orders that we took at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year. And for whatever reason, they've been constrained in our system and we're working through that. The previous issues that we've talked about due to realignment are for the most part behind us. And now, we kind of fixed some of those problems and we're addressing some of the bigger projects that didn't come out. And then when you look by a platform basis, IPD did progress which was a very good sign, and we're happy to see that. EPD and the valve business did not progress and actually went backwards just a little bit.","And so when we look at it in the quarter, July and August, we were making progress. We did take a step backwards in September and then what I would say is I've gotten the preliminary numbers for October and we've already cleared a lot of the stuff that we saw that got stuck there at the end of September for us. But look, this is one that we've got to fix. And unfortunately, it's not a quick fix because it really goes down to planning and materials management, and it's just not been a focus or a competency at Flowserve. And so we stood up this new manufacturing department. We did that in February with designated resources, and we created a central planning office here in the headquarters building. And then we've hired a new VP of Operations that started in July.","And so what we've now done, we've got the people in the organization in place, we've put a very structured process, and we're really moving toward a robust sales and operational planning process that will launch in 2019. And then we're going to really get focused on the production planning and materials management side. And so I'm very confident that we are making progress. It's not at the pace that I want to, and I do think by 2019, this will not be an issue for Flowserve.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you. My follow up with that would be around really the fourth quarter implied sales guidance, which is I guess maybe a little bit confusing because on a full year basis of 5% to 7% revenue growth, my math says plus 4% to minus 4% and I know that there's FX going the other way on you and now there's this divestiture going the other way on you. But could you kind of give us a little bit more color on that range which not only is wide but also has half of it is on the negative side of the ledger?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, sure. We'll let Lee do it. He's got a bridge here that can clarify.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So our implied fourth quarter guidance is roughly flat on a reported basis, reflecting the smoothing of our historical fourth quarter seasonality due to revenue recognition. That's the big thing you need to remember is in 2017 fourth quarter increased 17% versus third quarter and we're not expecting that type of transition. So, the other thing I would highlight is organic growth is roughly around 3% in the fourth quarter when you include that roughly 2% currency headwind and 1% of divested businesses. So right now, the big change I think this quarter versus prior quarter is the accounting basically smoothes our revenue during the year. So as I mentioned earlier, what we think is based on our guidance is that revenue will be roughly flat versus last year.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's really helpful, Lee. Thank you. And if I can just sneak one more in here, and you were talking about earlier that you see a good or reasonably good operating environment. I was just wondering if you could kind of bring that same sort of thinking, a comment to bear on the emerging markets, which is a good chunk of your business and if you could just give us an idea as the quarter progressed how bookings in the emerging markets went for you? Thanks.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Are you talking about Q3, Scott?","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, yes.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, in Q3, we had healthy bookings primarily in Asia, and we're seeing a lot of activity both in Asia and the Middle East. And so I'd say as we go forward, those are the two areas that probably drive the biggest growth on the project side and it's something that we're very focused on and we've got good teams there. And so in Q3, we got pretty much what we wanted in terms of the opportunities on projects there. And then from an aftermarket standpoint, we're doing really well in emerging markets and we expect to continue to do that with our large presence with QRCs and focus in country.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Josh.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just want to jump in on some of the mix within EPD. I guess, given how bookings have generally trended solid, Scott, I think it's on your prepared comments talked about aftermarket being solid and coming in well. I would think given the pretty wide spread there between the OE side of the business and the aftermarket particularly seal that we start to see a bit more of a pickup there on margins. Is that something you expect to start happening going forward? Can you just give us any context for mix both in the quarter and kind of looking out over the next several?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. Yeah. So, the EPD margin in the quarter actually, we were relatively pleased with where we ended up. And so when you look at the year, we've been moving margins up quarter-over-quarter through the year. I think when you look at it against last year, we were down slightly.","But I think there was an aftermarket mix there. And then in addition to that, we had some increased SG&A in that platform and a lot of that was around incentive comp and then also higher R&D. And so, I would say in the engineered side, it's an area that we've under invested in our product portfolio and it's a place that we actually really need to spend more money and make sure that we've got the right products for the right solutions and really have a refreshed product out there as we're competing against some of our more hungry peer group.","And then, the other thing I just want to remind you. If you remember last year in the fourth quarter, EPD's margins dropped substantially. And so what we're really focused on and trying to do is make sure that we're avoiding that step backwards. And at this point, I think fourth quarter will be a similar trajectory as to what we saw our margins in Q3.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And just shifting over to FCD, kind of the other side of the equation, clearly very strong quarter and these have popped up from time-to-time where it just surprises everybody to the upside. I mean, what's your sense for the cadence there? Does that smooth out and is some of that revenue recognition related that would cause that smoothing? Just trying to get a sense for any visibility you have there on what that could look like, especially with the tough comps.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. All right. So let's start \u2013 we'll just say, FCD had a great quarter and that team is highly focused, they're doing everything that we expect. They're ahead on the price curve side. We've got price increases that really took hold earlier in the year, and then the facilities for the most part are operating at a pretty high level. And so they're just doing solid fundamentals and running the business how we would expect and want them to run that.","I would say third quarter was a high margin quarter but when you go back and look at 2017 in the fourth quarter, they really had an outsized quarter there. And what I would say is we don't expect that big jump again in fourth quarter. But I think if you kind of look at Q2, Q3 and say \u2013 and take an average there and say that's a run rate, then that's probably a good number to look at as we go forward.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. And then just one more, I want to make sure I'm clear on Lee's revenue recognition comment. Was there any positive effect of that smoothing in the other three quarters as 4Q gets kind of smoothed to the downside? Just want to make sure we're clear on that?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So you may recall on the first quarter, we recognized roughly $70 million. There was a difference between ASC 606 and ASC 605 of about $70 million. Second quarter, it was about $10 million, in this quarter it was about $24 million. My expectation is that that should flip in the fourth quarter but we'll find out.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey Deane.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Hey. Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. I would like to get an update on price cost, where you expect to come in for the year. You just gave that shout out to FCD that they're ahead of the game. But broadly, what the challenges have been. I know you don't give a lot of detail on price but just if you aggregate price cost where that stands and what tariff impact that you've seen so far?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. Yeah. So obviously, it's been an incredibly dynamic environment and a lot of changes this year. So let me start with inflation. I'll hit tariffs. But on the inflation side, we are seeing inflation on the material and on labor and so that's an area that we're very focused on. We're trying to neutralize and protect against that.","And then on the tariff side, we are being impacted but what I would say is it's a relatively small number for all of Flowserve. And so, while they're out there and we watch it very carefully and we're watching it closely, at this point the tariffs have had a minor impact to our total cost structure.","And then on the pricing side, if you remember, we did two early price increases. We did a general one at the beginning of the year and then we did a tariff specific one right as we ended the first quarter and into the second quarter. And then the other part of that would be the engineered-to-order business. And on the engineered-to-order business, this is where we're building the cost stop at the time of the proposal. And on that side, we can definitely make sure that we've got inflation and tariff impact priced into that bid.","And so right now across the board in all of our platforms, we feel that we're on the positive side of the price cost curve. And you're seeing that in our gross margins as we've kind of been able to keep that and actually progress it each quarter this year. And so, we're obviously turning the quarter now and we're looking at next year. We are concerned about inflation and we're concerned about other things that could change in the geopolitical landscape.","But I don't think that changes next year in terms of being ahead of the curve and so we're looking at what our price increases should be and we'll probably be pretty active in getting that out there and ultimately we want to be a price leader here, right. So we want to be in front of it and driving that as we go forward.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And about tariffs?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So tariff, again, tariffs were a minimal impact for us and so it's out there and what we've been able to do is, we've neutralized it with price but then our supply chain has also been able to migrate out of certain countries and into others to where we neutralize that impact.","And so again, we feel we're on the positive side of any tariff impact. And while it's a concern and it could change any day and it's something that we watch incredibly closely. At this point, we feel good about our position and we're in a good place and we'll continue to monitor and we will adjust in 2019 if needed.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then, just as a follow-up on the end market discussion given how well you've done in oil and gas for this quarter. There were some competitors who struggled and it just seems like you've also taken some share this quarter. Is that a fair assessment and can you give any color there please.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. No. I would agree we took share in the quarter. There were also some things that we missed in the quarter as well. But I think oil and gas for us has done really well. It's primarily in the downstream side and so most of our orders there were downstream and, quite frankly, were refineries. And so in that space, we've got a pretty unique product offering that does very well. And so, we got our share of the awards and certainly did better than what we've been doing in the first half of this year or even last year. So, that's a nice spot for us. And any time we've got brownfield expansions where we've got an installed base, we typically do pretty well.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Looking forward to the meeting in December. Thanks.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","All right. We'll see you there, Deane. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, maybe just kind of following up on that point. Obviously, like big focal point here are the oil and gas orders coming back. Just can you maybe just talk a little bit again around like the pricing discipline around the orders and what you're seeing in the marketplace today? Any color there would be helpful.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Sure. So, I'll say oil and gas specifically will stay there. And again, primarily that was refinery and refining for us in the quarter. And we've got a pretty good basket of products that fit that market really well. And so, we feel good about the margins that we achieved in Q3.","Now, what I would also say is when we don't have a preferred offering or we don't have the installed base in that existing site and it's a greenfield tender, we are still seeing really competitive prices on our engineered pump side. And I would say it's a little bit surprising with me, given the uplift in the market activity now for the past couple quarters. And I fully expect that that pricing should improve across the peer set here as we go into 2019. But it's still competitive. And then, if I apply that onto the valve side, the engineered valves is still an incredibly competitive space for pricing.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful, Scott. I mean, have you found yourself walking away from some orders because of this pricing dynamic in some of the segments, sub-segments that you talked about?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, so I touched on that a lot after the Q1 or in the Q1 earnings call. And what I would say is our team is very focused and we're not afraid to walk away from work that doesn't make sense for us. And we obviously need to look at it holistically and we need to look at what the aftermarket brings in all of that. But there are jobs and there are orders that we walked away from this quarter because we weren't there.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. That's helpful. If I could ask one more. Just on the dynamics with revenue recognition and seasonally not seeing the same kind of step up into 4Q, are there any impacts that you would see to cash flow as well? So I'm just trying to understand like how we should think about the cash flow number for the year specifically because 4Q tends to be a big quarter for you guys?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'll let Lee jump in on that one.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So our expectation is that we'll have really strong cash flow in the quarter. Typically, what's happened is there's obviously a lot of shipments that happen in the quarter, a lot of stuff, as Scott's talked about in the past, as we clear up past due backlog. So what I suspect was going to happen is we're going to see a lot of shipments go out, we're going to be invoicing a lot of customers. I think you'll see a mix between assets going out of contract assets into receivables, and we're going to work hard to collect those receivables. But our expectation is that we're going to have a strong cash quarter.","Last year was really strong. We did, I think over $200 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. I'm not sure if we're going to do that high but I suspect we're going to be pretty strong versus third quarter.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. And then just to clarify, right, the 606 accounting really is around revenue recognition and should not impact what we expect on cash flow in Q4.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, I think you've had two really strong order quarters, but larger projects have been largely absent. What are you just seeing from a visibility as you move into 2019 on some of the larger projects?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I think what I'd say is, we didn't get any large ones that were \u2013 the Hengli and Dangote size. But we did get a handful of projects, primarily in refining, that were more than what we had been seeing over the last couple quarters. And so, we felt good about the projects that we got in Q3.","And then as we look at 2019, our pipeline and kind of what we see out there at our customers that are either in-FEED or pre-FEED activities is definitely higher than what it was at this time last year. And so, we feel pretty good about the project pipeline.","And again, although, there's a lot of kind of dynamics out there in the geopolitical sense and we've got oil prices coming down a little bit here in the last month, I think our customers are still willing to move forward with some larger projects, just because they haven't really done that now in the last four years. And so, we see projects next year at higher level than what we have this year in 2018.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then clearly, some progress on Flowserve 2.0 and seeing better trends, just as you kind of see yourself shifting maybe from defense to more on offense, just how are you maybe refreshing on M&A, and capital allocation in terms of maybe starting to return more cash to shareholders through buybacks? Thanks.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. That's a great question. And no, quite frankly, I'm not ready to make that transition to offense. And I love the analogy, but clearly right now, we're focused on blocking and tackling. We're focused on execution. We're focused on generating more cash flow. And so, what I'd say is our heads are down right now and we're really trying to stabilize and improve our margins and improve our operating consistency and our operating performance.","With that said, at some point, we've got to switch gears here. And I don't know when that happens and obviously having two relatively good quarters and solid performance starts to give us more confidence. But what I'd say is we're not quite there at this point.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. See you next month.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sounds good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Steve.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Jay. Just wanted confirm, you guys said on the last conference call that you were supposed to clear a pretty large past due project from EPD in the third quarter. Is that the one that you said on this call cleared in October?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I didn't want to get into specifics on certain projects but, yes, we thought we're going clear in September. It didn't and we've got \u2013 we now have visibility and that's gone in the month of October.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I think you also said on this call that the margins in EPD in Q4 would be similar to Q3. I'm just wondering if that's a lower margin project because it's past due, would that naturally just depress the margins in that segment, or is there something that you're offsetting that with and if so, is it cost structure, is it more just the better margins that are coming through backlog.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. No. I think \u2013 again, Q3 margins for EPD weren't bad, right. If you look at the year-over-year, they weren't great, but I mean you had a mix shift and we had more incentive comp, but we had higher R&D which are all things that needed to happen in that platform. And we've moved margins up every quarter in 2018, and we fully expect to continue to expand margins for EPD. But if you look back to what happened in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a really bad step down in gross margins and operating income.","And what I was saying is we don't expect to have that drop back in this fourth quarter of this year.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just on the power side of things, you listed in your slides a few drivers, be it thermal solar, nuclear upgrade. Are these big enough to stabilize the bookings, and if so, when do you think we could see those bookings kind of stabilize on a year-over-year basis?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I would love to say the answer to that is, yes, but it's no. We've got a \u2013 those were the only green shoots we could find in the power industry out there. And so we do have a unique and a preferred offering for concentrated solar power. We just don't have a big project list there to overcome the declines in the rest of the power market. And then on the nuclear side, we're getting aftermarket and there's a few things, but it's just not enough to give back. And I just think power is a \u2013 it's a very challenged market. I think it will remain challenged in 2019 and hopefully we'll start to see some improvement there in 2020 and beyond.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey guys. Good morning.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Hey Joe.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. So on the past due backlog, I know we talked a lot about it. But are you confident that you've identified like the root cause of these things? I'm a little surprised to hear that it's coming from stuff you booked late last year. Like is this a business problem where you shouldn't have been taking these projects at all or is it more of a behavioral issue? Do you feel like you're pricing them appropriately given the complexity? Maybe you can give some color there.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. Yeah. It is \u2013 unfortunately, it's a broad comment and there's not one issue and each of our plant has slightly different issues. And again, what I'd say is we've got a lot of attention and focus on this that really wasn't the case two years ago or even a year ago. And we stood up this manufacturing group that started in February. So, we've got BP as the manufacturing and operations in each of our platforms, and we've got a planning organization that is now really focused on the blocking and tackling of production planning, and improving longer-term planning with sales and operational planning.","And so, I actually feel that we've made progress. It just didn't come through in the quarter. I think we'll see a nice drop here in the fourth quarter. And I'd say by kind of mid into next year, this will not be an issue for Flowserve. And so, we've got organization in place. We've started to put the proper processes in place to make sure we're doing the right things.","And then ultimately, we switched the systems, tools and visibilities that make sure that this is \u2013 doesn't go backwards as Flowserve continues to grow. And so, I do think we made progress, but again, it's been a painful area for us, and it's one that I'm highly focused on, and I spend a lot of time in our facilities talking through the challenges and what they need to do to get this corrected as we go forward.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's fair. On the CapEx side, are you surprised to be cutting CapEx numbers here? I know you're being very targeted in where you're putting capital on the far side, which is good. Are there bottlenecks to deploying growth capital as you kind of go through the process here?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","No. I really think it's more just being really, really disciplined. And last year was the first year when Lee and I kind of went through this process, and there's a lot on the wish list from our group, and we weren't sure kind of what was real and what was needed. And so, what I'd say is, I'm actually pleased that we've restrained the spending this year, and it's not going to impede our ability to grow. And what I would say is the investment focus this year has really been around enterprise-wide systems to fix systemic problems like past due backlog and ability to work things across our enterprise.","And so, most of the spending this year was in IT and around enterprise systems. We actually \u2013 we just went live with our enterprise-wide CRM system this month \u2013 or in October. And we've now \u2013 we're in the process of putting an enterprise-wide PLM or engineering system and we've just launched our ERP program and projects on this. And so what I'd say is, we'll get into a little more detail in December about what our strategy is around systems and really trying to drive an enterprise focus.","But back to capital, I'm actually pleased that we're able to be a little more discrete on what we spend our money on. The number makes sense and what I'd say for next year is we'll need to move that up a little bit as we start to really sharpen our pencils on the needed things around our operations and around growth. But we'll nudge that number up in 2019 and continue the investment on enterprise-wide systems.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just last for me and kind of an extension on that. As you've gone through this, have any parts of the business come up, later where you're saying, well, now you have a better understanding of what you're going to need to do to spend to make them successful, that maybe we're not the right owners, that maybe things that weren't up for divestiture six months ago, now you're realizing that it's not where we want to deploy capital?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. No, I think it's a great question, and the more I learn about our business and the more I learn about what we can do really well and the things that we can't. We're constantly reevaluating our portfolio and what we want to take forward. So what I'd say is there's no major divestiture plans at this point, but there's probably a handful of things that are relatively small that are more of a distraction and could probably be better suited in somebody else's hands. But these won't be big needle movers but it'll actually allow us to be much more focused on the things that we do really well on, and focus more on servicing our customers and providing profitable returns.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the bigger jobs that you talked about growing FID and it sounds like there's a couple of buckets of refined fuels and LNG. Is there anything else that you're kind of looking at?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I think the two we're most excited about are LNG and the IMO 2020 upgrades on refined fuels. So, those would probably be the two biggest categories into 2019. The other thing is, yeah, we're starting to see some green shoots on the upstream production side. And so, we've historically done well on production facilities, and that's been an incredibly depressed market here for the last four years. And so that would be an area that we would hope to increase as we go into 2019 but it'll probably be in the back half of 2019.","And then the other area that we are getting more and more excited about is just the North American midstream. And so with that, I think interstate pipeline and then terminals and storage. And so, there's clearly a build-out there. And what I would say is, we kind of looked away from that market historically and now it's one that we've now turned more of an attention to, and there's a lot of capital being spent in 2019.","And then I'll just go through all the markets, right. So, chemical also, and so we've had pretty good growth here in chemicals over the last two years, but we definitely see a continued build-out on both greenfield and brownfield on the chemical side.","So, kind of back to my earlier comments, I feel reasonably good about our customers spending money on infrastructure in 2019. And so, we're tracking lots of projects and some will get pushed out, but for the most part we feel good about what comes into FID and our ability to win that work.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. It sounds like you got a lot in front of you. So, going into the refined fuel and the LNG projects, as you have your line of sight on these, would you expect orders in the \u2013 or these FIDs going in the first half, or the second half, or more second half weighted, what do you think about the timing for these bigger projects?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Well, if I can answer that question, I should be in a different job because that's a difficult one. And so, we've been surprised this year at FIDs that actually got pulled up ahead of expectations, and then, we've been surprised to the opposite side and moving right. It's really, really hard to predict when things come into FID. And unfortunately, it's lumpy and that's going to sway our bookings.","But what I can say is our guys are talking to the right folks with our customers. We're in their offices. And we're trying to really get diligent about predicting when the bookings come in and allowing our operations to plan appropriately, so we don't get in trouble like we did this year on some of the past due stuff.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. And on the early ones that could happen next year and go FID, are you guys designed into those already, so it's sort of you're locked and loaded or are these things where they go FID and then jobs go out to bid to you?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. There are very, very few opportunities where we get spec'd in. But what I'd say is we're highly competitive in what we provide and what we offer. And so, we're not afraid to compete with the peer group, and we're going to win our share. But no, it is a competitive landscape, both from the valves and the pump side. But we feel good about our ability to win when we're targeted and focused on winning that work.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just a last one for me. What's \u2013 and it's probably a tough one too. But what's the timing on like FID to when you start shipping, or you have the booking and then the shipment goes out? Like what's \u2013 is it the bid cycle a six-month cycle or a year cycle (59:07).","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","It really depends on whether its pumps or valves and it depends on what type of project it is. And so I would say on like a big greenfield LNG, you're going to see significant delays between FID and order placement in our delivery on things that have our equipment installed base there between FID and order placement on the pump side should be relatively fast and we can deliver in kind of six to nine months.","So it's a real kind of mix in terms of when those deliveries are and what we're tracking, has kind of all three flavors in there right now.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the detail on this.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.","John Roueche","Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in our call today to discuss Flowserve's first quarter 2018 financial results. Joining me this morning are Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Lee Eckert, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for your questions. As a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available. Also note that our earnings materials do and this call will include non-GAAP measures. You can review the reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to the reported results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in both our press release and earnings presentation.","Finally, this call and our associated materials also contain forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management as of May 11, 2018.

We fully encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's earnings materials, which are available on our website at Flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Scott Rowe ","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today\u2019s call. ","Flowserve\u2019s first quarter financial results were in-line with our expectations and provided a solid start to the year. I am pleased that we booked and delivered a high level of aftermarket activity and ended the quarter with a total book-to-bill greater than one. We also continued our journey to reduce complexity, accelerate growth and streamline Flowserve\u2019s operating model for the future.","Before updating you on our Flowserve 2.0 activities, let me start with a financial update. In the first quarter we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 on sales growth of 6.2%. As I mentioned, these results align with our expectations and guidance. ","Aftermarket revenues accounted for 50% of our total and were up 11% year-over-year and aftermarket bookings were up both sequentially and year-over-year. We are also pleased with our solid and broad based total bookings this quarter of $929 million, driven by growth in our general industries, power and chemical markets. ","As you will recall, in the first quarter of 2017, our bookings included an $80 million refinery project award which skews the year-over-year comparison as we did not have any large project awards this quarter. Additionally, we sold two businesses in mid-2017 that are included in the 2017 first quarter comparative results. ","Turning now to our segments, IPD\u2019s turnaround showed modest progress in the first quarter, but we expect to gain further traction and achieve improved financial results as the year progresses. In the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 11% year-over-year, which helped drive an improvement in adjusted gross and operating margins of 40 and 120 basis points, respectively. ","Reducing past-due backlog from the current elevated levels remains a priority. The shipments of this lower quality backlog will present margin headwinds, as it\u2019s delivered throughout 2018. However, I am confident in the IPD leadership team. They are aggressively driving actions to improve the overall operating performance of the platform. ","We continue to expect to exit the year delivering mid to high-single-digit adjusted operating margins for IPD as improvements take hold throughout the year. At this level, we still will not be delivering to our full potential, and I remain optimistic in the longer-term profile for this business.","EPD also delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter compared to the prior year. As Lee will discuss, adoption of new accounting standards accelerated recognition of some lower margin original equipment revenue, which more than offset the 10% increase in aftermarket activity. As a result, adjusted gross and operating margins in EPD declined 90 and 50 basis points, respectively. ","We are committed to improving EPD\u2019s manufacturing performance on original equipment products, which will include a number of facility closures this year to better leverage our highly engineered capabilities. ","FCD achieved its highest dollar value of bookings since the fourth quarter of 2015. On a reported basis, the segment\u2019s revenue declined 1% in the quarter as a result of the non-core business divestitures we completed mid-last year. Excluding these divestitures, FCD would have realized revenue growth of approximately 8%. ","The segment\u2019s adjusted gross and operating margins declined 260 basis points and 220 basis points respectively year-over-year. The decline in margin was primarily the result of product mix and timing. I am confident this is a timing issue and not indicative of a trend. FCD has consistently delivered solid operating performance and we anticipate that full year 2018 will be no exception. ","I want to provide a little more color on our bookings and end-markets. While we received no large products \u2013 projects in the first quarter, we did win a number of $3 million to $8 million awards driven by our base or foundational business. This solid performance helped partially offset the impact of the tough prior year comp, which included divested businesses and the large refinery bookings. ","Additionally, based on our improved visibility and solid quoting activity, we are optimistic about our near-term market environment and believe we can deliver sequential bookings growth in the second quarter. Furthermore, with the cycle of turning, we are determined to begin recovering some of the industry-wide original equipment pricing declines that occurred in recent years. ","Since the beginning of the year, we have initiated two price increases on our base business to help improve margins, offset cost increases, and mitigate the impact of a changing and dynamic global trade environment. Additionally, we have moved our margin threshold higher in our EPD original equipment business to begin the margin recovery journey in this platform. ","We believe this pricing discipline and approach will deliver value for our shareholders over the long run. Our aftermarket franchise has proven resilient throughout the cycle. In the first quarter, we delivered aftermarket bookings of $482 million, our highest level since the third quarter of 2015. Our discussions with customers continues to suggest their increasing focus on improving efficiency within their facilities indicating the potential for increased turnaround activity and the return of smaller projects and upgrade investments. ","Turning now to our first quarter bookings by end-markets and starting with oil and gas. Bookings decreased approximately 19% year-over-year, driven by challenging comparison due to the EPD large refinery award in 2017. FCD\u2019s bookings were up modestly including enhanced on-shore North American activity, while IPD decreased by approximately 40%, also driven by a challenging comparison. ","A number of runrate awards in EPD and IPD primarily in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, coupled with the improving commodity price indicate improved conditions for oil and gas markets. Our confidence is supported by the strong pipeline of pre-feed and feed activities that has continued to expand. In the chemical industry, our bookings increased approximately 3%, driven by FCDs and IPDs low-double-digit growth on short cycle activity, while EPD declined approximately 9%. ","Overall chemical demand continues to grow globally, driving additional ethylene investments in Asia, the Middle East, and North America where the second wave of crackers continues to move forward with three projects now in E&C hands and several others in various stages of planning. ","Flowserve\u2019s Power bookings increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in EPD and IPD and included nuclear awards in Asia-Pacific and a desalination project. Power industry is the most challenged industry that we serve and we are not counting on significant near-term growth in this space. ","General industry bookings increased over 17%, driven by strength in EPD and FCD and a modest increase in IPD. The increase was largely driven by distribution, including strength in Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. ","From a geographic perspective, we had strength in the Middle East and Africa delivering 15% growth and saw mid-single-digit growth in Latin America, which continues to be our most challenged region. These improvements helped offset declines in the rest of the world. Due to the large refinery award last year, Asia-Pacific was down 13%, while North America and Europe were also down by low-single-digits. ","In summary, while we expect our markets to be somewhat choppy quarter-to-quarter, we continue to believe the multi-year downturn in the cycle has started to reverse course and we anticipate an improved marketplace ahead. We believe global economic conditions are supportive. Oil prices have shown stability at higher levels. The tax reform package and regulatory environment are beneficial in the U.S., and the global project pipeline is growing. ","While we remain disciplined and realistic in terms of our outlook, we do anticipate solid steady growth in our markets and we expect to see sequential growth in the second quarter. We believe the combination of improving marketplace and our internal initiatives that we are taking to strengthen and transform the company will position Flowserve to deliver value for our customers and shareholders. ","I will now turn it over to Lee to discuss our financial results in greater detail, and then I will turn for a few closing comments before we open the call to Q&A. Lee?","Lee Eckert ","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. As Scott mentioned in his comments, at the start of the 2018 first quarter, Flowserve implemented a new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606. From a Flowserve perspective, implementation of this new standard had numerous moving parts, primarily due to the significant increase in contracts requiring Percentage of Completion accounting, also referred to as PoC for over time. ","While I don\u2019t intend for this call to become an accounting lesson, let me highlight some of the significant changes. We implemented ASC 606 under the modified retrospective approach. Under this methodology, certain contracts, which have remaining obligations as of the effective date are recognized in retained earnings at January 1, 2018.","The impact on Flowserve is that $237 million of year-end 2017 backlog equating to $0.15 of EPS, was recognized in retained earnings under the new standard. ","With 23% of our revenue this quarter now coming from contracts under Percentage of Completion, compared to just 3% in the first quarter of 2017, the new standard increased our revenues recognized this period as compared to the former standard. These PoC revenues of $71 million were primarily timing-related and were dilutive to our reported gross profit margin was mostly related to larger OE projects. ","Since very little SG&A was applied to the incremental amounts, the revenue was modestly accretive to our operating margins and our EPS. Our balance sheet now has two new line items called contract assets, and contract liabilities that are essentially for projects and processes. The amounts in these new categories came primarily from what previously would have shown in receivables, inventory and accrued liabilities. ","To wrap up this topic, let me reiterate that we knew this new accounting standard was coming. So our expectations and guidance were based on it and it was a major accounting effort due to the number of contracts effected, new locations doing PoC for the first time, the multiple ERP systems that exist within the company and more significantly, closing the books and reporting using both the new and prior accounting standards. ","I am proud of our team for getting this done. We do expect however that our financial reporting will occur a little later in the cycle for the remaining period this year similar to this quarter\u2019s timing. ","Let me now return to why we are here, which is discussing our financial results for the quarter. Flowserve delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.27. Again, very much in line with our expectations we discussed on our last call and the guidance given. ","On a reported basis, earnings per share of $0.12 included realignment expense of $0.07 and $0.05 of below the line currency impacts and $0.03 of discrete corporate items. First quarter sales increased 6.2% to $920 million. ","In addition to the new accounting standard, we incurred roughly a 2.5% headwind as a result of the divested businesses that Scott spoke about earlier, which are offset by approximately 6% of currency tailwinds on the weaker U.S. dollar. Aftermarket sales increased 11% to $455 million representing 50% of our total revenue for the quarter. ","Looking now at our gross margin, our adjusted gross margin of 30.3% was down 130 basis points versus the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Lower margin original equipment revenues including the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, more than offset our incremental cost savings and a 300 basis point mix shift towards higher margin aftermarket activity. ","On a reported basis, which included increased year-over-year realignment charges, our gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 29.5%. Adjusted SG&A was basically flat in the first quarter as our continued incremental cost savings initiatives largely offset the impacts from the weakened U.S. dollar. ","As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A decreased 110 basis points with improvement across all segments. Reported SG&A increased due to the currency headwinds despite cost efforts and lower realignment spends. ","First quarter adjusted and reported operating margin declined 30 and 100 basis points to 6.8% and 4.9% respectively. As Scott discussed, we delivered modest improvement in IPD\u2019s adjusted operating margin, which were offset by FCD\u2019s 220 basis point decrease as a result of timing and shipment mix. ","You will know, we are no longer adjusting for IPD\u2019s PPA related to the SIHI, which is about $1.25 million in the first quarter. Our reported effective tax rate was high in the first quarter, primarily related to losses in certain regions where no tax benefit was realized. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.5%, which is in line with our full year expectation of 27% to 28%. ","Turning to cash. Although our total operating cash flow was a use of $121 million, reflecting traditional seasonality, our cash balance remains strong. We finished the quarter with over $0.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, more than $200 million above March 31, 2017. In the first quarter, we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividend and had capital expenditures of $13.5 million, down about $2.4 million from a year ago. ","While the first quarter tends to be seasonally weak, as I discussed before, our working capital performance is still not where it needs to be, and it remains a priority to reduce. In 2018, the company\u2019s focus on implementing sustainable improvement to its working capital processes. We are changing the foundation of all aspects of our order to cash and sales and operational planning processes. ","We expect the initial benefits of these changes to begin, being recognized in the second half of the year. Looking forward, our clear expectation is to deliver stronger cash flow performance. ","Turning to our 2018 outlook. With our first quarter results in line, which kept us on pace for the full year, we reaffirm our full year EPS target range of $0.95 to $1.15 per share on a reported basis and $1.50 to $1.7 per share as adjusted. We also confirmed our expected revenue growth of 3% to 6% including a 2% full year currency benefit and roughly a 1% negative headwind from last year\u2019s business divestitures. ","The adjusted EPS target range excludes the 2018 expected realignment and transformation expense of approximately $90 million as well as below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items, which may occur during the year. ","Both the reported and adjusted EPS target range, assume year-end FX rates and commodity prices, current backlogs, expected booking levels, and market position and a minimal impact from the adoption of the new accounting principles as new awards coming in are expected to offset the lost backlog. ","Net interest expense is expected in the range of $58 million to $60 million with a tax rate of 27% to 28%. Additionally, we expect traditional earning seasonality although for to be more pronounced in the second half of the year. We also expect these approximately $100 million of cash in 2018 to pay dividend to our shareholders. ","We will remain disciplined in capital expenditures, but plan to invest in some enabling technologies for Flowserve 2.0, which should bring full year CapEx to the $80 million to $90 million range. We expect to pay down approximately $60 million in debt and contribute approximately $30 million to our global pension plan, mainly due to our ongoing service products as U.S. plants remain largely fully funded. ","Now, let me turn it back to Scott for his closing remarks. ","Scott Rowe ","Great. Thanks, Lee. I\u2019ll conclude the call with an update on our internal initiatives designed to transform our business model to better serve our customers, engage our associates and reward our shareholders. Recall the initiative Flowserve 2.0 and we are taking the best from our past, improving on it for the future. ","In the February call, I discussed the initiative in some length and highlighted our recent completion of a full scale internal assessment across six key areas, operations, commercial, growth, aftermarket, G&A cost, and working capital. ","Since that time, we\u2019ve gone from an assessment to now taking action. It is still early days, but we have now formed a fully dedicated transformational office with [Indiscernible]. We are augmenting this team with third-party expertise where needed. The singular focus of this group is to accelerate and drive sustainable and value-creating change to improve our operating model. ","We are changing the way we think, act and operate to better drive growth and reduce costs. The transformational office is currently focused on scoping and sequencing different initiatives that are intended to ultimately reduce the complexity of Flowserve, better leverage our enterprise scale and accelerate growth. These projects fall under broad work streams that are underway in various planning stages. ","Here are some examples of what we are attempting to do. Improving our focus on select core markets, developing a methodical process to set and govern pricing decisions, rationalizing product lines and employing design to value principles, improving efficiency and effectiveness of our selling functions, driving operational excellence and consistency across our global manufacturing footprint through these lead times, improve on-time delivery and reduce our non-material cost of goods sold, optimizing our supply chain activities across the enterprise to reduce material costs, driving increased growth and profitability across our aftermarket platform, structurally reducing G&A cost while improving efficiency and effectiveness, driving the common operating systems and process automation tools, and becoming a people first organization that embraces a common strategic vision. ","As I said before, transformational change like we are pursuing is not easy or accomplished quickly. We are not trimming around the edges, but we are pursuing a comprehensive change to our business model that will deliver long-term benefits to our stakeholders. ","I am confident that these actions will increase our ability to effectively support our customers, create a more meaningful workplace for our employees and drive significant long-term value for our shareholders. ","Operator, that concludes our prepared comments. We now like to open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mike Halloran of Baird. Please go ahead. And Mike, if your line is muted, please unmute your phone.","Scott Rowe","Good morning, Mike. Are you there?","Operator","We will move on. The next question is from Charlie Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Charlie Brady","Hey, thanks. Good Morning. A couple questions here. Just on FCD, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the timing issue that impacted Q1? And as kind of a follow-up to that, in line with that, as you are looking towards your visibility, you commented that you expect sequentially improving bookings in Q2 from Q1. ","Is that confidence a function of what you see in bookings through April and May or is it just more of a quotation activity that you think that hasn\u2019t hit yet, but likely will? ","Scott Rowe ","I\u2019ll let Lee do the FCD part, and then I\u2019ll take on the outlook on bookings. ","Lee Eckert","Yes. Hey, Charlie, this is Lee. FCD had a record fourth quarter, finished the year and a lot of that performance pulled some of their shipments from the first quarter into the fourth quarter. So, they basically performed as expected and I think a lot of the results of this quarter were really impacted due to their strong fourth quarter. ","Scott Rowe ","Yes, so I\u2019d just say, I mean, to add to that, we\u2019ve got a very strong FCD team. We are confident that that starts to get back into a more normal operating margin level. On the Q2 bookings, we feel pretty good. So we had a solid April bookings, and we\u2019ve got visibility to refining and petrochemical work in the near-term, and we\u2019ve got clear line of sight that we believe that Q2 is going to be higher than Q1. ","Charlie Brady","Thanks. On those ethylene plants that you mentioned that have gone to the \u2013to the ones that have gone to the EPCs, are you on those plants yet? Has those equipment been awarded? ","Scott Rowe ","Some have and we are participating, and others are still in the pipeline. ","Charlie Brady","Thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Hey, good morning guys. ","Lee Eckert","Hey, Andy. ","Scott Rowe ","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Scott, so, when you think about Flowserve 2.0, can you give us an update, obviously, I think last quarter you talked about at some point setting out official targets. You talked today about improving efficiency in the factories, optimizing the supply chain among other things. ","But are you ready at some point to give us a timeframe on when you think you might be able to say that the company is more simplified and how do you think investors should judge you on Flowserve 2.0? Should we see meaningful improvement in performance by the end of this year?","Scott Rowe ","Sure. Yes, I think, the best way to think about it, I said a little bit in the prepared remarks is the way we are using Flowserve 2.0 is it\u2019s the vehicle to accelerate our transformation. We are not satisfied with the performance of the company both operationally and financially. We know we\u2019ve got to do things differently. ","And as I kind of work through the back half of last year, it was -- we had to do something as a catalyst internally to start to drive significant change, and so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve created this initiative. As we talked about, we did a very holistic assessment in the \u2013 that launched in the fourth quarter, and it completed in the first quarter, and just basically where we are is that assessment is now completed. ","We\u2019ve staffed this transformational office here with a pretty large number of associates that\u2019s dedicated Flowserve associates that are leading that transformation. We\u2019ve got the six work streams that I commented to on the script, so we\u2019ve got commercial, growth, aftermarket, operations, working capital, and then our cost structure or G&A cost, and then we are augmenting that team with third-party help where we just don\u2019t have the skills or the talent or we can\u2019t assess best practice to bring into Flowserve. ","And I\u2019d just say, the potential prize and initiatives are defined and we are now turning that into actions, timeline, and sequence, and we recognize that this is a significant effort with a massive process improvement which is driving success and change for the long run. The majority of the prize will be in 2019 and beyond, but we fully expect to start to see benefits and achieve results in the back half of 2018. ","It\u2019s going to continue to require investment in our people, our process, and our systems and while we would love to come out and say, here is the potential of Flowserve and here is the prize, I just think at this point, we are not ready to do that. We are still sequencing things. We are still committing to action. And quite frankly, I want to get some wins under our belt and get some traction and get more confidence in the program here. ","But I do think at some point we\u2019ll need to talk about what we see as the holistic potential for Flowserve, but I think right now it\u2019s more of a milestone story, and let\u2019s get a win or two under our belt and then we\u2019ll come out holistically with the program, the actions, and what we think is the \u2013 kind of where we think Flowserve can go on some high-level metrics. ","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Scott, that\u2019s helpful. And then, either for Scott or Lee, we know that Flowserve, I mean you mentioned that you usually have seasonally weak free cash in the first quarter, like you know negative $134 million, and the [indiscernible] rev rec, I guess, somebody who orders a little bit, but you had a $64 million increase in contract assets. So, can you talk about revenue in excess of billings, why it\u2019s higher in the quarter? ","And maybe talk about the second half improvement that you expect in working capital. If you look at the numbers, working capital as a percent of sales were 27.9% last Q4, should we see better than that by the end of this year and how should we look at working capital itself? ","Lee Eckert","Yes, so the accounting clearly has changed the formula a little bit. One thing that I should mention in contract assets, that represents cases where we have not billed the customer for the work that\u2019s performed. So included in that, there is some profit that is part of the adjustments that we disclosed in the Q. But just stepping back, we made tremendous progress in the fourth quarter in driving working capital performance. ","Unfortunately, a lot of it was just very manual and a lot of, I would say management intensity. Coming out of the year in the fourth quarter, trying to get the Flowserve 2.0 running, trying to get the new accounting running, we could not provide the same, I would say management intensity around all these areas.","So, working \u2013 AR, we did not make as much progress as I would like. We are in the process of putting in more systematic fixes to drive that to understand what\u2019s preventing us from getting collections. On the inventory side, as we talked about in the last call, we\u2019ve been working hard in driving our past-due backlog performance. ","We did not make as much progress as we would have liked and that\u2019s providing some overhang. And then, I guess, the third part I would highlight is that, in Scott\u2019s remarks and my remarks, we talked about building our \u2013 what we call our SNOP processes. That is the major change from how the company historically has been run. ","And we are in the process of implementing these \u2013 right processes around forecasting, buying inventory and executing production. And so, that\u2019s going to take some time during the course of the year. Scott has added individuals who are extremely skilled in these areas. ","But it\u2019s taking time to start to get the pilots running and starting to institutionalize that effort. So, in a nutshell, we are not pleased how the first quarter played out. But, we feel that we can turn the corner and drive improvements to the balance of the year. ","Scott Rowe ","Yes, I think, just to summarize, what Lee said is, we are not happy with where cash flow and working capital are. We\u2019ve been doing it a little bit by management intention and we are turning that now into much more eloquent systematic approach. That\u2019s systematic and can drive long-term results on this. And so, we are adding resources. It\u2019s a major part of the Flowserve 2.0 and we do expect to see progress during the back half of 2018 on working capital. ","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Okay, Lee and just clarifying one thing. You had $0.03, I think of benefit from ASC 606 in the first quarter and you said it was timing. Does that mean that that impact sort of recedes as the year goes on? Any more clarity there and how to think about it in the rest of the year?","Lee Eckert","So, in our guidance, we said, adjusted 150 to 170, through ASC 606, we effectively lost $0.15 from the restatement that went into retained earnings. What we\u2019ve got out and what we communicated that we believe that\u2019s going to be other pull-in from 2019 into 2018. So, net-net, we don\u2019t think there is any impact. ","Where there is potentially some impact is timing during the year. And so, it was difficult to figure out when \u2013 how this is going to get sequenced. But, we feel that, for the year, the $0.03 effect that we got this quarter is going to be offset in other quarters and over the course of the year, it should be balanced. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Scott Graham ","Hey, good morning. ","Scott Rowe ","Yes, hey, Scott. ","Scott Graham ","Hey. So, in EPD, could you unbundle the bookings there a little bit? Some of the commentary you made, Scott, was oil and gas and EPD down because of the comp or when you remove the comp, was it still down and why was chemical down?","Scott Rowe ","Yes, so, on EPD OE specifically, we had the large comp. The $80 million award in refinery or oil and gas in the first quarter last year. If you remove that, oil and gas was actually up slightly when we look at kind of apples-to-apples excluding that. And then, on the chemicals side, I don\u2019t know, Jay, do you have the exact number on the year-over-year on chemicals?","John Roueche","Sure. The chemicals bookings were actually up on a dollarized basis. They were down slightly on a constant currency basis and I would suggest that it is predominantly timing, because as Scott mentioned during his prepared comments, we are fairly optimistic about the outlook for chemical going forward. ","Lee Eckert","Yes. ","Scott Graham ","Gotcha. ","Scott Rowe ","Scott, I would just say, just more generally, we are not really excited about where the OE pump bookings were in the quarter. There was a lot of work out there. And so, we\u2019ve got to get a little more rifle shot approach on these things. We do have visibility to a much stronger Q2 and so we are looking forward to that. ","But also just especially on the EPD side, I said this in the prepared comments, but we ratcheted up our margin expectations probably into Q3 and Q4 and what we saw as those kind of tenders went through the cycle and started to materialize in Q1, we\u2019ve probably overshot a little bit on pricing. And so we know we\u2019ve lost some work in Q1 that we potentially could have won, had we\u2019d not been pushing that. ","And so, we are continuing to look at pricing. But also, we also strong on that, this business commands and should be a higher pricing than what\u2019s out there today. And so we are going to be pretty disciplined about what we take into the system and make sure that we take, we can generate the value that we deserve in these awards. ","Scott Graham ","Gotcha. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the Flowserve 2.0, and I am going to maybe make some phrases up here. I am assuming that, of the six, some of it is like, Flowserve 2.5 and some of it is Flowserve 1.5 and by that I mean, all six don\u2019t have \u2013 don\u2019t require the same level of intensity by the company and you guys in that room. ","Could you kind of tell us, of the six, maybe which two or three are areas where you have to be more intensive? And maybe which ones, maybe a little bit less? I am assuming that working capital is on the more 2.5 side. But could you see where I am going with this question? ","Because, the old Flowserve has some things wrong with it, but a lot of that stuff happened in the last couple of years when the markets went really bad on them. It seems to me that there is some of these areas where they are not as bad as others. Maybe you could kind of lay some of that out, Scott. ","Scott Rowe ","Sure. I am going to use the 1.5 and 2.5, because that\u2019s going to confuse all of my 70,000 associates here. So, but, what I would say is that, obviously, there is different intensity across the six initiatives. But I\u2019ll just go through it, but clearly, aftermarket \u2013 sorry, let me start on the working capital. Working capital is got to get significantly better. ","And so that\u2019s an area that we\u2019ve already added resources and we are moving into systemic process change. Under operations, supply chain is another significant area of focus. And so, we go back to the problem statement, you\u2019ve got originally lots of different acquisitions, sites basically made a lot of decisions and we are not leveraging the scale that we have at Flowserve. ","And so, supply chain should really, as we start to consolidate our supply chain centralized process, we should be able to get some nice wins here this year and that\u2019s a big prize if we can do it correctly. And then the third one that I would say would be a kind of a top three list of value creation immediately with a little more intensity is aftermarket. ","And so, while the aftermarket franchises is absolutely fantastic, right, and I continue to be impressed with our breadth, with the field business and kind of what we can do, if I look back over the last three years, we haven\u2019t really grown aftermarket in the way that that we need or should grow it. And our installed base continues to grow and yet we\u2019ve been relatively flat on aftermarket. ","And so, one of the big areas that\u2019s getting a lot of initial attention and focus is, how do we really start to unlock and grow the aftermarket more than we have here in the last couple of years. So I would say, those are three areas that are coming with a lot of intensity and we expect to see relatively quick rewards in the back half of 2018 and early 2019. But all six are critical and we\u2019ll have actions and initiatives and we have leaders across each of those work streams. ","Scott Graham ","Understood. Thank you. And if you could just maybe, one quick mention on, when you expect to start announcing the plant closures? Thanks. ","Scott Rowe ","The plant closures, is that what? Is that correct?","Scott Graham ","Yes, yes. ","Scott Rowe ","Yes, so, we have actually \u2013 we announced some in the fourth quarter and we announced three here in the first quarter of this year. And so, that is ongoing and kind of I would say, it\u2019s generally on the restructuring, right. We haven\u2019t changed our course there. We do expect to complete largely the original program at the end of this year. But we added a few in the first quarter that was part of the original program. ","They are relatively smaller, I would say as clean up. That was desperately needed and we did announce those in the first quarter. So, we are still continuing to press this. We believe from a capacity standpoint that we have plenty of roofline and we can expand capacity significantly with productivity. And we are going to continue to refine that footprint. ","Scott Graham ","Was that a news release or is that an internal announcement, because I apologize if I missed that. ","Scott Rowe ","Yes, it\u2019s just internal. We don\u2019t do that externally. ","Scott Graham ","Gotcha. All right. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Fisher ","Thanks. Good morning. ","Scott Rowe ","Hi, Steve. ","Steven Fisher ","You guys explained the timing part of the FCD margin. Can you just give us a little more color on the mix headwind you experienced? And when do you think you will see the FCD margin return to improving year-over-year? ","Lee Eckert","So, this is Lee. So, the key issue in the first quarter, like I said is, we moved a lot of, I would say, parts and service that\u2019s got really pulled in, into the first quarter, like I said, we put a lot of pressure on them to deliver and they exceeded our expectation. My expectation is, going into the second and third quarter, we should start seeing those margins going back to where they historically been.","Steven Fisher ","Okay. And then, in achieving your IPD margin targets, to what extent is this going to be more a result of gross margin improvements versus lower SG&A? I am not sure if past backlog \u2013 past-due backlog, is that just directly a gross margin thing? Or how should we think about that dynamic? ","Scott Rowe ","Yes. The progression in IPD is primarily o the gross margin line. There will be some SG&A savings and work there. But it\u2019s really around execution performance. And so, we\u2019ve talked quite a bit about the pain in IPD and some of the sites that are causing us concern. Those now have a pretty significant past-due backlog and what I would say is, in the first quarter, it did not get worse. ","They didn\u2019t get significantly better, but we are in a stability mode right now. And so, we\u2019ve kind of stabilized the platform if you will and now we\u2019ve got to really transition and focus on optimizing it for the future. But I think you will start to see the improvements more on the gross margin line and we do feel confident that we start to make progress in the second and third quarter of this year. ","Steven Fisher ","Okay. And on the past-due backlog, should the ultimate target for that be zero? And if not, why not?","Scott Rowe ","Yes, so, it will never be zero. And really it\u2019s a balance of our commitment to our customers and lead times. And so, in an ideal world, right, you are running a past-due backlog at kind of a 2% to 3% of the total backlog. But probably what\u2019s more important is that we are focused on our lead times and getting those as short as possible. ","And then when we make a commitment to our customers, what we don\u2019t want to do is, if we miss a delivery, we want that \u2013 the days late to be one week or maybe two weeks. We don\u2019t want the days late to be months or even quarters, which is kind of some of the situation we are in today. ","And so, past-due backlog will always be there, but it\u2019s going to \u2013 what we want to be doing is, driving lead times down aggressively and really tightening up our variability and our ability to execute. ","Steven Fisher ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie ","Thanks, good morning guys. ","Lee Eckert","Hey, Joe. ","Scott Rowe ","Good morning, Joe. ","Joe Ritchie ","Maybe just sticking on the past-due backlog for a second, is it \u2013 do you guys have, like, liquidated damages that are going through at all? Or is this just a function of just extra cost to serve? Is that \u2013 so, I am just trying to understand what\u2019s going through our margins right now.","Scott Rowe ","No, look, delivering late is not good, right. It causes concerns with customers, it\u2019s revenue, it\u2019s working capital. We do have liquidated damages. There is receivables and collection issues, inventories. So, it is bad and so, you don\u2019t want a large past-due backlog. And so, what I would say is, we didn\u2019t have any major surprises in the quarter. ","But we didn\u2019t bring down working \u2013 or we didn\u2019t bring that past-due backlog and if you want, and IPD was relatively flat, but it grew in both EPD and FCD. And we\u2019ve got a \u2013 we are continuing to continuing to focus on operations and our performance to drive that down. ","And one of the things and Lee touched on this is, we\u2019ve got a lot of issues there, but one of the big things that we are really focused on or focusing on is manufacturing planning. And so, we are introducing the SNOP process. We are investing in production planning and material management which I think they are just basics to manufacturing. ","But if you don\u2019t do these really well, then you get a lot of the issues that we are facing today. And so, this is under the Flowserve 2.0 and we\u2019ve already added and strengthened our competency and our people in that space. But it\u2019s an area we\u2019ve got to get significantly better at. ","John Roueche","Joe, one thing I would add to that is, when we identified liquidated damages, there is a potential for liquidated damages, we record them once we realize that that product is going to be late. So, we did not necessarily incur much liquidated damages this quarter, because a lot of the timing of shipment was known last quarter and in the quarter before. ","Joe Ritchie ","Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Jay. And I\u2019d appreciate the color on that as well, Scott. Scott, maybe just, we talked a little bit about the organic bookings being down year-over-year and why they were, but they were also down sequentially. And I know that there is an expectation for a sequential improvement in 2Q. But, I take a step back and look at the old backdrop right now, it\u2019s very strong. ","I guess, I am wondering, like when can we get back to $1 billion per quarter in orders, just given that the backdrop had strengthened? And then secondly, do you guys have the right capabilities in place today to actually deliver on that kind of backlog? Or is it going to take some time to fix things internally before you would take in those types of orders?","Scott Rowe ","Yes, so we did come down sequentially. What I would say is, the FCD grew and actually, if you exclude the divestiture we are up 15%. We add 482 on aftermarket is a really good number. And so, we had some bright spots in the quarter. We had a hard comp year-over-year with Hengli award and some of the divestitures. ","But I think, everything we are doing is focused on growing and we would really like to see $1 billion on the top-line at the quarterly level. And that\u2019s kind of what we are lining up and focusing on from a sales theme and execution strategy. And, I don\u2019t know if we are going to get to $1 billion, but we do have confidence that the Q2 will be higher than Q1. ","And then just on the ability to execute, what I would say is, we are being back to planning and understanding where our capacity is and where our problems are. We are being more deliberate about making sure that the work that we do bring in, that we can actually execute and deliver throughout the system. ","And so, a lot of the past-due backlog we do think is starting to clear and we are being selective as where do we put that work and which facility is in making sure that we can execute. So, I am confident that what we are chasing today, we will be able to execute. But we\u2019ve got to continue to progress our operational capability. ","Joe Ritchie ","Got it. And maybe if I could sneak one more in for Lee. Lee, how should we be thinking about cash flow then? I know you guys don\u2019t have like a cash flow guidance for the year. But did the accounting rules change anything? What should be the expectation from a either free cash flow generation or conversion for you guys?","Lee Eckert","So, the new standard does not really impact cash flow. It obviously puts it in different buckets. So, our expectation is that, we are driving down working capital. We are improving velocity of receivables, velocity of inventory. Under the new accounting, some of it \u2013 what was used to be in inventory analysis and contract, contract assets, so, we need to come up with some better metrics around that. ","I mean, we are still getting comfortable with how the accounting worked. But we need to drive more transparency around how quickly are things going through the facilities and how well are we collecting. But, again, the accounting doesn\u2019t impact cash, but it does put it in different balance sheet accounts. And the expectation is, we are going to reduce our investment in working capital. ","Joe Ritchie ","But, do you guys have like a bogey? You have to have at least an internal bogey that you'd like to have from a cash flow perspective for the year, I would think.","Lee Eckert","Well, we\u2019ve not gone out with cash flow guidance, but the expectation is that, we are driving improvement in operating cash flow year-over-year. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeff Hammond ","Hey, good morning guys. ","Scott Rowe ","Good morning. ","Jeff Hammond ","Just on the \u2013 I guess, in the order pacing, one, can you just talk about what you are seeing on pricing? What you are doing differently as you get better environment to drive price? And then just comment on how the funnel is starting to build or visibility is building for larger projects?","Scott Rowe ","Yes, on pacing, I talked a little bit on the prepared remarks, we did come out at the beginning of the year with a very general price increase on certain industry items. And then in the end of Q1, we followed that with a much broader price increase on the back of steel import tariffs. And so, we\u2019ve got two out there this year. ","I would say, the second one is a little too early to tell in terms of traction and making sure that that\u2019s going to work. The other thing that we did was on EPD specifically. So EPD OE as we did ratchet up our margin expectations, a lot of that work is a cost plus model rather than a list price. And we did that in the third quarter \u2013 Q4 of the last year. ","And what we saw is we had mixed results and so, our bookings probably could have been higher in Q1 had we been a little less aggressive on that pricing. And so we are kind of stealing our way through what we believe should be a increased pricing environment, but yet, we are struggling to get that traction. But we do want to be on the front side of this and be a leader in price. ","And given some of the operational challenges that we talked about before, we want to make sure that we are a little bit more selective. We are bringing the stuff that that we can work on and when we do it, we actually get rewarded for the work that we do. ","Jeff Hammond ","And then larger project visibility.","Scott Rowe ","Yes, larger project visibility, I would say, our funnel of projects is probably better than I have seen in the last 12 months. On the larger ones though, we are not seeing anything at that kind of large size at the $100 million where we had one or two last year or in the last 12 months on. ","But we are seeing a really healthy pipeline at kind of that $10 million to $20 million range. And so I would expect to see more of those in Q2 and Q3 and as we complete the year. ","Jeff Hammond ","Okay. Great. And then, just, to get back on past-due backlog. So I think you said it was stable this quarter and I just \u2013 I want to kind of get back to the big gating factors of kind of making improvement, particularly as you start to get a pick-up in demand, like that you can kind of continue to make progress. Thanks. ","Scott Rowe ","Yes, so, I want to super thorough on past-due backlog. So IPD was reasonably stable in the quarter. Where it went up was on the FCD side and the EPD side and so we actually grew past-due backlog in Q1 which is certainly not what we want to do. And then in terms of fixing this, one, we talked about it, but we\u2019ve really got to change and strengthen our competency around planning and manufacturing process improvement. ","And so, that\u2019s the focus. We\u2019ve got that within the Flowserve 2.0 umbrella and we are basically systematically going through large plans on ability to plan and execute our work. And so, while Flowserve has had a lot of success historically, planning and delivery have never been a real strength. And so it\u2019s something that we are taking a very comprehensive look at in making sure that that we\u2019ve got strong competency around planning and manufacturing execution. ","Jeff Hammond ","Okay. Thanks guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray ","Thanks, good morning everyone. ","Lee Eckert","Hi, Deane","Deane Dray ","Hey. I might have missed this, but, I was hoping to get some color around the reference about two price increases that you put through. Just, what's the cadence of those? What's been the reaction of the customers? What kind of yield are you getting on that pricing? Just any color would be helpful.","Scott Rowe ","Yes, Deane. So, I talked about a little bit. I would certainly go into it again. We did want at the very beginning of the year and what I would say was on select items and there was discrete. And we\u2019ve got some data now that\u2019s saying that that was reasonably successful with a relatively nice uptake. And, we didn\u2019t get the pushback or the losses that we were worried about. ","And so, that one went through reasonably well. The second one was on the back of the import tariffs on steel. And so we did that at the end of March and we are just too early to tell on that one. And so those are the two that have happened this year that are more across Flowserve generally. And then just, what I haven\u2019t talked about yet is, prices is something that we are very much looking at in the commercial work stream for Flowserve 2.0. ","And what I would say is, we\u2019ve really haven\u2019t utilized analytics to really drive more intelligent pricing decisions. And so, that\u2019s something that we are absolutely jumping on and we think we\u2019ve got opportunities on where we got like parts, pricing, our aftermarket service pricing and then some of our more standard type products. ","We are making sure that we don\u2019t have to spare pricing and that we are able to move that up progressively and done with some logic and intelligence. ","Deane Dray ","Got it. And then, for Lee, how does this translate into price\/cost for the year? I don't think you've got a specific goal here. But where does that stand if you had to draw the line in the sand today on how you are tracking on price\/cost on a net basis?","Lee Eckert","So, right now we are kind of assuming the two offset each other. We\u2019ll see how that plays out. I mean, Scott, didn\u2019t go into a lot of detail, even on the cost side, one of our supply chain group that is, we are looking at who we buy from kind of consolidate suppliers, trying to be proactive on some of the inflation. ","So, our assumption is that, it\u2019s pretty consistent with the guidance. We assume there is going to be inflation and we also assume there is going to be some price and then the changes since being the year, we are assuming that net out to be pretty consistent with what we assume, that we assumed originally in our guidance. ","Deane Dray ","Got it. Thank you. ","Scott Rowe ","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano ","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. ","Scott Rowe ","Hey, Joe. ","Joseph Giordano ","Scott, on the pricing, and the loss of maybe some work that\u2019s been out there. I guess, how strong is your summit on this? How long are you going to remain firm and sacrifice orders to kind of lead the market into a more disciplined scenario?","Scott Rowe ","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Joe. And it\u2019s something we talk about quite a bit between our commercial officer and our platform president myself. I think, we went pretty strong hoping to get more traction than we did in Q1. And it\u2019s something that we are evaluating on a regular basis. And so, I would say, we are not going to be completely dogmatic and we are going to do it very rationally. ","We understand that we want to drive growth in the business. And so we are not going to jeopardize that. But at the same time, we are not going to take work that doesn\u2019t \u2013 we are not going to take it for practice. Right, who want to take work that we know we can make money on and we are very focused and committed to work that gives us our long-term aftermarket annuity. ","And so, I\u2019d say, we are getting much more methodical about our pricing and we\u2019ve got a more deliberate and more visible planning cycle that allows us to have rich discussions early in the cycle and early in these project pursuits. ","Joseph Giordano ","Is it like a handful\u2026","Scott Rowe ","We are going to do anything crazy on this. Right, I mean, we know it\u2019s a balance. We\u2019ve got some under absorption in some areas, but we got past-due backlog in others. And so, we are pretty good about what we want to win and we are going to be more targeted. ","Joseph Giordano ","Is it like a handful of bad actors just willing to do things for zero? Or is it, or are you guys kind of in outlier with your thought process right now?","Scott Rowe ","Well, like you say, we are outlier and obviously, as you are bidding these large projects and tendering things, it\u2019s a pretty dynamic environment, right. So, we will get signals and we can move our price down as we need to. ","But what I would say is, I mean, we\u2019ve been three years in a down cycle. Everybody has excess capacity and I think folks were eager to fill their capacity and what we said is, yes, we want to make sure we minimize our underabosrption but at the same time, we want to be the ones that are moving the market up here.","Joseph Giordano ","Okay. And then, on the past-due backlog, I hate to bringing the same questions up, but, I understand why maybe, can you go down as much, but I am kind of a little \u2013 why did that actually go up in EPD and FCD in this environment?","Scott Rowe ","Yes, good question and again, I think, systemically, we don\u2019t have the planning and we don\u2019t have that true operational focus that we need, but what I would say is, in the quarter it really was isolated to a very large project. ","One or two projects that we just didn\u2019t deliver on time, and because these are going to be a quarter late or significantly late, they are probably in the range of 30 to 60 day late. And so, we do expect to clear some of this in Q2 and it remains a significant focus on us to improve our operational excellence. ","Joseph Giordano ","And if I could sneak one in for Lee. Regarding EPD and FCD margins, given 1Q performance, do you think that you could be up year-on-year for the full year in those two segments?","Lee Eckert","Yes, that, I mean, that\u2019s our expectation. I mean, I think, again, when I said a little bit earlier in my prepared remarks is, some of the new accounting pushed down the margins. EPD would have been 160 basis points higher, if we had to use the old accounting. And so, some of it, comparing that to prior periods, it would have been very competitive margin. So, our expectation is to drive margins throughout the year. ","Joseph Giordano ","But using this structure that we are currently booking for 1Q, do you think that it\u2019s still possible for those two things to be up year-on-year versus what we booked for last year?","Lee Eckert","Yes. ","Joseph Giordano ","Okay. Thanks guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry ","Hey guys. I think for two more minutes, I can say good morning. ","Scott Rowe ","Good morning. ","Robert Barry ","Maybe another hour and two where you are. So I just wanted to pick-up on the comments earlier about providing the long-term targets. Scott, when you say you want to wait to get one or two under your belt first, like what exactly does that mean? Because it sounds like it might be a while before we get some mid-term targets and I think a lot of investors are just trying to kind of get their hands around the finding reasonable mid-term earnings number for Flowserve. ","Scott Rowe ","Sure. No, I understand that as I get it and, we do think we want to talk about what the potential of Flowserve is in the long run. We \u2013 if we go back to where we are in the transformation, the assessment got completed at the end of Q3 or Q1. We\u2019ve now formed a team. The team is preparing to sequencing. ","We\u2019ve got things in the pipeline. We want to get a couple wins and make sure that we got something that we commit to you. And the last thing I want to be doing is showing out this large prize number. And then, having talked about that, when we haven\u2019t really got the process or the program in place, and so, we are moving very quickly with this. ","And I would say, we do expect to be able to talk about what we think the future of Flowserve is, reasonably since. ","Robert Barry ","Got it. I mean, just big picture if I look back over the last decade, say, the margins \u2013 the op-margin has peaked out at around 15%, 16%. I mean, directionally, do you think for that\u2019s a good target? Or do you think just given all the restructuring you\u2019ve done already and what you have planned that it\u2019s reasonable to assume a base case that\u2019s at least a little bit higher than that?","Scott Rowe ","Yes, and I\u2019d just add. Again, not ready to go fully into this, but we are going to be incredibly ambitious on what we are trying to do here. And we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s focused and they are energized about doing things that are in the top quartile in the space and exceeding margins that have ever been done at Flowserve. ","Robert Barry ","Got it. Got it.","Scott Rowe ","But we've got to get a little more time before we are ready to commit and show what \u2013 how the program leads to what the future looks like. ","Robert Barry ","Got it. And maybe just finally for me, I just wanted to clarify a little bit about the end-market perspective especially in oil and gas. I know, you have very little upstream. So perhaps, limited direct impact of higher oil, but as oil has moved up here, can you talk about kind of connecting the dots on what\u2019s some of the secondary or tertiary impact of the higher oil has actually been on the business? Thanks.","Scott Rowe ","Yes, I think, obviously, oil price strategy, a lot of things in energy. And so, stability above $60 and touching $70 now is definitely a positive to our industry and certainly our business. And what it does is, it just gives operators confidence in their ability to start to spend money on larger projects. What I would say is, and you said, it\u2019s really important, our exposure to the upstream side of oil and gas is relatively small. ","And, probably worst is that our exposure to upstream and it\u2019s really around FCD and we don\u2019t have a giant pump offering in oil and gas upstream land. And, those things that we are looking at in our product portfolio to make sure that we are driving products into the markets that we see are attractive and growing. ","But overall, $70 oil is doing a lot of good things and we are seeing smaller projects internationally start to move forward where we do participate. And for us, certainly on the pump side and the valves side, what we like are critical service type projects. ","FPSOs are good production platforms and big kind of production systems that have harsh environments is when customers come to us for both pumps and valves. And so, any of that that comes to the system is positive and the new price stacking kind of stability here is helpful. ","Robert Barry ","All right. Thank you for that color. ","Scott Rowe ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for today\u2019s call. And we will now conclude. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"9323":["Flowserve (NYSE:FLS) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 31, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Mike Mullin - Director of Investor Relations","Mark A.

Following our commentary today, we will begin the Q&A session.","Regarding any forward-looking statements, I refer you to yesterday's earnings release, 10-Q filing and today's presentation slide deck for Flowserve's Safe Harbor statement on this topic. All this information can be found at Flowserve's website under the Investor Relations section. We encourage you to read these statements carefully with respect to our conference call this morning.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to begin the formal presentation. Mark?","Mark A. Blinn","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our second quarter results. The progress we have made operationally, as well as the strategic actions we have taken, are positioning our business to capitalize on the continued global trend towards infrastructure spending, which will enable us to continue to grow and drive shareholder value.  I am very proud of our employees' constant focus on serving our customers, while we make these operational enhancements.","In spite of what appears to be another summer of uncertainty with the European debt crisis, the looming U.S. fiscal cliff and concerns over the rate of economic growth in China, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our end markets and our ability to capture profitable growth across our diversified markets.","I'm also very pleased with the improved quality of backlog resulting from our disciplined effort around pricing and selectivity, as well as the leverage resulting from focused cost control actions across our operations and at corporate. The SG&A line, in particular, highlights the flexibility and operating leverage of our business.","While work remained, Tom and his leadership team continue to gain traction in their efforts to drive operational excellence through our One Flowserve initiatives. They were able to increase sales, operational and cost leverage across many of the common processes in our business units. We are seeing tangible progress across many of our initiatives, including cost of quality, on-time delivery, supply chain, working capital, cost management and the front-end bidding process. The benefits of these initiatives are starting to show in our results and are improving the quality of our backlog.","As we discussed after the first quarter, we anticipated challenges in our gross margins in the second quarter as we made progress shipping low margin legacy backlog, which was taken in the competitive environment of 2010 and early 2011 as the groundwork for our aftermarket business.","We've also seen a continuation of the dollar strengthening since the end of the first quarter and expect additional earnings headwind as a result.  Mike will outline the expected impacts from legacy backlog and currency for the rest of the year when he updates you on our current guidance.","Turning to our capital structure, we took additional actions in the quarter to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet and ultimately increase value for our shareholders. Based on our consistent performance through the cycle over the last few years and the demonstrated cash generation ability of the business, coupled with our improved visibility and our strengthened end market, we concluded it made sense to increase the efficiency of the balance sheet and capture the value that additional leverage would provide to our capital structure.","Our board approved a targeted capital structure with a gross debt level of 1x to 2x EBITDA, compared to our prior gross debt level of 0.7x. We decided that the best use of the cash generated from this higher leverage was to increase our share repurchase authorization to $1 billion.","We intend to complete this share repurchase program during 2013. We also initiated a $300 million accelerated share repurchase program under this $1 billion authorization, financed with short-term borrowings, to systematically repurchase shares and to more quickly bring our debt level into our new targeted range of 1x to 2x EBITDA. We are very pleased that all 3 rating agencies recently upgraded our debt rating to investment grade upon our announcement of this new capital structure strategy.  We are now well positioned to take advantage of the current attractive debt markets as we progress towards our targeted capital structure.","Moving to the second quarter financial highlights, I'm pleased with our 12.5% earnings improvement over last year, particularly in light of significant above and below the line currency headwinds of approximately $0.38. Second quarter bookings were solid, as we continue to capitalize on our investments in our end-user strategies and localization, resulting in strong aftermarket bookings in the quarter of $508 million.","Our focused and disciplined investments through the downturn have enabled us to create a current $2 billion annual run rate aftermarket franchise. We don't take this opportunity for granted and recognize that every day, we must earn the right to support our customers.","The second quarter also highlighted the strength of our diversified regional exposure. Weakness in Europe and softness in the Middle East were more than offset by strength in North America and Asia-Pacific. We have seen this theme play out before.  Our diverse regional and end market exposures, together with our strong aftermarket franchise, provide the company with a lower net risk profile, which we believe is a key differentiator.","Looking forward to the balance of 2012, we are keeping a close eye on Europe. However, I continue to be cautiously optimistic about how the cycle is progressing. Quoting activity has been above 2011 levels. And while uncertainty in Europe caused the timing of some projects to shift, this increased activity should result in increased booking opportunities in 2013 and beyond.","While we are optimistic about these future large infrastructure projects and our aftermarket potential, we will continue to focus on areas where we have greater control, including operational initiatives, driving our end-user aftermarket strategies and the pursuit of small cap run rate projects, while we wait for the large projects to work their way through the approval process.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark discussed, we are pleased with our second quarter results, with bookings of $1.21 billion essentially flat versus prior year, despite a significant headwind from the stronger dollar. Additionally, bookings were negatively impacted by the economic uncertainty in Europe, particularly in FCD. Our consolidated book-to-bill was 1.03, driven by a strong aftermarket book-to-bill of 1.07.","On a year-to-date basis, we have booked nearly 2.5 billion in orders without the benefit of any large project orders. As we discussed at the end of Q1, we continued to see positive momentum building in our end markets. The level of feed and pre-feed activity has improved significantly, with levels of work in the first 6 months approaching full year 2011 levels. As Mark mentioned, when we look at the potential larger projects on the horizon, they have pushed a little bit to the right and probably will not be awarded until 2013.","Turning to our year-to-date bookings by end market. We saw significant growth in the chemical and modest growth in general industries and oil and gas. Regionally, the growth has concentrated in North America and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by lower bookings into the Middle East, Africa and to a lesser extent, Europe.","Both the power and water markets are down from prior year levels. In the oil and gas markets, unconventional oil, tar sands, subsea and shale continue to see a high level of CapEx. Downstream oil projects remained strong in the Middle East, Latin America and Russia. Additionally, abundant, low-cost natural gas is having a significant impact on the number of chemical project announcements and combined cycle power plants in the U.S. From a power standpoint, economic development and environmental regulations remain the primary drivers. China and India continued to utilize a broad range of technologies, including nuclear and fossil.","Recently, the nuclear market advanced another step as China approved its safety plan after a 9-month review. Interest in renewable energy is growing in new areas, for instance, solar generation in the Middle East. In the water business, we still see opportunities in China and the Middle East. Finally, we are seeing substantial opportunities in fertilizer production worldwide.","Turning to the year-to-date sales regional mix. We grew the top line by 6.3% or 11.5% on a constant currency basis. Strong activity in North America and Asia-Pacific more than offset weakness in Europe.  In North America, investment in pipelines, terminals and storage facilities continue to rise to move the new-found oil and gas. In China, investment in LNG facilities increases as a means to supplement long-term energy concerns, while the Middle East continues to drive for industry diversification with mega investments in power, refining, petrochemical and water sectors. Finally, recent large oil and gas discoveries in Latin America are attracting increased attention for additional investment activity.","Now I'd like to turn to our segment results for the second quarter. The Engineered Product Division increased bookings $15 million to $603 million, up 2.5% or 10.2% on a constant currency basis. Aftermarket bookings increased $27 million, up 8% or 13% on a constant currency basis. I am pleased with the strong aftermarket growth rates resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.08, reflecting our successful end-user strategy. We continue to invest in our aftermarket capabilities, adding an additional QRC in Africa in the first half of the year.","The bookings growth was driven by the strength in the general, oil and gas and chemical industries, partially offset by weakness in the power industry. Regionally, we saw increased bookings into North America and Asia-Pacific partially offset by decreased activity in Europe, in the Middle East, Africa.","Sales increased $29 million to $587 million, up 5.3% or 13.2% on a constant currency basis, driven by increased customer aftermarket sales, with increased sales into the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, partially offset by a decrease in Europe. Gross margin declined 110 basis points to 33.4%, negatively impacted by shipments of lower margin legacy projects, partially offset by a sales mix shift to the higher margin aftermarket business and the effects of lower costs associated with operational execution improvements.","Operating margin improved 60 basis points to 16.2%, due primarily to the lower SG&A and increased gross profit. We continue to improve our business processes and operations to drive quality and on-time delivery. Employee training and lean processes, kaizen events and value stream mapping are expanding throughout the organization.  Additionally, focus side initiatives designed to improve on-time delivery and reduce past due backlog are driven by divisional level teams of master black belts, quality managers and supplier development. The division team stay engaged with the site to ensure all projects are completed.","Finally, we have a rigorous program in place for supplier qualification, development and measurement.","The Industrial Product Division bookings increased $14 million to $243 million, up 6.2% or 11.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by activity in the general and chemical industries.","Booking strength in Asia-Pacific and North America was partially offset by weakness in Europe and Latin America. Sales increased $7 million to $232 million, up 3.2% or 9.4% on a constant currency basis. Strength in North America and the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific was partially offset by a decrease into Latin America. Both original equipment and aftermarket sales were up 3% versus prior year, or up 9% and 10%, respectively, on a constant currency basis.","Gross margin increased 440 basis points to 24.1%. Gross margin improved 110 basis points, excluding the impact of $7.5 million of realignment charges in 2011 that did not recur. The improvement reflects continued traction on the IPD operation improvement plan, as we focus on operational excellence, on-time delivery, supply chain and cost management.","Operating margin improved 600 basis points to 10.3%. Operating margin increased 250 basis points, excluding the impact of 2011 IPD realignment charges that did not recur on strong SG&A leverage and disciplined cost management.","I am pleased with the progress we have made on the overall initiatives to improve operating margins. Strong SG&A expense control, disciplined pricing policies, strong project management and improved spend leverage have driven the steady improvement in our operating margins. I am confident we are taking the necessary actions to reach our targeted operating margin of 14% to 15% by 2015.","The Flow Control Division bookings decreased $28 million to $412 million, down 6.5% or relatively flat on a constant currency basis on a particularly tough compare. The second quarter of 2011 was FCD's highest booking quarter ever. While most of the end markets were down, again, on a very tough compare, the power market was strong. Regionally, strength in the Middle East, Africa and North America was not enough to offset a significant decline in Europe.","Sales increased $14 million to $402 million, up 3.7% or 11% on a constant currency basis versus a very strong 2011 compare. Sales growth was driven by original equipment sales in the oil and gas and chemical sectors, primarily in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Regional strength in Asia-Pacific, North America and Latin America was partially offset by Europe and the Middle East, Africa.","Gross margin declined 110 basis points to 33%, due primarily to a mix shift to original equipment, reflecting the shipment of certain low-margin projects in oil and gas strategically bid in early 2011 to build our aftermarket base in this sector.","We have continued to drive the oil and gas business in the Middle East through portfolio enhancements and QRC development. Operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 15%. Disciplined cost control drove SG&A as a percent of sales, down 70 basis points to 18.1%. FCD continued to develop its aftermarket capabilities with the addition of 2 QRCs in China and Russia in the first half of the year. The new sites will support our customers with local inventory, manufacturing capability and quick response requirements.","Overall, I am pleased with the operational improvements since the One Flowserve initiative began. Work remains, and we continue to drive internal efficiencies that focus on further improvements in the front-end bidding and project pursuit processes to drive quality improvement in our backlog and margin expansion in future quarters.","And now, I would like to turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into the financials, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the importance of our risk profile and the stabilizing attributes that have driven our consistency through the cycle.","Our highest ever aftermarket bookings of over $500 million in the second quarter, combined with solid original equipment bookings in the absence of large projects, demonstrates the importance of our diverse end markets, broad geographic presence and our long and short cycle mix, which have been critical in lowering our risk profile and creating stability through the cycle.","For example, while Europe, the Middle East and Africa have been a challenge this year, with economic instability and the effects of the debt crisis, bookings in North America and Asia-Pacific have more than offset the softness in those markets.  Additionally, while our power and water markets have been down the first half of the year, they have been more than offset by the strength in the chemical, oil and gas and general industries.","So as we take a look at our bookings mix in the first half of the year, we drove strong growth in our aftermarket bookings through a continued focus on our end-user strategies. The aftermarket mix increased 2% to 40% versus the first half of last year.","Overall, first half bookings increased $80 million, up 3.4% or 8.1%, excluding a negative currency impact of approximately $111 million. When we look at sales for the first half of the year, the mix is comparable to last year, with 59% original equipment and 41% aftermarket. Sales increased by over $130 million, or up 6.3% over the prior year, despite $109 million of currency headwind.","Turning to the financial results slide. Sales for the second quarter increased 5% year-over-year, or up 12.6% on a constant currency basis. Overall, gross margins declined 30 basis points in the quarter. As we discussed at the end of Q1, we expected gross margins to face continued pressure due to the shipment of some large, low-margin legacy backlog projects booked during the downturn in 2010 and the first part of 2011. Similar to Q1, there were approximately 100 to 200 basis points of impact due to these low-margin projects flowing through earnings, and we expect this to continue in Q3.","One large project, Yanbu, booked in a very competitive environment in the first half of 2011, accounts for a significant amount of the legacy backlog expected to shift over the balance of the year. We were sole sourced and expect the facility to provide 30 to 40 years of very attractive aftermarket opportunity. We expect to see gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter, as the majority of these legacy low-margin projects are expected to be shipped by the end of the third quarter.","SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased by 180 basis points to 18.9% for the quarter on strong leverage and a continued focus on cost management. Excluding the favorable impact of a $3.9 million benefit on the resolution of certain items, sales grew as a significant multiple to our SG&A growth, even as we continued to invest in our QRCs and engineering capabilities in emerging regions. Operating margins for the second quarter were up 150 basis points to 13.9%, or up 70 basis points, excluding realignment charges in 2011 that did not recur.","In the other expense income line, the stronger U.S. dollar continues to impact reported results. Similar to the first quarter, we recorded an $0.11 loss below the line as we marked our hedges and balance sheet items to market, whereas last year, we saw a $0.07 gain resulting in a negative $0.18 swing. We also saw roughly $0.20 of negative above the line translation impact. That's a $0.38 year-over-year delta in the quarter and $0.62 year-to-date. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 26.7%; was similar to Q1, just slightly below our stated structural rate of 28% to 30%. We continue to expect the full year rate to be in the 28% to 30% range, possibly trending towards the lower end of the range, including discreet items.","Turning to cash flows. We had a strong quarter generating $168 million in operating cash, reflecting significant improvement on both our quarterly and year-to-date basis. CapEx was $28 million in the second quarter, about $4 million higher than last year, as we continued to increase our aftermarket capabilities, adding an additional QRC during the quarter, a total of 3 for the year, all in emerging regions. Our capital expenditure outlook for the year remains in the $125 million to $135 million range.","As part of our capital allocation plan, which started last fall, we announced a new targeted capital structure of 1x to 2x total debt to annual EBITDA as we move towards a more efficient balance sheet. Our improved end markets and proven ability to manage through the cycle gives us the confidence to prudently increase leverage, while driving improved cash utilization efficiency and investing capital in the most accretive opportunities available.","As part of our plan, we executed a $300 million accelerated share repurchase program to systematically access the market over a 6-month period. We believe our targeted capital structure will provide adequate flexibility to meet our commitments to shareholders while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic when unique investment opportunities arise. Bolt-on acquisitions will continue to be focused around strategic fit and revenue synergies across our global sales and aftermarket platforms with significant consideration of integration risk.","During the quarter, we paid a total of $411 million related to share repurchases, partially financed by $300 million of short-term borrowings. We took delivery of 3.3 million shares, including the initial delivery of 2.26 million shares for $240 million under our $300 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in June. While the cash has been paid, the remaining $60 million share value under the ASR program will not be settled until the conclusion of the program later this year.","As of the end of Q2, we have $625 million remaining on the $1 billion program, including the impact of the final settlement of $60 million of share value under the ASR program. As it relates to dividends, we increased our dividend over 12% earlier in the year and returned $20 million to our shareholders in the second quarter, or $37 million year-to-date.","Moving to working capital. We made some progress, but work remains. As it relates to receivables, DSO decreased 7 days versus the first quarter to 81 days. I remain confident that with our disciplined focus on cash collection and the improvements we are making on the front-end bidding process, we can drive DSOs into the mid 60s over the next 12 to 18 months.","On the inventory side, we successfully decreased our past due backlog by approximately 200 basis points since the beginning of the year, which puts us back near historical levels. With the implementation of operational improvements and Tom's focus on on-time delivery and cost of quality, we believe there is additional opportunity to reduce that past due balance and drive further inventory efficiency.","Although we saw improvement in our inventory turns up to 2.8, we believe we can hit a long-term target of 4 to 4.5 turns over the next 18 to 24 months. We have a number of internal initiatives ongoing around working capital. And as I stated previously, working capital is receiving a significant amount of my focus, as we bring these metrics to more appropriate levels.","So let's take a look at our outlook for the remainder of 2012, following a solid first 6 months.  Similar to the prior years, we expect the third quarter to be seasonally challenged from a volume and absorption standpoint. Additionally, as we mentioned earlier, the third quarter margins will be impacted by legacy backlog shipments by 100 to 200 basis points year-over-year. However, the fourth quarter is shaping up to clearly be our strongest of the year.","From a foreign currency perspective, we have seen significant volatility. With the strengthening U.S. dollar, we are now estimating approximately $1 instead of the $0.50 in prior guidance of negative foreign currency impact above and below the line versus 2011. Most of this additional impact will be felt in the second half of the year.","Third quarter will be a tough year-over-year compare, as the dollar began strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect additional foreign currency headwinds will be partially offset by the share repurchase activity, as we execute on our share buyback program.","We estimate approximately $0.30 of net benefit related to share repurchase activity in 2012, offset by higher borrowing costs related to increased leverage. With the recent credit upgrade from the rating agencies, we anticipate taking advantage of current attractive debt markets to further support our capital structure strategy.","Net-net, despite the significant incremental foreign currency headwind, partially offset by our share repurchase activity, we remain confident in our initial guidance range; therefore, reaffirming our 2012 4-year guidance of $8 to $8.80 per share.","And now let me turn it back over to Mike.","Mike Mullin","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we are ready to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Charlie Brady.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can we go back to the commentary on the strength in the pre-feed and feed activity? Can you give some more granularity on where you're seeing that by end market and geography?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, there's -- well, we talked a little bit about softness in the Middle East, and that's mainly around the projects that we see on the horizon, some refineries that are being built that we see coming on next year. And so you've seen a lot of the feed work in that area, feed work in the LNG. So if you look at particularly a lot of the Western E&Cs, they've been doing a tremendous amount of feed work. There's front-end work being done on the chemical, particularly in North America, where you're seeing gas as a low-cost feedstock. And then also, we talked a little bit about the power industry year-over-year and really, for the quarter, down -- it was kind of mixed. We've actually seen nuclear start to free up a little bit. And we're seeing that combined cycle on the horizon, but solar has been challenged, and they're still working their way through the coal fired. But as we look over the horizon, certainly some combined cycle opportunities, and we think that nuclear are going to come back online. So that's consistent with what you've seen. Also on the mining industry, you've seen continued feed work. That's been the case for about the last 2 years.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right. And your commentary on the fertilizer production opportunity. Can you just go into that a little bit more? I mean, it's an area I don't think you've talked about a lot previously.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, as Mark was indicating, the amount of pre-feed and feed work is significantly up on the general industries segment, of which a lot of that is the fertilizer business on a worldwide basis. So that business looks like it's really driving pretty heavily across many different regions around the world. And we would expect some good bookings going forward in that business.","Mark A. Blinn","Charlie, consistent with the trends we've been talking about for a while. Demand, demand for food, demand for water, demand for power, demand for hydrocarbons, they'll vary from time to time. I mean, I think one consistent theme that we've talked about is you've seen the impact to Europe, and we're not the only company. But pretty much across-the-board in our sectors, we've seen the impact of what's going on in Europe.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, one more I've got in the queue here. What is the new share count assumption embedded in the current guidance for 2012?","Michael S. Taff","Charlie, it's Mike. Yes, I mean, I think the best way to think about it is for the year, we purchased about $433 million worth of shares. And by year-end, we'd expect that number to increase another 200, let say $240 million or so by the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Hey, I was just wondering, maybe this is a question for Mike, then one for Tom and then truthfully Mark, one for you. Mike, the cash flow profile of the company has improved towards -- 2 consecutive quarters now. And I know that there's a lot of blocking and tackling work. But is there also an aftermarket element to this where maybe the conversion of cash, that cycle is expedited a little bit and gives you a little bit more visibility on what your liquidity looks like going forward?","Mark A. Blinn","Actually, this is Mark. It works a little bit the other way, particularly in our seal business because we keep a lot of parts and spares in our QRCs so that we can respond very quickly so the aftermarket -- if you look at our aftermarket business, the key is the ability to be able to respond very quickly. So what you're seeing in the improvement, a lot of it is focus. There's a lot of focus. But the other thing, as Mike commented, at the beginning of the year, we talked about a focus around our past due backlog, which is distinct from legacy and how we were going to bring that down. And we've had good success. That will correlate to working capital and the utilization of working capital. So it's really been around a lot of the operational improvement. We still have work to do on the working capital. But that's driven some of the cash conversion.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","As far -- so Mark, maybe they'll just stay with you. The legacy backlog just -- I guess, it's frustrating from an outsider standpoint that this thing, this keeps slipping into deeper and deeper quarters. Now you're signaling that possibly even into the fourth quarter. Could you tell us why that is exactly?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, this is the same thing. It's the other side of what we saw in 2009 and 2010, when the 2008 very high-priced backlog lived with us for a period of time. That's just the way our long cycle business works. And we commented last year that some of the projects were going to live into 2012. I think the key is you\u2019ve seen the growth in our aftermarket business and being able to offset that; the growth in our short cycle business. It's the way our business works. And it's also why you didn't see tremendous volatility in earnings through the cycle because you have this lag effect. So as Mike commented, I mean, one of the particular projects, we're very -- it's very strategic. We're very happy about it, sole sourced in the western region of Saudi Arabia. We will get the kind of aftermarket capture that you are now seeing embedded in our $508 million of bookings. But the fact is these things, you work through them; they're long cycle project. So we anticipated it. We'll work through them. Sometimes these things do push if the customer is not ready. But for the most part, we'll have a lot of this cleared from where we were at the beginning of the year, at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we typically have a lot of other strengths in our business that will tend to offset that. And as we set up for 2013, we will get the benefit from really moving out of the cycle that we saw in 2010, 2011. We talked about some of the additional bidding activity that we see in 2013 and some projects. We'll see some of the benefit from that next year, but it will carry on. That will be long cycle, as well. So that benefit will stay with us. Driving our initiatives, as we talked about around an improvement in our gross margin, improvement in our operating margins, focus on leverage. So this is the way we kind of cycle through in our business.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So let me just try to paraphrase what you said on the incremental. So what we thought was going to be kind of a wrap-up in the third quarter of the legacy shipments, essentially gets pushed into the fourth quarter based on customer push backs of deliveries. Is that fair?","Mark A. Blinn","You can have -- the customers, you can -- look, one of the things on these big projects we've talked about before is we have to wait on a motor. And if the motor is slow on delivery, then that can push us. But for the most part, we see our way through. Where we were at the beginning of the year, we see a lot of this getting up by the third quarter, which is what we anticipated. If some carries over to the fourth quarter, that can happen overall in our business. But we'll move past the cycle this year and basically get into the environment we've been in since the last half of 2011 starting in 2013.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, fair enough. The other question I had was for Tom. Tom, your work across the segments. I'm just kind of wondering, I asked this question last quarter but now we've got a little bit more runway here with you with what you're doing, a little bit more time to implement. What are the big things that you are focusing on, on the cost side right now, Tom?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Well, I mean, everything from our perspective starts on the proposal stage. So we're putting a lot of effort into the proposal and in terms of the set up if the scope on the job, the set up of the terms, the costing, a lot more advanced procurement resources we put on that aspect, as well as good cash flow management, as we look at our cash flow strategies in the proposal space. So I would say that's one aspect. We continue to focus on the same things that we've been focusing on in the last several years, which are gross margin. There, we take a lot of effort in terms of low-cost sourcing, the lean, the Six Sigma efforts, the throughput through the facilities. We have good line of sight on areas that we want to fix in several of our facilities, and we have teams on those. I would say the other 2 items are items we talked about before, which is the base, which is the on-time delivery. So a significant amount of focus on supplier on-time delivery, as well as individual unit on-time delivery with our initiatives. We spend a lot of time on quality and quantity of documentation to get at the working capital, as well as try to get at first-pass yields through the business so that we improve the overall efficiency and throughput through the businesses. So I would say a lot of the basics we continue to drive. We just have, I would say, a more rigorous program for driving those initiatives.","Mark A. Blinn","Scott, the general theme that was in our comments and what we're focused on, we are very focused on what we have in our 4 walls and being able to even drive margin improvement there. We think we have opportunity there. If you think about it, we came through a high-price cycle in '07 and '08. We spent a lot of time realigning what I'd call the front end of our business in '09, '10 and '11 on the aftermarket side, integrating pumps and seals. And now this is a step around really driving the operations engine of this business to carry us into this next cycle.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Maczka.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First question on the demand side. It sounds like you're optimistic there but you did have some commentary about short cycle moderating and some mega project pushouts. So 2 questions. I guess on the short-cycle side, has that stabilized at this point? Any moderation that you've seen? And on the mega project pushout, if that's macro-related, what is it from your customer conversations that gives you confidence that, that will, in fact -- those bids will be the let in 2013 and not just pushed out even further if things remain tough?","Mark A. Blinn","Okay. Well, a couple of things. On the short cycle, moderating doesn't mean going down. Moderating means you don't see, for example, the growth rates you saw this time last year in FCD. They were up almost 30% in the bookings in the quarter. A lot of that overlay around that moderation is Europe. You are just seeing the impact of Europe across the board on our sectors. That's what's driving the moderation. But moderation still means growth. I think the thing on the -- what on the long cycle in the projects, we made these comments in the beginning of 2009. We said, \"Look, there's been a lot of investment made in these projects already. Feed work and pre-feed work, there's a tremendous amount of investment.\" So as it did then, we have confidence that they'll come online, but you do see it. They can't push out of couple of quarters, especially when the world pauses to see what happens in Europe. What gives us confidence that they'll come on is one, the investment that's been made; but more important, the need for these projects. They have strategic value. So you talk about the chemical facility in the Middle East. They have a strategic focus on making sure that they're vertically integrated across their feedstocks and putting more refined output out into the market as opposed to just basic crude. Those are strategic drivers. You look in, for example, in Latin America. Some of what you've seen is the impact of elections in Mexico and then there's a new leader at Petrobras. It doesn't mean they aren't going to invest going forward because their economies or their companies are highly dependent on monetizing these natural resources, but an election will affect the timing of some of these things. You know they're coming back online because they need them basically for their economy, for independence, for their population, same thing with power. So that's what gives us confidence. It's the same thing that gave us confidence that projects would come through when we were sitting there at the end of 2008 and 2009. It's just we recognize that they can push a couple of quarters.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Got it. And then, Mark, environmental regs is another area that we haven't talked as much about. But you mentioned it a couple times in your slides today in the oil and gas and the power space. Can you just maybe give a little more color there? Are there some potential real needle movers here? And what kind of compliance timing are we talking about in a couple of instances?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, there is -- there are always needle movers. But if you look at how diversified we are across, for example, the hydrocarbon, oil and gas business, LNG has been certainly a needle mover. But in and of itself, it's -- since we're not highly concentrated necessarily in one area, it'll move, but it's not significant. That's the opportunity of being diversified. In terms of -- if I understand, on the regulatory on the power, the coal-fired plants in the United States have been hung up for quite a while. And now with -- although natural gas has increased in price with, that as a relative low-cost feedstock and viewed as an abundant resource, people are tilting more towards combined cycle. But I think when we look at it, we don't expect the entire power industry in the United States to go to combined cycle because if gas were to go back up to high levels, then they'll be caught on the other side. So there is a view globally that they're going to stay diversified in their power sources. I mean, we fundamental believe nuclear is going to remain 20% of the global supply of power. But you do have regulatory issues. Also certainly in the United States, and to a certain degree, in Europe as well, we've seen the nuclear industry go through what I'd call a re-evaluation mode. But they're also starting to invest again. So it's -- we'll always have these things kind of coming up overall in our business. But we remain optimistic on the power just because of demand with the urban growth and just the requirements around the world and the same thing on the hydrocarbons.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Halloran.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So some thoughts on lead times, how they're progressing from here. I know you've got some moving pieces on the lead time side, but maybe you can try to frame it more in terms of how demand is impacting the lead times and your selectivity on projects as it stands here. And then also a little bit of commentary on the utilization levels you're seeing in your plans and try to compare that to the industry.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I may not have heard the last one; somebody will tell me. But lead times, you've see them come in. I mean, an E&C always wants to bring those in because time is money. And so part of what Tom and his organization are focused on is making sure that we can drive the efficiency to respond to the lead times. So when you look at how they evaluate us bidding on a project, lead time is certainly one of the things they consider. So they've come in. Where we saw lead times really gap out was in '07 and '08 when the entire supply base was getting constrained. And the E&Cs recognized that they were going to have to flex out on lead times.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And the second part of the question was just utilization levels, how the trending in your facilities and then maybe try to give a comparison.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes -- no, good question. I mean, Mike, we talked about -- look, I'll give you an industry perspective. In '09 and '10, you had capacity that came on that was planned in '07 and '08, and there was capacity that was certainly chasing price at that point in time. As part of -- as we look over the horizon and see these project opportunities so do our very capable competitors, and they will start to rationalize. So capacity has started getting incrementally utilized in our business. And as these projects come online, it'll start to get utilized and that's when price will start to rationalize that capacity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry from UBS.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify some of the commentary around the margins. I was under the impression that we would see a slow but somewhat steady improvement in margins from 2Q to 3Q to 4Q. And it sounds like now maybe 3Q will step back but then 4Q will rebound perhaps more dramatically. Is that the right cadence, Mike, interpreting that?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think you -- there's 3 factors that -- around earnings that Mike talked about relative to Q3. But keep in mind, around our third quarter typically, we do have a seasonal element to that. Europe is on vacation. If Ramadan falls within that period of time, typically, if you looked at our absorption, fixed cost absorption, Q1 tended to be our lowest historically and Q3 -- it was -- yes, Q3 was our second lowest. So there's always been that element around the margin profile in the business. In addition to that, it's pushing through some of this legacy backlog as well that will impact margins. Now what we'll do to certainly offset that in Q3, Q4, all next year, is to continue to drive our margin improvement initiatives. I mean, look at what's happened in IPD. So some of them, I would say, are around legacy backlog and typical seasonality. But there are things that we'll focus on within our control: costs, improving the IPD platform that we've talked about and operational enhancements, a lot of things that we're going to work on. But I think we just want to give you a general sense that remember, the seasonal element around Q3, also that we're working through this cycle and with some of the legacy backlog, as you look at our margin profile. But it's certainly important to us.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to clarify one of the earlier questions, is the legacy backlog moving through the P&L at the pace you anticipated at the beginning of the year, or has that pace changed?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, it's pretty much as expected. And we talked about last year, and we said \"Look, we're going to be living with the down cycle though a good part of 2012. It's just the way our business works.\" Like I made the comment earlier, because of the lead times, earlier to Mike's question, earlier, the lead times back in '08, we were able to live with which was very high-priced backlog in -- for about 2 years. And so this is the offsetting impact as we work through the cycle as well. But we had anticipated. The other comment we made in the beginning of the year was around our past due. And we've made the progress we anticipated as well and brought that down.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess just finally, I wanted to ask about oil and how that's changed conversations with customers. I mean, through the quarter, both WTI and Brent came off pretty significantly. I mean, it's rebounded recently. But at these levels and considering the volatility, has that changed conversations at all with customers?","Mark A. Blinn","No.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe about 2013 CapEx?","Mark A. Blinn","No. When we go out and talk to them, they actually, in the Middle East, they set budgets at a lower expectation rate around Brent in terms of the way they look at things. I mean, if there is a sustained drop that is viewed to sustain over a long period of time, well below the levels that we have right now, then they may evaluate the projects. But to date, we have not seen them start to question their investment because of the movement. I mean, they look way past the spot price of oil.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on how you folks are thinking about M&A and your appetite for acquisitions. Given your buyback, given some of the stuff you're doing on the balance sheet, and also, given the new CEO structure that you've put in place.","Mark A. Blinn","Okay. Well, I mean, I think the way we generally look at cash deployment is what is the best return for our shareholders in terms of how we deploy cash. So if you think, for example, a highlight on the capital structure, it was really around -- as we moved through the cycle and saw the durability of our aftermarket business and cash flow generation, it gave us a lot of confidence in going ahead and taking up our leverage profile. The result of that was that we were going to in a sense from levering up precipitate some cash. When we looked at the deployment of that cash, we said, \"Look, relative valuation of our company, that's a good investment.\" So that drove the $1 billion share repurchase program. As we look at M&A, we look at similarly. We're always going to look at the alternatives of how we deploy cash: CapEx, dividends, share repurchases and inorganic opportunities in terms of returns to our shareholders. As we look at the pipeline and M&A, one of the things we talked about, because we have a broad geographic scope and quite a few products in our portfolio, what we want to do is focus on bolt-ons. Bolt-ons are -- have to have good strategic fit, and that is what you've seen, for example, on Valbart and Lawrence that we can leverage our sales organization, drive through our aftermarket capabilities. So in terms of strategic fit in our space, we will also focus on the impact to integration. And I think a lot of that correlates to our new COO structure, driving a lot of operational initiatives. And what we want to make sure is that those stay a priority overall in our business. And then finally, we'll look and determine how we finance it. But it's really going to start in terms of what is going to be the cash-on-cash return of the investments we make. We recognize that we want to continue to grow the business as well. So we think with the flexibility in our capital structure, we can really look to grow our business, also invest in our business, both in CapEx in terms of our share count as well, and really drive returns to our shareholders. So that's the way we think about it.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That makes sense. And then just a question on the legacy backlog. You guys spoke of that being a margin drag, 100 bps, 200 bps, maybe. Could you maybe comment on how we should think about the difference in margin profile on that legacy versus the past-due backlog? I assume not all past due backlog is low margin. Maybe if you could touch on how we should think about that.","Mark A. Blinn","That's fair. I mean, not all past due is low margin. And so as you think about it, past due correlates more towards some of the working capital, some of the things -- the impacts you've seen on inventory in the business. Now having said that, we've always talked about time is money. So to the extent something becomes past due, the margin profile does change, and typically, not for the positive. So there is a related element of that. But -- and the way to think about the legacy backlog, Hamzah, if -- we've talked about this. On our long cycle business, which has, historically, been 20% of our business, think back about '07 and '08. And also consider that on these big, big projects, 40% to 50% of that project is something we buy from other companies, a big driver, a big motor. And we can't drive big margins on those buyouts, as we call them, to our customers. They just source them directly. But what you saw in '07, '08, there was so much competition for capacity in the industry we were actually able to get good decent margins on the whole project itself. You roll forward to back to what we saw in 2010 and 2011, and people were looking to cover their absorption, cover their variable cost, which means you had fairly low gross margin bids out there in the business. Now as things have started to kind of rationalize a little bit in late 2011, 2012, what you see is you can get good margin on the equipment you manufacture and get margin on your engineering capabilities and your ability to assemble, test, deliver, design and really, ultimately, support it. But you're not going to be able to command very high margins on the buyouts of these business. So what we're seeing is the market is starting to move back to more normal levels and typically, what you'll see is it will undershoot in the down cycle and it will overshoot if capacity gets real tight.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That makes sense. And just a last one for me, just for Tom Pajonas, just a clarification. On the Flow Control business, is the margin coming in lower all mix, or did you see any disruption from you moving to the COO role, or is that just all mix and you expect margin to come back?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, I'll take the latter part of that question first. I mean, the management team there is very capable of continuing to execute and expanding the business going forward. So I'm very confident in the management team there. The gross margin issue had a lot to do with the mix shift to the original equipment. Also, it had to do with -- we took some shipments that were lower margin strategically in the oil and gas area, particularly in the Middle East in order to build up the backlog there, get the capacity for some of our facilities in Europe and to begin to look at the aftermarket business there. So I would say we're aware when we took those jobs that, that gross margin was going to flow through. And I'm very confident going forward in terms of the gross margin of that business picking up in future quarters.","Mark A. Blinn","Hamzah, let me just clarify just one thing, I -- somehow, we've gotten the notion here that legacy backlog was -- is bad and it is lower margin. But keep in mind this is what will continue to feed our aftermarket business. So part of what you've seen us to support us through the downturn and provide good earnings, stability and growth in our business is our aftermarket. And part of this -- a lot of this legacy backlog is directly related to feeding that aftermarket business in future periods.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Question, bookings. Quite impressive on your bookings given the fact that you had really no large -- or you called out really no large projects. Can you give us a sense of the current pricing that's in those bookings right now because it is much, as you say, shorter cycle?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I think in general because a lot of the processes that Tom has talked about and really what we see on the horizon in terms of projects, the quality of our backlog improved. And in that, there's a number -- price is certainly an element of that. You also, as we look at flow-through and cycle times, quality, on-time delivery, all those aspects of us gives us confidence that what we're putting in backlog has an improving margin profile.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Many of my questions have been answered already. I want to go right to the guidance. Mike called out 100 bps to 200 bps year-over-year. Is that year-over-year on an adjusted basis?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, that's right. Q3 versus Q3 net last year.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, on an adjusted basis, though?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, in terms some of the realignment activities and everything we had, yes. It's just -- if you look at the business in terms of backlog flowing through and backlog flowing through, it's 100 bps to 200 bps.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Right, right. And you made the comment that it might be a tough hurdle on the bottom line so to take that into consideration. The other question I have is on the FCD in terms of the margin degradation there a little bit. I know you sort of spoke about a little bit of the mix shift there. But has there been any legacy projects or, say, slow- or no-growth margin projects in that particular segment? I thought the majority of it was in EPD and IPD?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, that's fair. But what Tom commented, they've started to move into particularly in the Middle East, some of these big projects similar to what EPD did. And that's part of what you saw in this quarter. But keep in mind, we opened a big aftermarket facility there in the first part of this year. So FCD is starting to leverage some of the capabilities that EPD has had for many years in terms of driving their aftermarket business. Keep in mind, if you think of the evolution of aftermarket, it was typically our heritage seal business that drove strong aftermarket growth, then the pump business, you saw increases there. Now with this One Flowserve, Tom is starting to drive some of the same capabilities across our valve division, which typically had a relatively low aftermarket retention. So it's part of the projects. And the other thing was, as you look at in terms of our capabilities -- broad capabilities, on some of these big projects, we were able to get our pump seals and valves on them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to clarify the last question on margins. You have the 100 to 200 basis point headwind, but it doesn't necessarily mean the margins will be down year-over-year. Looking at 2Q, you had the headwind, but margins weren't down. Is that the way to think about it?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, we've got the headwind. Like you saw on the second quarter, we are able to offset it some with better flow through and operational improvement and increase in aftermarket. All we're trying to do is isolate the impact of the business that's come through that was booked in the downturn for aftermarket business going forward. And sometimes, it was to load the facilities. There's -- the other things will continue to drive margin improvement overall in the business: cost controls, better flow through and the gross margin line.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right, okay. And on the -- you mentioned the legacy backlog and the aftermarket opportunity there. Can you talk about how the aftermarket capture rate maybe has progressed on backlog today versus 3 or 5 years ago?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, it's certainly a component of the growth. I mean, if you go back and look at our CAGR growth rate in the aftermarket business over the last 5, 6 years, it's been very, very strong. It has been an amount that's well over the net incremental installed base that's going in around the world. So part of that is better capture rate of the installed base we put in because as you look at customers out there, the equipment\u2019s becoming increasingly complex. And so oftentimes, they want the OEM to service it. You also have the other dynamics that a lot of their capability is for repair to the customers, which is probably our biggest opportunity. You're seeing the rotation in retirement there or redeployment oftentimes to other parts of the facility. So we've certainly seen better capture rate. But you've also seen the benefit of expanded QRC base, where we're going in and taking aftermarket capabilities from the customer or, to a certain degree, some local machine shops. And also, the benefit of our ISG strategy that's really driven around operating optimization for the facility. So there's a number of things. But keep in mind, as you look at our industry, if you just put installed base in, our aftermarket would not be going at the rate it was because there's just not that much incremental installed base around the world on an annual basis.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then one last quick one. We've heard some mixed commentary from companies on China. Just curious if you could talk about what you're seeing in the region, I guess, more on the shorter cycle businesses across the segments.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, we -- that was one of the areas of growth overall in business and part of being diversified. I mean, it depends on the areas. Oftentimes, on the consumer base, you've certainly seen pressure in China. But a lot of this is infrastructure. And they are continuing to invest in the infrastructure of the business. You look beyond -- behind the spend in China, you still have the issue where people are moving to major cities and require more power. You still have more cars on the road for -- on the hydrocarbon side. So a lot of the things that create this durable demand overall in China play out overall in our business. Now if you look at any kind of niche areas in the industrial space, certainly, in the consumer space, areas like that, then the relative growth does have an impact. And also, keep in mind, China has talked about going from growth rate to 9% to 6% overall in the business. A lot of that on the margin is going to be areas that don't impact our business. It's going to be consumer or some, what I'd call, very, very short cycle. In a lot of our short cycle business, keep in mind, also is replacement. So these facilities need to continue to operate. I'd tell you the same thing in Europe, is while it does represent approximately 20% of our business, that's why you haven't seen it completely go away is because a lot of this is tied to facilities that are currently operating.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","I apologize if this was asked. I jumped on a little bit late. But just in regard to FX, you guys have been hit a bit harder than I think, really almost any industrial that I have come across in the second quarter. Obviously, everyone is seeing headwinds, but yours is fairly exaggerated. Can you just kind of discuss how that will flow through? I understand -- from what I understand, it's kind of hedging against the mismatch between products sold -- or produced in the European region, but maybe sold in different currencies? And I would assume that they would actually result in an improved margin profile later down the line. But maybe can you just walk through that and talk about what you would anticipate that margin improvement to be, if you can, and when you would anticipate that benefit to flow through, that is offsetting the headwinds that you're seeing in the other income line in Q2?","Mark A. Blinn","Right. Well, I mean, on your general comment around industrials, an industrial that has 70% of the business outside of the United States probably are seeing a similar impact to currency. The one thing -- I don't know specifically their hedging strategies. But the one thing that may be different is we do hedge our cash flows in our business. We think cash earnings over the period of time is ultimately the right thing. So if we have a cost, not on every project, but in a meaningful amount, if we have a cost that\u2019s denominated in euros and a contract that's denominated in dollars, we want to lock in the economics. So that may be something you're seeing different. But the converse of that would have been last year, in the first part of the year where we had earnings below the line related to our marks as well. Generally around the margin profile, a negative mark will tend to indicate margin improvement in future periods, depending on when that's ultimately delivered. Keep in mind, the mark is done quarterly. So if you put the notional -- it's really sitting on backlog. If you put the notional amount on our order that's in backlog that stays there for 4 quarters, you're marking that notional every quarter that comes through. But ultimately, what that means is if the euro has weakened on a dollar-denominated contract, you'll get margin expansion and you'll take the negative impact below the line typically in a prior period.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. So based on the pressure that you've seen in Q1 and Q2 and likely, you'll see in Q3, do you have a sense of what kind of margin expansion should follow based on the marks you've taken?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, one way to help you out is there is -- I think in our disclosure, there's a portion of the mark that's related to our hedges. And if you just look at what lead times overall in the projects, the 3 to 6 quarters, you would take that mark, if sustained, and smooth that over those periods. That's probably the best way to estimate it. And that would be your margin impact. So if you, for example, had a $6 million mark and nothing else changed over in our business, and it was related to hedges, you'd look to take that maybe incrementally evenly over the next 4 to 6 quarters.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And separately, yesterday, there was a fairly large acquisition announced within the E&C space. I'm just curious, as far as your relationships with the 2 that are considering combining, how does that affect you? Are you kind of a preferred supplier to one of the 2, to both? Do you anticipate more opportunities, less opportunity associated with that deal?","Mark A. Blinn","I don't think it is going to tip the needle either away, I mean -- and we'll get more of the details around it. But generally, on these big, big projects, we work with multiple E&C firms. Now clearly, some we work more closely with than others. But we don't anticipate that's going to impact our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Moore from CL King.","John R. Moore - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Two questions on the guidance to start here. First of all, with the foreign currency being an additional $0.50 headwind, that offset by the $0.30 from share repurchases and I guess, $0.05 from corporate -- the corporate benefit this quarter, it looks like you're basically absorbing about $0.15 here in the back half of the year. And it sounds like the top line might be even a little bit slower than you expected. So I'm just wondering if there are 1 or 2 items you can point to operationally that are performing better than you had originally anticipated.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, a couple things. We haven't changed the indication around our top line. We had a 5% to 7% range. We've laid that out, I think, in earlier periods and it hasn't changed at this point in time. But I think what you do see is we have been -- we've been able to offset this, and some of it is the traction that Tom is getting overall in the business and the focus on costs as well. But if you think about it, as you look at the guidance for the year, what clearly, you can see from our guidance this quarter, going from $0.50 to $1, is the significant impact that volatility and currencies can have in our business. That's something we certainly can't control. So what we do is focus on what we can control and driving the improvement.","John R. Moore - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Okay, I got it. I guess the 5% to 7% range that it's -- I'm interested to hear that you're able to still achieve that with the foreign currency headwind. Have you actually -- I guess, can you talk about it organically? Have you actually raised your organic revenue growth forecast for the year?","Mark A. Blinn","No, I mean, the organic number is what we give you on the constant currency. And so you can kind of monitor that. Keep in mind, as we go through the year, on a year-over-year compare, Q2 would have been one of our toughest, but Q3 is as well. I think the euro was still relatively strong, or the dollar was relatively weak to other currencies in the third quarter. But you saw that abate significantly because the dollar started strengthening in Q4. So at these levels, Q3 is still a tough compare from a currency standpoint, but that impact starts abating in the fourth quarter.","John R. Moore - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Okay, got it. Just final question then. The IPD orders this quarter, I thought those were actually pretty strong, given the -- what's going on here in the global economy and that does seem to be your shorter cycle business and a little bit more through distribution. So just curious if there's a specific trend that's benefiting orders there? And I guess what I'm thinking of is the chemical industry and the benefit from, I guess, the shale gas here in the U.S.","Mark A. Blinn","I think they will certainly benefit from some of the trends overall that you're seeing in what we'd call the shorter cycle business, also benefiting from some of improvements they've driven. I mean, bottom line is, they're taking better care of their customers, and the customers are responding. But my comment around the short cycle growth, around moderation, I'll remind again, it doesn't mean no growth. It just means, for example, on FCD, they had a, I think, 25% or 30% constant currency growth in the second quarter of last year. Those are tough compares. So we will go back to what we said 4 or 5 years ago, don't read too much into just any one quarter. Look at overall trends. But what you are seeing is the short cycle business grew nicely in the early part of last year. That's moderating some but it is still growth. And what we see next on the horizon is our longer cycle business.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I'll just go with 2 quick ones, and we can follow up later on. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the SG&A, how we should think about it. I know we talked about that it should -- your long-term goal is 18%. Is there a sequential cost containment expectation that you might have as we go into Q3? Can you see that go down versus Q2 in any of the specific divisions?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, take along quarter-by-quarter, keep in mind that Q3, as I mentioned earlier, typically is our second lowest absorption quarter. And that will impact all fixed costs, including SG&A. But let's really look longer-term. What we want to do over the next 2 years is drive this down towards 18% in our business. A lot of that comes from growing our business at a rate that's quicker than you're growing your SG&A. And also, we need to take advantage of some of our One Flowserve initiatives as well. You've seen us over the last couple years hold very, very tight on our corporate cost; continue to do that as well. So it's a lot of things that we're driving, but it's really more around driving leverage in our business over the next couple years. That's part of our margin improvement profile. So as you kind of take a step back and look at margins, improvement in the IPD, they had very good cost leverage. But we see opportunity for them to grow their gross margin levels. If you can look over history, they've been higher than they were at this point in time; grow that as well. Continue to grow our aftermarket business. Take advantage of the opportunity of some of the long cycle business and leverage our SG&A. All those are interrelated. You can over-tilt on one to the detriment of the others. So we manage them very systematically across the overall business.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then really trying to get a better idea on gross margins, as you look into better bid discipline, as you discussed, and that's how we should start look at the backlog, are there any metrics you can provide to -- and give us some comparisons year-over-year on bid discipline? How should we look at that?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, I think Tom's comments around on-time delivery. I think that's going to correlate to past due backlog, and that's going to correlate to working capital, and that's going to correlate to margins as well. So I think just the commentary on how we're making improvement on our operational initiatives, coupled with our fixed cost leverage, and then our general commentary overall in the market environment are really the best indicators for what our margin profile can be looking forward. We'll also try to give you as much color as we can over the relatively short term on the impact of maybe some of these legacy backlog projects. But part of that is why we put these targets out over a multiple-year period is, as I made the comment earlier, you can drive margins certainly very, very, very short term, but impact your overall margin profile long term. So we're always striking the balance there.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I'm sorry, lastly, you had once mentioned fee-based from your aftermarket. You provided a number of customers and dollar amount. Do you have some sort of comparison for us on fee-based activity from your aftermarket business?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think the number we provided, if I recall correctly, it was -- we had these alliance agreements, about 180 of them. And that number does continue to increase. But going back to my comments originally and my remarks is we still -- even though you can have a fee-based or a contract, we must earn the right to serve our customers every day. And so we don't get overconfident in the fee-based. What that does indicate, though, and we're seeing them increase is how customers move strategically around total cost of ownership and lifecycle cost. And if you think about where this industry was 10, 15 years ago, there was the delivery and the commissioning of the facility and then really focused on maybe parts, service and repair. Increasingly, customers now are thinking about the operation of their facility over 5 to 10 years, and that's where we're starting to pick up some of these fee-based opportunities.","Operator","This time, we have a question from Charlie Brady.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Sorry if I missed it but can you give us what the fully diluted share count was at June 30?","Michael S. Taff","Say again?","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","What were the total fully -- what was the fully diluted share count at the end of the quarter on June 30?","Michael S. Taff","Shares outstanding on the face of the Q is 51.129. The weighted average was 54.266.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The 51.129, that's of July 23 or so. I guess what I'm trying to get to is there were share repurchases that happened subsequent to June 30 that aren\u2019t reflected -- or are reflected in that.","Michael S. Taff","That's correct.","Mark A. Blinn","That's correct.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So do you have what the share count was at the end of the actual second quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","That's the one he just gave you that was on the face of the document. I mean, you've got a difference between what was the average share count during the quarter because it makes a difference if you buy them in the first day of the quarter and the last day of the quarter. But that amount on the face of the Q is what will carry forward starting on July 1 into the back half of the year.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, okay. I just want to make sure there wasn't some share repurchase happened in that 23 days that skewed the number. That's what I was trying to get to, really.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes so in July?","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes.","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, we're continuing with them but we'll disclose that as we close out the quarter. I think what Mike talked about is relative to where we were in the program in the end of the quarter, this being June 30. We expected another 200 million to 240 million during the balance of the year.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And on the corporate -- discrete corporate items, there was a benefit. What was -- what exactly was that?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, it's something -- it was just resolution of a matter around accruals. I mean it was a legal matter that we resolved over a period of time, something we've been accruing for systematically over the last couple of years. So it's part of our business. But it was related to a legal accrual.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stewart Scharf.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","Most of my questions have been answered. But just looking at the DSO and inventory turns and your targets, and based on your sensitivity analysis, will that translate into, say, $200 million in cash flow if you got to 65 days and another $350 million to $500 million for the inventory turns based on 4x and 4.5x?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, Stewart. Mike. Yes, I think in the Q, we disclosed that every day is worth about $13 million now, and so we're at 80, around 80, 81 days. So if we get down to mid 60s, that's worth about $130 million or so to monetize over that period of time. And then by increasing our turns, we've got some potential benefit there, too. And another roughly, say, another $50 million to $100 million or so of monetization there potential in all.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","And what's the timeframe for that?","Michael S. Taff","I think what we said is that the DSO target is a 12- to 18-month period and the turns are 18- to 24-month period.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the time we have for our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn it back to Mr. Mullin.","Mike Mullin","Thank you, operator, and thank you, all, for joining today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead.","John Roueche","Thank you, Paulette, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in our call today to discuss Flowserve's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. Joining me on the call are Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Eckert, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up to your questions. And as a reminder, the event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available.","Also note that our earnings materials do, and this call will, include non-GAAP measures. You can review the reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to our reported results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in both our press release and earnings presentation.","Finally, this call and our associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of February 16, 2018.

We encourage you to fully review our safe harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's earnings materials, which are all available on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Robert Rowe","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's call. I am pleased overall with the progress we made in the last nine months of 2017. The new leadership team is performing well and is committed to the Flowserve transformational journey. As we look forward into 2018, we believe our served markets have turned positive, which will give us the foundation that we need to drive profitable growth for the coming years. Our near-term focus and priority is transforming Flowserve into a more simplified and streamlined operating company. Flowserve has significant potential, and we are committed to unlocking it through a comprehensive program that touches each of our functions and all of our business processes. In short, I believe the opportunities at Flowserve that I envisioned when I joined last April are even larger today, and our number one priority is to capitalize on these. I will discuss more on our Flowserve 2.0 strategy shortly, but let me first provide some comments on our end markets and our results for the period.","Starting first with our quarterly results. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 were delivered on a revenue decline of 3.4%, both of which were generally in line with our expectations. We were pleased to achieve better-than-expected bookings of $985 million, up 8.5% year-over-year and 10.3% sequentially on strong general industry and chemical activity.","Turning to our performance by segment. I am proud of our FCD team. They delivered a strong fourth quarter with both sales and operating margin growth. They achieved this growth despite the distraction of divesting two noncore businesses during 2017. For the year, FCD's reported bookings were essentially flat and sales were down modestly. But on a true comparison basis, bookings would have been up approximately 9% and sales up 4%, excluding the sold businesses.","Additionally, the segment delivered strong adjusted operating margins of 16.4% for the year despite continued pressure in the trough of the cycle. FCD has performed well through the cycle, and we will invest both organically and inorganically to build out this platform.","By contrast, IPD is still in turnaround mode. While we delivered positive adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter, we remain committed to more meaningful improvement as 2018 progresses. We continue to expect our 2018 exit rate for this business to be in the mid- to high single digits for adjusted operating margin. The new leadership team under David Wilson is making progress and taking the necessary actions to improve the overall health and performance of this platform.","While IPD's 2017 financial performance was disappointing for us, I am encouraged by the outlook and possibilities of this business unit.","The performance of EPD is somewhere in the middle of the other two segments. EPD bookings were better than expected in the quarter, driven by stronger original equipment bookings. As a longer-cycle business, these bookings were needed to replenish our backlog and help offset the original equipment sales decline.","The margins in our OE business in the fourth quarter underperformed our expectations, partially due to a 300 basis point sequential increase in OE mix, but we also struggled to execute a project in one of our Latin American manufacturing locations.","We completed a number of realignment activities in EPD during 2017, and we will see additional large facility rationalization this year as we conclude our 2015 realignment plan. I believe there is substantial room for profitability improvement in this segment, particularly within the original equipment space. This segment represents the majority of our aftermarket work, which continues to perform well in both activity levels and profitability.","Before discussing our markets and bookings in detail, I would highlight that we believe most of our served end markets have turned more favorable in the last 90 days, and we expect short-cycle investment in both FIDs and project FIDs to increase in 2018 as the cycle progresses. While it's still early to quantify the opportunity at this point, our customers are saying, either directly or through public means, that the improved macro environment, a relatively stable oil price at higher levels, improving U.S. regulatory conditions and the recently passed tax reform, are some of the factors supporting their expected increased spending levels. So we are encouraged at the prospects of having reached an inflection point in this cycle.","Now moving to our bookings for the quarter. Our bookings were higher than expected, driven by our base or foundational business. And we did not book any large projects in the period. The largest award in the quarter was $15 million, but we did obtain a number of $3 million to $8 million projects, which combined to produce solid year-over-year growth of 8.5%. Additionally, we continue to improve our discipline around pricing and order selectivity, and we are pleased with the order quality in the fourth quarter. With this total level of bookings, our backlog grew nearly 7% versus year-end 2016 levels, providing us with a stronger foundation for growth in 2018.","Aftermarket resiliency continued in the quarter, with modest year-over-year and sequential bookings growth. While we remain at the foundational level of aftermarket bookings for some time now, essentially, the $450 million per quarter level, we are optimistic that our aftermarket franchise will return to better growth rates following three years of rolling deferrals and limited investment in discretionary upgrades. Our recent discussions with customers indicate that they now anticipate higher turnaround activity and an increased focus on efficiency, starting in 2018, potentially driving an increase in small project aftermarket work, which has been largely absent for several years.","Turning to our fourth quarter bookings by end market, and I'll start with oil and gas. Bookings at our larger-served market increased approximately 3% year-over-year, driven by EPD. FCD bookings were essentially flat, while IPD decreased by approximately 5%. EPD saw bookings included several small project awards in Europe, in Asia Pacific. Looking forward, we expect that oil and gas industry to continue to gain traction, evidenced by our pipeline of pre-FEED and FEED studies that continue to expand.","Additionally, we expect many of our refining customers to increase their maintenance spend over the minimal levels that we've seen in recent years. In the chemical industry, our bookings increased over 21%, driven by EPD and FCD on strong short-cycle bookings, while IPD was essentially flat year-over-year. Overall, chemical demand continues to grow globally, especially with project opportunities in the U.S., Asia and Middle East. The second wave of North American ethylene crackers continues to move forward, albeit slowly, with two projects now in E&C hands and several others in various stages of planning.","Power bookings decreased 6%, driven by FCD, more than offsetting IPD's strong growth, which include a small nuclear project award in Europe. Newbuild fossil opportunities remain but are very competitive, particularly in Asia. Nuclear buildout continues in China, but the opportunity is partially offset by a decline in the installed base in U.S. and Germany, where fuel switching to combined cycle natural gas provides economic rationale.","Finally, we expect growth in concentrated solar power opportunities, an area where Flowserve is well positioned. General industry bookings increased over 13% versus last year's fourth quarter, which was the lowest since 2016. The increase was largely driven by distribution activity across all segments.","From a geographic perspective, all regions delivered bookings growth with the expectation - or with the exception of the Middle East, which was down 17%. North America and Europe delivered 15% and 8% growth, respectively, driven primarily by FCD and EPD. Asia Pacific increased 4%. And even our most challenged region, Latin America, grew its bookings by over 50%.","Now let me turn to Flowserve 2.0 and my expectations for progress during 2018. Late last year, I laid out the central elements to streamline and simplify the company while transforming our operating model. While I plan to capitalize on the foundation the company has built over the last 20 years, we believe an improved operating model will provide more value to our key stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders. As I've discussed in the past, transformational change, like the one we're pursuing, is not easy and it won't be accomplished quickly. Flowserve 2.0 will be a multiyear journey that focuses on improving the culture, the health and the performance of Flowserve. While the journey will take time, we are actively implementing and driving change. I want to highlight some of the progress that we made in 2017.","We implemented a flatter corporate organizational structure and added many new leaders to the team. We created a marketing and technology organization to ensure that we are market-led and customer-focused, moving us to be more proactive with our product development and R&D efforts. We centralized our supply chain efforts and began the journey to leverage our global scale and capitalize on our buying power. We installed an operational excellence team and standardized our operational KPIs to drive improved and more consistent performance, and we reduced overhead costs and streamlined corporate reporting and requirements to accelerate our business simplification ambition.","All of those changes were implemented in 2017. In addition to those changes, over the last couple of months, we conducted a complete diagnostic evaluation of how Flowserve is currently operating and organized with a top to bottom examination of ourselves, essentially equivalent to conducting a robust due diligence review to fully assess our capabilities and to better identify our long-term opportunities for value creation. We conducted this assessment across six key areas, operations, commercial, growth, aftermarket, G&A or cost structure and working capital. This full-scale assessment is now complete, and we are creating detailed action plans and a timeline to deliver this value.","In January, we conducted a leadership summit with 100 of the top Flowserve associates. In this session, we launched the value creation and value capture journey. Earlier in my time at Flowserve, it became clear to me that we had to address the culture and better engage our associates around the world. A large part of the leadership summit was devoted to the foundational aspects of running a company for the long term. We launched a new purpose statement, new core values, a new vision for the future, and we spent time addressing the human side of driving change. We need each and every Flowserve associate to understand why they come to work and how they can impact our long-term success.","In addition to these foundational elements, we also rolled out a global organizational change that will drive enhanced accountability and drastically simplify our organization. As I have previously indicated, Flowserve's past operating model was more intricate than required with too many P&Ls, systems and processes. The new organizational changes in the Flowserve 2.0 initiatives will significantly decrease this complexity to better leverage the vast scale that we have in the business. The entire company will be run on a similar manner with consistent operating model. We will be leaner, faster and better informed to make proper business decisions for our long-term success. We're essentially breaking down the silos that have been present within Flowserve for many years.","As I discussed last September, this is a multiyear endeavor, but we do expect to see progress each and every month. The price and the potential at Flowserve is enormous. In fact, it's larger than I originally expected. However, in order to capture this value, we had to start with some of the foundational elements to address our people and our culture. 2018 will mark a significant step in our journey towards excellence. As we continue to progress with Flowserve 2.0, we look forward to sharing additional details with the financial community on the initiatives that we'll be taking and if it's derived in quantifying these opportunities. While I fully expect the benefits of our transformation are material, we anticipate offsetting much of this year's costs associated with driving these important changes by reprioritizing investments and redirecting some of our key savings. I'm confident that the actions we are taking will increase our ability to effectively support our customers, creating more meaningful workplace for our employees and drive significant long-term value for our shareholders.","I'll return shortly for some closing comments, but let me now turn the call over to Lee to discuss our financials in greater detail.","Lee Eckert","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Looking through our financials. As Scott highlighted, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 in the fourth quarter of 2017, generally in line with the expectations we discussed on our last conference call. On a reported basis, loss per share of $0.81 included discrete tax items of $1.21, primarily related to the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform. For Flowserve, this discrete tax expense will be noncash as repatriation tax is offset by existing tax credits. The remaining impact from legislation is a benefit related to the adjustments of deferred tax items to the lower tax rate. Additional adjustments include realignment spend of $0.06 and $0.04 comprised of a small asset impairment, below-the-line currency impacts and PPA.","Total sales were $1 billion in a seasonally high fourth quarter, sequentially delivering a 17.1% increase. Year-over-year fourth quarter revenue declined 3.4%, which included a 370 basis point currency tailwind on the weaker U.S. dollar and roughly a 2% headwind on divestitures. Aftermarket sales were $502 million, representing 48% of our total revenue for the quarter and were essentially flat with prior year.","Looking now at gross margins. At 30.5%, our adjusted gross margin was down 230 basis points versus the prior year's fourth quarter. Loss of sales leverage, lower-margin shipments from backlog and the challenged project at EPD more than offset our incremental cost savings and a 100 basis point mix shift towards higher-margin aftermarket activity. On a reported basis, which included a reduction in year-over-year realignment charges, our gross margin decreased 120 basis points to 29.4%.","Both reported and adjusted SG&A were down modestly in the fourth quarter. Continued incremental cost actions were sufficient to offset impact from the weakening U.S. dollar and other headwinds. Fourth quarter adjusted operating and reporting margin declines of 310 and 130 basis points to 9.8% and 8.3%, respectively, were primarily driven by loss sales leverage, EPD's Latin America project and IPD's performance. 2017 reported operating margins did benefit from lower realignment expense.","Our reported effective tax rate was high in the fourth quarter, primarily related to U.S. tax reform act in certain valuation allowances. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for the quarter was low at 24.8%, primarily due to favorable resolution of older tax issues. While we saw substantial quarterly volatility in our tax rates during the year, for the full year of 2017, our adjusted tax rate was very much in line with our initial guidance at 30%.","Despite the substantial reported tax expense we recorded during the quarter, we believe the Tax Reform Act will prove beneficial to our customers, end markets and future results. Considering Flowserve's approximately 2\/3 international, our effective tax rate in 2018 will not decline as much as U.S.-centric entities since we still record taxes in the foreign jurisdictions that are generating income, but the ability to move international cash back to the U.S. without incremental tax increases our financial flexibility.","With current global growth rates, the tax bill, reduced regulation and relatively stable oil prices, we believe the conditions are set for inflection in many of our served markets. Quickly looking at our full year 2017 results. Revenues were $3.7 billion and our adjusted EPS was $1.36, down 8.3% and 36.2%, respectively. This is clearly not the level of performance we expect in the future. It is consistent with the third quarter guidance we provided.","Turning to cash. Strong fourth quarter operating cash flow of $239 million improved $70 million year-over-year, primarily due to $148 million reduction in working capital in the fourth quarter. For the year, our $160 million working capital reduction helped generate a $71 million increase in cash flow from operations to $311 million. While we are pleased to achieve the year-over-year operating cash flow improvement, our working capital is still not where it needs to be and remains a priority to reduce.","Moving to the realignment program. Cash costs were roughly $26 million this quarter, bringing the full year total to approximately $79 million. In the fourth quarter, we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends. During 2017, we were very disciplined with our capital expenditure spending, even as we properly invested in and maintained our core business. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $21 million, which brought the full year to approximately $62 million, the lowest level in over a decade.","As a result of our strong quarterly cash flow, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $700 million, a quarterly increase of $200 million sequentially.","Turning to the 2018 outlook. We are targeting full year adjusted EPS of $1.50 a share to $1.70 a share on expected revenue increase of 3% to 6%, including approximately 2% of expected currency tailwind, which will more than offset an approximate 1% headwind from divested businesses. The adjusted EPS target range excludes the 2018 realignment expense of approximately $90 million as well as below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items, which may occur during the year such as acquisitions, divestitures, tax reform law, et cetera.","Our outlook assumes volume, price and productivity to offset the incremental headwinds in 2018 due to inflation, merit and the annual reset of performance-driven broad-based variable compensation plans. Both the reported and adjusted EPS target range assumes current FX rates and commodity prices. 2017 year-end backlog, expected booking levels and market conditions and minimal impact from the adoption of the new accounting principles. Net interest expense is expected in the range of $58 million to $60 million with a tax rate of 27% to 28%.","Additionally, we expect traditional seasonality in the quarterly phasing of earnings, although with it being more pronounced in the second half weighting. In addition to the anticipated realignment spending, which will complete the 2015 program, other expected full year cash usage includes approximately $100 million in dividends for our shareholders. We will remain disciplined in our capital expenditures but plan to invest in some enabling technologies for Flowserve 2.0, which will bring full year CapEx to the $80 million to $90 million range. We will pay down approximately $60 million in debt and expect to contribute approximately $30 million to our global pension plan, mainly to cover ongoing service costs as U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.","Next week, Scott and I will participate in the Gabelli & Company's pump valve and water systems conference in New York City. Additionally, Jay and Mike will attend Citi's International Conference in Florida next week as well. We hope to see many of our shareholders at these events, and Scott's session will be webcast for those who would like to listen.","While Flowserve can't realistically participate in all the opportunities available to us, we do look forward to maintaining active engagement with the financial community again this year.","Let me now turn the call back to Scott for his closing remarks.","Robert Rowe","Thanks, Lee. I will close with a few comments on our guidance and why I'm uncomfortable with it. Clearly, we did not deliver the profitability in 2017 that was originally expected. We don't intend to repeat falling short again. I would also note that our internal aspirations exceed these levels, but we believe this guidance range is realistic, considering we still have significant issues to overcome an incremental annual headwind. I am more confident in the overall marketplace and that we have seen an inflection point in most of the markets that we participate in. Additionally, Flowserve has a healthy backlog to begin 2018.","I also have confidence in David and the IPD team that the past performance issues are contained and fixable and that the segment will contribute in a more substantial way in 2018. While our work this year is not forecast to unlock Flowserve's full potential, we expect it will position us well for 2019 and beyond. Our guidance for 2018 doesn't include the full productivity enhancements that we expect longer term and the benefits from Flowserve 2.0 will be more meaningful in later years.","Nevertheless, we are pleased to initiate guidance for 2018 with a positive trajectory after several years of forecasting declining revenues and earnings. This year represents a new beginning for our company and one we expect to drive significant long-term value for our shareholders.","Like Lee, I look forward to seeing many of you as the year progresses. We value our shareholders in every action we have and we'll take is with our owners in mind and the expectation to deliver value.","Operator, this now concludes our prepared remarks. We would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust.","Charles Brady","Just on IPD and kind of the margin progressions through the year to get to that exit rate, how much of that, getting to that rate, is volume-dependent versus internal, fixing what's wrong-dependent?","Robert Rowe","Yes, no. Good question, Charley. It's really - it's internal focus. And so we've got the volume. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we had a nice number there. The first quarter, from a seasonality perspective, will be lower. And so we've got a little bit of some headwinds just on the scale in overcoming that. But we feel good about the bookings level and the revenue, and it really is just focusing on operations and testing what we've done. And one of the big things, and I talked about this a little bit before, is we've got a pretty substantial past due backlog. And as that backlog ages and sits there, we're adding cost to it via expediting additional inspection of the redundancies. And so until we get the past due backlog fully cleared, it just is a headwind to driving profitable growth and expanding that margin.","But I'll tell you, David and the team, they're doing a good job. And I think he's in month five now on the job, and we're - we reorganized the entire platform in January. We're upgrading our people. And then probably more importantly is we're really focusing on disciplined manufacturing and operational process and process adherence, but we're at the starting line on that. And so it's going to take time. We've got to clear the past due backlog. We've got to get that process and procedural adherence in place. And I think when we look at the year, kind of the big things, we're going to continue to take cost out, both product cost and overhead cost. There's more restructuring to be done in the platform, and so there'll be some realignment activity that continues in 2018. And then we've got to get more focused on our pricing discipline and capturing the value that we deserve in that platform. But we're still committed to mid- to single high operating income margin at the end of the year, the fourth quarter. But I would just say, first quarter is not going to be great. And as we progress, it just gets better throughout the year.","Charles Brady","Can you just comment on if we back out any kind of restructuring one-off costs as we go forward, what kind of incremental margins should we be assuming across the three segments?","Robert Rowe","Across all three?","Charles Brady","Well, I guess, obviously, there's a different margin profile for each of the segment. So I guess, I'd like to - by segment, I guess, what's your thinking on...","Robert Rowe","Yes, I can give - I mean, I'll give a little color. I don't want to get into exact one-offs. But I'd just say IPD, we just talked about, right? So we'll progress IPD. Q1 won't be great. We should improve in Q2, Q3. We exit the year at mid- to high single digits. And while that's not where we want it to be, it should be a mid-teens business, we'll continue to drive that progress in progression. On the EPD side, we talked about the fourth quarter margins not being where we want it in the prepared remarks. And I think - so if we back that out, you get back into some normal operating margins there that we think we've got improvements on. And then FCD, I think we're at a pretty good place. And I'm not saying they don't get better, but I think it's just slow progression on the FCD side as we kind of progress and continue to do good things in the valve platform.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Scott, there was - I think you talked about the fact that there still was a fair amount of noise in the quarter. We knew about IPD margin already, but EPD margin was relatively weak based on the project execution issues. So maybe stepping back, you've been in the seat now for a few quarters. Outside of realignment, should we begin to see the noise level start to go down here pretty significantly in '18? I mean, you already talked about IPD, but sort of these little nicks and surprises, have you been able to sort of get to the point where you feel pretty on top of this stuff and we should see less noise in '18?","Robert Rowe","Yes. Andy, it's a great question. And honestly, it's what's been bothering me every quarter that I've been here. So every quarter, right, we've got something that's an issue or some nick that's driving our margins down. And what I'd say is it is isolated to - at this point, at least, isolated to our original equipment on the pump side, right? And so it's been IPD. And then we had an issue on the EPD original equipment this quarter. But everything that we're doing, right, the new organizational structure and how we think about Flowserve 2.0 in terms of defining process, procedural adherence, the right KPIs, the right metrics, everything we're doing is to just drive consistency in operations. So I do think that gets better. But unfortunately, right now, we've got a large past due backlog that's accruing cost.","We've got to move that out in the first half of next year, and then we've got to start to drive more consistency in operations. Again, that is our focus. I do expect that to get better in '18, but unfortunately, this is a journey. And I keep getting surprised by things even this quarter. That shouldn't happen. And so we've just got to - we've got to get the right organization in place, the right process, and we've got to be maniacally focused on delivering that new equipment.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. That's helpful color, Scott. So just focusing on aftermarket for a second. You kind of talked about it, but the aftermarket bookings have been creeping up again, 4.60 you mentioned has been the range for the last couple of years. And the thing is versus a couple years ago, right, short-cycle energy; certainly, short-cycle industrial are better than they were. You mentioned deferred maintenance and the absence of small projects. But why haven't they come back already for you guys? And are you more confident that we really should break out of this range in '18?","Robert Rowe","Yes. I think - so obviously, we've been at 4.50. We've been hitting that every quarter now for almost 2, 2.5 years. And then we've got a little bit of an uptick in the Q4, but I would say nothing to be too excited about. But as we turn into '18, the discussion and the view toward the turnaround is better than what we've seen in the last two years. And so there is optimism there, but I would just say I would be - I would say cautiously optimistic because it hasn't happened yet. And we've had this optimism a year ago, 1.5 years ago, and it hasn't come through.","And what I'd say, it's kind of twofold. One is there's absolutely this pent-up demand for maintenance and focus on reliability and making sure that things don't break. But there's also a little bit of prevailing trend that's saying, okay, we've now gone this long without spending this type of money on our maintenance program in maintaining these facilities, and they're not completely breaking. And so what we're trying to do is come in with a much more proactive approach. We're trying to provide technology into our solution and being more predictive about how we go forward. And so I guess, in aggregate, what I would say is that I'm optimistic about aftermarket and starting to see growth and more sustained growth in 2018. We do have more visibility to our turnarounds, particularly in Asia Pacific and North America, but I'd love to get some wins early in the year in Q1 and Q2 to get more confidence that operators truly are spending in this space.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Just a really quick one for Lee. How much is the swing in incentive comp from '17 to '18 so we can think about underlying incrementals there?","Lee Eckert","So Andy, it's a relevant number. But historically, correct me if I'm wrong, Jay, we've not given that number out as far as - but it's meaningful. But we have not been that prescriptive on it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets.","Robert Graham","I was hoping for some help on the gross margin here as well. Could you help us understand the project situation's impact on the gross margin? And then maybe by extension, we've heard the prior regime talk the word selectivity on bookings for years. And I understand that shipments out of the backlog are only a part of the equation for any one quarter. But so the gross margin, despite what they've said, continues to come down, suggesting that the pricing on the run rate business continues to come down. Could you kind of put that together for me, Scott, as well as maybe quantify the impact from the nick from the project?","Robert Rowe","Yes, let me - I'll start with kind of - I'm not going to go way back, but I'll talk about what we're doing about pricing and where we are in gross margins. I'll turn it over to Lee to kind of hit what's happening there. But I would just say right now, and really probably put this in earnest in Q3 of this year, is a much more robust kind of philosophy around trying to get the value that we deserve on these larger projects. And I'm really speaking about pump OE, right? So both industrial and on the engineered side. And so I feel pretty good. Certainly, in Q3, we did better. And then in Q4, I feel pretty good about our selectivity on the pricing and the ability to deliver the orders that we brought forward. And so that's going to help us as we go forward. And I think - and I'm going to let Lee go into details, but a part of the problem on the gross profit is the underabsorption and our inability to execute as well as we should. And that, quite frankly, these variances in the manufacturing side are really hurting our ability to drive higher profits. Lee, you want to touch more on maybe Q4...","Lee Eckert","Yes, so just to kind of talk about the margins going forward. So Scott and in my comments, we talked about the headwinds. So between paying our people 2.5% for merit and the AIP adjustments and inflation, that provides pretty significant headwind as most businesses. I think what's maybe somewhat unique to Flowserve's current situation, as Scott also alluded to, is the past due backlog. And so that's also a meaningful number. That's going to be sales that I was going to say is going to have low margins, which compress it. So that's going to come through. Our belief is that's going to come through the first half of the year. At the same time, we are implementing robust continuous improvement programs around supply chain, around our productivity for our facilities and also continuing the realignment programs. So unfortunately, some of that work is being muted by some of the headwinds. When you normalize for that, we are driving margin expansion. But right now, it's being a little bit masked by cleaning up what's currently in the plants.","Robert Graham","So the fact that the prior regime said, and I'm sorry to keep harking back to them, but that's a relevant set of statements from them regarding the backlog, right? So the prior regime kind of held to the fact that the gross margin in the backlog has essentially been flat for a while, but your comment on - just now, one of your comments suggest that, that's not the case.","Lee Eckert","What I'm saying - well, let me just clarify. The issue with the backlog is the past due backlog. So this is product that we are late on, and for a number of reasons. And the reality is in order to get that - we've had - as Scott has talked about earlier, the facilities are not running at efficiencies that many of us are used to. And so in order to get the product out to meet our customer requirements, it's coming at an incremental cost. We believe that the stuff that's currently - the new - I wouldn't say the new versus the old, but a lot of the new orders, should we have attractive margins associated, the issue we're having is we are late on product, and that product - our focus is to reduce the past due backlog. When that gets flushed out, it's going to be at low margins.","Robert Rowe","Again, I don't want to go back and talk about what the prior management said. But what I'd say is in this past due backlog, right, there's now - the margin has declined from the as-booked margin or the expected margin. So there's variances to what the original belief was. And it's just the definition of this work is hanging around our facilities longer and it's collecting costs, both people and material cost, that's now lower - bringing the margins down lower as we move it out of the system.","Robert Graham","That makes a ton of sense. Last question is this. Last quarter, you indicated that your expected pace from initially taking over on reducing SG&A needed to kind of slow to make sure you were cutting in the right places because the systems were not helping you ensure you were cutting in the right places. Could you kind of update us on where SG&A reduction progression stands today?","Robert Rowe","Yes. No. Yes. I appreciate you bringing us back to this topic. It's important. So we did some pretty healthy cuts in the end of - right in that Q3 time frame. In Q4, we paused to really focus on process and making sure that we weren't - we could cut more in 2018, but what we wanted to do was make sure that we're focused on the right things and that we could create long-term value and not completely break things as we look forward. And so we now have done - in my prepared remarks, we talked about this pretty significant assessment and this due diligence upon ourselves. And so now, what that's doing is starting to highlight this path forward to say, Okay, yes, we can start to achieve more savings. But to do that, we've got to put process in place. And so what I would expect is that as we transition through 2018, we start to get much better on our ability to leverage our cost structure in the second and third quarter of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Just to follow-up on some of the Flowserve 2.0 commentary. Is there a point, and when is it, when you think you'll be in a position to kind of lay out the midterm plan for where you think you can take this business?","Robert Rowe","Look, it's a great question. I thought you guys were going to ask this first today, honestly. We know we have to provide some more color about what the opportunity is, what the potential is and when we can get there. And really, I wish I could have come out early with the big price and put a number out there, and I would have loved to have done that. But for me, it's really about putting something out that I'm 100% confident that we can achieve. And quite frankly, where we are is we know the price is there. We know the buckets. [Indiscernible] six buckets earlier in terms of where our big opportunities are. And the issue is more around how fast can we do it. And so when I look at Flowserve and we go around the world and talk to people and look at our execution, what I'm concerned about is just our ability to drive these changes as quickly as we should.","And so right now, we're kind of sharpening our pencils saying these are the actions we need to take. These are the initiatives. Here's how we resource them. And are we going to break the organization by doing all of this at once? And how do we sequence it? And so we're pretty close to getting that all pulled together. And then what I need to do after that is come out publicly and start to talk about the prices. This - here's the progression of the price, and here's how we're thinking about it. So I'm not going to give you a date on when we're going to do that, but I know I have to do it, and I know the clock is ticking there. So give us a couple months.","Robert Barry","Got it, got it. That sounds reasonable. How big is the past due backlog?","Robert Rowe","Yes. We don't disclose exactly what it is, but what I would say is it's meaningful. It's probably twice as large as it should be. And we've got to get it - we've got to clear it out the system because it's causing a lot of problems. But we're not going to give a specific number on that.","Robert Barry","Got you. And just lastly on the seasonality of the earnings. Can you just remind us what is the typical level and maybe just a little bit more color on what it will be this year?","Lee Eckert","Yes, Jay, do you want to kind of go typical...","John Roueche","Yes, no. Typically, first quarter is high teens to 20% of what the full year expectation would be. Again, with - as we indicated earlier, with some past due backlog coming through in Q1, it'll probably be towards the lower end of our progression. And then second and third quarters, take time trying to be the second best quarter. And then as we saw this quarter, the fourth quarter always tends to be the strongest. I'm sure you've got the model, Rob, where you can look at the past few years and confirm how those shake out. But that's the trend, weak first quarter, strong fourth quarter.","Robert Barry","Yes. So I expect, what, 60% to 75% or 60% to 65% will be second half-loaded?","John Roueche","Yes, traditionally.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Scott, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about I guess how expected the past due backlog and difficulty getting that out of the door. You're now looking at having revenue growth in 2018. How comfortable are you allowing the company to actually grow under these circumstances to go after orders, to look to grow orders given that the operational challenges that you had - have. What is the risk there? Do you know stacking growth and stacking volume on top of this actually creates more problems?","Robert Rowe","Sure, Nathan. Thank you. It's a complex problem, and it's something we're looking at regularly. And unfortunately, recently, with some of the problems in Latin America that I alluded to, we've had to move orders out of that facility and into others. So I would say it's a complex problem. And the good news is we've got - we still, despite all of our realignment efforts, have a pretty robust network around the world, which does give us some flexibility to move things around. And so what I'd say is when we look at the 2018 growth numbers and kind of what we've said on revenue, I have no concern at all in our ability to meet that and potentially go up if the markets were to give us a little bit more. But I'd say we've got to get this - we've got to get our house in order, and we've got to do a much better job with our productivity at each and every one of our manufacturing locations to start to grow in earnest in 2019 and '20. But in '18, I have - I don't have any concerns, but it is something that we're actively managing. And again, unfortunately, we're moving orders around from plant to plant to make sure that we can truly execute and meet our customer demands.","Nathan Jones","And then my follow-up question's going to be on working capital and cash flow, which has been relatively poor at the company for several years here. You had a very good fourth quarter cash generation quarter, even much better than you do seasonally usually in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about anything that was maybe one-off that helped you there? Any kind of processes that you've put in place to help manage that? And Lee, if you've had a chance to identify what a target kind of working capital is percent of sales number would be over the longer term?","Robert Rowe","Yes, let me - I'll talk generally, and then I'll turn it over to Lee. But sure, we did have - we had a nice progression there in the fourth quarter. And I've shared this both in the meeting that we did in September and then a little bit on the third quarter call. Right now, it's been brute force, right? So it's just been heavy lifting and a lot of focus. I'd say as Lee came in, and just basically I said, Lee, we got to get this moving in the right direction. And so we set up a cadence on how do we just manually push the right levers here to drive working capital. And so right now, it's just been heavy, heavy effort and focus, and it generated very nice results in fourth quarter. We now need to transition to systems and process, particularly on the inventory side. But Lee, do you want to talk about just some of the nuances in working capital?","Lee Eckert","Yes. So Like Scott said, fourth quarter was management attention and brute force. So as we go into the year, we need to have a much better enterprise solution. So for - it's kind of area by area. So on the AR side, our DSO is far from where it needs to be, and it's going to take total authorization to have much more ownership around that. So we are looking at processes, ownership. With people talking about bonuses, and one of our bonus metrics is improving working capital. So everybody's invested in that result. We're looking at some of our policies to drive better behavior. So it comes down to insight, behavior, ownership and accountability.","On the inventory side, as Scott's talked about, having the facilities run much more efficiently. So that's an area through better planning, better execution, getting these past due backlogs out, all will drive better inventory turns. But again, as a business, we are far from where we need to be on inventory. And then on payables, we're currently looking at our supply chain and renegotiating all our terms to get back to where we think the market is on payment. So from a couple - we're probably very tactical. At the same point, as Scott mentioned, from our Flowserve 2.0 conversation, this is also a major area that we're looking for a transformational improvement. And it's clearly, we have made a large investment in our working capital, and so there's a lot of value that can be freed once we fix that.","Robert Rowe","Yes. And to continue the discussion, because it's such a big point. And just - Lee said, we're not near where we want to be, right? And I said that there - I've said it a couple times, there's a price of a couple hundred million dollars here, and we're not backing off of that. And when we think about 2018, we don't think we need to grow our working capital to deliver the business that we put forward in our guidance. And so we just have a lot of work to do, and part of our operational excellence organization that we've stood up includes a planning - central planning function, and we've put planning now at each of our platform levels. And so we've got a big attention on this. We're starting to put the right people that understand how to do this, and we're now putting the process in place to drive this down even further.","Nathan Jones","Have you had time to sufficiently look into this to be able to evaluate what the appropriate level of working capital for the business is?","Robert Rowe","No. I think we'll roll all that out when we talk about the Flowserve 2.0 price. But again, I've said it before, and I'm not - we won't change that. There's a couple hundred million dollars of opportunity here.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc.","Jeffrey Hammond","So you talked about some quality orders coming in. Can you just speak to how you're feeling about the margins on the orders that are coming into the backlog? And then just as you start to see this improvement and larger projects come through, what you think you're doing structurally to kind of ensure those margins hold up as we recover?","Robert Rowe","Sure. I'll repeat a little bit of what I said in the prepared remarks and in an earlier question. But we feel good about what we did in the fourth quarter in terms of quality of orders coming in, and that's both on price and the ability to execute or deliver those orders. So for me, it's really twofold, right? It's one, making sure that we get the price; and then two, making sure that we can execute them because that's what's hurting us today, is our ability to execute. And so what we saw in the fourth quarter was a nice inbound number in terms of orders. We did well across each of our platforms, and we believe that the quality of those orders in the fourth quarter is quite good. And so as we go forward, we don't expect to change that, right? In fact, we believe that we should only get better about our ability to execute.","Our [indiscernible] and fees are in a level that we're very comfortable with, and our pricing is at a level that we believe we can expand our margins. And so I feel pretty good about that, basically, where the market is and our ability to do this. Now obviously, we have a long way to go to restore pricing back to the 2013 and '14 levels, and we need to continue to walk that up as the market starts to get a little bit tighter than it is today. So I'd say overall, we feel good about that environment, and it is very much a focal point for us. And what we really have to just turn our focus to is as we get the larger projects in the door, we've got to make sure that [indiscernible] and not get the - have the variances that we saw in the fourth quarter down to Latin America or some of the issues that we faced in other divisions.","And so when we think about some of the things that we put in place, we talked about KPIs in process, in program management, is that we've also put in a very robust project tracking in terms of how we measure progress, how we measure our estimates execution and making sure that we're progressing these larger orders, how we should in getting them out the door at the margins that we booked them at.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. And just on it seems like you're still getting smaller projects coming in. Can you just speak to what your customers are saying or what visibility you're starting to see on the larger project front?","Robert Rowe","Yes. I'd say what's - the really good thing in the fourth quarter is that we didn't have many large projects. We had one that was 15, and we just had a whole bunch [indiscernible] that kind of $3 million to $5 million to $8 million bucket. And quite frankly, we can make more money on those and they can get out of our system faster. So ideally, that's the work that we want to fill our shops up. That's the base of the foundational level. And we're pretty excited about the quality of those orders again. On the bigger ones, the bigger they are, the more visibility there is. And quite frankly, it attracts more of our competitors. And it's quite hard to make the margins that we deserve, which is contrary to the complexity and the technology that we're bringing to that solution. So yes, we want to talk about big orders, but I would say more foundational and more important for us is getting this base level of work in that's got some nice calories to it.","Now with that, we are seeing in our pipeline, we're seeing more of the large orders in 2018 than we have even at the beginning of 2017. And so we've got a mix of projects. And I would say if we think about regionally, a lot of those are going to be Middle East and some in the - in North America. And when we think about what type of markets they are, we're seeing a lot in the refining space. We're seeing it increase in petrochemical, and then we've got some in the power side as well. And so we're seeing bigger work, new greenfield projects or large expansions now across each of our major served markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research.","John Walsh","So I just wanted to come back to the incremental margin question. And if I look at my model, and you guys have been growing sales historically, the gross margin's kind of been in the 35% to 36% range. Obviously, you've done restructuring. We all understand that 2018 has this incentive comp headwind. But when we think about going forward on a more normal basis, is 35% to 40% the right range, a little bit better than where that gross margin was historically? Or could it be something higher or lower than that? How do you kind of think about it relative to your gross margins when you're growing sales?","Lee Eckert","Yes. So this is Lee. I think what you'll see, and it's going to be a little - when it gets reported, it's probably a little different than what the underlying numbers are. What I mean by that is until we burn through this past due backlog, it's going to be depressed. Once we, I think, clear through that, I think - my view is 33% to 35% at this juncture is probably the right number. Obviously, I think going forward past '18, that number - we should continue to challenge that number and grow that number. But from a top-down standpoint, until we burn through - we'll have a bunch of revenue with very little profit on it, so it gets burned through. It's going to be more kind of in the 30% to 32% range versus the 32% to 35% range.","John Walsh","And the cost headwind is also something that we're dealing with this year.","Lee Eckert","Yes, Right. Good point. Right.","Robert Rowe","Yes. And just to add to it, and again, we owe you guys more color on what the future looks like for us. But what I'd say is when we go back to those six categories on where we're going to focus our efforts, supply chain and operations are two of the largest buckets in terms of prices. And so we know there's a large price when we centralize our supply chain and start to get - start to leverage the scale and get better costing on our inbound materials. And so that's one big bucket that we've got to attack that's going to help gross margins, and then the other one is the productivity within the manufacturing. And so that is - we're still having variances there. We have too many people. We've got a lot of things that are just taking too long and costing too much as we think about the manufacturing process. And so again, we'll articulate those buckets in what the price are and what we're doing about it at a future time. But there is significant potential on the gross margin side.","John Walsh","Got you. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, as we think about the portfolio and some of the things you're trying to do, is this cut - I don't want to use the word cut, but should we think about continued pruning portfolio actions going forward? And is that kind of part of a new normal?","Robert Rowe","Sure. I think - if we think about acquisitions and portfolio, we've got to do some things to make sure we've got the right products that are - provides some synergy or integration in terms of - with what we're trying to do in the future. And so with the valve side, we cut out two product lines that weren't core and didn't facilitate what we wanted to do in the long run. So we'll continue to do that, right? We've got - we're looking to move some other product lines out. We've got some opportunities to bring things in. At a general or a higher level, what I would say is right now, flow control is performing well, and I'm confident in that management team and what we're doing. And that's the one we're kind of greenlighting to bring in products or tuck-ins, both on the product development side and then potentially, the inorganic growth side. We've got to fix our ability to deliver new pumps, both in IPD and EPD, before we start to do anything on adding products to that portfolio.","Operator","And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Wolfe Research.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Scott, I think people have tried to ask this question may be a few different ways, but I know that you don't want to call out incentive comp and it's kind of a cost to doing business, so calling out that discreetly, I respect. But should we think that ex noise with restructuring savings coming and some you've already done, incentive comp probably some other puts and takes from 2017, discrete items that go away, what's the base incremental margin you think this business is at today? And how should we think about that on kind of a pure volume price cost basis?","Lee Eckert","So this is Lee. We'll try to take another attempt to this one. So again, I think after the noise, and there is a lot of noise, I think - my view is on an aggregate basis, I think 32% to 35% is where we're at right now. But that's - I would say that's a clean number. It goes back to - so we clean up what's currently in our back - the past due backlog, it's going to be muted. And like every business, we're not unique to the standpoint, is every year, you got to deal with inflation, you got to deal with merit, and you got offset that with productivity. And our goal is to obviously have more price, volume and productivity to offset the headwinds. But right now, we're still relatively in that inflection point.","Robert Rowe","Yes. And just to add, we just provided 2018 guidance. We feel that, that's very realistic guidance, and that's what we're prepared to deliver this year. We owe the investment community what the price is, and when we take these actions, what the potential is. And so we know we've got to do that. And I just said, give us a couple months and we'll come out with what that looks like.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","No. I think that's great. And that - the 32%, 35% is really helpful kind of as a clean starting point to calibrate off of. And then just as a follow-up on the - some of the questions on free cash flow and working capital management. I guess, I missed that, and maybe you said it. Is there a target for conversion in 2018?","Robert Rowe","We did not publicly put a conversion target out.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Safe to say that you guys are targeting something better than in recent years? It seems like working capital is starting to...","Robert Rowe","Yes. What I said before, it's a huge price, and we know there's opportunity there. We will continue to get better. There's no doubt about that. And just unfortunately, it's all been manual brute force and a lot of heavy lifting from an effort standpoint. And we've got to get a lot smarter about how we attack that. And so we just - as we transition into '18, it's going to be focused on process, systems, tools. We're going to keep that cadence of brute force because that's the way we're managing it, and we'll start to see more improvements in the back half of '18 on our working capital.","Lee Eckert","Yes. So we're looking at velocity, how quickly are these assets turning. And so for our sales pick up, obviously, there's typically a working capital element to that as sales go up. But we are looking towards to increase the velocity and reduce the investment on working capital.","Robert Rowe","Yes. And then just to add, again, we've got these six buckets that we disclosed. Working capital is one of the buckets in that the really big focus for us is inventory. We've got a lot of inventory. We've got to figure out what it is, what we're doing with it and then how do we have a much better and robust planning process, both in our facilities and at the platform level. And that's really what we're driving toward in the first quarter of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen.","Joseph Giordano","So I think, obviously, a big part of the story here going forward I think has to be that EPD does not devolve into like a problem that in itself needs to be fixed. So Scott, to your point earlier about we feel good about what we're doing, but there's always been like a thing that pops up. And we've had write-downs in Latin America. We got a project this quarter that went south. So how do we - what gives you confidence that, that is not something that keeps happening every quarter in that business?","Robert Rowe","Sure. No, it is a real issue, and it's what I'm most concerned about of - what I'd just point to is that we've got a lot of focus and attention on that OE and our ability to deliver work. And the big thing that we did in the beginning of 2018 was this reorganization. And so we've now put an operational manager at each of the platforms to drive consistency across that platform. So EPD now has a Vice President of Operations that is focused on project delivery and execution. And then we also raised the P&L up to a much higher level. And so I've talked about before closer of having kind of 300 general managers and P&L and a lot of complexity. And so for EPD specifically, where we're putting the emphasis in [indiscernible] is on three bigger P&Ls that are regional-based. But what it does is it allows - and I'll just use Americas, for example, what it does is allow that Americas General Manager to provide the right stewardship and consistency across that network of operations.","And so those two things, in addition to our project reviews and project trackings in our operational KPI, give us confidence that we move forward. But again, every quarter, I've been surprised by something either on the new equipment with IPD or EPD, and we've got to get that out of our system. And so those are the things that we're doing to get that out. And I'm getting more confident. But again, we're not where we need to be on our ability to execute orders at this point.","Joseph Giordano","And then last for me. The CapEx is going to go up next year off of like a pretty low number. Are you guys - what gives you the confidence that you're spending enough to stay ahead of like the R&D curve? And it's a tough balance when you're cutting and trying to get things in order, but in a very competitive market where small incremental benefits on the tech might win the day. So how do you kind of weigh those decisions and where do you stand...","Robert Rowe","Yes. It's a good question. We didn't disclose our R&D and where we're at. But let me just start on kind of the '17 CapEx. And so on the '17 CapEx, we basically just stopped spending, right? So when I came in, I wasn't really happy on where we're spending or how we're spending money in the process of our capital improvement. And so we clamped down pretty hard, and that's how we got to this pretty low number in 2017. As we transition to '18, we want to be able to basically keep that maintenance capital in place, and so we've kind of built that foundation of what we think is needed to maintain the level of our business and enterprises. And now, where we're spending - where we moved the capital up in 2018 has been - is all about productivity.","So we're doing it with our enterprise-wide IT solutions. And so we're launching enterprise-wide now systems of that are going to start to drive a much more uniform approach and standardization across all of Flowserve. In addition to that, the R&D number does come up. And so a little bit of that improvement in capital has some of the things that we're building from an R&D perspective. The rest of R&D is in expense, and we move - we actually pushed up our year-over-year spending on the expense side with R&D. And so I've talked about this in the original tenets of Flowserve technology or in Flowserve 2.0, but that was the creation of our marketing and technology function. And so we've got a strong leader there, we're spending more money and we've got a much better process of linking where we're spending product development and research money, and combining that with the market outlook and what our customers need. And so I feel really good about our ability to drive forward on technology. So it was a key tenet of the first Flowserve 2.0 discussion. We're not backing down from that. And we're actually spending more money in '18 versus '17.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global.","Walter Liptak","Just to be clear on the Flowserve 2.0, the KPIs, those have been rolled out to the employees now? And are those going to be tied to incentive compensation at like the local level for 2018?","Robert Rowe","Yes. So what we did - the difference in the incentive plan from '17 to '18 is we made it much more at the business unit and the local level, and we're adding operational performance to the mix. And so while it's super important to have the top line overall operating income and some of the other metrics, we're now pushing down working capital, on-time delivery and revenue and operational income to the local facilities and what they control. So I think that's going to get us aligned in terms of an incentive standpoint, and it follows kind of the KPIs and how we're starting to run the business. And so we made that change for 2018, and it's in place now.","Lee Eckert","One thing I'd highlight, Scott, we've also simplified the process. Before the - I would say the AIP program was extremely complicated. I'm not sure the deliverables align with investors' interest. And we've completely simplified it to focus on what I think is important to you all, earnings, cash and growth. And so it was a major change of what was done in the past, and I think it's going to correlate more with your interest.","Walter Liptak","All right. That sounds good. Money can be a good motivator.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.","Jay Roueche","Thank you, Operator, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you participating in Flowserve's 2016 third quarter earnings call. Joining me this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Karyn Ovelmen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up to your questions. And as a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available.

We encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's earnings materials, as well as our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are all available on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Mark Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. First, on the positive side, we are pleased to achieve a book-to-bill greater than one for the first time in over a year. This is a particularly positive development, given that our customers continue training cautious and deliberate with their budgets and spending patterns. As a result of these bookings, our backlog grew modestly and higher-margin aftermarket bookings now represent over 30% of our work under contract for the first time. We are also seeing some early signs of pre-feed and feed opportunities building in the pipeline.","We are particularly pleased with the bookings' resiliency and performance of our aftermarket franchise throughout 2016, producing modest constant currency bookings growth for the year. We continue to make significant progress on our ongoing realignment program, which will drive cost out of our platform and position Flowserve to enhance profitability as a leaner and more efficient Company. Finally, while our third-quarter earnings were lower than expected, the Company continues to be well-positioned and we are actively pursuing opportunities for further improvement as we execute on our cost reduction initiatives and long-term strategic growth opportunities.","With regard to market and Company-specific challenges this quarter, we continue to experience challenging global macro conditions. And, as I noted earlier, our customers have remained cautious and deliberate in their investment decisions. Reflecting this environment, project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals, and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance have become the norm. We were particularly surprised in September with the slow pace of industrial short cycle and aftermarket revenues, but the good news is these orders remain largely in backlog and we expect to deliver on them in future periods. There's also additional political uncertainty in many regions around the world, including the United States.","We continue to see some operational and cost issues in our receiving sites as we shift manufacturing and implement our structural realignment program. However, we are actively addressing these issues. While we are pleased with the progress in our aftermarket bookings, the lower backlog associated with our OE facilities will increase under absorption in the short run, which occurs faster than we can realign or take costs out. As we execute and complete our realignment plans, our new cost structure should catch up to the current workload and alleviate this timing issue and position Flowserve when the cycle improves.","Finally, we incurred some significant non-cash reserves during the quarter related to Latin America. As we have previously discussed, this region has been, and remains, challenged. While we have collected about $5.5 million year to date and will continue to actively pursue collections on these accounts, which are not dispute, we believe that fully reserving for certain receivables balances and work in process is the most prudent course of action.","On an adjusted basis, EPS this quarter was $0.52. While we indicated on our last call that we expected this quarter to be light due to the timing of shipments, given the magnitude of this impact, along with the continuation of challenging market conditions, we are revising our full-year guidance. Karen will cover our financials in more detail, but operationally we will continue to focus on a disciplined approach, cost management and improving our efficiency across the business and addressing all of these with a sense of urgency.","Despite the challenges this quarter, it is important to note that we have successfully navigated previous cycles and are actively leveraging this experience as we manage our business through the current market environment. Further, I am confident that our current strategic direction and ongoing cost reduction initiatives will position Flowserve competitively for the eventual recovery in our energy end markets.","Our primary near-term challenge remains transforming our manufacturing platform quickly enough to reduce under absorption, while enhancing our operational flexibility to meet customer expectations of better value for their investment dollar. This situation particularly impacts EPD and IPD in the near-term, as pump OE backlog continued to decline during the period. With the recent operating issues and financial performance in our IPD segment, I have asked Tom Pajonas to assume interim leadership of the segment's day-to-day operations. Tom was instrumental in turning FCD into the stronger performer it is today and I am confident he will drive the necessary actions and accountabilities to improve the business.","Key initiatives include accelerating the pace and execution of the realignment program and embedding sustainable process improvements to drive differentiated value for our customers, such as reduced lead times, automated order process through e-commerce, enhanced supply chain management and improving on-time deliveries. Ultimately, we are driving towards an operating platform and culture in IPD similar to that of our FCD segment. I have complete confidence Tom will improve IPD's performance with time.","Next, I'd like to update you on the significant progress we're making as we execute our realignment program. Though we continue to have some operational issues in some of our receiving sites, we are continuing to focus on the structural transformation of our business platform. During the third quarter, we initiated actions to close two additional manufacturing facilities, including an Australian IPD facility which will be consolidated into another Flowserve site in that country and we are transferring EPD's Lawrence operations based in Massachusetts to other US and Latin American facilities.","During the fourth quarter, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites, including recently announced initiatives to close a German manufacturing facility and the consolidation of Middle East QRCs. We continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. From a savings perspective, we delivered approximately $37 million in the third quarter, $80 million year to date, and importantly, we remain on track to deliver $100 million of incremental savings for the full year of 2016.","While we identify most realignment costs incurred for your analysis, I'll remind you that our reported and adjusted numbers do not include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We are improving our manufacturing transitions with dedicated resources and teams to minimize bottlenecks and implement processes to apply lessons learned from completed actions as we continue to execute on our realignment program.","Turning to our markets and bookings within our served industries, overall we believe the relative stability of oil around the $45 to $50 range over the past six months has been a positive development for many of our customers. Nevertheless, we still anticipate that our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multi-year nature of infrastructure original equipment investment, it will likely require several quarters of this level of stability before investment spending actively resumes and we expect the opportunities that arise will be competitive.","Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 7%, primarily due to an OE bookings decline of approximately 11%. As expected, aftermarket bookings continue to demonstrate resiliency, but did decline approximately 2% this quarter. While aftermarket bookings have increased constant currency year to date, third-quarter aftermarket sales saw a sharp drop-off sequentially during the quarter. We believe this is just a timing issue, as it is rare for aftermarket orders to cancel and was mainly because our first-half 2016 bookings included a few upgrade projects that will not ship until 2017. Additionally, some customers have been slow to accept shipments, but we do continue to see elevated levels of emergency response aftermarket opportunities. While pricing pressure has been a significant issue on larger CapEx driven greenfield and brownfield projects, we are pleased that we've maintained fairly consistent pricing levels in our aftermarket bookings.","Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis coming off a low base. Bookings in our largest served market, oil and gas, increased 10% in the quarter. European orders and an ebulliator job for Asia were key drivers of this growth. While we are pleased with this improved level of bookings, we are certainly not calling a bottom yet. However, we do view our downstream and midstream focus as a long-term asset for the Company. Power bookings decreased approximately 21% on a tough prior-year compare. Going forward, we expect steady combined cycle investment in North America and fossil projects in Asia, which tend to be very competitive.","China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. The distribution channel remained depressed in the quarter. While we continue to believe destocking across many of our distributors is largely complete, distributors overall are maintaining lower inventory levels, placing smaller orders, often only when they have a customer order in hand, so a quick response time will be a priority for us.","Chemical bookings were down 18% in the quarter, with low levels of new project releases. We continue to see delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants, as well as the second wave of crackers, but we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East, supported by low cost feedstock.","To summarize the quarter, we remain focused on rapidly transforming our cost structure for these uncertain markets, while positioning Flowserve for enhanced growth and profitability. We've seen cycles before and fully expect our markets will recover. Importantly, we are confident that our investments to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global operating platform will lead us through current challenges and enhance the value that Flowserve can deliver to our customers and shareholders.","Finishing up on a personal note, as most of you know about, a month ago we announced my intention to retire from the Company at the end of March 2017. After over a decade at Flowserve and as the Company begins its next phase of growth and development, now is the right time for the Company and me to begin this transition process. I am confident that Flowserve has the right strategic plans and the right team in place to achieve our objectives. Flowserve is a great Company, with a solid operating and financial foundation and is on the right path forward. Importantly, until the Board names my successor, it remains business as usual and I remain fully committed to the success of the Company, our employees and shareholders. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Karen.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 third-quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America, our realignment initiatives and our performance of the OE business, which I will detail. Third-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 excludes $0.47 of non-cash charges related to the Latin American activity, including a $63.2 million charge to reserves certain undisputed accounts receivable, which we will continue to pursue and a $15.9 million charge to reserve for inventory exposures in the region. Additionally, adjustments include $0.21 per share of realignment expense, $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price adjustments and integration charges and a gain of $0.01 on below-the-line FX. ","Reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.16, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.02 in both reported and adjusted EPS.","Q3 revenues of $943 million decreased 14%, or 12.1% constant currency. Year to date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 8.2% compared to 2015 levels. Regionally and a constant currency basis, North America was roughly flat, while the Middle East and Africa, Europe and Asia PAC were down low- to mid-teens. Latin America remains our most challenging region, with a decline of nearly 39%.","Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 10% in the third quarter but remained elevated as a percent of sales, due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing of expected realignment savings from our ongoing realignment program and our paced approach to SIHI cost reduction. Additionally, we have continued to invest in aftermarket and distribution initiatives as we focus on long-term growth in the business.","Turning to margins, third-quarter adjusted gross margins decreased 350 basis points to 32.4% versus prior year and excluded $15.9 million of non-cash charges related to our Latin American activity and realignment charges of $24.5 million. Reported gross margins were 28.1%, negatively impacted by increased under absorption on our volumes, the adjusted items and further challenged by shipments that reflected the pricing environment booked over the last year and a half. ","Adjusted operating margin of 11.7% excludes non-cash Latin American charges, $79.1 million, $31.5 million of realignment and $2.6 million of SIHI charges, partially offset by realignment savings and lower compensation expense. Both gross and adjusted margins benefit in the quarter due to lower variable incentive compensations in the 2016 quarter as compared to a year ago. In total, we had over 100 basis point operating margin tailwind year over year during the third quarter as a result of this line item. On a year-to-date basis, however, variable incentive comp is, and is currently expected to remain, a slight headwind to our results. ","Our third-quarter adjusted tax rate of 29.3% was slightly below our full-year guidance rate of 30% to 31%, due primarily to the jurisdictions where earnings occurred.","Turning to our bookings, constant currency original equipment bookings declined 11.4%, while our aftermarket franchise remained relatively stable, down 2.1% over the prior year, but still showed modest growth year to date. From a regional perspective, Europe and Latin America constant currency bookings increased 7.9% and 7%, respectively. North America was down 6.4% while Asia-Pacific and the Middle East and Africa were down in the mid-teens.","Shifting to our realignment program, we realized approximately $37 million of savings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $80 million. With our continued progress this quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. We expensed $37 million in the third quarter related to these efforts, bringing the first nine months 2016 total expense to approximately $70 million and we continue to expect total program savings of $230 million at a total program cost of $400 million. We further expect total 2016 cost of $160 million.","We continue to strive for efficiency in our investments and as we progress our efforts, we will continue to assess individual projects within the program to adjust or replace initiatives within the framework to which we have been externally guiding. We continue to estimate total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million.","Turning to cash flow, through September 30, 2016, operating cash flow is down about $73 million versus a year ago, primarily due to decreased earnings, partially offset by working capital improvement. In the third quarter we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends while our realignment program used approximately $30 million of cash. As many of you know, the fourth quarter typically accounts for a substantial portion of the year's operating cash flow and we expect this seasonal trend to occur again in 2016.","Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year, based on our first nine months 2016 results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we have updated our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.05 per share to $2.25 per share. Unexpected revenue declines of 11% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind, or roughly $0.10 per share, of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low to mid $16 million, a tax rate of 30% to 31% and reduced variable compensation expense.","As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses. In addition, the Latin American non-cash charges recorded in the third quarter, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of other potential discrete items, are also excluded.","Moving on to cash uses for the year, we continue to expect full-year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $115 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. We have $15 million in scheduled debt payments in the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year debt reduction total to $60 million. We contributed $20 million to our fully funded US pension plan through the first nine months of the year and we anticipate no further contributions in the fourth quarter. ","With that overview, let me turn the call back to Jay.","Jay Roueche","Thanks, Karen. Operator, we have concluded our prepared remarks and would now like to begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.","Charlie Brady","Thanks, good morning. A couple questions really on the realignment program. First, you talked about accelerating some of the efforts that are going on there and I guess my question really is, there's currently some inefficiencies going on with the realignment and moving factories from one place to another. Does accelerating this program in your mind increase in operational risk, or what are you doing to mitigate that? And I guess my second question related to that would be, you talked about the absorption, the realignment savings not really overtaking the absorption right now. Is there a time you can provide us when you think, kind of ballpark, when you think that switch over might happen when you kind -- I know it depends on the volumes, obviously, as you go into 2017, but maybe some idea in your mind of when you kind of get that crossover threshold to where you're making up for the absorption on the lower volumes","Mark Blinn","Let me start with the latter one. A lot of the absorption issues are going to be in our large custom engineered facilities and those are also the ones that take time to effect the realignment primarily, Charlie, because you have backlog that you need to work off. You need to carefully transfer those product because they're very highly engineered. There's a whole skillset that needs to move, a lot of capabilities. So we anticipate a lot of those benefits from the custom engineer to come through next year and this was anticipated at all times as we worked off the backlog. So we expect that efficiency to start or to work its way through in 2017 and that will help offset because a lot of the backlog decrease that you're seeing is in these large projects. So it works somewhat in parallel as we work off that backlog and that's primarily what you've seen in our bookings decline. Those costs start coming out of the business.","To your first question, I think the general comments were, you always plan for some inefficiencies when you're moving product. It\u2019s not like moving simple-widget manufacturing. There's a lot of know-how. There's product movement. There's a lot of planning that goes into it, so there is going to be some slippage. It is not insignificant, but you plan for it. In fairness, and I think we've been very upfront, in the IPD segment, we've seen more than we anticipated and in what that does is that impacts a couple of things. It will impact results. It will also impact bookings as well, because if a plant isn't operating efficiently, you can't book into it. In my comments earlier, that's why I said Tom has taken over. Your question is, what\u2019s the answer? And it's proven in the past it's Tom. He's assumed the responsibility for that and getting these things resolved and I'm confident that he well. But clearly, in general realignment is going as planned, but we\u2019ve seen some impact beyond what we anticipated, not insignificant, in the IPD segment and we will fix it.","Q \u2013 Charlie Brady \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","Good morning, all. Mark, first of all let me congratulate you openly on your retirement. On your watch this has become a much better Company. While that's not reading through now, I have no doubt that will when the end markets improve. I only wish you\u2019re exiting at a time when the operating environment was better, so congratulations.","Mark Blinn","Thank you, Scott. I appreciate it.","Scott Graham","I have two question for you guys. The first one is about pricing and particularly given your comment, Mark, that even when things do get better, you expect some pretty competitive bidding out there, pricing is obviously down on a year-over-year basis. Would you expect it to continue to be down, maybe though by a lesser amount in 2017?","Mark Blinn","Well, let me separate this a little bit. On the big projects, until backlogs start to get full, I think you are going to see pricing pressure. Just remember in 2013 and 2014, factories weren't full in our industry, so you didn't have the kind of, near the 2007, 2008 time of pricing of environment that you had at that point in time. But if you look at these custom engineered facilities, our industry is taking capacity out. So what you'll see is that capacity that is remaining will become taxed quicker, but you need to start to see the pickup in the custom engineered and the large projects. As I talked about before, and in my comments, you see some early feed work that's being done, but as we commented before, we don't anticipate that that would come into our industry's bookings until the end of next year or 2018.","Now, when you look at the other parts of our business, and this is why we talk about a lot e-commerce on-time delivering, a lot of pricing there is about being able to respond to the customer, because these aren't large, highly competitively bid type projects. This is about getting the product that the customer needs to him as quickly as they can and making it easy to do business with them. And so that's -- we see that as an opportunity. For example, I talked earlier about IPD. If we can respond and respond quicker, you can get price. You can not only get price, but you can get volume, so that represents an opportunity for us.","And then in the aftermarket business, I think we commented, everybody's looking at their OpEx budgets. In this oil and gas, we're in the ninth quarter, so folks have gotten fairly focused on their OpEx budgets and continue to do that. But again, a lot of that is about being able to respond very, very quickly. So we've been pleased to see somewhat that there's been stability or reasonable fair stability in the pricing in the aftermarket business. So the way I'd look at it is, the projects, I think they are going to remain competitive until you start seeing some more robust bidding activity. Keep in mind that the industry capacity will be less than it was in 2014. And as to the other ones, I think a lot of the pricing is in our hands.","Scott Graham","That's a great answer, Mark. Thank you. The follow-up question is a simple. It's fourth quarter. The guidance assumes a lesser decline in operating margin than in the third quarter. My guess is that that's largely based on the ease of the comparison or is there something else that you would point to?","Mark Blinn","I think it\u2019s going to be volume. If you know, historically Q4 is our strongest quarter, so we get fix-cost leverage. I'm very pleased. If you look at our adjusted SG&A, we were below $200 million and we haven't seen levels of that in a number of years and a lot of that is some of the realignment, but I also I think just the cost containment efforts that we've pushed through our business. So a lot of that is going to be volume with fixed cost leverage and it permeates through the entire P&L, because of absorption issues and things alike. That's why.","Scott Graham","I got you. I did have one other question there and I forgot. I'm sorry.","Mark Blinn","Okay. We can follow up if you need it.","Scott Graham","That's fine. No problem. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys. Mark, can you give us a little more color into your aftermarket sales in the quarter? If I look at aftermarket bookings, they stayed in the range of $450 million to $500 million, at least in the last couple years, but you mentioned that sales were low, took a step down. You talked about short cycle industrial weakening in September. How should we think about your aftermarket business moving forward? Can you quantify how much in sales were the delayed aftermarket shipments that won't ship until 2017? You see the aftermarket more stable. The bookings were flat. Are you concerned that the weaker sales number could continue for a while?","Mark Blinn","Well, there is a difference between the bookings and sales in the quarter. I think you've seen this in our industry, that there was a slowdown and for many unexpected, because you saw all the adjustments that occurred. But this is one of the lower aftermarket sales we've seen in a while. I wouldn't call it systemic at this point in time because in my comments you heard that we haven't seen large cancellations. I think there was just, it was a slow pace. If you look at the third quarter in our industry, there's a lot of vacation time in July and August and there needs to be a notable ramp up in September and we didn't see it. Now, we're certainly considering that in the guidance for the rest of the year, but we haven't fundamentally seen a structural change in our industry where people have no interest in taking any aftermarkets. Remember where those things go. So I think the bookings pace is still something to keep in mind, but in fairness we\u2019ll tell you, our aftermarket sales were low in the quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Is October active like September or is it too early to tell?","Mark Blinn","It's too early to tell and even Q4, and again this is why we were cautious in our guidance, Q4, December is an important month as well. But Andrew, if you look at things with the election and all the things that are going on around the world, you can see why the world kind of took a pause in the third quarter, but we'll see how it comes out in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. Okay. Mark, there's obviously a ton of moving pieces in your earnings, but maybe you can frame how to think about 2017 at this point. I know you don't want to give guidance or your backlog. It's been relatively stable now for about a year. It is down still significantly year over year. And aftermarket we just talked about. You should have increasing savings from your realignment plan. Hopefully IPD is going to start getting its act together. So can you talk about your conviction at this point that 2016 was the bottom?","Mark Blinn","That's a good way to think of it. You are right. We are three months away from giving our guidance, so I certainly don't want to do now because we are working our plans as we speak. But I think as you look forward, I mean clearly our lowest contribution margin business is the one that is seeing the bookings decline and that's our custom engineered. While that is coming down, that is where we are addressing the realignment and if you think about our business, that doesn't -- that industry has absorption issues, but not necessarily the biggest contribution margin, but it is certainly being impacted. In that you're also see the mix of aftermarket run rate become a higher mix. Aftermarket backlog represented 30%-plus for the first time really ever in our business.","Also as you look forward, I mean you talked about the IPD, getting to work on that. There is good opportunity there. Just look at its historical performance. SIHI's a good business and Tom's on the matter in terms of the opportunity going forward, the benefit of the realignment. And then on the flipside is companies deal with inflation and as we talked about before, around the variable comp, but that's aligned with our shareholders. I think those are all high-level factors to think about when you look at our business and then ultimately what happens to the market.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good. Thanks, Mark. Congratulations on your retirement.","Mark Blinn","Thank you very much, Andrew. I appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mark, I'd like to start on that, the observation about rolling MRO deferrals. And we've heard this from a number of your competitors, so it's not a Flowserve, issue. It's a sector issue. We understand that. But your perspective on how much the MROs can be deferred. Some cases you run into plant safety issues so forth, but is this -- what you expect the duration for at least this (indiscernible).","Mark Blinn","Generally our sense is this MRO role is in a kind of steady cadence and from this point, if there's more confidence around the OpEx, it will start to abate some, but I think you're right, Deane. It does become a safety issue. There are planning issues around takedown. Keep in mind, a lot of these plants have to be taken down on specific repair schedules because if they don't, you definitely run risk. As I mentioned earlier, being two years into this, I think a lot of that deferral is kind of on a steady cadence. We haven't seen a pickup in it. We have, in terms of that abating, we have seen some emergency opportunities come up which customers don't necessarily like to have. But I think we're on a steady pace and I think what will happen over time is it will abate. It will not abate all in one quarter, because they just can't pick up their maintenance and service schedules that quickly. I think it will steady -- it will abate steady to a more normal pace in terms of MRO planned takes down in facilities, upgrades, repairs, all those things.","Deane Dray","Sure, that's helpful. And then how about go back to the fourth-quarter guidance if we could. That's an awfully wide range. We understand that kind of uncertainty that you're dealing with right now, but it would be helpful if you give us a sense of what would be the key assumptions that would put you at the low end and then also at the high end of the range","Mark Blinn","Well, I mean, we take into consideration if you look at what you heard from our industry, how the quarter and particularly September impacted them and how that impacts into seasonality. If you look at our fourth quarter, typically our fourth quarter is our strongest quarter in our industry and for our Company. And so just looking at the potential variability of outcomes, that's how we drove our guidance. If there's normalcy, then that impacts our guidance in one way. If we see any kind of reservation concern drop off, that's where we took it to the bottom end. If you look historically, we've had a range roughly here and we typically narrow it when we provide guidance in January.","Deane Dray","Exactly. So we should expect that that, you'll have more precision then?","Mark Blinn","We typically do. Again, that's three months away so I don't want to get ahead of that, but that's typically what we've done in the past, Deane.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Please go ahead.","Mike Halloran","Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the retirement, Mark.","Mark Blinn","Thanks, Mike.","Mike Halloran","So first on the backlog and then thoughts into next year, is there any reason to think that backlog wouldn't kind of have its normal bleed in the fourth quarter? In other words, does guidance assume that you have a normal backlog bleed off or dump in the quarter? And then if that's the case, as you go into next year, then short cycle aftermarket is probably going to be the key. Some thoughts on where you'd see it first, what customers are telling you and what it would take for that to turn around?","Mark Blinn","Yes, so Mike, you are right. Typically we have a book-to-bill less than one in Q4 and a lot of that is around the seasonality of our business. I mean, obviously it's going to depend on our Q4 bookings. That's one of the components of the book-to-bill. But it's fair to say, you're right in what you've talked about. Where we've seen the primary bookings decline are in the larger projects. That also correlates to where we're taking a lot of our aggressive realignment actions to address that. So as we look into next year, it is going to be more the short cycle in the aftermarket. The things that, as I look into next year that are going to impact that is obviously the work Tom is going to do in the IPD business, because I'll remind you, bookings in that business have not been insignificantly impacted by some of the challenges that it's had this year, particularly the over last two quarters.","And then getting back to the earlier comment about where we are in terms of maintenance cycles, that will impact the aftermarket business. Where companies are on the OpEx budgets to do some small upgrades and efficiency repairs, which are sorely needed out in the industry right now. So if you think about our business, there are levers certainly we can pull, both from what I'd say a commercial sales standpoint around e-commerce, making it easier to order our products, which customers want to do and they want to do quickly and they have -- we have fairly good pricing power, to the operational improvements, how the market responds in terms of their OpEx budget, but we're -- the one thing with time and being in a down cycle is that brings you one day closer to when you start to move out of it. We're pretty far into this. ","If you think about our industry had a relatively strong cycle on and off, but for the most part on, for about a 10-year period. We've been in a two-plus year downturn in the industry. That's quite a while and while that's not great from a retrospective standpoint, if you look forward, it does bring us closer to when this will start to abate and we'll move out of it. I think one thing I'll remind you, we\u2019ve taken a conservative approach on our future in terms of our actions. We don't think pricing is going to come back to 2007, 2008 levels. If it does, we\u2019ll be all the better off for it.","Mike Halloran","And then for just puts and takes on the margins into next year, you've already at least loosely talked about pricing. Obviously a lot of confidence in the interval initiatives and then volume leverage that you leveraged depending how that pans out. Any other puts and takes we should be thinking about, changes in incentive comp going to next year, pension, things like that?","Mark Blinn","No, not any large item. On the incentive or the variable comp, it's that. It's how do we deliver to our shareholders and what commitments do we make. It's other cost containment. If we look at issues around inflation in the business, all the things that I've talked about, we do and always have been reacting to that to look for ways to drive efficiency in our business. I think the items at a macro level to think about are, how can we respond to a declining project environment before it starts to pick up with our realignment efforts? How can we drive our realignment efforts that are on the table in the other areas as well? Improvement in our business, particularly in the IPD business. ","Continue to look for efficiency and then just dealing with inflation that all companies deal with and the variable comp, how we set it. Probably a good high-level way of thinking of it and then starting to realize, really -- oh, I think there's one other element is in our CE business. That\u2019s still have an impact on our SG&A and as I commented earlier, adjusted we're below $200 million. We will get that out next year. It's a good business and we're learning a lot from it.","Mike Halloran","Great, thanks, Mark. Good luck.","Mark Blinn","You're welcome, Mike. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question come from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys, good morning. Actually just wanted to start with a follow up on an earlier question. You had referenced some elevated levels of emergency repair activity. How widespread is that and has that been accelerating?","Mark Blinn","Not really. I think it's just what happens when you stretch it out too long. These operators are savvy and they know their plants very, very well. Typically they will not manage those to the point where they created a state of disrepair, but it does happen. So it's more isolated, you see that, but in general, when you see rolling deferrals, that does tend to increase those because they're not perfect at pushing it right to the limit.","Robert Barry","Sure. Could you just give us a little bit more scope on these operational challenges? How many facilities are being impacted? You have a rough sense of what it costs you in orders in the quarter?","Mark Blinn","I do, but it's probably not worth going out and talking about those. The fact is it\u2019s not insignificant, particularly in IPD. Two of our larger plants, our horses were impacted. These things happen. I wish we could all say no, these things never happen here. They do. Question is, we acknowledge it and we\u2019ve got a plan to deal with it. Just look at IPD's results versus historical and you can draw your own conclusions as to what the opportunity is there, but it is not insignificant.","Robert Barry","And then maybe just lastly on this variable comp headwind, it sounds like it's going to be slight this year but in a typical year, what's the rough order of magnitude that you'd see in the P&L from resetting the variable comp?","Mark Blinn","It depends on how we perform relative to shareholder expectations. The reason, actually for this year, variable comp is a headwind relative to last year, but as you look out, it's all driven by our commitments to our shareholders. That's why we call it variable. We oftentimes work on cost containment and efficiencies to offset a lot of that, but if you think looking forward, it's a lot in terms of how we set our plans and a lot of that is aligned to how we're going to deliver to our shareholders. That's just the way business is overall. It's not a fixed cost in our business.","Robert Barry","Right. Assuming were not planning for a dramatic rebound next year but we're just kind of executing the restructuring, is this a like a 10, 20 basis point headwind or is it like a point of headwind? Just rough order of magnitude.","Mark Blinn","Robert, we\u2019ve got to set our plans. I think a lot of it is around the guidance that you see. The reason it's been not what we anticipated at the beginning of the year is part and parcel to the fact that you saw we dropped our guidance. So that is an indication to you that we created a favorability relative to our initial expectations, because we made a commitment to our shareholders and have come up short of that. I think that's the best way to think of it. It\u2019s really going to be what you see is in the guidance next year. But keep in mind, we've been dealing with this for many, many years. So inflation and everything like that is embedded in all businesses and the fact that we've been able to sustain margins and do the things we do, means we have a long history of dealing with these issues, delivering to our shareholders and addressing it. But a lot of it's going to be how we set our plans and our guidance next year. That's three months away. Thanks, Robert.","Robert Barry","Thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congratulations, Mark.","Mark Blinn","Thanks, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Maybe starting on the retirement, Mark. Just curious, can you talk a little bit about the process you guys have in place for both internal and external candidates? I'm also really curious as you think about the 2017 plan, at this point, who's going to own it?","Mark Blinn","We all own it. I mean, I think this is important and one thing to remember, Joe, while I appreciate the compliments on the call, this Company is a lot bigger than any one individual, and specifically me. So we\u2019ve got a leadership team that is well intact one and two levels down that is driving the process. So I don't go in my back office and come up with a plan for next year and deliver it to everybody. It is a very thorough bottom-up process that everybody owns. And so it's owned by the Company. To our comments earlier, our variable comp is very, very broad based. ","To your former question around the process, worked very close with the Board. I have a lot of confidence in the process. It is going to be very detailed, very comprehensive, very thoughtful in terms of what I've seen and I think what's important is that I'm really confident with how they are approaching this thing and how they'll get this thing accomplished. I'm here to support for as long as they need. So you should think about it in terms of very orderly, very thoughtful, very communicative, very, very comprehensive, certainly with a long-term view. My assessment of it is, I'll tell you, I have a lot of confidence in it, a lot of confidence in them and the process.","Joe Ritchie","That's helpful. Mark. Maybe switching gears a little bit and talking about IPD for a second, so clearly it sounds like the restructuring is impacting orders and sales today. I guess the first question is, at what point does is stop? Is there -- you guys have a timeframe in mind with Tom coming on board and now running that business where you feel good, you're going to a level environment where that's no longer occurring? And then the follow-on to that is really, you think that there is going to be maybe additional pricing pressure to try to re-acquire some orders, or how are you guys thinking about that?","Mark Blinn","On the first one, if you ask Tom, he wants it done yesterday, but in fairness it's going to probably take about two quarters to get these things up and running. On pricing pressure, no, because that is about taking care of your customer. If you think about a $1,500 pump, an $8,000 pump, a $10,000 pump, particularly a $15,000 one you order online, you're not worried about 5%, 10%. You're worried about getting that piece of equipment under the process conditions that you need spec to order as quickly as you can by getting the plant to respond to you quickly. So I think the point is no, we actually anticipate pricing power because part of the issue is when you're not delivering, you don't have any pricing power and price correlates to ability to deliver on time. ","So they may take your product with a longer lead time but they\u2019re going to command price reductions for it. When you can deliver quickly, you can command a higher price. So what I'd say is look over the next two quarters. I have a lot of confidence in Tom. From the pricing side, we actually think it will really start to feed on itself terms of price and volume once we can execute because we have very good products. It's just we're having trouble getting them to our customers and making us easy for them to do business with. We have to fix that.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That makes sense. Thank you and congrats again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Good morning. Mark, congratulations on your retirement.","Mark Blinn","Thank you very much.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on capacity. I think I heard you saying that the industry is going to have less capacity going to the next cycle. How do you weigh this against the fact that we are hearing that the Chinese players are getting a lot more active, particularly as Chinese EPCs are gaining market share, as well as the impact of additive manufacturing on the industry?","Mark Blinn","I think a couple of things. In general, the traditional competitors are taking capacity out. You are right in terms of Chinese EPCs, but keep in mind a lot of our capacity is designed to participate with those EPCs in some of their global efforts. So don't think about that these products, especially some of the more highly engineered, are going to necessarily just be picked up by local Chinese suppliers. Where we traditionally see Chinese competition are on the lower-end products. But one of our key strategies is to develop capabilities like in the China power business, because we're well aware that not only are those Chinese EPCs going to serve their local markets, but they\u2019re going to go to regions like Africa and we want to go with them.","I'm trying to think of -- oh, your comment around additive manufacturing. Yes, in terms of some sub-manufacturing, a lot of our LPO SPO strategy is designed to have that internal capability and as part of the realignment, we're moving some of that manufacturing, base manufacture out to our supply base as is our industry. So you're right on in terms of your comments, but don't view that as a negative. One is specifically a strategic area where we are addressing and another one is strategic\/tactical in terms of how we are approaching our realignment.","Andrew Obin","Just a follow-up question on the EMCs. What are you seeing in terms of people reopening contracts? Have we gone through the cycle already?","Mark Blinn","We haven't -- what we saw the cancellations in 2015 picked up quite a bit. We saw quite a few of those. That has significantly abated. In terms of cancellations and everything, there's been -- it hasn't been of any great significance. There hasn't been a bow wave or anything like that in terms of these. These projects are fairly mature. They're moving along. Keep in mind we're pretty far along in the projects in terms of our product deliveries. You do see them from time to time. Part of the Latin American one was one that, a project that's been put on hold for quite a few years in terms of that inventory right now. So I'm not saying it's not happening, but there isn't any significant change in the pace and cadence of those activities.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone. Mark, I'm going to save my congratulations for February because you\u2019ve still got five months of work to do.","Mark Blinn","Thanks, I'll appreciate it.","Nathan Jones","I'm going to go the M&A route here. When you bought SIHI at the start of 2014, you talked about that being an 18 to 24 month integration process, so you should be largely finished, if not finished at the moment. What is the Company's appetite for further M&A at this point? Does that change at all with your impending retirement?","Mark Blinn","I think -- just remember, the Company's not about one individual. If a good opportunity comes up, I'm sure Management, we would all take a look at the opportunity. But in fairness, new leadership may have a different point of view, especially as you get up the curve in terms of much more strategic type activities. But I think if something is compelling as SIHI were to come along and it would make sense, I am certain Management and the Board would take a hard look at it. I just want to point that out. We are continuing to move forward. We have things to do in our business and particularly realignment, which is an absolute priority. I'd go back to our capital allocation priorities and our priorities in our business. That's still first and foremost, which I can tell you may impact our view in terms of when we look at in an external opportunity.","Nathan Jones","Does the bandwidth required for this realignment program going through the end of next year make it less likely that Flowserve would embark on a meaningful acquisition at this point?","Mark Blinn","I can just tell you that realignment is a priority and I expect it to remain a priority, Nathan. A lot of that is determined by the opportunity itself. Where is it? For example, if we were having a discussion as a management team and something came up in our custom engineered business, you take a step back and say wow, there's a lot going on there. Could we really integrate it? You'd have to risk adjust the opportunity. Flip side, and I'm not signaling anything, I'm just telling you how we think about it, because if you look at our valve business, you say well, those are fairly discrete operations in terms of facilities, the ease of integration is going to be higher. ","So on a disciplined approach, you look at everything on a risk-adjusted basis. But my point earlier is the highest return on every dollar we have is really in our realignment area right now. Hopefully that answers it because I don't know. It's a case study on the opportunity that comes up. If something came up that was very compelling, you have to evaluate that, but that's the way we think about it.","Nathan Jones","Okay, then I have one on capacity and price. You had probably your largest competitor in the engineered pump business talking about an expectation that demand and supply capacity would come at the balance towards the end of next year and an expectation that you wouldn't see any price improvement until at least then. Is that something that you'd concur with? Just any color you could give on how you think about it.","Mark Blinn","On our custom engineered, I think that's a fair statement is price is determined by amongst other things, capacity. I mean, you have to be able to engineer and design the product. You have to be able to deliver it on time. All those things being equal, it is going to be around capacity. I think in our other areas, particularly in IPD, it's going to be in our ability to execute. I think that's going to determine price more than anything.","Nathan Jones","All right, thanks very much. Look forward to talking with you guys again.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Go ahead.","Bhupender Bohra","Good morning guys. Mark, just a question on the month of September here. Can you give us some color in terms of the end markets? We saw oil and gas, coal orders, the bookings actually grew like 10%, but the non-oil and gas business has stayed weak here. If you can just (indiscernible) in September and what are we seeing in the first few weeks of especially October here?","Mark Blinn","Bhupender, I think my comments were in general about the industry. We don't go into bookings month by month. But in general, what you saw was typically you expect July and August to be somewhat slower, with -- you have Ramadan in the Middle East. You have vacations in Europe, vacations even in the United States. It tends to be a little bit slower in pick up. We just started out slower than originally anticipated in July and August, but just didn't see the ramp up in September. So my comment is more general around the quarter and I think you've heard that from our industry. I just wanted to provide you our color on it.","If you look at specific bookings, we did have an ebulliator. Not huge, but an ebulliator opportunity booking that came in. so there's going to be a lot of moving parts but in general, what my commentary around the month of December -- September was, excuse me, was that we just didn't see the ramp-up that we normally saw in the month of September. But also as you think about September, there was a lot of uncertainty in the market then. So you look back and you go, I guess that wasn't really a surprise, but we just didn't see the ramp up.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay, got it. Was that specific to a particular geographical region here or regionally?","Mark Blinn","No, it was more in general. I think this goes around. You think about all that's going on. The US has elections and that has a worldwide implication as people observe what is going on. I just think it was fairly broad based.","Bhupender Bohra","So my next question was on the press release which you put out a day before your earnings was the collaboration with Honeywell on the Internet of Things here. Some of your competitors have talked about how they\u2019re converting their assets to the Internet of Things and making it more -- more them more intelligent here going forward. They have even talked about sales funnels because of this application. I don't know if you want to give a broad perspective on where Flowserve is as you're collaborating with Honeywell and I believe HPE and how that thing actually goes over the next two years or maybe even half.","Mark Blinn","Sure. This is important, because in these capabilities, these smart plants, the product matters. That's where you embed the sensors. That's where the basic algorithms come from in terms of the know-how or the process conditions. We're right in the middle that. I've talked about that on earlier calls. It's where we're spending some of our time is making sure that our equipment can, because it's critical to the process, our equipment has that capability because we think over time, customers are going to increasingly value that. What you saw with our relationship with Honeywell, you've seen them with other providers before, is part of the value chain in terms of how we deliver that capability to the customers.","But keep in mind, a lot of the predictive algorithms and everything come from the product manufacturer because they know the product, they know the process conditions, they know the hydraulics. They're the ones that can actually make the machine smart. So we think it's a great opportunity going forward. My view is it's not going to occur overnight, but it's certainly going to start to penetrate the market and when I think about how highly engineered our equipment is, the know-how that goes into it, our ability to embed sensors, the ability to ubiquitously transmit that information, I think it's going to be a real opportunity.","Bhupender Bohra","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question come from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joe Giordano","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to talk about capacity quickly again. There's no question that everyone is taking footprint out, but you get the sense talking to some people that through things like lean and automation that the actual quantity of items that are able to be produced isn't really changing a whole lot relative to the amount of square footage being taking out of plants. So can you maybe comment on that a bit? Is there a need for larger scale consolidation within the industry to really achieve more of a balance?","Mark Blinn","That's actually a fair statement is I think that what you've commented on is we will have less footprint, 30% less facilities and I'm confident that we would be able to execute on any of the backlogs we've had in the last 5 to 10 years for the exact reason you've talked about. And that is, we had a lot of under absorption in the most recent peak in our cycle in 2014, so we'll eliminate a lot of that. But then the comment earlier around sub-manufacturing, our LPO SPO, the ability to move work, our focus on more highly engineered products. What that does is that obviously gives you better absorption in the business. So I think that as I look at our business specifically in terms of what we've done over the last, particularly in the last five years, we will have less square feet and equal or more manufacturing capability and throughput capability in our business.","In terms of industry consolidation, yes and no. All manufacturing is not equal. You need to keep that in mind is that some of our facilities have the ability to manufacture certain or specific products. So when I think about our CE acquisition, that wasn't -- there was very little consolidation in that and it was more around adding product and product capabilities to our portfolio. Now, you can move some of their products into some of our facilities, which we've done, and by the way, we moved some of our products into one of their facilities. There is the opportunity to do that, but I'd caution you not to think of our capacity as ubiquitous, and it's just a matter of square footage. You've got to have the know-how, the capabilities, the right machining, the right experience in those locations. Clearly, though, our efforts are going to make us much more efficient.","Tom Pajonas","I would just add to what Mark says on the capacity side, that's one aspect of the realignment. The other aspect is a strategic repositioning of our products and people around the world, similar to the previous comment that came up in terms of the EPCs going in different locations. A lot of the jobs going forward are requiring more local content and that is one of the aspects of the realignment is a strategic repositioning of our assets.","Mark Blinn","That's a good point. In many countries, you must be present to win.","Joe Giordano","Is this -- while that's all obviously very positive for Flowserve, if everyone else is doing a similar thing, is this inherently bad for the industry where if the markets don't materially accelerate and get back to OE levels that would justify this level of volumetric capacity, has nothing really changed from an overall industry perspective?","Mark Blinn","No. Look, the industry has taken enough capacity out. Keep in mind, our industry was stretched for capacity in 2007 and 2008, so it's not like there was a bunch of extra capacity. The industry is taking capacity out. We're fairly aggressive on it. I can't comment generally, specifically on some of our competitors, but generally they're taken the capacity out. The industry knows how to right size itself. It's had plenty of time to do that. I'm confident that the industry, it's not going to be perfect on capacity. If anything, there will be a little extra. Just keep in mind, we are one of the ones that are more capable about moving products around our facilities around the world.","Just because 80% of your plants are full doesn't mean that 20% of them won't be under absorbed even in good times. So I think it's probably to remember to say not all capacity is equal. Our industry is responding by taking capacity out, particularly players like Flowserve that tend to be on the higher-end products, they've rationalized that capacity. So I don't think there's going to be a big capacity overhang where we go into the next uptick.","Joe Giordano","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi and thank you for taking my question. I have a clarification and a question. Thank you for the color on 2017 and I apologize if I missed it, but did you actually say whether or not you could grow earnings next year?","Mark Blinn","Did not. I said we'd provide guidance in three months.","John Walsh","Okay. Fair enough. As we think about cash flow into next year, obviously this year you have the headwind from the realignment cash. I think there's still a modest headwind based on your guidance for cash from restructuring cash, but how about some of the other lines, pension, CapEx, cash interest, how should we think about those into next year?","Mark Blinn","Our pension cash outflows have been fairly steady for the last couple of years and as Karen mentioned in her comments, we are fully funded. I don't want to again, get ahead of our guidance, but I would say the biggest consumer of our cash looking into next year is going to be following through on our realignment initiatives. It's pretty much as simple as that. Then as -- in our industry, as we deliver a lot of these large projects, that does tend to cause your balance sheet to liquidate slightly, especially the large ones. We will give the guidance in January, but I think if you look at the just generally trends that we talked about, I would focus the most on our realignment cash in terms of making your assumptions.","John Walsh","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","Hi. These are two quick ones. Mark, there's been a lot said about the aftermarket, the turnarounds, the lack of them, the push-backs and what have you, yet here you are with an aftermarket bookings number of about down two. It essentially shows stabilization. What are you trying to say about aftermarket with that type of number which supports stabilization? Are you concerned about it going forward or is it something else?","Mark Blinn","No, I'm not concerned about it. I will tell you we have to earn that business every day. But no, I haven't expressed a concern. We've been pleased with the stability we've seen in the tough environment we've been in.","Scott Graham","Got you. Last one is the corporate expense. Is that a number we can see repeat going forward, or is that maybe just really tightening your belts in the last two quarters of the year?","Mark Blinn","We are always going to continue to tighten our belt, Scott, and if you look at corporate expense over the last seven years, we've managed that very tightly. You should expect us to continue to do that.","Scott Graham","Very good. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We have reached our allotted time. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.","John Roueche","Thank you, Paulette, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you participating in our call today to discuss Flowserve's financial results for the 2019 first quarter. Joining me this morning are Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Eckert, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for questions. And as a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available.","Please also note that our earnings materials do, and this call will include non-GAAP measures and contain forward-looking statements. These statements are based upon forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management, as of May 3, 2019, and they involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. We encourage you to fully review our safe harbor disclosures, as well as the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to our reported results, both of which are included in our press release and earnings presentation, and are available on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Scott Rowe","Thanks, Jay, and good morning everyone.","Flowserve's first quarter results are a strong start to the year. And I'd like to begin by recognizing our associates for their continued engagement and enthusiasm around the significant changes that we are driving within the company. Our associates are leading the Flowserve 2.0 effort to accelerate growth, reduce complexity, and streamline the Flowserve operating model, and we are making great progress.","We executed well during the first quarter, delivering $0.44 of reported EPS and $0.41 of adjusted EPS. The transformation costs and below the line foreign exchange impacts, more than offset by net realized benefits.","As realignment activities wind down, and lower cost transformation initiatives continue, we expect the size and number of adjusted items to moderate in the years ahead. We fully intend to narrow the difference between our reported and our adjusted results.","We will continue to use our Flowserve 2.0 transformation initiatives to drive further operational and productivity improvements company-wide. The actions we have taken thus far were validated by strong year-over-year margin expansion again in this quarter. Adjusted gross and operating margins increased by over 300 basis points in the first quarter.","Improving free cash flow is also a priority for us, and I'm pleased with our stronger performance in the first quarter, as compared to a year-ago. The improvement is still primarily attributed to an intense in manual effort, but I'm confident that we're beginning develop the underlying process changes needed to deliver more sustainable and consistent cash flow conversion at higher levels.","As many of you know Flowserve and our industry as a whole is impacted by seasonality, and the first quarter is traditionally the lightest of any year. So, I'm pleased with the performance in each of our segments this quarter. We are off to a good start in 2019.","Our newly formed FPD segment delivered strong operating improvements, including 450 basis point and 440 basis point improvement and adjusted gross and operating margins respectively . While we no longer report on the former IPD segment, I will share that during the first quarter, IPD's former facilities in aggregate improved their operational excellence, on-time delivery, productivity, and adjusted operating margins year-over-year.","As I discussed in our Analyst Day last year, the rationale for the combined FPD segment is to better serve our customers, and fully leverage the scale of our pump platform from both a manufacturing and aftermarket perspective. FPD's strong 24% total bookings growth, which is led by a 56% increase in original equipment awards, benefited from this combination, as improved sales force collaboration allowed us to capitalize on a number of market opportunities. We also expect cost benefits and additional manufacturing improvements as we implement common processes and best practices across the platform.","The FCD segment, our valves and automation business once again delivered strong quarter including 230 basis point and 290 basis point improvement in adjusted gross and operating margins, on modest 1.8% revenue growth. FCD's bookings were down 2.3%, but included roughly 3% of negative currency impact.","Additionally, the comparison period was challenging, as last year's first quarter represented FCD's highest bookings periods of the year. We expect FCD to again deliver strong full-year performance, including improved collaboration with our FPD organization to better leverage the entire Flowserve portfolio to support the increased project activity.","Looking now to overall bookings and end-market. We are particularly pleased to have produced $1.07 billion of total bookings, representing year-over-year growth of 14.9%, including a nearly 25% increase in original equipment bookings. These strong results were a function of our growth-oriented transformation initiatives combined with more robust infrastructure spending. As market visibility continues to improve, we expect near term booking levels to remain solid.","Additionally, the health of the market is giving us confidence in our ability to continue to improve our pricing. We are seeing good results from our price increases that went into effect at the beginning of the year, and we are pleased with the acceptance and resiliency that we've seen thus far. We have initiated further price increases over the last few months, where we have the opportunity to price at higher levels.","Flowserve delivered the highest quarterly level of bookings since the second quarter of 2015 and our fourth consecutive quarter at over $1 billion. First quarter bookings continued to be driven by smaller run rate in upgrade activity, most of which are below $10 million in size.","We did attain one larger oil and gas award in the $30 million to $40 million, range, but are yet to see a significant increase in new large project activity, as these customers continue to work toward FID on many of the sizable opportunities. We will remain disciplined on pricing for these larger projects to ensure that Flowserve earns the appropriate profit for the value we deliver.","During the quarter, our aftermarket franchise generated nearly 6% bookings growth, representing the fourth consecutive quarter with bookings over $500 million. As we successfully embedded many of the commercial intensity initiatives across our global aftermarket platform, we are capturing an increased share of our customers' maintenance spend.","We continue to expect our customers will focus on facility maintenance, increased efficiency, and meeting changing regulatory requirements in the near term, but when combined with our growth oriented transformation efforts, these factors will provide ongoing opportunities for Flowserve to expand the aftermarket business.","Now from a served end market perspective and starting with oil and gas. Bookings in the first quarter increased 45% year-over-year, driven primarily by FPD's 66% growth, including our largest award of the quarter at over $30 million in Asia-Pacific. Both FPD and FCD however, saw the bulk of their orders in the $3 million to $15 million range, primarily in the Middle East, in Asia Pacific. Downstream investment drove much of the increase as we continue to support refining modifications for clean fuel production and efficiency upgrades.","With relatively stable commodity prices, we expect increased project activity to occur near term in both downstream and midstream oil and gas. While Flowserve has traditionally been predominantly downstream focused, we are utilizing our strike zone initiative within the transformation to successfully increase our pursuit, and more importantly, our capture of midstream pipeline opportunities with a coordinated effort across our pump and valves offering. We've booked a handful of orders in the first quarter and have good line of sight into additional midstream opportunities throughout 2019.","Finally, we have yet to benefit from the expected large project activity in the marketplace, both those still in the FEED stage and the one already awarded to EPCs. While timing is always difficult to predict, we do expect increased refining in LNG projects to provide good opportunities for R&D - for our industry in the coming quarters.","In Chemicals, our quarterly bookings increased approximately 6% year-over-year including 4% of currency headwind. Both FPD and FCD contributed mid single-digit growth, again supported by smaller projects and run-rate investment.","We are encouraged by the near term opportunity and remain confident in the second wave of North American ethylene development. We also expect increased investment in Asia and the Middle East, as oil majors and national oil companies increasingly pursue integration, up the petrochemical value chain.","The Power market remains our most challenged industry with first quarter bookings essentially flat year-over-year. FCD's First quarter bookings however, increased 13% in this market, as it benefited from several nuclear awards across North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. We expect industry-wide headwinds to continue in Power markets for the near-term, although limited opportunities do exist related to fuel switching, new build nuclear in China, and fossil fuel development in Asia.","We also continue to support existing western nuclear facilities with maintenance upgrade and life extension activity. Additionally, the concentrated solar power market is a niche opportunity for Flowserve in the growing renewable space, and we have a differentiated technology offering that we provide to this market.","First quarter bookings in general industries declined 5% year-over-year, including nearly 4% of currency headwind. FCD was down approximately 23% in this market, primarily due to lower distribution activity that was negatively impacted by North American land-based upstream volatility due to oil pricing pressures in the fourth quarter.","Given the oil price rebound this year, we expect to see growth in North American upstream through our distribution channel later in 2019. General industry bookings also declined in mining, pulp and paper, and agriculture, although each of these markets currently represent less than 3% of our overall mix.","Lastly, representing our smallest market, water bookings increased approximately 24% in the first quarter, including several small awards in both segments and primarily in North America. From a geographic standpoint, we delivered strong growth in all regions except Europe.","Compared to the 2018 first quarter, North America was up nearly 18%, the Middle East and Africa increased 45%, and Asia-Pacific was up 21%. Latin America also grew nearly 20%, sorry, grew nearly 27%, but off a low base. European bookings declined nearly 11%, including approximately 7% of currency headwinds.","I'll now turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results in greater detail, and then I will turn for closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A. Lee?","Lee Eckert","Thanks Scott, and good morning everyone.","Flowserve delivered a very good start to the year. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 in line with our expectations. On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.44 which included realignment benefit of $0.09, $0.04 of transformation charges and $0.02 of negative below the line currency impacts.","First quarter is traditionally our seasonally low quarter in the year, revenues were $890 million, a decrease of 3.3% versus prior year. Excluding approximately 5% of headwinds from currency and divested assets revenues were up about 2% year-over-year.","Additionally, this year, only 17% of our first quarter revenue utilized overtime percentage of completion accounting compared to approximately 23% a year ago. This reduction was a result of differences in sales mix between the two periods, disciplined spending on larger projects in progress and the deliberate efforts we made last year to ensure that the new smaller contracts that we booked do not contain terms - terms and conditions that would trigger overtime accounting. Compared to a year ago Flowserve's current backlog has a higher percentage of contracts or revenue will be recognized as work is completed and shipped.","As a result of the growth we delivered in recent quarters and aftermarket bookings, aftermarket sales increased for the first quarter by 3.4% or 7.9% on a constant currency basis to $470 million and comprised 53% of our sales mix, which was a 300 basis point increase over last year's first quarter.","Now looking at margins. First quarter adjusted margin increased 340 basis points to 33.7%, matching the highest quarterly level since 2015. Both segments contributed to the improvement, with FPD expanding adjusted gross margin by 450 basis points to 33.7% due to continued operational improvements, fewer but higher margin large project POC contracts and progress and a 500 basis points mix shift towards aftermarket sales. FCD's adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 34.8% a modest revenue growth as we continue to operate at a high level.","On a reported basis we had a 280 basis point increase in gross margin to 34.6% which was driven by essentially the same factors as well as approximately $1 million of less realignment expense in 2019.","Adjusted SG&A decreased $5.2 million to approximately $240 million or 24% of sales, relatively flat with last year's first quarter. On a reported basis first quarter SG&A decreased $24 million which included a $17 million net realignment benefit.","At the operating level, our adjusted operating margins improved 310 basis points to 9.9%, as a result of our strong gross margin and ongoing tight cost controls. On a reported basis, operating margin increased 540 basis points where improved operating performance further benefit from a net reduction of approximately $20 million in adjusted items primarily related to realignment. Our adjusted tax rate was 25.6%, slightly above - slightly lower than our full year guidance - adjusted tax rate guidance of 26% to 28%.","Turning to cash. We delivered a substantial year-over-year improvement in free cash flow. Strong earnings, some timing benefit and our continued focus on working capital, produced the operating cash flow of $39 million, a $159 million improvement versus the 2018 first quarter. Working capital declined over $100 million and as a percentage of sales decreased 360 basis points to 28.4% .","Scott mentioned, we are working on - we are working towards driving company-wide improvements within our order to cash and inventory processes to create a sustainable systemic operating model. These changes are the necessary foundation to enable Flowserve to achieve our longer term cash conversion target.","While much of the quarter's improvement was again driven by intense focus and highly manual efforts, we will continue this brute force approach until enabling technologies are in place and the underlying process improvements take hold.","In the first quarter we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends, paid off $50 million of long-term debt and invested in the business with $11 million of capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of nearly $640 million. A sequential increase, an improvement of over $100 million from the year-ago level.","As I'm sure you've seen in - from other companies, you may have noticed in our balance sheet, at the start of the year, a new lease accounting standard was implemented which required companies to account for operating leases on the balance sheet. For Flowserve this charge added about $200 million to both assets and liabilities as of March 31st.","Turning to our 2019 outlook. As we mentioned previously, we are actively re-instilling a culture of excellence, continuous improvement and our focus on meeting our commitments. And with our first quarter results, keeping us on pace for the full year, we are reaffirming our full year targets.","On adjusted basis, we continue to expect EPS between $1.95 and $2.15 a share and $1.60 to $1.80 on a GAAP basis. Similarly, we also confirmed our expected revenue growth of 4% to 6% including full year headwind from currency of 1.5% and roughly 0.5% from last year's business divestitures. This level of performance will keep us on track with our longer term 2022 targets we laid out in December.","The adjusted EPS target range excludes the 2019 expected realignment in transformation expense of approximately $60 million, as well as below the line foreign currency effect and the impacts of potential other discrete items which may occur during the year, such as acquisitions, divestitures, tax reform laws et cetera. Net interest expense is expected in the range of $55 million to $57 million with an adjusted tax rate of 26% to 28%.","Additionally we expect, traditional back half weighted seasonality generally in line with the 2018 quarterly phasing as we delivered additional transformation benefits. From 2019 full year cash usage perspective, we expect to return approximately $100 million through dividends to our shareholders.","Capital expenditures are expected in the $90 million to $100 million range. We also expect full-year debt repayment of approximately $50 million and to continue - and to contribute approximately $20 million to our global pension plans, mainly to cover our ongoing service costs and the US plants, remain largely fully funded.","Now, let me now turn it over to Scott for his closing remarks.","Scott Rowe","Great. Thank you, Lee.","As I wrap up, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our outlook in the progress of our transformation efforts. When we formally commence the Flowserve 2.0 transformation program, a little over a year ago. We knew, it's going to be a multi-year journey. We are convinced that Flowserve had a significant opportunity to better serve our customers, our employees and our shareholders.","A year into the journey, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made. We have built momentum and have increasingly shifted to a self sufficient internally lead program, while greatly reducing the amount of third-party reliance.","We are encouraged by the results that we're starting to see in all areas of the business. Flowserve has improved operationally as demonstrated by four consecutive quarters of increased year-over-year adjusted operating margins. We've driven improvements in our manufacturing productivity, our planning and scheduling, as well as in our supply chain management.","Our growth initiatives, combined with an improved market outlook have driven four consecutive quarters of $1 billion plus bookings. As we continue to push the transformation initiatives deeper into our business we are confident that we will build on the results delivered to-date.","Perhaps most encouraging, there is still significant opportunity ahead of Flowserve. Much work remains to achieve the 2022 targets that we presented last year, but we are instilling the culture, developing the processes and changing the operating model to create sustainable long-term value.","We're making good progress on both the health and the performance of Flowserve. We are still in the early phases of the transformation, and I am convinced, there are significant opportunities ahead of us. Our commitment to Flowserve 2.0 combined with the strong first quarter performance gives me the confidence that we can deliver on our 2019 commitments.","Operator, we've now concluded our prepared comments. We'd now like to open the call to any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead.","Michael Halloran","So, just some questions on the margins, as we look through the year here. Obviously some of the prepared remarks talked about the mix benefit on the aftermarket side in the first quarter. Obviously the margins from here would imply some pretty healthy results relative to guidance potentially. So could you help with that cadence through the year here. What was sustainable from the first quarter as we work forward and how those cost initiatives and mix and things like that should play out as we work forward?","Scott Rowe","Yes, sure Mike. I'll start and then I'll let Lee fill in because I'll probably miss something here. But I'd say there was a 3% mix shift towards aftermarket in the first quarter. And so that was one thing and that will probably unwind as we go throughout the rest of the year. But what I'd say in the first quarter that we had no major surprises and historically at least as long as I've been here we've had a surprise almost every quarter.","And so, we're doing well on execution in eliminating that. Additionally, we're on the positive side of the price cost curve and as I discussed in my remarks, we've now had two pretty substantial price increases in the year, and we feel pretty good about our ability to continue - our ability for that to continue to stick throughout the year.","And then we're just more selective on the work that we're taking. And so as we think about what goes into our facilities and what we can execute, we're making sure that we can deliver value when we deliver that work.","And then finally, the other thing is that our past due backlog is significantly down from where it was a year ago. And so that was consuming a lot of cost and this incremental cost into that backlog and that's cleared in a much better place the margins are in the good place right now, and we expect to keep a similar result throughout the year. Lee you want to add anything?","Lee Eckert","Yes. I think you summarized it pretty well, Scott. Our focus is to drive year-over-year margin expansion. And as Scott mentioned, the key drivers as price ahead of inflation, we're driving supply chain savings as part of a Flowserve 2.0, we're executing better on projects such as we're not having surprises like we had in the past.","And then we're also winning the right contracts. So we're much more selective in what we're winning and executing on that. But the last item is one, so all those should continue through the rest of the year.","The last one is the aftermarket mix. And our expectation is that its going to be more balanced and especially with the significant amount of orders we want and what's in our backlog, we are going to see lot more obviously original equipment through the balance of the year. So while we are driving year-over-year margin expansion, it should not - you should have a conclusion that will lead to sequential margin expansion.","Michael Halloran","So if I could unpack that then you're basically saying mix is going to be a swing factor from here. But as far as internal initiatives go, price cost, things like that it feels like more of a tailwind from the first quarter looking ahead. Is that fair?","Lee Eckert","Yes. Mix is the headwind and we offset that headwind by transformation activities and doing the good things that we did in the first quarter.","Michael Halloran","And then a comment on the pricing side. Is the pricing limited from ability in the marketplace to some of the aftermarket in the more higher end niche applications, how does it all - could you talk about that side, but then also how does pricing look on the larger projects, those $3 million to $15 million plus kind of range. How competitive is it and obviously you're being more price disciplined, but love to hear about the opportunity set there as well?","Lee Eckert","The other side, what we've done this year so far, and then I'll talk about a little bit about the current environment. So we did our price increase earlier this year than we ever have. In fact, we announced it in December and went into effect in the early parts of January. And that was pretty much across our entire offering with the exception of the engineered order products that we build up that cost and then price off the build-up of the costs.","We're seeing really good resiliency in the price increase that we issued in the beginning of the year. And that affects all of our business. Right. It seals, it's parts in the aftermarket, it's valves and it's on more of the base product within the pump portfolio. And so that's got good traction. We're seeing good results from that and we expect to continue that throughout the year.","In addition to that, what we've done in the engineered order as we started to raise our margin expectations, as we've been able to drive cost out in the execution instead of passing that on to the customers we're capturing that ourselves. And so we're pricing at higher levels than we have in the past and certainly much higher than what we did in the first quarter of last year.","And then finally the third piece to this is, there are selective areas where we've got a preferred position or a niche opportunity where we've also added price increases on top of what we've done at the beginning of the year.","So we feel very good about where we are on price right now relative to cost, inflation, tariffs and everything else, but there are areas of concern and where it's say the - the areas are primarily the larger projects and for some reason, larger projects attract more attention, and what we're seeing from peer group and competitors is that that gets incredible focus on price reduction and become highly competitive.","And so we understand that and what we're going to do is we're going to price our big projects accordingly. We'd love to have some of those in our backlog and in the portfolio, but at the same time, if we can get the price that makes sense to create ultimate value, then we're not going to do those jobs. But there still - it's surprising to me there is still a lot of pressure in large pump projects and in the large more engineered valve projects as well.","Michael Halloran","But that's - varies much smaller percentage of your portfolio today than historically. Correct?","Lee Eckert","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","You guys should really do more resegmentations, if you can [indiscernible] quarters like this. So maybe the first question is in cash flow. So we like seeing the progress year-over-year, and I was interested that both of you talked about - still in a intensity manual process. Maybe share with us where and how does that get automated or more systemized if I can use that word. But then also it's not just the speed of order to cash, but what's the ultimate plan for working capital, because it just seems your capital intensity is still a bit too high for the businesses that you're in, and where and how are you looking to drive down working capital?","Scott Rowe","Yes. So Deane, let me start and then I'll let Lee jump in and go into the details here. But we're making good progress on working capital. But this is the area that we continue to talk about right, Flowserve is highly decentralized and trying to get this accomplished across the enterprise is just been incredibly hard work. And so right now, we're doing it with management attention, intensity and a big manual effort.","Ultimately, we want to have far more transparency in the ability with an integrated system to do this from a systematic standpoint. And what I'd say is the manual effort is getting good results right, we're down significantly from where we were last year, 32% and now we're at 28.4%, but we still have a long way to go. And this is not our aspiration, in fact, we're fully striving to be somewhere in closer to the 20% mark, as a percentage of revenue.","So we know we have a long way to go here. As part of the transformation this is a major initiative, both on the inventory side and the receivable side. But we are definitely getting traction and from a year ago we're in a far better place than we were.","And so you'll continue to see improvements here. But it's really going to be slow going until we can really start to have an integrated and more systemic approach to that. Lee why don't you go in a little bit more on the cash flow side and touch on working capital.","Lee Eckert","Sure. So as I mentioned, a pretty big improvement $160 million driven - $43 million in earnings, $85 million in working capital and about $44 million that I would say is more timing related. So we do expect that kind of bounce back during the year, but as Scott mentioned there is intense focus here in working capital in importance.","So, some of the things we talked about in the past is - first things we did is, we made sure everybody was incentivized to focus on working capital. There is not a location you would go to where people are not talking about the progress we're making on inventory and receivables and that wasn't the case before. But the manual effort where we would like to get to are places where we have centralized billing, centralized collection, centralized SKU management system.","Today we don't have those capabilities. Right now it's all at our sites. And so right now the manual effort, people are aligned and focused on it, as we said, it's kind of brute force efforts, but we are putting plans and processes in place to centralize, to get scale. I - you will be embarrassed to say that in many cases I invoice - I send invoices by mail, and often it's snail mail.","Those should be electronic payments, and so those were some of the things that we need to do to drive the balances down and as Scott said, our goal - our short-term goal is to get to around 20%.","Deane Dray","All right.","Scott Rowe","And Deane, one last thing I failed to say on the incentive structure, because Lee brought it up, and I said this in the first quarter, but it is driving behavior. And so, now we've got everybody incentivized with working capital and then the other thing we did is historically at Flowserve that incentive was in the end of the year metric , which obviously is not going to help you bring down working capital throughout the year. And so this year we changed that. And it is your average, and so we're really getting that attention much earlier in the year and our teams are focused on driving that down.","Deane Dray","And then the second question is a little bit more reflective of this. What happens when you start making progress and you've - you can see Flowserve 2.0 turning the corner here, is when do you get to start playing offence? It sounds like yesterday, there will be some energy pumps and valves assets coming onto the market, and it just raises the question when will you be ready to go back into M&A? What's the timing? What makes sense, and we would appreciate some color on that. Thanks?","Scott Rowe","Yes, Sure. Well, obviously, it's a dynamic space right now in the industrials full control market. And so we have our ear to the ground and we're watching things evolve and move forward. For us, we are very focused on Flowserve 2.0 and driving that agenda, and getting the results that we need. I'm not going to commit to say, no, third quarter this year, we're ready to go or fourth quarter, but what I'd say is, we are definitely making progress.","And so every quarter that we go through, I am more confident that we've got a platform that we can integrate something into. But as we just talked about right, it's still highly manual, and it's not as clean as simple as we would want. And so, as we start to move forward and develop our enterprise wide IT systems, and start to have more consistency in our operating results, then I start to get more comfortable about moving toward the offensive.","Now with that said, we've got to make sure that there is a requirement that we are generating value if we were to go outside and look at acquisitions, and so it's got to be financially attractive, we've got to be able to integrate it, almost seamlessly, you have the confidence and the ability to integrate. We'd also still need to maintain financial flexibility.","And so we're going to be prudent about what those are, and what is there right now, as we're still very focused on the Flowserve 2.0 agenda. But if we can have a couple more good quarters like we had in Q1, then we get more confidence in our ability to execute and run a bigger business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","I was going through my model, I was trying to figure out when was the last time you had positive free cash flow in the first quarter. It only goes back to '05, and I haven't seen any quarters like that, so congrats.","Scott Rowe","Thank you, Andy.","Andrew Obin","So, question on that, you sort of talked that they were one-time items in the quarter on working capital. I just want to make sure that - and I understand that there will be paybacks throughout the year. But what are the chances of us seeing quarters with negative free cash flow in 2019 or should we assume that they will go up and down, but pretty much free cash flow will be positive throughout the year?","Scott Rowe","Lee, you want to take this one?","Lee Eckert","Yes. So without giving like quarterly guidance on cash flow, we do - there is - we do have a major, I would say outflow is going to happen in the second quarter around compensation. So that will be a drag in the quarter. But our focus, as Scott talked about is, continue to drive working capital improvement quarter-to-quarter. And so that should continue to build. So I'm not going to give guidance on the second quarter cash flow, but I do expect you will see a change in liabilities in the second quarter.","Scott Rowe","We've got an intense focus on cash for right now. We just talked about working capital, and as you know, right, first quarter is always the most challenging on working capital. So we got off to a reasonably good start. We expect to improve that as we go forward. And I think with that focus in the expanded margins, as we look at the back half of the year, we feel pretty good about staying in a good space on cash flow.","Andrew Obin","Right. But I just want to make sure that there is - historically, right, I mean if you look at the swing - the swing from Q1, Q2 is fairly substantial. So if you are in fact sort of gaining operational attraction, maybe it's breakeven, but second quarter, can you comment whether there is a chance that can be negative or not, and I know that you don't guide. But I'm just trying to understand the magnitude of the swings that we could see in the second quarter?","Scott Rowe","There are some timing issues, but I wouldn't expect a big step backwards here.","Andrew Obin","Good. Second question on pricing. You highlighted the fact that pricing is getting better. And I'm just trying to understand what's driving it. Can you comment maybe on industry capacity, clearly for whatever reason people are behaving more rationally. Why all of a sudden you have ability to implement pricing and for pricing to stick. Thank you.","Scott Rowe","Sure. On the pricing side, again, I - we've done some really good work and we've been far more sophisticated about how we price and where we have our opportunities than ever before. And so, we're using a lot of data and a lot analytics, and what that tells us is that we've got opportunities in certain areas. And so we're trying to - what I would say is, we're trying to catch up probably to some of our more sophisticated peers on pricing, and so we've done that.","And then in addition to that, the backdrop of tariffs and cost inflation, also give us the ability to have true and honest discussions with our customers to say, hey, here's the real environment. I do think there are - we are getting some traction with the peer group and competitors, at the base business and so we are seeing folks lift prices up a little bit.","But like I said, earlier, where we still see highly - high degrees of competition is in the more engineered-to-order type projects and the bigger projects, they are attracting more people, and for whatever reason we are seeing significant price pressures on anything in the large project sizes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","Just a couple of questions around sales and expenses and what have you. So the implied organic kind of full-year basis is 6% to 8% thereabouts. And we have the first quarter which kind of came in at 2%, and I get the whole purchase - POC accounting change stuff. I guess what I'm wondering though is that, your second and third quarter comparisons are pretty tough. So, it would seem to me that you're expecting a pretty back half loaded and perhaps even fourth quarter loaded sales here. Can you kind of give us a little bit of color there, and does that mean that that fourth quarter could be maybe, fairly mix negative for margins?","Scott Rowe","Let me talk about our revenue profile, and then we'll hit margins. I'm going to let lead it off, and then I'll let Lee clean up here, if I miss something. But let's just have a first quarter, you typically, as you know right, that seasonably our lowest quarter, and we expect to go up from here. And I would say, in the first quarter, I'm pleased with the execution that we had. So we didn't have any major surprises and there is pretty much in line with our internal expectations.","We have improved operations dramatically from a year-ago, and so we were able to clear that huge past due backlog that, we talked about a lot in Q1 and Q2 of last year. And then we continue to expect revenue growth throughout the year with the increased backlog, right.","So with these bookings, we've got higher backlog and we expect to convert that at a higher level, as we move forward. So Lee do you want to talk about a little bit of the finer details on the revenue side, and talk about the forward look there?","Lee Eckert","Yes, sure. So just a couple of points. First, I'd say the first quarter was roughly in line with our internal expectations, where we recognized less project revenue than last year. At the beginning the year, we had fewer large contracts that qualify for the POC accounting versus last year. Last year, the 606 impact on revenue in the first quarter was $71 million. Unfortunately, the margin on that incremental revenue was really low, was at 9%. The good news is that the margin and the backlog starting this year is clearly better.","So the first quarter revenue, the net is that our sales are down, but our margin is up. The third thing - or the second thing I would say is that, as we said in our guidance, we alluded to it, we are still expecting 4% to 6% growth. So if you just do the math, that would expect the 6% to 9% balance of the year revenue growth.","Now the good news is that from our perspective is that, if you look at our backlog and you assume a certain conversion or historical conversion, our book and burn is roughly equivalent year-over-year. So that gives us the confidence that we get the sales number, but your point on margins going forward, there's clearly a second half lift as I talked about, between the 6% to 9%, but it's going to have a lot more equipment in it. So that will put some downward pressure versus the aftermarket margins.","Scott Rowe","Yes. So, like we said before, at the aftermarket OE mix goes more OE in the back half of the year, and so that's a headwind to margins. And we're trying to offset that margin headwind with our pricing and with some of the stuff in the Flowserve 2.0 and cost reduction.","Scott Graham","My other question is around corporate overhead and honestly from the outside looking in that's always a tough one to estimate. Is this a reasonable run rate number, the first quarter, plus or minus $3 million for the year, and then it goes higher in the fourth quarter. Just maybe give us a little bit of thinking on that?","John Roueche","So, unfortunately, it is an area that bounces around depending on certain types of expenses or costs that we typically may not push down to the platform. So there is some time that happens. So this quarter we were down roughly $10 million to $11 million in the fourth quarter. We're slightly up versus last year's first quarter due to some of the timing around benefit accrual. So it does bounce around. I think this quarter we are $25 million. I think that's pretty consistent over the course of the year, it could go up, it could go down, but on average, it should be around that number.","Scott Graham","Okay. That's hugely helpful.","Scott Rowe","And just Scott, let me just add long-term there, right, that is still an area that we are very much looking to drive down further. But this goes back to integrated systems and doing things a little bit better from a process standpoint. And so what I'd say is we continue to move toward our enterprise IT systems and as we continue to improve our process and our operating models, we'll start to get even further improvements of this overhead costs, but this one is - this is a very painful one for me personally.","Scott Graham","Yes. Well, Scott, to that same end if I might just sneak in this last question on the SG&A, I know that the corporate obviously affects that. So what we, - we might not completely gain back in operating margin what we lose in mix in the second half of the year, but wouldn't it - greater OE shipments imply a year-over-year percentage reduction in SG&A in the second half of the year and what is your ultimate target for that number if it is - for, let's say this year, maybe even next year. Whatever you can give us? Not the 2022, just kind of what are you thinking on that number for this year in total.","Scott Rowe","Yes. I would say, I mean our aspiration is 20% and I don't think we will be there by the end of the year. And again it goes back to just - this is taking longer than we thought with systems and your ability to drive more process, better and improved enhanced processes. But I think we'll make progress as revenues continue to grow in the back half of the year. We will make progress in bringing this down, but we're not going to get to the goal of 20% this year.","Scott Graham","No. I know that. I was just making sure that SG&A as a percent of sales because of maybe a little bit more OE in the revenue, that should naturally decline more right?","Scott Rowe","Yes. It will come down as a percentage of revenue, a little bit. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andy Kaplowitz","Scott, so four quarters in a row of aftermarket bookings over $500 million. I think one of the initiatives that you had right when you became CEO, it's really capture more of Flowserve's installed base. Is Flowserve beginning to do that at this point. And do you see good sustainability of maintaining or even growing off of this $500 million of bookings a quarter run rate?","Scott Rowe","Yes. And I'd say it's a really good point. And I'd say one of the differentiating factors of Flowserve than the peers is that we do have an adjusted incredibly large installed base. And so this is something that we've got a major initiative and effort within the transformation. We talked about this in December at the Analyst Day, and we're calling it commercial intensity.","But essentially, what the commercial intensity initiative is, is looking at a local geographic site that might have two or three refineries in a petrochemical facility and it - how does our local team in that local quick response centers start to get more of our installed base and capture our entitlement to do the aftermarket.","And then the other thing that we're doing is we're starting to add services and moving up the value chain with the maturity curve of services. And so ultimately what we want to do is provide more holistic services and move from just providing parts and maybe a service call out here and there.","And so I think all of that stuff is starting to come together now. We've rolled out commercial intensity worldwide. So we're completed now through the Americas, our Europe, Africa and the Middle East business and then also in Asia Pacific.","We're seeing really good results where we first started the program in North America. And now we're just starting to see the benefits in Asia Pacific and in Europe. So as we continue to evolve that program and continue to get more mature, I'm confident that we can sustain this type of levels and continue to grow our aftermarket business.","And then ultimately as we move through reliability-based systems and add more technology here, we really start to partner with operators, their maintenance departments, their reliability departments and providing a much more holistic service overall in our aftermarket offering.","Andy Kaplowitz","And then could you just from a more color into what happened with FCD bookings? Did the bookings relatively flash in the quarter, was that all related to general industrial being weakened. We know you mentioned oil price impacting the general industrial business, you mentioned that you expect to see a better North American option in channel given higher oil prices, have you already seen improvement in that end market yet? Have your customers really stopped destocking at this point?","Scott Rowe","Yes. So that was the challenge for FCD and it was - as you know, right, General Industries contains the distribution booking. And so really that was the only negative spot in our FCD bookings was the North American distribution channel.","And so as commodity prices went down in the fourth quarter, distributors stopped stocking in putting more product on their shelf. And I think that that's very natural, it happens all the time and we've got good visibility to their inventory levels. And so we had a little bit of awarding and knew it was coming.","Now what I expect is with oil prices back in a much better place than where we were at the beginning of the year, we should start to see completions in production in North America progress probably sometime late this quarter or in the back half of 2019.","And as that activity increases will see distributors start to spend money and stocking product on their shelves, and where we get the biggest benefit is in that FCD side. And so I feel reasonably good with the FCD bookings overall, but I would say that's probably the biggest risk is when this North American activity start to come back and do - start to put product back on their shelf.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jeff, your line is now open. Can you check to see if you've muted.","Okay. We'll go on to the next one. And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","On the POC disconnect in 1Q the 6 percentage points that you referenced, how does that - how does that play out for the remainder of the year?","Lee Eckert","So, Joe, this is Lee. My expectation as we mentioned is tied to our bookings is that we would see more - the way I would equate to it, we'll see more project revenue. And so during the balance of the year, there should be more project revenue than we have seen in the first quarter, as you can tell from our variances, year-over-year our project revenue was down, we're expecting that to grow the balance of the year.","Joe Ritchie","Yes, I guess maybe my follow-on there Lee, is when you compare it though to your Q2 to Q4 in 2018. Do you still expect to see favorability in percentage completion accounting and how that impacts your margins or does that kind of net out because your project revenues are maybe...","Lee Eckert","I guess I'm not - I wouldn't mold it that way. I think what I would say is that year-over-year we're going to see more project revenue. I'm not - we're not necessarily keeping a scorecard - how much POC. But what I would say is that as we - with our backlog, with our order wins in the first quarter, we're going to more project revenue in the second half of the year.","Joe Ritchie","And then my one follow on is really going back to the margins, obviously, great performance this quarter. I recognize that there will be mix headwinds as we progress through the year on the project side. But like there's still just a lot of like goodness that you have going through the model right now from a margin perspective. And so I guess my question is Lee you mentioned earlier, not to assume sequentially that margins would be better, but it would - it seems like, sequentially through the year, margin should be better in each of the businesses. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything?","Lee Eckert","Yes, I just - I think, there is going to be some lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter. I think on a trailing 12 basis, it would be better. But I think, it depends on how much project activity gets recognized in that quarter. So we have a quarter where there's a large - a number of large projects that go out, it could put some downward pressure on the rate. Now on a trailing 12, the point is that sequentially, you should see improvement, but I think like I said, quarter-to-quarter it could bounce around. It should be better year-over-year, but quarter-to-quarter there could be some lumpiness.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joe Giordano","So just on the guide here, I mean, I know you guys are being very measured in terms of how you're publicly setting commitments and want to be very comfortable in your ability to be able to deliver on them, which I think we all appreciate. If I just think forward from here, with the understanding that 1Q is a low contributor to your full-year. The midpoint of your guidance, is kind of 20% incrementals on the midpoint of your revenue guide, consider and we have very easy comps, like 2Q and 3Q on the old - what's the old IPD. So can you just walk us through kind of, is that just conservatism in a little cushion there or how should we think about incrementals, I mean Europe, obviously a lot on revenue decline in this quarter. So if we are expecting growth in the next nine months, it seems like a fairly easy bar to get to?","Scott Rowe","Yes, Joe, we understand and we've done all the math and we've had a lot of discussion on this. But I just, for us and where we made the decision, is we're still very early in the year. And so we're pleased with what happened in the first quarter and we are focused on meeting our commitments for the rest of the year. But there's still a lot to do, I mean, we've got executed on our transformation, we've got to continue to hold the margins. I mean a lot of things still have to go right for the next three quarters.","And then the other thing, I just want to remind you and others that in December we talked about - at the Investor Day, we talked about the different phases. In the first phase, we were in, which is all of last year was a stabilized phase. And now we are very much in the transformation phase, but the stabilized phase, wasn't that long ago.","And so, we're still concerned about potentially some surprises here and there, but we feel very good that the teams are making great progress, and we very much want to move into our optimized state.","And so you're right now, we're very committed to what we said in our full-year guidance. And then again, the full-year guidance is 17% EPS growth year-over-year. And so it's not a small task, and what I'd say is, when we put guidance out, we want to make sure that we can absolutely meet that commitment, and that's what we're trying to instill internally here at Flowserve, and so that's what we're going to do externally. But we'll continue to reassessment throughout the year, and as things move and change and - but right now, we're sticking with the full-year guidance we put out last call.","Joe Giordano","And then if I can - on the organic growth guide for the year, just considering the price increases that you put in, in December and you put in some new ones this year. How much of that do you think is price alone?","Scott Rowe","Yes, I think, I mean, we're not doing anything crazy on price, right. We're never going to get 5%, 6%, 7% price increase. So I would say, is that really small percentage revenue growth here. But what we are confident is that the price increases that we're seeing is - it's absolutely offsetting inflation tariffs and any cost headwinds. And so we feel very good about that. It's definitely a portion of our margin expansion story here. And I think you could see that as we go forward.","Joe Giordano","If I can just sneak in one last one. Another competitor on the pump side this morning talked about their oil and gas funnel, as kind of, - they've already won a bunch of these orders and like the funnel needs to kind of reshape here. And they're exposed slightly different than you and it seems like there is a bit of different color. So if you can talk about like the oil and gas funnel from here. What's kind of been - has there been a lot of projects that you pass because of the competitiveness that you talked about, and how full that pipeline look on the new projects?","Scott Rowe","Yes. No, we actually feel really good about our oil and gas outlook. And as I said earlier, and as you know, right, we're more of a downstream focused company, and so we're highly focused to the refinery side, and we feel good about the outlook for the next couple of quarters in the refinery segment. A lot of that's driven by regulation changes and move to cleaner fuels. And so that's moving very well.","As we talked about in the Investor Day in December, we launched the strike zone initiative to get back into the midstream space. And so this is midstream pipeline, primarily focused on the Americas, but obviously this pipeline work all over the world. We're seeing incredible progress with the pipeline work.","And so we know we're taking market share, because this is an area that we didn't have any bookings in 2017, and early parts of '18. And so there's still a lot of build out in North America on pipeline and our outlook for the pipeline in the midstream is incredibly robust into Q2, Q3 and Q4.","And then the other big piece here is LNG. And so we got a handful of LNG orders early in the first quarter, and we're actually very pleased with what we were able to bring in. But it's just the beginning of this LNG wave. And so there is a significant amount of LNG projects going forward. And for us, we've got a great valve portfolio that supports the LNG projects. In addition to that, we've got pumps that fit into that space as well.","And so we talked about our power as a pure play initiative, we're bringing our pumps, valves and seals together. The LNG market is one that we're absolutely focused to bring the whole portfolio of Flowserve together to capitalize on that. And so I think you'll see more LNG discussion from us as we go throughout the year into 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","So once again, I echo everyone's sentiment on a solid quarter. I wanted to follow on that discussion with orders and kind of think about, obviously, as we get here into the back half you have some difficult comps, but it sounds like you're really excited about the midstream and pipeline, and the opportunity on the LNG side. How would you kind of characterize the activity level, if you had to put a number around it. I don't know if - should we think about the orders as a two-year stack or how do you think about that profile as we go through the rest of the year here, obviously, knowing that quarterly earnings can bounce around?","Scott Rowe","Sure. Let's just stay on bookings and orders. Again, we feel very good about the outlook. And so, we like what we see. Our project funnel is bigger than it ever has. The concern would be on the MRO and predominantly the North American land business that has slowed down in the first quarter, and it's more about when does that start to recover and get back. But overall, our project outlook is substantially better than where it was last year.","The initiatives with commercial intensity and the ability to capture more on the aftermarket state is we're doing that on the back of some tailwinds on increased maintenance and spending. And so I feel very good about our ability to kind of keep - continue to grow and keeping a healthy number of booking certainly into the second quarter, and realistically throughout all of 2019.","John Walsh","And then maybe just a question here around the pump division. I think when you were first speaking about that combination, a lot of the synergies, we're kind of focused around bookings and kind of sales, obviously a very strong margin in the quarter. Curious if you're actually seeing any cost synergies from the combination as well?","Scott Rowe","Yes. So we talked about this in Investor Day and the genesis is that the reason that we put them together was really focused on our customers and better supporting our customers. And I think we're making tremendous progress on that, and so there are no silos, there's no barriers within the pumps platform now.","We are better positioned to manage the commercial operations, project management, and now we're moving into kind of the manufacturing planning, the supply-chain side, the product rationalization opportunities, and all of those things will start to drive cost - product cost down and improve our productivity within the manufacturing.","So I think there's more good things to come here in terms of driving cost out. We haven't really started that today, and really the focus is been about really getting positive customer response and doing the right things for our customers. And then what I'd say is in the first quarter, we received incredibly positive feedback from a lot of our customers that we've got better communication, clear accountability, and then ultimately better performances is helping there as well. But I do think we will continue - we will get some cost and cost savings as we continue to integrate these two platforms and drive those activities forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Linzey from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Brett Linzey","Just wanted to come back to free cash flow. I guess from your internal vantage point, and maybe relative to plan, what line items came in better than you expected. And then as I think about the $65 million swing in contract assets and I think it's about a $40 million in accrued liabilities, what's the big driver there. Just a little more granularity on those dynamics?","Lee Eckert","So thanks, Brett. So I'm happy to say is that actually nothing came in as a surprise. I think for the first time we kind of actually nailed our cash forecast. So I think everything to Scott's point earlier, I think we are executing where we expected to be between the sales through net, margin and also the working capital. So I would say, nothing really surprised us. I think it came in pretty close - what surprised us is that we came so close, And so that's a good thing.","As far as the contract assets, I think it just shows a change in behavior versus last year versus this year. Last year, the processes were in place. So contract assets are effectively WIP. And material is brought in, now with a disciplined, this year as it was last year. So last year I think even in the call last year we we're really disappointed. We didn't think we had a good handle on what was going on with the inventory, and we learned from that and through the balance of the year we're much more disciplined. Scott added to the organization. He put metrics in place.","We are doing weekly tracking and as we went into this year and we kind of the ended the call - on our last call that we were expecting to have much better control around the first quarter, around amount a material we're bringing in and getting the jobs out and that played out. The team did an outstanding job getting the contracts out and putting the discipline in place to make sure material wasn't coming in.","Brett Linzey","And then just specific to 2019. I mean a quarter little bit more than third of the way through 2Q here under your belt, what's the expectation in terms of free cash flow for this year. Scott, I know you mentioned 20% as an aspirational free cash flow margin over time, but what's the marker for this year as we progress towards that 20%?","Scott Rowe","Let me answer a little different. We got beat up around our free cash flow conversion. I think we we're under 50% last year. And I think Deane is one always beat us up on that, and I think when I was on the call, I talked - question is what - give your target. And I said over 75% and I think that's still good.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We have reached our allotted time. This concludes today's conference.

We appreciate you participating in our conference call today to discuss Flowserve's 2019 second quarter financial results. Joining me this morning are Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer and Lee Eckert, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for questions. And as a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available.","Please also note that our earnings materials do and this call will include non-GAAP measures and contain forward-looking statements.

Flowserve delivered solid second quarter financial results building on the momentum of the first quarter. We continue to make progress on our Flowserve 2.0 transformation journey, and we're seeing good results from each of the different work streams in the program.","Our associates' engagement remains high and they have fully embraced our strategic program to drive growth, lower cost and deliver operational improvement throughout the company. Flowserve 2.0 is becoming the way that we operate our company each and every day.","Let me begin with some highlights of the quarter before turning to our segments and markets in detail. We delivered second quarter revenue growth of 1.7% or 6.2%, excluding currency and divestiture impacts and drove adjusted growth and operating margin improvement of 16 basis points and 200 basis points respectively.","Adjusted EPS of $0.54 increased 32%, both sequentially and year-over-year. Reported EPS of $0.44 included transformation and realignment costs of $0.08 and below the line foreign exchange impact of $0.02. With our solid first half results, including the bookings and backlog growth combined with our expectations to continue to drive further operational and productivity improvements, we increased our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $205 million to $220 million.","Turning now to our segment. FPD's first half performance continued to validate our decision to combine our pump platform and leverage its scale and better serve our customers. FPD's bookings increased 5.7% in the second quarter or 10.8%, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures and are up 14% for the first half of 2019. Operating improvement and leverage drove 230 basis points and 210 basis points improvement in adjusted growth and operating margins respectively.","With the multiyear realignment program now largely complete, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead for this segment. Our legacy IPD facilities continued to show improvement this past quarter, and we are gaining traction on our transformation initiatives and lean implementation at the site level. These efforts are expected to drive further improvement in planning, manufacturing productivity, supply chain and inventory management. FPD delivered a solid quarter with 8.7% bookings growth, including 3.2% of negative currency impact.","Margins were negatively impacted in the quarter due to shipping at higher mix of lower margin project work and a slowdown in short cycle MRO activity. As a result, adjusted growth in operating margins decreased year-over-year by 190 and 110 basis points respectively. However, we fully expect the FCD team will deliver another solid full year performance as we focus on growing our valve platform for the future. I would also like to thank and recognize John Lenander who has led the FCD segment for the past four years. John retired earlier this month and we wish him well in the next chapter of his life.","Turning now to our overall bookings in end markets. Second quarter booking increased 6.5% to $1.1 billion, including sequential growth of 3.6% reaching the highest level in over three years. Excluding the impact of currency and divestitures, second quarter bookings increased 11.1%. The combination of our growth oriented transformation initiatives and improved energy infrastructure investments drove project wins across all our core markets. While we had a few larger awards exceeding $20 million during the quarter, the vast majority of the bookings were smaller in size.","Looking forward, we expect our markets to remain healthy near-term, and we expect another solid quarter of bookings in Q3 as global projects continue to move toward award. However, we do recognize and remain vigilant of the ongoing uncertainty due to geopolitical volatility, global trade disruptions and fluctuation in commodity pricing. Original equipment orders grew nearly 12% over prior year and over 7% sequentially, accounting for 54% of bookings and reaching the highest level since 2015 second quarter. With larger projects beginning to ramp up, we expect the pricing environment to remain highly competitive for this type of work for both pump and valves. However, with improve market visibility, we have been and will remain disciplined in our project pursuits.","We're committed to building a quality backlog while targeting prospects based more on customer relationships, our ability to offer a differentiated solution and where there is a high probability of aftermarket services. We remain optimistic in the progression of this cycle where we're seeing a significant number of new project in L&G, midstream oil and gas and global chemical markets. These projects will provide opportunities to strengthen our install base and ultimately drive aftermarket growth.","As part of the transformation growth initiatives, we are increasing our collaboration across our segments, leveraging the power of the flow control pure play to better support our customers and increase Flowserve's capture of expected large project investment. We launched the concept at the end of last year, and we are pleased with the results that we are seeing in 2019. In fact, in the second quarter, we received a large L&G award that was comprised of valve, pumps, and seals and the associated services that come with it. We are actively pursuing other projects where we can bring the full technology portfolio at Flowserve to better meet our customers' challenges.","Turning to our aftermarket franchise. We continue to roll the rollout of the commercial intensity initiatives in the quarter, driving increased aftermarket capture and producing our fifth consecutive quarter with bookings over $500 million. Our efforts resulted in a constant currency increase of 4.5% versus prior year. We expect that the ongoing implementation of Flowserve 2.0 growth initiatives, coupled with the increased customer spending we see, we'll continue to drive aftermarket growth. As many of our customers have increased their focus on efficiency of their facilities and the upgrades required to meet regulatory challenges.","Now from the served and end market perspective, and starting with our largest market oil and gas. Second quarter bookings increased 22% year-over-year, driven primarily by FPD's 30% growth with FCD's, contributing a 6% increase. Both LNG and midstream pipeline awards represented over 5% each of Flowserve's bookings this quarter. Two of our largest awards in the quarter related to a North American LNG project and a crude oil pipeline award in Texas. Both LNG and midstream pipelines are part of the transformation strike zone initiative where we are seeing tremendous success when we focus the resources and technology available to Flowserve.","Additionally, we continue to benefit from global IMO 2020 investment in refining debottlenecking and efficiency upgrades. Regionally, North America and the Middle East delivered a number of orders in the $5 million to $10 million range across the downstream and upstream markets. North American upstream has recovered modestly since the first quarter slowdown, but it is not back to the levels that we experienced in 2018.","Our chemicals market remained strong in the second quarter, delivering nearly 3% growth, including 3.7% of currency headwind. Growth was driven primarily by smaller projects and run rate investments in FCD's 16% growth, which included an $11 million project award in Europe. We continue to believe that the strong pipeline investment expected in the North America, Asia and the Middle East will present near-term market opportunities, including ethylene crackers and derivative facilities.","Challenges in our power markets continue where second quarter bookings declined 4% year-over-year. We were pleased that FPD received a $20 million award for our concentrated solar power project in the Middle East, which is a growing niche power market for us where we have the differentiating offering for pumps, valves and seals. Overall, we expect industry wide headwinds to continue in traditional power markets for the near-term. We do continue to see opportunities related to fuel switching, new build nuclear in China and competitive fossil fuel development in Asia. We also continue supporting existing nuclear facilities with maintenance, upgrades and life extension, which drove $4 million aftermarket award for us in Asia Pacific this quarter.","Second quarter bookings in general industries declined 13% year-over-year, including nearly 3% of currency headwind. FCD's 5% increase was more than offset by FPD's 19% decrease, primarily due to lower distribution activity that was negatively impacted by oil price volatility and higher levels of inventory at our partner locations.","General industry bookings also included increased pump and paper activity, while mining, food and beverage and agriculture declined. Although, combined these markets currently represent less than 5% of our overall bookings. Lastly, representing our smallest market, water bookings increased 12% in the second quarter, including small project awards in North America and Europe.","Turning to total bookings by geography, we delivered 49% growth in the Middle East and African markets. We're seeing a significant increase in project activity. We also grew 11% in Asia Pacific and 2% in North America. This growth was partially offset by 11% decline in Europe and 4% decrease in Latin America.","I'll now turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results in greater detail. And then I'll return for closing remarks before we open the call up to questions and answers. Lee?","Lee Eckert","Thanks, Scott and good morning everyone. As previously mentioned, we are pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, in line with our expectations and keeping us on pace to deliver another year of substantial adjusted EPS growth.","On a reported basis, second quarter EPS was $0.44, which included $0.08 of realignment and transformation charges and $0.02 of negative below the line currency impact. For the first six months of 2019, our adjusted EPS of $0.95 is 40% above the prior year. In addition, our reported EPS was approximately 93% of our adjusted EPS, a meaningful improvement from 32% last year as we continue to improve Flowserve's quality of earnings to reduce realignment and transformation expense.","Second quarter revenues were $990 million, an increase of 1.7% versus prior year and up 11.2% sequentially, in line with normal seasonality. On a constant currency basis and excluding the divestiture headwinds, organic revenues grew over 6% year-over-year. Second quarter aftermarket sales increased 2% or 5.4% on a constant currency basis to $498 million, or 50% of our sales mix similar to prior year.","Turning to our margins. Second quarter adjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 32.5%, driven by FCD's 230 basis points improvement to 33.6%, which included continual operational improvement, cost control and leverage from our pumps combination. Partially offsetting FPD's strong performance was 190 basis point decline in FCD's adjusted gross margin to 31.4%, primarily due to higher sales mix of lower margin project work, as well as lower percentage of MRO and aftermarket sales. Reported gross margin increased 270 basis points to 32.1% on improved operational execution, decreased realignment items and the impact of 2018's loss on an asset sale.","Second quarter adjusted SG&A declined $7.6 million to approximately $240 million. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A decreased 110 basis points to 21.6% as a result of focused cost control and modest revenue growth leverage. On a reported basis, second quarter SG&A decreased $17 million, including approximately $10 million reduction in adjusted items versus prior year. With our solid adjusted gross margin improvement, as well as ongoing tight cost control, we drove a 200 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin to 11.3%.","FPD's 12.1% adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points year-over-year, which was partially offset by FCD's 110 basis point decrease. Although, FCD still delivered a respectable adjusted operating margin of 14.6%. Reported operating margin increased 510 basis points, which benefited from continued operational improvements, as well as approximately $30 million net reduction in adjusted items. Our adjusted tax rate was 26%, at the low end of our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 26% to 28%.","Turning to cash. First half operating cash flows increased $100 million versus prior year, including earnings growth and approximately $80 million improvement in working capital, which drove our cash balance to approximately $600 million, or roughly $80 million higher than last year's second quarter balance. Additionally, primary working capital as a percentage of sales declined 150 basis points to 28.5%. While we made some early progress on working capital, we still need to continue to drive improvements in our inventory and order cash processes until they are sustainable, systemic and embedded into our operating cadence.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter are approximately $15 million. We also returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends and repaid $15 million of long-term debt. In July of this year, Flowserve entered into a new $800 million five year senior credit facility, replacing the one that has supported us since 2012. Our new facility will provide Flowserve with the liquidity and flexibility to support the company over the coming years. We are very pleased with the outcome of the new agreement, and want to thank our banking partners for their support and ongoing strong relationship.","Turning for our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong first half results and expectations for the second half of the year, we increased our full year adjusted EPS target range between $2.05 and $2.20 per share. The adjusted EPS target range excludes the expected 2019 realignment and transformation expense of approximately $50 million, as well as below-the-line foreign currency effect and the impact of other discrete items, which may occur during the year.","As a result, we also increased our reported EPS range between $1.75 and $1.90 per share. Essentially, we expect this year's reported EPS to equal or exceed the adjusted EPS we delivered in 2018. We also tightened our expected revenue growth to 4% to 5% from the prior range of 4% to 6% due to continuing strong U.S. dollar where we now expect full year currency headwinds of 2% versus prior expectation of 1.5%.","We also faced an additional revenue headwind of roughly 0.5% from last year's business divestitures. However, our total organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of FX and last year's divestitures, remains at high-end of our original range now narrow to 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year 2019. As I indicated last quarter, our revenue growth of the year will see a higher percentage of sales from larger projects, original equipment work as the growth in our short cycle MRO business has decelerated in recently months.","Net interest expense for the full year is expected to be between $55 million and $57 million with an adjusted tax rate of 26% to 28%. From a 2019 full year cash interest perspective, we expect to return approximately $100 million through dividends to our shareholders. Capital expenditures expected in the $90 million to $100 million. We also continue to reduce our long-term debt within our credit facility during the remainder of the year. And we expect it to contribute approximately $20 million to our global pension plan, mainly to cover our ongoing service costs as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.","Let me now turn it back to Scott for his closing remarks.","Scott Rowe","Great, thank you, Lee. As I wrap up, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our outlook and the progress of our transformational efforts. We are well into the Flowserve 2.0 transformation program that commenced in early 2018. I am very pleased with the momentum that we are building on the multiyear journey to drive the cultural and operational improvements necessary to better serve our customers, our employees and our shareholders.","Over the last two months, I've spent significant time meeting with our associates and leaders from around the globe. I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we are making and their willingness to take on the challenges of this transformation. They are informed, engaged and empowered to drive the changes at all levels of Flowserve.","The engagement level of our workforce has improved dramatically in the past two years, and the overall health of Flowserve is significantly better than where it was in the past. We're spending a lot of time investing in our leaders and creating a performance based closer. Today, our transformational program is largely internally led, and is being executed by our frontline leaders from around the globe. We are encouraged by the results that we are starting to deliver in the areas of our business, including strong bookings and backlog growth, consistent margin improvement, increased manufacturing productivity, reduced working capital and lower path to backlog. Even more encouraging, there is still significant opportunity ahead for Flowserve.","Much work remains on the path to our 2022 targets that we presented last year, but we are instilling the culture, developing the processes and changing the operational model to create sustainable long-term value. As we approach the middle innings of our transformation, I am confident that we'll build on the momentum that we have created and continue to drive further improvements at Flowserve.","Operator, we have now concluded our prepared comments. And we'd like to open the call for questions. Paulette?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Scott, can you step back and talk about the cycle as you see it. You have been recorded $1.1 billion in bookings since early 2015, but yet many of your peers have been talking about project delays and so we have seen a short cycle slowdown that you're feeling in your general industrial business. So can you give us some perspective on the booking cycle as Flowserve sees it? Do you think there's good enough pipeline out there that you could sustain or grow from this level of bookings for the next few quarters? And how much on a higher level of bookings is actually coming or could come from self help with the initiatives that you have for the strike zone and commercial intensity?","Scott Rowe","So our project outlook still remains really positive, and so I've talked about that now for probably two quarters. We still feel very good about the health of the project pipeline and the project portfolio. The LNG markets are robust. And I'd say that's got at least another year or two of activity, our midstream oil and gas markets are very active and we've had some great awards this quarter. And we expect further awards here in the next 12 months there. And in petrochemical is strong as well.","And so I think from a project standpoint, we're still seeing a lot of activity and we expect project work in the second half of the year to be pretty robust for us. The concern and its very similar to what I talked about at the end of the first quarter would be more of that North American MRO business. And so this is primarily the distribution network that services some of the -- more the upstream markets, but also some of the midstream, and that's where we're seeing a slowdown. And you can see that in our general industries category where our bookings were down 12% year-over-year.","But I'd say that's where we are putting the most focus on transformation. So our commercial intensity is meant to attack and really address that MRO type business. And I would say that we are trying to offset the negative market sentiment there with the internal actions. But overall, I feel reasonably positive with the markets. And again, I think the projects will continue here for at least another year and our outlook for Q3 and Q4 remains solid.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And just on following up on that. Scott, can you give us more color into your margin progression in FCD? You mentioned short cycle slowdown impacting margin segment. But you just said general industrial business was week last quarter also. So what changed this quarter and should we still see FCD on a generally upward margin trajectory for the second half of '19?","Scott Rowe","I would say, certainly, we never want to go backwards in margins. And for the first time, FCD took a big step back. It's really being impacted by the mix within our OE business and that's the slower MRO work that comes through the North American distribution. And so it's not shown in after work, it is more in that OE side. And the OE is pivoted to project. And the differential in margins between projects and MRO is pretty significant.","And so we've looked at it in a great detail. We know which product it is which facilities. And unfortunately, with North American distribution, there was just a lot of products on the shelf from a lot of activity last year and that inventories got to bleed off over the next quarter or two before we start to see active bookings there. I don't expect that situation to get worse. But I also don't expect significant improvement to probably 2020 as the inventory levels start to get down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Scott, I would love to follow-up on Andy's questions and this whole industrial short cycle pressure is been happening to everyone. So there's no surprise that it manifested your business. And you gave really good color in terms of what you're seeing and the expectations for the channel. What might be helpful is how did it progressed during the quarter, and then any commentary about July? And if I could start there, thanks.","Scott Rowe","Sure. I'd say it progressed not as well as we would have expected in Q2. We knew we had a concern with the bookings in Q1. And then I'd say in Q2, it did not improved at rate that we were expecting. I don't want to give any color on July or the third quarter yet. But what would I say is our guidance has this level of activity in it for the back half of the year. And so that's already baked in and we don't have any uplift in that guidance.","So I would say as the North American markets start to improve, which I think we saw a little bit of improvement in June. If they continue to move forward in the back half of the year then we start to move up from where we are. I'd say the other thing I'd just add is just this is -- it's something that's happening to everybody. As you said, it's that short cycle industrial and it's the North American upstream business that's pulled back now since December.","It won't stay down forever. There's a lot of activity that has to happen. There's things that are going to have to move forward with. And so it comes back and it's just more a question of timing. And for us probably the biggest single thing is just inventory on the distributor shelf. And so we did good visibility with our partners and their inventory levels. And as we start to see that come down, our bookings will increase here and we'll start to generate revenue pretty quickly, because it's very short cycle work. ","Deane Dray","And given that bookings were one of the positives here in your results, I'd love to hear more color on this large LNG project, because it does sound like the perfect win here. You had pumps, valves, seals and services. So, what was different about the selling proposition for this win versus what Flowserve 1.0 was doing? Is it maybe a little bit on pricing? And what does it say for a project like this about the aftermarket opportunity?","Scott Rowe","So, unfortunately, I can't speak to the details because our customers haven't allowed us to do that yet. And hopefully, we'll get a press release out on this shortly. But what I would say is it's absolutely flagship award for Flowserve. And it's the first time where really we put the efforts of strike zone across all of our products in the whole portfolio to bare. And what we saw is when we do that early in the process, so pre-FID and in the concept phase.","And we can start to partner with our customers about how we can bring better efficiencies in the pump; the right isolation in flow of control with our valve; making sure we have the proper barrier and safety with our seals business; and then assuring them that our aftermarket will be present and help them with reliability and uptime. When we do all that and when we do that early then we can have incredible opportunities to get a bigger share of these projects, and then a bigger share of partnering with them throughout start up, commissioning and through the operations.","And so we're super excited. It's definitely a flagship award. It exemplifies what we've been talking about on power of the pure play. And it also just validates the efforts in the transformation office. And so like we've talked about on the midstream pipeline, LNG is also a strike zone market for us. And so this is one we've been focusing on. We've been making sure that we have the right portfolio. We've been enhancing our technology to better the serve the market. And this is just a great win for us in a pretty big and growing market.","Deane Dray","So congrats for the team on that one, and just a clarification and then last one for me is. Could you explain in a bit more detail the aftermarket discussion that you have? You hinted at it that there is some assurances that you'll be participating in the aftermarket. Is that a formal process? Is there -- -how does it defer from project-to-project in terms of how realistic the aftermarket opportunity is?","Q - Deane Dray","So ideally we would love to sign, like on a Greenfield facility. Ideally, we would love to sign the long-term lifecycle agreement while we're in the process of negotiating the frontend valve. We haven't done this on this award. But what I'd say is I've got about 90% confidence rate that we will get the long-term service agreement for pumps, valves and field here. And just it's because we've got -- we'll have the install base and all the original equipment. We are taking up the installation and commissioning work, and so we will get aftermarket on that. But I highly anticipate that we will have a long annuity on the aftermarket sides on both pumps and services in this facility.","Operator","Out next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Adam Farley","Good morning. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. So you sound pretty confident in this late cycle project work. Could you just provide a little bit more color along the lines of the late cycle projects? We have heard from some companies that projects are starting to slip to the right, really there is a little bit of a pause given the macro uncertainty. I mean are you seeing this anywhere in any end markets?","Scott Rowe","So I think we're always concerned. And there is a lot of negativity in the back drop. But I'd say for us in Q3 and Q4, the project work should absolutely continue. And so these are projects that are already through FID or nearing FID. And I would say the Middle East is incredibly active, North America is active and Asia Pacific is active. And so we feel really good about our Q3 bookings. We feel pretty good about Q4. And I would say as we get further out and the confidence starts to go down. Certainly, the back drop with oil and some of the other commodity pricing provides concern here, and will potentially delay some of the larger awards. But I think overall, for us we have got reasonable visibility in the projects in Q3 and into Q4.","Adam Farley","And then just turning to free cash flow and working capital, you've made some improvements there. Maybe just provide a little more color on how you view working capital performance and maybe where are you in terms of implementing structural processes and technology into working capital management.","Scott Rowe","Yes, I'll start and then I'll let Lee do some details on the receivable side, and may be inventory. But this is an area that we've been focused on since I've been here. What I would say is I am very pleased with the progress we made. I'm also a little frustrated that it's taking this long to get to where we are. I think from the systemic standpoint that we're putting the process in place certainly on inventory and inventory planning that will sustain this momentum and continue to move inventory down even further. In fact, feel really good about that.","On the receivable side, Lee is leading that and we're seeing good progress there. What I would say, both at inventory receivables, is just the fragmented nature of Flowserve and just the disparate locations that we have has made this incredibly challenging. But we're starting to make good progress and our leaders very much understand the importance of driving working capital. And I'm very pleased to start to see the movement here on the year-over-year numbers.","Lee Eckert","I think the key thing that Scott ended with was awareness. I recently spent time in India at three of our facilities, and they are talking about receivable improvement and they're talking about inventory improvement and that didn't exist a few years ago. So awareness is, I'd say very high across the company, which was a start. One of the major strategies we have at Flowserve is try to consolidate our collections work. I'd say beginning of the year we have roughly about 30% of our collections work at our shared service operation.","Our goal is to get around 60% of the year. By doing that, we got a lot more transparency and insight of what's growing on in our receivable performance and what's wrong with our customers. We also buildup tools to get better insight across looking at our invoices and understanding what is pass due and which ones are not been being paid, and are in process of building a much better power BI tools around understanding what is late, providing that information for our sales organizations, which we didn't have in the past say.","Let's say, now here are the customers that are delinquent or have issues with us that are preventing them from paying. So we're solely building up the process. But the awareness is clearly there. We're trying to catch up with the tools and the ownership. And as we shift our collections with the shared services, we expect to also improve that performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","I guess just a question around pricing. You've been talking about positive momentum on the aftermarket side the last couple of quarters. One of your European competitors actually mentioned some capacity tightening. So just wanted to get your view on the pricing landscape, and your view is on if we're actually starting to see industry capacity tighten a little bit?","Scott Rowe","So, it's really not a lot of different than my commentary in Q1. And so we had our pricing very early in the year. So we actually started in December and we did a second price increase late Q1. And so for the work that is a priceless work, so that would be our MRO, valves, our spare parts, some of our services and service contracts and then some of the smaller pump, very confident that we're ahead of that price cost curve, and that we're doing really well. Unfortunately, a lot of that through that distribution channel, which we talked about that is now off and lower than we expected. So if that's comes back then we start to see more margin and mix on the higher prices side.","What I'd say is I am very happy to hear our peers starting to talk about price, that's the first time I've seen that since I've been talking about now for three quarters. And what I'd say is we're starting to see a little progress on pricing for our bigger projects, but they still remain highly competitive. And so, I do believe though as capacity begins to feel across the peer group in both pumps and valves, I think we're going to see more people get more disciplined in that project pricing. But honestly in Q2, I think it was still pretty competitive on the larger projects. And so for whatever reason, the bigger the project, the more excited people get and more discounts seem to be provided. And so that's an area of concern.","What I would say is we're incredibly focused on our pricing. It's part of our commercialization work stream. And it's an area of intense focus. And so we'll remain very selective on our project. And we're going to make sure that they provide the margins that Flowserve and our shareholders deserve. And we'll continue to focus on this as we move through the back half of the year, or through the transformational work stream.","John Walsh","And then maybe a follow on for Lee around free cash flow. Last couple of quarters, you've been talking about this 75% loss conversation. Is that still the right bogie? And anything to call out in terms of cadence in the back half?","Lee Eckert","So just to remind everybody. So free cash flow in the first half of the year was $24 million, which was up a $113 million versus prior year. Improving working capital, quality of earnings, free cash flow conversion is the high priority for the business. Now, as I mentioned on the last call, we had really strong first quarter cash flow but a benefit from some accrual timing that reversed out in the second quarter. But we were really pleased with $113 million improvement in the first half of the year. And we've got really good line of sight at 75% conversion.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joe Giordano","I just want to clarify something you said on the FCD margin. You said like you're not expecting an improvement until 2020 and some of the distribution freeze up a little. But are you talking like from 2Q or are we talking year-on-year? Because obviously that's a business that dropped materially in the second half typically, and if we look at last year back half something like high 18s, lows 19s. So how should we think about second half in that business year-on-year?","Scott Rowe","So from the second quarter gross margins, we don't expect gross margins to go down from where we are right now. And so -- add the progression there really depends on how North America responds and if we're able to get more products through our distribution in that general industries category. And so right now we feel reasonably good that it stepped up in Q3 and Q4. But I think it is dependent on the activity that we see in North America.","Joe Giordano","And then the corporate line was one that was brought up by a couple of people, it's being pretty light in the quarter. Is that just timing or is that step-up to compensate in the back half? Or how should we think about that?","Lee Eckert","So as I -- in my prepared remarks, we are focused on driving SG&A down as a percentage of sales year-over-year. That corporate line that you see is really reflects the unallocated corporate cost. As I mentioned on previous calls, it's about $100 million of cost that's unallocated. They represent legal costs, some board costs and CEO costs. And that number does bounce around from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, we expect it to be roughly around $100 million for the year.","Joe Giordano","And then one maybe more higher level on the business. For LNG, I know we've talked in the past the leverage you have to that has historically been lower than something like a refinery, I guess certain product categories like valve, pumps and stuff like that that you don't have. Is there a ways for you given how you're having some success here at the market that seems to be doing pretty well? Is there a ways for you to raise your content on some of these projects?","Scott Rowe","Sure. I think through the power of the pure play that's absolutely how we raise the content. And so if we can get valves hold in and get seals locked in then we're doing good things there. The other thing is just expanding the portfolio through our R&D and new product development. And so the LNG focus is within our new product development, and we continue to add more cryogenic products, both on the pump side and the valve side to make sure that we've got a bigger entitlement on each of the LNG trains.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Walter Liptak","I wanted to ask an LNG question too. And it's good that you've got some LNG projects that are moving forward. And I wonder if you could maybe give us some insight onto your win rates, because there have been small number of projects that have moved forward. How do you think about the market share on those wins? And then the second half of the question is, there is a bunch of projects that look like they could go FID and provide visibility into 2020. And have you done the value added selling or the pre-FID selling on those LNG projects too?","Scott Rowe","I don't want to get into specific win rates on a category. But what I'd say is we have been doing reasonably well with LNG, but it's been a little bit under the radar, because we're getting around $10 million of awards. And we would get a pump award or just a valve award in that $8 million to $10 million range. And so we have been reasonably successful thus far. This quarter was the first time we've been able to really bring all of the assets and technology that Flowserve has together into a single award. And so that was roughly $30 million for us, and again a flagship award to talk about on power of the pure play.","We are engaged in other of those type of discussion, but they're way upfront in that concept base. And at this point, I'd be reticent to commit when do we see another one of these type of award. But -- just because we don't know the timing for sure. But of the things that we're trying to do is to get more involved with operators, and our customers and licensors and really make sure that our technology is part of that package and part of the solution for providing a better service to our customers in the long run.","Walter Liptak","And then I guess just switching gears to the pipelines, the midstream. And is that what you were talking about in the third quarter, fourth quarter, you've got visibility but 2020, you're not so sure, because I think some of the pipeline spending comes to an end in the back half of this year? Do you have any visibility into 2020?","Scott Rowe","Let me just, I'll talk a little bit about Q2 and then I can go into the back half of the year. We received a really nice award here in North America on a crude oil pipeline. We're very excited about it. It's a big number for us. And it's a flagship award to really get us back into the interstate of the large pipeline work. So thus far, we launched this initiative about a year ago and we've booked $120 million over the last 12 months in midstream pipeline.","We believe the outlook for the remainder of the year is reasonably healthy. We don't have another incredibly large award in the $20 million to $25 million range, but we've got a lot of activity in the $5 million to $10 million range. And our outlook for Q3 and Q4 remains robust in midstream. I do believe that starts to slowdown in 2020. But certainly, for the few quarters, we feel good about midstream and pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Linzey from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Brett Linzey","Just want to come back to the sales guide, you mentioned some of the uncertainty from a micro standpoint, the weaker upstream and some of the de-stock, but you're holding the organic guide here. I guess in terms of that big ramp up in the back half. Is it -- just confident around backlog and deliverables? And I guess if so, what percent of backlog do you need to ship in the second half to hit the plan?","Scott Rowe","Yes, I'll let Lee walk through our revenue guidance here in the back half.","Lee Eckert","So just to answer your question directly, we're now expecting around between 60% and 65% of our backlog to convert. Our backlog is up 14% since year end and it's actually up 18% year-over-year. So based on what we've got line of sight, I would expect roughly between 60% and 65%. And then basically the book and burn is the balance and right now, it's pretty much flat year-over-year. So we feel good about our revenue guidance. If we can -- we should be able to convert the backlog and give the same amount of book and burn that we've had historically.","Brett Linzey","And then just thinking about the Q3 to Q4 progression, from a growth standpoint but also margins. Anything to be aware of from a modeling standpoint and the way OE versus aftermarket mix hits both those quarters?","Lee Eckert","Sure. I'm glad you brought that up. So just to remind everybody, we remain highly focusing on expanding our margins. Driving year-over-year margin expansion is important to us in order to drive shareholder value. We've seen great progress over the last five quarters. Four out of six of our Flowserve 2.0 initiatives are around margin expansion. Our growth initiatives that we talk -- that Scott talked about has resulted in OE bookings being up 17% in the first half, and our backlog and OE being up 20% year-over-year.","So as I discussed in the first quarter call and discussed in my prepared remarks, we expect the sales mix for the rest of the half year to shift towards the OE in the project work with the strong bookings that we have. And so as a result of that we're going to see an increase in OE sales, which is going to help to drive earnings and obviously build our installed base. But there will be some downward pressure on margins versus what we've seen say in the first quarter where we had a heavy aftermarket mix.","Brett Linzey","And is that a Q3 comment or just the back half as a whole?","Lee Eckert","I would say it's the back half.","Brett Linzey","And then just one quick follow up. Could you just put a finer point on what the size and scope of the large projects were in the quarter? I think you mentioned a fewer in the $20 million range. Could you just quantify that and then just any visibility on the timing of when those led out?","Scott Rowe","LNG award was right at $30 million, our big midstream pipeline award was above $20 million and then we had a nice concentrated solar power award in the Middle East that was around $20 million as well. So that's when we talk about large projects, so that's the size that we like. And we can bring our technology and get the margin that we deserve in that range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Fisher","I just wanted to follow up on your recent comment there a couple questions ago about the midstream. Where you said there is lots of activity, I think in the $10 million to $15 million range after this big $20 million to $25 million range, but they you said that would slowdown in 2020. What tells you that that will slow down on the smaller side in 2020? Is it your customers are already telling you this, or is it just assumption that, hey, it's going really going well this year, it's bound to slowdown?","Scott Rowe","Yes, that's a great point, because I probably didn't answer that as well as I should. The reason I think it slows down a bit is just we don't have visibility beyond this year on the pipeline work. And so typically, this is a little bit shorter cycle type work, and it gets built pretty fast. And we can ship within 12 months. And so for us, we have got visibility in Q3 and Q4. Our midstream work is all again that $10 million to $15 million work and we believe we will get our share of that. We just don't have great visibility to 2020. So when you look -- when you step back and look at the macro though, there still needs to be pipeline build out certainly in North America and in other parts of the world.","And so I would expect international opportunities to start to come through in 2020, and probably some other big ones in 2020 that we just don't have visibility to right now. So I don't think -- I don't necessarily believe midstream comes down dramatically in 2020. We just don't have a lot of visibility right now in what we're chasing in and looking at in talking to our customers.","Steven Fisher","And then is there any connection on the MRO piece in North America tied to oil and gas directly or indirectly? And so is there any assumption that that would have to pick up in the fourth quarter to get your FCD margin back up?","Scott Rowe","Our distribution channel is largely oil and gas. Now there is others that -- there is refining, petrochemical and others, but a big portion of that is the oil and gas markets. And so we need oil and gas to pick up in the back half of the year, the more on the upstream side. And as that happens, we start to move up in our bookings and certainly in our revenue because it's such a short cycle business there.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche. Mr. Roueche, you may begin.","John E. Roueche","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in our call today to discuss Flowserve Corporation's financial results for the first quarter of 2014, which we published yesterday afternoon through our press release and Form 10-Q filing.","Joining me on the call this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Taff, Chief Financial Officer.; and Mike Mullin, our Director of Investor Relations.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the call to your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. Before turning the call over to Mark, I would like to remind you that this event is being webcast and an earnings slide presentation is available, both of which are accessible through our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","An audio replay will also be available on our website approximately 2 hours following the conclusion of this call. Both the audio replay and the slide presentation will remain on our website for a period of time over the next few weeks.","Finally, please note that this call and the associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements that are based upon forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of April 23, 2014. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control.","Therefore, we encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's press release, slide presentation and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-Q filing for the period ending March 31, 2014. All of these documents are accessible on our website under the Investor Relations section.","Finally, please note, except to the extent required by applicable law, Flowserve undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of today's forward-looking statements.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Mark A. Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our operating and financial performance in the first quarter. We met our expectations for the 3-month period, which provides confidence in our 2014 guidance. I appreciate the commitment and dedication of our employees. They have continued to embrace our performance culture initiatives while increasing their focus on exceeding our customers' requirements. These efforts, evidenced by our notable operational improvements, enhance Flowserve's ability to capture the expected growth provided by accelerating market demands and aftermarket opportunities.","EPS of $0.78 increased over 16% versus last year's first quarter. While Mike will discuss the details of our financials in a moment, I would simply add that our core business delivered and is demonstrating the improvements in our operating platform necessary to support anticipated revenue growth.","Bookings of $1.2 billion increased slightly over last year, driven by strong aftermarket growth of over 8%. Aftermarket bookings of $517 million were at a record level for the period and highlight the success of our ongoing commitment to end-user strategies and supporting our customers.","Our original equipment bookings were again driven by the recurring short cycle run rate business, which continues to provide a solid foundation of profitable work. Although we bid on a few larger projects during the quarter, these initial opportunities were competitive as expected.","We remain disciplined and selective and continue to believe our shareholders will be rewarded by this approach over the cycle. With the anticipated ramp-up of energy-related projects, particularly in the Gulf Coast, we believe there is ample opportunity for near-term bookings and revenue growth on the horizon.","Additionally, I would like to highlight the IPD segment. Over the past few years, it has delivered on its commitment to improve the operating platform and is now shifting focus towards higher growth. As evidence of this progress, IPD's bookings grew over 10% year-over-year, demonstrating its operational progress and customers' increasing confidence in its capabilities.","These solid bookings produced a quarter-end backlog of $2.7 billion, level with a year ago, but significantly improved in terms of quality and past due levels. Compared to year end, backlog is up over $130 million or 5.2%.","Despite traditional seasonality, Flowserve again demonstrated the strong leverage that exists in the business, driven primarily by improving execution, as well as focused cost control and modest aftermarket mix shift.","Gross margins improved across all segments, including an impressive 280 basis point increase in FCD. Last month, we dedicated significant time during our Analyst Day highlighting the operational improvements that we have implemented over the last few years. This quarter, strong gross and operating margins are a direct result of these initiatives. However, I want to emphasize again that significant propensity remains to further enhance our business. And even as we prioritize increased growth, we will continue to focus on the customer and improving key metrics.","Turning to our end markets. Several project owners have made final investment decisions on large infrastructure investments over the last few quarters, which is encouraging. A number of these energy-related projects have already been awarded to EMCs, and we are currently bidding on many of them. Our visibility into the progression of similar projects as a move towards final investment decision provides us additional confidence in an improving cycle.","By region, North America shale production continues to support investment in chemical and oil and gas projects. Ongoing efficiency investments in Europe's infrastructure drove modest growth over the last year. We continue to pursue opportunities in Asia Pacific and aim to further increase our presence and market penetration in that region to support growth.","Middle East investment is expected to continue as they look to capture more the value in downstream products, although it remains the most competitive market. And while political and financial instability in Latin America pose some challenges, their efforts to increase production should provide opportunities over the coming years, assuming these issues can be managed.","In addition to expected near-term organic growth in our core end markets, we also continue to target technology, product and geographic additions through strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Our disciplined approach towards these opportunities requires rates of return that add value for our shareholders.","Likewise, we take the same disciplined approach when evaluating our existing portfolio. If an asset is not performing to the level we expect, serving a key market or providing the appropriate growth opportunities, we will either take the necessary actions to correct it or divest the business if another party values it more highly.","Our recent divestiture of Naval, a noncore district heating valve asset, is a good example of this approach in action, as we regularly evaluate our assets based on rates of return and strategic fit to drive value for our shareholders.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2014, I am confident that our actions over the last few years have significantly improved our operations and ability to support customer's requirements. As a result, Flowserve is now well positioned to take advantage of the growing energy markets we see ahead.","So with that overview, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results have us well positioned to deliver on our full year 2014 targets. As we have discussed and detailed late, there remains substantial opportunity within the business, and we continue to focus on improving our operations.","Our goal is to better align our processes with our customers' expectations, as we prepare for the improving growth expected in our key energy markets. These customer focused initiatives include: Continued localization, strategic initiatives to drive enhanced customer focus, raising the bar on our performance culture and building the project management expertise that complement our strong product manufacturing culture and processes. All of these efforts should enhance our flexibility and enable Flowserve to adjust to the changes in our markets and customer requirements.","The first quarter results again demonstrated the projects we have driven within the 4 walls of Flowserve. Despite lower revenues, we increased gross margins and delivered solid flow-through. Our improving execution and operational metrics, combined with disciplined cost control and leverage, resulted in strong gross margin performance in each segment. In particular, SEB's notable 280 basis point improvement was impressive and included a favorable mix of product shipments to the power and oil and gas markets.","IPD continued its steady operating improvement and is achieving progress toward this targeted 14% to 15% operating margin goal by the end of next year. The improvement in this segment has increased our ability to meet customer expectations and their lead times, which drove a strong 15% increase in the original equipment bookings and prepares it for expected accelerated growth.","EPD delivered a 6.3% bookings increase on a constant currency basis, driven by strong aftermarket bookings from increased activity in the Gulf Coast and Europe. As many of you know, this segment has the greatest exposure to the larger project activity that we anticipate to build as the year progresses. As we have discussed previously, these initial larger projects are competitive in both price and terms, and we have experienced these conditions on recent Middle East projects.","However, we maintained and we'll continue to pursue our disciplined approach. We will focus the customer on the benefits of our key differentiators, including our technical capabilities, on-time delivery performance, the total cost of ownership and our localized presence. This approach will continue to support the quality of our backlog.","Summarizing our end markets. Oil and gas remain solid, considering current oil prices and the positive long-term outlook. These factors support major investments. We expect new refining investments in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, but somewhat at the expense of European refining capacity.","North America continues its strong growth in pipeline construction, refinery upgrades, gas processing, oil sands development and gas-to-liquid plants to capitalize on advantaged natural gas and oil supplies. Additionally, continued opportunities exist in liquefied natural gas facilities, particularly in the U.S. Longer term, opportunities in Mexico should increase following the recent policy reform intended to increase production levels.","From an aftermarket standpoint, maintenance activity has increased in the Gulf Coast and Europe as expected, from the lower levels we have faced since the second half of 2012. We are also beginning to see aftermarket benefits from the Yanbu project booked several years ago in a very competitive market.","The chemical market also remains strong and the outlook is very positive, as new capacity investments in North America continue to advance. The first quarter included equipment awards for the first ethylene project in the Gulf Coast. Announced North American shale gas related investments are impressive, valued at over $70 billion. And the majority of this capacity is destined for ethylene and ethylene-derivative projects, considering the U.S. has now joined the Middle East as a low-cost feedstock leader. In the Middle East, their efforts towards downstream diversification continue, while Asia and Latin America, we assess the chemical development plans based on competing opportunities in the U.S.","Moving to the power market. We expect growth. China, India and Russia continue to pursue fossil-based projects. The Middle East also sees growth, both in conventional and solar power. North America and Europe, however, remains slower, due largely to conservation, the lack of a consistent energy policy and modest energy demand drivers. However, the low price of natural gas should drive the U.S. combined cycle market.","Nuclear power remains in transition, but we see continued development in China, Russia and South Korea and discussions of new capacity in some regions of Europe. Japan is even considering restarting up to 1\/3 of its idle capacity.","Finally, natural gas combined cycle plants are a global opportunity, although U.S. expansion could be impacted somewhat by pipeline constraints. Our general industries markets faced challenges in the first quarter, as mining companies cautiously evaluate the projects based on concerns of oversupply. Global fertilizer projects remained on track; and our distribution business, primarily valves, continued to produce solid levels in the first quarter, driven by the oil and gas markets.","Wrapping up, we have delivered significant progress in our operating profile. And while we will continue to drive further operational improvements, our focus is on growth and building on a culture of performance that consistently delivers results.","However, I am also confident that the propensity remains for ongoing operational improvement, improving our flexibility, pulling various operating and growth levers and increasing our ability to react quickly to opportunities across our broad product, geographic and industry exposure, will continue to position Flowserve as the value-added supplier of choice.","With that overview, let me now turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. With our operational overview and business outlook well covered, let me discuss in greater detail our financial results for the quarter.","We began 2014 with a strong operational performance and are well positioned to deliver on our guidance for the year. First quarter EPS increased 16.4% to $0.78. Included in EPS is $0.03 per share of net benefits. As we discussed in the press release, this amount is comprised of a $0.05 gain on the sale of our Naval district heating valve business, partially offset by combined $0.02 of realignment charges and below the line currency expense.","Excluding these items and the $0.03 per share net benefit from discrete items in 2013, EPS increased 17.2% year-over-year. As expected, the first quarter reflected typical seasonality, with revenues down 2.6% or 1.3% on a constant currency basis. Even so, we delivered improved gross margins across each segment through strong execution, a higher quality of revenue, continued emphasis on low-cost sourcing and a 1% mix shift towards aftermarket.","Turning to SG&A. Our results demonstrated focused cost control. As reported, SG&A as a percentage of sales was down 120 basis points. 2 items skewed our results, including the $12.6 million net gain on the sale of a business in 2014 and $1.7 million of joint venture transaction fees in 2013. Adjusting for these items, SG&A expense declined $4 million year-over-year.","As we have indicated, our longer-term goal is to achieve full year recurring SG&A as a percentage of sales to be consistently in the 18% range. We've made substantial progress over the last few years and opportunities clearly remain. Progress will ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, since even as we lower cost in some areas, we're also making strategic investments in others to improve our platform.","For instance, over the last year or so, we've invested in quality and project management programs and personnel, increased research and development spend and reorganized our global sales organization. To be sure, our end goal is not only focused on dollars spent, but also increasing our capabilities, efficiency and productivity. We will continue to further optimize SG&A in this manner over the next few years.","On a reported basis, operating margins were down 10 basis points to 15.4%. However, excluding the discrete items we previously discussed, operating margins increased 120 basis points year-over-year to 14.3%. Below the line, foreign currency had a negative impact of approximately $2 million in the 2014 quarter, but it decreased significantly from last year's $11 million negative impact, which included $4 million of Venezuela devaluation.","While we continue to monitor this year's developments in Venezuela, we have not recorded a charge for any further devaluation. Our tax rate in 2014 first quarter was 26% and was lower than our previous expectations due to certain beneficial tax items. For the remaining quarters of 2014, we continue to expect a tax rate of nearly 30%.","Turning to cash flows. As many of you know, the first quarter seasonally tends to be a major usage of cash and it was again in 2014. We used about $85 million in our operations during the quarter, but that was an improvement of $23 million versus last year. We also spent another $171 million combined for share repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures and debt payments, while the sale of the Naval business generated cash inflow of approximately $47 million.","In the end, we finished the quarter with no borrowings on our corporate revolver and about $165 million in cash. Similar to the seasonality of our earnings profile, we also expect the first quarter to be the trough for cash flow and anticipate much stronger performance during the remainder of the year.","Focus on cash flows and working capital will remain a priority, as we work towards our goal of consistently generating annual free cash flow near our net income level. We continue to execute on our strategy to efficiently deploy the balance sheet and return value to shareholders. At quarter end, we had about $275 million remaining under our authorized buyback program.","Turning to working capital, it's a mixed story. Although DSOs increased 3 days and inventory turns were flat compared to a year ago, the combined dollar balance of receivables and inventory was down around $27 million from 2013 levels. And these items were cash neutral in the 2014 quarter, which is an improvement of $43 million versus a year ago. I remain confident that the working capital initiatives previously detailed will drive improvement in our metrics over the next few years, as we continue to target DSO in the mid-60s and inventory turns of 4x to 4.5x.","Moving to our EPS guidance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our 2014 earnings guidance of $3.65 to $4 per share. We also continue to expect revenue growth of 3% to 6% on a neutral FX basis.","Turning to our spending priorities. After a couple of years of accelerated returns to shareholders to optimize our balance sheet, we expect a return to our stated policy of returning 40% to 50% of our running 2-year average net earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Importantly, we fully intend to invest in our business for profitable growth and solid organic returns.","Capital expenditures were $31.7 million in the first quarter, and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the $130 million to $140 million range. These investments include adding and expanding capacity in regions like India and China, introducing new products, and as many of you saw in Raleigh, replacing and upgrading manufacturing equipment. We believe this dual approach of capital returns to shareholders with organic and acquisitive investment in our business will provide Flowserve shareholders solid returns over time.","Other uses of cash we expect for the remainder of the year include pension contributions and scheduled debt repayments. But even combined, this amount is modest in comparison to the other priorities.","Lastly, I'd like to thank the many of you who attended our Analyst Day in Raleigh last month. For those of you who are unable to participate and have an interest, the presentation is available on our website. In the weeks ahead, we are planning a fairly active investor relations schedule, with investor meetings in Europe, scheduled visits to our offices here and a number of conferences over the next few months. We value our time with the financial community and our shareholders and anticipate there will be several venues available to you ahead.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jay.","John E. Roueche","Thank you, Mike. Operator, we have concluded this morning's prepared remarks and would now like to open the call up to any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on maybe if you could give a little more color as to how you plan the balance, getting some of these larger projects that are coming in pretty competitive, as well as sort of balancing, taking a lower margin project in -- and getting the aftermarket for it. You mentioned Yanbu was pretty low margin, but now you're seeing the aftermarket for that. Do you expect the competitive environment to get better and margins to get less competitive, as some of these larger projects come online? Maybe just walk us through what your thought process there is and how selective you're going to be.","Mark A. Blinn","Just your question indicates the -- really the -- how we think about it and the complexity. You're exactly right. I mean, the way we look -- first, to the first question, what happens in our industry is as capacity starts to fill up, then the industry starts to use lead times to the extent they can. But there's reluctance to do that because time is money on these projects for the engineering contracting firms. But then the industry also starts to use price to rationalize capacity. So that's a general theme in our industry. And when we talked to you back in 2010, you had a number of forces that were really driving a very price competitive market, Middle East projects, Korean contractors and the like at that point in time. Setting that aside, what we do know is we look at our capacity long term and capacity utilization, in terms of potential absorption. That's a factor you consider relative to where you see in the market cycle. And -- but you also look strategically at some of these projects. So if you've got a good foothold on the aftermarket, you want to make sure you're very competitive. Having said that, Hamzah, I can tell you, in our industry, a bad project never gets better. And so one of the things that we're always very careful with, because we had discussions with you for a couple of years about past due backlog and legacy backlog, that is not a situation that gets better and we think really provides types of [ph] returns for our shareholders. So we will balance all of that. And in the meantime, what we want to do is to continue to focus on execution because that allows us to be more competitive. So as we look at these projects, we will look over at our capacity over 1.5 to 2 years, anticipate how it's going to get utilized, look at market expectations around the world, because with our LPO\/SPO, we can move work all around the world and look at the aftermarket opportunities, look at other pull-through of products because keep in mind, it's not just a certain type of pump that we're seeing, there are seals that go with it and there's valve opportunities as well. And that's how we'll consider the projects. But at this phase, and we talked about this in the first quarter, we saw some that were just very, very competitive. And yes, that could -- we could have taken a couple of those, and those may have changed the comps that we're talking about today. And that -- while that would change the discussion or the perception of the discussion, it really doesn't change the discussion because if those aren't profitable, and they go into our backlog, but they're not going to deliver value to our shareholders. So it is a very thoughtful and complex way we do that. But it's important to know, the process we use around One Flowserve really looks across all of our global capacity, all of our capabilities, our supply-chain capabilities, aftermarket, pull-through opportunities, the other products that we can bundle in, and that's how we consider how we want to take a project. What we don't want to do is fill up our capacity with projects that don't meet our economic requirements. Long answer to your question, Hamzah, but I think that's important because just the length of this answer indicates the level of detail and thought we go through when we look at a project.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I appreciate the answer. It's very helpful. On the aftermarket side, how much of that growth is just pent-up demand or deferred maintenance relative to just underlying growth that you're seeing within that business right now? Is there a way to parse that out or think about that?","Mark A. Blinn","On a percentage basis, no. But on a anecdotal basis, you heard Tom's comment around what we've seen in the Gulf Coast region with increased maintenance spend. Over the last couple of years, European production process facilities have been holding back on maintenance CapEx. So some of that is starting to come back online. That certainly contributed. Also, as we talked about, some of the installed base that we put in over the last couple of years is bearing fruit. And then there's an aspect of it where we're really executing on our end-user strategies. So if we've talked about 8-plus percent growth in aftermarket and really look at the growth over the last couple of years, there's not that much incremental net installed base that goes in around the world at that point in time. So what that indicates is we're gaining ground executing on our strategies, but there certainly will be cycles. Now what you're seeing with the opportunities in the Gulf Coast region is they're going to start putting money back in the maintenance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets.","Unknown Analyst","This is Patrick actually dialing in for Charlie. On the bookings side, I was just wondering, what was the tenor of that during the quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","Hold on. Can you speak up? I can't hear you.","Unknown Analyst","Sorry, sorry. By the way, this Patrick dialing in for Charlie. On the bookings side, what was the tenor of that during the quarter? Was there a steady uptake? And I guess, also if you can give a little bit more color on the backlog as well, how are the margins now, say, versus 2 or 3 years ago as a result of increased bookings?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. I mean, one of the things -- typically, we don't really talk about current quarter information. But in the press release, in our commentary, we talked about accelerating in some of the activity in April. Now 3 months in a -- 3 weeks in a quarter doesn't necessarily make the quarter. But we wanted to give the market an indication of what we've seen. And I think some of our competitors in our industry have seen is that towards the end of the first quarter, things started to pick up. Again, competitive on some of the large projects, and that's continued into April as well. As to the comments on the backlog, if you think about it, especially on the large projects, backlog can be around a while. We embarked on this journey a little over 2 years ago around being disciplined and focusing on execution and all the processes associated with that. What that means and has meant is that our backlog has continued to improve over time. So as we look at this year's backlog, and you heard at my comments over the last year's, you've seen growth in our aftermarket business. But more importantly, we're not having discussions really now around significant legacy or past due backlog. And that type of backlog tends to have little or no margin at the gross margin level. So that can just highlight to you that we've seen good improvement in our backlog. And we think that's important because not only does it impact margins, but it impacts working capital, it impacts our customers, it impacts our sites, it flows through the entire system. We do still have work to do. And one of the outcomes over time of this continued discipline and execution will be more efficiency in our working capital.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. Can you guys -- moving on to the segments, can you guys provide a little bit more color on how much the key end markets were up or down relative across the 3 segments?","Mark A. Blinn","You're going to have to speak up again. You're kind of drifting on us.","Unknown Analyst","Can you provide a little bit more color on how much the key end markets, oil and gas, chemical and power gen were up or down relative across the 3 segments?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think that what -- we need to look at trends over a couple of quarters because, for example, the decline in bookings was more focused on our FCD business, a very high performing business. We saw a pretty good level of oil and gas orders last year on some FPSO opportunities. So when you look at any quarter year-over-year compare, you got to be very careful about calling it a trend. But that's a good business. It does well. As we've indicated, oftentimes, in the first quarter, don't read that as the year for that division. It's executing at a very, very high level. But you'll -- sometimes, you'll have some challenging comps. Generally, in our industries, we've heard there's been talk around -- certainly around the E&P side in oil and gas. But keep in mind where we participate. It's more on the processing side. And what that means is when you take a hydrocarbon, when you take any kind of feedstock and you can process it in a different manner or transport it, what you're seeing increasing levels of, that benefits our industry. The other comment on the power side where you see improvement is we've been in gridlock, certainly in the United States, around fossil-based power plants, but they've gone to combined cycle. You've seen what's happened to the nuclear industry and some signs of life. As we had indicated years ago, that represents 20% of the global supply of power. There is no way to diversify away from that over a short period of time. And you look at all the aspects of what's going on around the world in energy security, and it's difficult for countries, even like Germany, that said they were going to exit it and completely exit it now because they're reliant on natural gas from Russia. So I think it's important to consider there can be pauses [ph] in certain area of the power industry. But as long as people move to urban areas and there's population growth, there's going to be demand for more power.","Operator","Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mark, a question on the run rate OE business and the opportunities there. Maybe you can just give us your view on that cycle and maybe what the growth of that market opportunity is, assuming that these large projects are going to be lumpy and sometimes competitive, as you mentioned?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, some of those large projects will pull through some of what we -- more of our run rate products. If you look at EPD and IPD, IPD will tend to benefit from project opportunities because they'll supply some more of the configured order. I think, in general, when you see upgrades and retrofits of large and medium-sized facilities, and as Tom commented, when you see the distribution channel start to take in more inventory during those periods of time, and more important, Flowserve specific, as IPD continues to improve its execution, that gives us encouragement in that run rate business. I think other areas, as we talked about -- in Mike's comments, he talked about our sales force. I mean, we are making a lot of changes here at the company, but one of them is if you think about it, companies tend to like to hunt elephants. Bringing focus and comp plans around driving this run rate business is important as well. So I think there's market-driven aspects to it. There is a benefit from project activity. There's a benefit to aftermarket from project activity, because there's, I talked about these before, commission spares that go with a new project. So that's kind of the macro outside-in looking opportunity for that business. I think improving the way we execute into our distribution channel, FCD does it quite well. We can -- certainly, we've got room for improvement in IPD as well, focusing our sales organization. Improving execution will give us the opportunity to continue to drive that, more of that configure-to-order smaller run rate business.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe -- you talked about the IPD, the bookings, up 10% or so. I know they had a little bit of an easy comp, but you talked about the focus on growth and some success there. Can you maybe some give us some more details on that, maybe how resources are allocated or focused now or initiatives that we don't see outside of the numbers that's making you feel good about the progress there?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, the way it's operating, it gave us more confidence on executing on our acquisition of Innomag last year. If you think about it, the one thing you don't want to do is acquire an asset, a business for a company that isn't performing at the level it should because it doesn't make things better. So I think that's one great indication of the way that we're thinking about the business, is to bring in more products for them to deliver to our customers. Another thing that we talked about is just aligning the sales organization and making the investments that we have. That's one of the businesses where we've made investment on the chemical side to support the ISO standard chemical equipment. So it's going to be investment in terms of R&D, sales organization, people, talent, inorganic investment opportunities as well because oftentimes, on some of these bolt-ons, those are the type of products, those configure-to-order, that we can bring in and load onto our platform. Honestly, a highly engineered, long cycle piece of equipment, we contend to develop ourselves. And when you go out and make those types of acquisitions, you're typically just buying installed base and setting yourself up for an opportunity to consolidate manufacturing capacity.","Thomas L. Pajonas","And I would add to do that, that if we look at the IPD business, bookings were up in many different areas, so not just one. So chemical was up and GI, water and oil and gas. The only one that was down a little bit was the power business, which was expected. Both the aftermarket and the OE business were up. And if you look at the regions, again, it was broad brush, up across all the regions, with the exception of the Middle East. So it was a good strength across the wide berth of both region and industries on the IPD side. And as Mark has indicated, just good solid execution on the orders that they were getting in.","Operator","The next question is from William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","We know Flowserve's expertise on the downstream market. Can you provide us an update on what you've seen and some of the initiatives that you're doing on upstream?","Mark A. Blinn","We've made a couple of comments around our participating in the thrusters for offshore platforms and also FPSOs as well. So -- and we also provide some of the -- in the firewater pump for some of the offshore platforms. So if you think about type of rotating equipment opportunities and valve opportunities, that's really where we participate on the upstream side. Now there are things we do near upstream that I would call, again, like in the tar sands, where you're right there proximate to the production facility and there's a pre-processing activity that occurs so that the product is easier to transport as opposed to hauling in large trucks and containers. So at the wellhead, there's certainly some down water injection pumps and things like that where we can participate, but it's really going to be around flow control. And that's our core competency. And then on the midstream as well, and Bill, I know you're fairly familiar with that, there's -- you have valves. I mean, the Valbart valve is critical on some of the gas pipelines, certainly, whether it's gas or liquid. If it's a liquid pipeline, you've got pumps that go on it, seals as well. And then, if you think about upstream and midstream, that means that product is going somewhere to get processed.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Great. My second question, and I appreciate the color there. You called out nuclear a little bit. Can you give us a little color on what is happening on the waterfront? A little desalinization there, I know it's a very small piece. But what are you seeing in terms of some of the projects?","Mark A. Blinn","Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, the -- you want me to cover nuclear or do you want me to cover the water feeds [ph] itself?","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","They sort of go hand in hand.","Mark A. Blinn","Okay. Yes, in -- well, in the Middle East, you're right. The -- I would say the power business and the desal business kind of go hand in hand because they try to put those 2 things together. Well, we are seeing a pickup in the desal business, particularly in the Middle East, China, and I would also add India into that. We're seeing some -- a fair amount of activity in the water business itself, not necessarily desal, but water -- I mean, the simple business in the U.S. out of our industrial group. So as the financial condition changes with some of the cities in the U.S., they seemed to be moving at some of those projects. We're also seeing some Latin American countries look at desal as certain countries have mandatory requirements to use desal for mining in order to conserve some of the water supplies because they're having some shortages in Latin America. So we're seeing some good projects there. And as you've indicated, the power, and especially in the Middle East, is going along with the desal plants, particularly in the Middle East.","Operator","Your next question is from Chase Jacobson with William Blair.","Chase Jacobson - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just first on the capital allocation. Mark, at the analyst meeting, you gave the target for $2 billion of growth investment through 2018 on top of CapEx. You've been through the first quarter. You were still active with the share repurchases. Can you update us on the acquisition pipeline?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. It's active in terms of some of the smaller opportunities that you see out there. I mean, I think you've read out there some of the larger opportunities in the flow control industry. So there is activity that is certainly picking up. But in terms of the bolt-on, we're -- we stay very focused on looking for the types of opportunities, products, regions that are certainly out there. They just have to meet the return requirements. And then from time to time, you see assets go out to auction, but you'll see them right about the same time we do.","Chase Jacobson - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So I mean, is there any way to give color on if you're prioritizing technology or geographic footprint or product portfolio at this point?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think that's just it. It's really -- we want to make sure we have the flexibility to shift across those opportunities. And that's what we're doing. So in different areas, I can tell you, we're focused more on R&D and product development and in area One [ph] because we can leverage the product technology that we have right now. We can get it to market as quickly as we'd like. And either there's no asset available out there or to acquire and integrate that asset creates more risk than taking it to market ourselves. We have spent quite a bit of capital on further penetrating the Indian and Chinese market to support those markets primarily, but also to support markets around the world. So we've opened, in the last year, 1.5 years, a new facility in China, one in India and one in Brazil as well. So I think the point here is what we're going to do is look for capital allocation opportunities to provide returns to our shareholders, and we'll look across the entire spectrum. Obviously, M&A is more opportunistic. And sure, you can create opportunities by paying up. But then the real question is, can you deliver the value to your shareholder of that acquisition over a period of time? And that's what we have to do. So we're moving certainly across all of those, not only with our CapEx dollars, as Mike talked about with our SG&A as well. One thing I want to be clear on in SG&A, this is not a matter of just going through and cutting costs. This is really a matter of how we prioritize those SG&A dollars to drive long-term value.","Chase Jacobson - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then on the competition, you've been talking about it, about competitive market for a while. And I guess, we shouldn't be surprised to see it more competitive in the Middle East. But now that, that experience is behind you, are you worried about the ultra competitive environment spilling into the U.S. at all? And is the competition that you're seeing coming from Eastern or Western competitors?","Mark A. Blinn","It's a lot of the same competition that we've seen before. They're good and capable companies. One thing to keep in mind in terms of competition, particularly in the United States, the more of the OECD, what customers value is quality, on-time performance and good execution. And so in the Middle East, it can tend to be oriented a little bit more towards price, although that's changing as well. Because if you think about it and if you followed some of the E&C projects from the Koreans that were executed a couple of years ago, they struggled a little bit, and that cost everybody money. So I think there's an increasing perception, especially in the critical nature of these, that quality and on time is just paramount, not at any price. We had a very strong pricing environment, '06, '07, '08. But again, what I'll tell you is that's when economies were growing at very rapid rates. And more importantly, commodity costs were rising very quickly. So when an owner would bid a project, it would come in 50% to 80% more than what they budgeted for. So that causes the market to try to grab capacity as quickly it can. It's not always a good situation. So what we see in these environments, this is typical. We go through multi-year cycles. We started the cycle down really towards the end of 2009. It got very difficult because the industry had little visibility in 2010 and 2011, but you live with that backlog and you see the opportunities start to come. This is not any different from any time before, other than the financial crisis -- was pretty rugged on all industries. So as we looked at competition, they appear to be very rational, but this isn't unusual as people start to fill their capacity.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question on the guidance, if you might. You mentioned at the Analyst Day, Mark, that the trajectory of bookings in the large projects out of the business would be a critical factor in determining whether you end up ultimately at the low end or the high end of the range. And here we are a few days from May and still at a reasonably wide range there in guidance. So can you kind of update us on how you're handicapping that relative to the comments you made about somewhat of an acceleration in bookings at the back half of the quarter and into April?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, yes, let me clarify. The conversation at the Analyst Day was where we'd be in the revenue range. So I think one of the key messages that we want to make sure you take away from this -- I mean, look at the improvement in the margins, look at the improvement in the operations, the platform, that's -- you see improvement year-over-year, which, in and of itself, revenue aside, drives earnings growth in the business. So that's one thing to look at in terms of when we look at our guidance. I think the question I had at that point in time was, how will revenue growth impact your earnings outlook? And what we talked about is some of these projects, if they are competitive, still have economic value. We'll contribute some to earnings, but less so than the underlying platform in terms of growth. So I think, I want to make that distinction. That was the conversation we had at that point in time. We still think one of the biggest opportunities to drive earnings growth in this business is improving our platform. But clearly and certainly, as you take a step back relative to where you were, I mean, we've sold the business that had some revenues to it. We do need to see increased booking activity to start approaching the top end of our revenue range.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is just, I mean, you've kind of touched on this a few times on the call here, but just to kind of ask it more, I guess, directly, this whole issue of competitiveness to the environment, is there anything different -- can you contrast, I guess, the environment today versus the last cycle around and whether things are more or less competitive or whether this is just kind of where you would expect things to be at this stage of the cycle we're in right now?","Mark A. Blinn","I think it's where we'd expect it to be. If you go back to the last cycle, I think the industry in general got caught by surprise with how economies heated up so quickly and material costs or commodity costs went up fairly quickly. This one seems to be more steadily paced. What do we mean by typical? Typical in the fact that it's understandable, these projects get delayed because people want to make sure they have their budgets right, that they know exactly what the process conditions are, that any change orders they want to consider to get this thing right, they do. So I think people are very, very thoughtful. These are 40- to 50-year commitments that these owners are making. And if you've looked at the activity back in '07, '08, they were rushing to market as quickly as they could and understandably so. This is more typical. Long-term spend, long-term commitment, it's not just any one individual's career, it's many careers that depend on the decision that these folks make. And so they're very, very thoughtful and methodical about it as they go through the process, so it's not typical. I think, over the last couple of years, what we did see, and you've seen in our industry, was 2010, 2011, there was little visibility, and that creates some more of -- we use the term choppy behavior at that point in time. That's not unusual as well, except for the fact that the industry had added capacity and was adding capacity and in '10 and '11, had little or no visibility as to how that was going to get used up. So a steep cycle, you saw, it creates a little more of a choppy environment during the trough that we've seen we getting back to more of what you see as steady state [ph] in our cycles.","Operator","The next question is from David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I had a follow-up question on the aftermarket business. I was wondering if you can quantify the size of the opportunity for bringing in-house some of your aftermarket support as in Dow Benelux? And was there any progress reflected in the aftermarket growth that we saw in the quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. I mean, there was absolutely progress. I mean, progress in terms of market driven, we talked about earlier, but also in executing on our end-user strategies. And there's a whole array of things that we're doing to try to capture more share of the customer's wallet. We could and have quantified what the opportunity is internally that wouldn't be necessarily something I'd talk about on the earnings conference calls. But if you take a step back, Dow Benelux is one facility. Think about how many they operate, how many DuPont operate, Exxon and Shell. That really is our opportunity. And if you take a look at just overall aftermarket, I mean, again, I would say the aftermarket was up in many areas. Chemical market was doing very good on the aftermarket side. The oil and gas, we talked about the refineries on the Gulf Coast and started to spend some of the MRO business. Again, from where they were in the past, Europe oil and gas aftermarket was also up, which was a very good sign. Our general industries business was up in terms of aftermarket also. And then most of the regions fared very well in Q1. Probably, the only region that we had a little difficulty was in Latin America and Venezuela. Other than that, I think it bodes very well for the aftermarket going forward. And then the last thing, as we mentioned, the distribution business on the valve side also had a very strong Q1 in that area. And we've had a pretty good distribution business on the industrial side also in that area, so...","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I guess, my question was related -- did you see any benefit of additional opportunities in the quarter that went in-house or went from in-house to where you were taking care of it?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, we didn't announce any during the quarter.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And do we expect -- even if they're small, you won't announce them anyhow, will you?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, those types of relationships, we tend to, if the customer permits, let you know, because it helps you understand we're executing on our strategies. Sorry about that. I get emotional when I talk about aftermarket.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Understanding your enthusiasm for aftermarket, those type of -- with those type of margins. But Mark, I do have to push you on the guidance a little bit more. So I mean, we're standing here in Q1. Organically, you're down 1%. If I look at what Q1 has typically contributed to the full year revenue, it is trending below where we would be to hit the mid-range of your full year target numbers, about 4.5% growth range. Your backlog is flat year-over-year, yet you're talking to 3% to 6% growth. I mean, so obviously, you're assuming that there's going to be a meaningful acceleration. We're talking about EPD orders maybe coming in the back half of the year, but it's not going to contribute a whole lot this year. So how should we be thinking that? And what's really driving this and what you that confidence that we're going to get there?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, one thing is we, in Q1, even on lower revenues, we delivered more earnings, and we're sitting flat backlog year-over-year, but as I talked about improved backlog, with more earnings power and backlog. I think the third thing to look at, is look at the growth in our aftermarket business, even over the last 2 quarters. We've seen good growth there. And then the trajectory of the platforms. So we're not done improving this platform as well. And I think the other thing -- the comments earlier, aside from the aftermarket is, as these project opportunities come, there's run rate business that goes with that as well. So I think you -- if you saw those things together. And honestly, Brian, there's an aspect of share count year-over-year as well that we get a benefit from. That's what, at this point, gives us confidence on our guidance.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes, but just to follow-up on that, I mean, I appreciate the improved margins in the segments. But I mean, if we look at Q1, you did get a meaningful tax gain, which I don't think you were anticipating. You got the gain on the sale of the asset. So operationally, you're actually running quite a bit below, I think, where you expected the run rate to be. So I don't think your guidance initially anticipated those benefits. And it seems like top line actually would be a meaningful driver to get you operationally where you thought you would be. Is that not a fair view?","Mark A. Blinn","No, if you even normalize the operating income, I mean, it improved on lower revenues. So take all the items aside, let's not even talk about the tax, and you can see the improvement driven by the improvement in gross margin and the other one, the operating and the leverage on the SG&A as well. Now to your point, especially around fixed costs, leveraging the SG&A line, do we get benefit from top line growth? Yes, because we leverage it. We can leverage it in our factories, our gross margins. So there's certainly improved benefit. But if you look, being able to improve our margins on a normalized basis, compared year-over-year on declining revenue, that shows you the power that you may not be fully observing in the improvement of the platform and just even the growth of the aftermarket bookings over the last 2 quarters.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just one last one maybe on aftermarket. So we're -- last quarter was all-time high aftermarket. This quarter, all-time high for a 1Q. How do you look at the timing of conversion there? And how would you balance on a margin level maybe the -- what we expect to be a short cycle conversion from that OE? How would you balance that with expected -- sort of expected OE growth in the back half of the year at a more of like a dilutive impact to that? How would you categorize the whole -- the trend for the year on the overall operating margin?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, what -- more on the gross margin than the operating margin, because if you get project-related revenues, you tend to get better fixed cost leverage in the SG&A line for that. We talked about this before. If you looked at, historically, the -- when we reported the seal business, had 40% plus gross margins in the business. And so you can see it certainly has a margin enhancement. So a mix shift in original equipment to aftermarket, all other things being equal, assuming there's no improved operations or anything like that, is 25 to 30 basis points margin. But that's it on the gross line. We want really to drive all of it. What we want to do is make sure we have profitable projects that come through in the business. Again, we can increase the bookings that you see. But if we take things at 0 profit or potentially, at a loss in the operating line, we don't think that benefits anybody at this point in time, because we're not concerned short term about absorption issues. So as you look at that, we want to continue to grow that aftermarket business. It does tend to cycle through over -- max a couple of quarters. The run rate business will tend to cycle through a little bit longer. And then projects, we do get percentage and completion accounting, but those things will tend to execute over a year, 1 year plus.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one question on chemicals. So we saw year-on-year, there's about a 300 basis point mix shift on the bookings there, so something like 15% year-on-year growth in chemicals. I just -- maybe if you can give some color as to where that's coming in and which segment are you seeing that kind of big increase. And is this the OE from the ethylene projects that have already been handed down to the EMCs? I think -- so that's maybe that's getting hidden in the OE decline in EPD.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. I mean, the ethylene projects are a part of it. We're starting to see those projects start to come in. But if you were to look overall, chemical is up about 15% for FLS overall. And the business, it was up in EPD quite a bit, so that was EPD, and it was up in IPD also. And chemical, and FCD was just slightly down about 2%. So 2 of the business, where the powerhouse destroyed the chemical business. And beside the ethylene projects, they're getting the shale gas finds in the U.S., driving all the chemical business, primarily in the U.S. And you're also seeing some chemical business driving in the Middle East. They, again, diversify their overall business to get into the chemical business. So I would say Middle East and North America were the 2 primary drivers, along with EPD and IPD in that basis.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Graham with Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So the pickup in bookings that you saw in March and April, one of the things that we understand is that the company's optimism on the timing of a project releases TPCs [ph] is incrementally a little bit better because of what you're seeing in Europe and the Middle East. I was just wondering if -- is that the same thing? Are you -- is your optimism on the timing of the rest of world over those areas of the world, bookings, leading, running through your bookings now?","Mark A. Blinn","Let me see if I understand the question. I mean, we've talked about seeing these opportunities out there, and I think a lot of the comments have been focused around North America. And I think during the Analyst Day, Scott, we -- you saw some of the awards to some of the EMCs. And we were saying, we'd anticipate seeing some of that towards the back half of this year from the North America. If you go around the world, those are a set of different conversations that either give us optimism or concern over a period of time. For example, in the Middle East, some of the upgrade requirements we talked about in Kuwait and some of the projects that we've seen out there for a while. And in Europe, a lot of that is going to be more around the economy. And we don't expect that they're going to build any new refineries. But it will certainly support some of the run rate business, the power industry as well and some of the things that we're -- they're doing with chemical as well.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understood. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the run rate business, Mark, because we've been using that phrase now for a couple of quarters. You gave a couple of examples early on in the call about what that is exactly. I guess, my bigger question is, what are the signs that you're seeing there that suggest that, that can continue at the pace of growth that it's currently running at?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, one is just the growth we've seen fairly consistently over the last couple of years in that business. Another one is the improved execution. Those are the kind of pieces of equipment that a customer needs quickly, on time and to operate the way it needs to operate. And when IPD wasn't executing to that level, honestly, they had to turn away some business. So I think those are some of the encouraging signs that we're seeing. The other thing that we've looked at, we talked about a minute ago, was the distribution channel. In 2008, they started destocking, that will tend to put pressure, it'll flow through into that run rate business because that, oftentimes, that's where some of that configure-to-order product will tend to go through. The other thing that we added in our commentary, Scott, is oftentimes, some of the run rate -- and this can be some of the configure-to-order process equipment will go along with projects as well. So on project opportunities, IPD does participate. If you look at the balance of plant-type investment, some of those run rate products will go in there. And I think the other thing -- frankly, one example is we told you 3 or 4 years ago that we've not probably targeted an R&D opportunity in the ISO chemical pump, got that product up and running and it's doing well. So those are some of the things. But I think really, from our standpoint, what it comes to -- externally, we looked at project opportunities, we look at the distribution channel, we do look at some of the drivers and economies because some of this run rate product goes into small upgrades or repairs or replacements in Europe and in the United States and other regions. And then, internally, we look through opportunities around how we're aligning our sales organization, the products we've developed that we've invested in and how we're taking them to market, the acquisition that we made of mag drive product that we can load on to the platform. And then at the end of the day, it comes down to execution.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understood. The last question is this. Earlier today, a company in your space, not necessarily a competitor per se, reported that the power business -- their power business had started to accelerate in the Middle East and Africa. I was wondering if you were seeing the same.","Mark A. Blinn","If you take a look at the power business, a lot of that is tied to desal business in the Middle East, and also, it's tied to the combined cycle business in the Middle East. I would say it's those 2 drivers there. And after there [ph] does have some desal business going on there. And as you know, that those plants take a lot of power in order to operate. I would say you're correct there.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay Roueche for any closing remarks.","John E.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Quarter 4 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mike Mullin, you may begin your conference.","Mike Mullin","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Flowserve's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast with our earnings presentation via our website at flowserve.com. Simply click on the Investor Relations tab to access the webcast and the accompanying presentation.","The webcast will be posted at flowserve.com for replay approximately 2 hours following the end of this call. The replay will stay on the site for on-demand review over the next several months.","Joining us today are Mark Blinn, President and CEO of Flowserve; Tom Pajonas, our Chief Operating Officer; Mike Taff, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dick Guiltinan, our Chief Accounting Officer.","Following our commentary today, we will begin the Q&A session. Regarding any forward-looking statements, I refer you to yesterday's earnings release and 10-K filing and today's earnings presentation slide deck for Flowserve's Safe Harbor statement on this topic. All of this information can be found at Flowserve's website under the Investor Relations section. We encourage you to read these statements carefully with respect to our conference call this morning. ","Now I would like to turn it over to Mark to begin the formal presentation. Mark?","Mark A. Blinn","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our solid 2011 results, and I am proud of the work our employees have done to position us to take advantage of what we believe are improving end markets. ","Looking at our 2011 financial results, bookings were $4.7 billion, up 10.2% versus the prior year. We ended 2011 with our highest fourth quarter backlog since 2008, in spite of geopolitical challenges and considerable currency headwinds. ","Our aftermarket bookings grew 9% in 2011, demonstrating the success of our end-user strategies, which include ongoing investments in our global QRCs, as well as our strategic localization efforts. Earnings per share were $7.64, up 11% versus prior year. Our margins were negatively impacted by lower margin, large projects booked in 2010 and early 2011, as well as incremental costs associated with a few delayed shipments. Despite these margin headwinds, we had positive operating income improvement on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, as we continued to tightly manage cost.","Our 2011 results demonstrate the execution of our core strategies around global localization near key customers and resource allocations towards higher growth markets. Towards those strategies, we continued our efforts to reposition our people and capabilities in growing regions of the world, and we are seeing the benefits of these efforts in the bookings growth in emerging markets. We expect this trend to continue in 2012 in light of our additional investment in Brazil, China, India and Russia. ","We also executed on our inorganic growth strategy in 2011 through the acquisition of Lawrence Pumps. In 2012, we will continue to seek out similar bolt-on opportunities, where we can purchase well-respected engineered technology that complements our product portfolio, has good brand recognition in an underserved market. We look for opportunities where we can leverage our global sales force and aftermarket platform to grow the business and pull through additional products. ","Additionally, we recently set in place a new COO leadership structure, which will help us drive our One Flowserve initiative. We are seeing that increasingly our customers want to face one supplier. Our Shell frame agreements are a great example of that trend. Our new structure will help us leverage our product offering and aftermarket capabilities for our common customers across common markets and more quickly respond to the global trends we are seeing. ","We will also drive expense leverage and common processes through our unified organization. Tom will give you more details on his plans around the new structure and where he sees opportunities for leverage and operational improvement. I would just point you to the success we have had in combining our pump and seal groups, as well as Tom's success in improving FCD's operational performance and margins over the last few years. We believe our more unified leadership structure will help us drive a strong culture of operational excellence through a common focus across the company. ","Looking forward to 2012, we expect continued momentum in our short cycle and aftermarket businesses, and we expect the long cycle business to remain competitive, but slowly growing. We have seen some increased quoting activity around several large mega projects that have been announced or expected to be announced relatively soon. Although we are optimistic about these projects on the horizon, given the long cycle nature of this aspect of our business, we will not see an immediate impact on our results, as we must still produce lower margin, large projects in our backlog in 2012. ","We expect the first half of 2012 earnings, particularly the first quarter, will be [indiscernible] compared to the first half of 2011, primarily due to the impacts of the delayed projects in backlog, the strong dollar and the continuing uncertainty in Europe. Mike will go into the guidance in greater detail later in the call. ","Despite these headwinds, I believe we are well positioned with our increased backlog to continue to achieve our 5% to 7% revenue growth target for 2012. The guidance for revenue growth and margin expansion is based on our confidence in our end markets and our proven strategies around targeting growing global regions and markets to capture that growth. ","With this increased confidence in our future, we recently announced a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend on an annualized basis. This action reflects our commitment to our policy of returning cash to shareholders. ","In addition to focusing on profitably growing the business, we will always look to increase shareholder value and believe that along with our increased visibility and confidence, returning cash to shareholders was an important step in increasing our valuation. Simply put, while 2011 showed good progress, we believe 2012 is well positioned to be even stronger. ","Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to thank Dick Guiltinan for all he has done for our company. It was a pleasure working with you, and we wish you the best in a well-deserved retirement. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be here and serve as your new CFO. I'm excited about the opportunity we have to grow the company and create shareholder value. ","Before I review our financial performance, I would like to thank Dick for the first-class financial team he has put in place and wish him the best in retirement. ","Mark provided an overview of 2011. I am going to add some comments on the consolidated financials, talk a little bit about 2011 cash flow and how we have deployed our cash over the last few years and discuss our working capital performance and our plans for improving it. ","On the financial results, we continue to see momentum in bookings with Q4 bookings growth of 11.3% over the prior year, while 4-year bookings grew at 10.2%, which, I would like to add, is the strongest bookings year we have posted since 2008. Our book-to-bill ratio in the fourth quarter was 0.9 on solid bookings and strong sales. ","Our full year book-to-bill ratio was over 1.0 for the second year in a row at 1.03. Backlog at the end of 2011 was $2.7 billion, up 3.7% from the prior year. ","Sales in the fourth quarter were up 11% over the prior year and up about 12% for 2011, reflecting the continued growth in the oil and gas and chemical industries and the full year impact of Valbart, which was acquired in July 2010. ","Gross margin for 2011 was 33.6%, which decreased 140 basis points from 2010, in part due to a few large projects with low margins, along with some incremental charges on certain projects that have not shipped or shipped late. ","As we turn to SG&A, you can see cost control continues to be a major focus, but not at the cost of limiting our investment in growing emerging regions. We continue to see the benefits of our realignment programs and cost reduction initiatives. ","When you look at SG&A as a percentage of sales, the fourth quarter decreased by 130 basis points to 18.4%, while the full year of 2011 came in at 20.3%, which decreased 70 basis points from 2010. ","Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 15.3%, reflecting strong leverage. Operating margin for the full year of 2011 was 13.7% or 14% when adjusted for realignment costs, which is down about 90 basis points from 2010 with the SG&A improvement partially offsetting the lower gross margin. Foreign currency rates continued to be volatile in 2011. ","Other income expense net for the fourth quarter included $4.2 million in losses associated with transactions we have entered into in currencies other than our location's functional currency and mark-to-market charges on foreign currency hedge contracts during the period. ","For the full year of 2011, we recognized a gain of $3.7 million. Our fourth quarter tax expense was negatively impacted by a profit mix shift to higher tax jurisdictions, resulting in a quarterly tax rate of 30.3%. We do not view this shift as permanent and expect our structural rate of 28% to 30% to remain intact going forward.","Turning to cash flows. We finished the year strong, as is typical with the seasonality of our cash flows. We generated $368 million in operating cash in Q4, bringing our full year cash flow from operations to $218 million. As we have mentioned throughout the year, working capital investment has been higher than expected. We'll take a more in-depth look at working capital in just a few minutes.    ","On investing activities, we had capital expenditures of $108 million for the year, as we continued to invest above our rate of depreciation. We also deployed $90 million of cash for the strategic acquisition of Lawrence Pumps. ","On financing activities, we returned $220 million to our shareholders in 2011: $70 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases. So on a year-over-year basis, our cash balance decreased $220 million, as we finished the year with $337 million in cash with a net debt position of approximately 7% of total capital. ","Turning to our use of cash [indiscernible], we have a historical look at how we have deployed capital over the last 6 years. We continue to take a balanced and disciplined approach to evaluating and deploying cash. We will provide some additional guidance around our expected use of cash in 2012 later in the presentation.","Turning to working capital. We saw sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, however, there is still work to be done. This is an area of focus for our team over the next several quarters. We made some progress reducing DSO to 75 days at year end. As I mentioned on our Analyst Day a couple of weeks ago, I believe we can drive DSO into the mid-60s. We also made some progress on inventory, shipping roughly 20% of our past due backlog, representing approximately $60 million. I believe there is another $60 million of opportunity within past due backlog, which we expect to get out the door in the first half of 2012. ","Now I would like to turn it over to Tom, as he will talk about the markets and our divisional results. Tom?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the overall markets and the details of the business segments, I'd like to discuss the new structure. ","As Mark mentioned, we are transitioning to a One Flowserve approach. We will be focusing on product and service platforms, as shown, and driving those platforms on a worldwide basis within our operating divisions of the Engineered Product Division, EPD; Industrial Product Division, IPD; and the Flow Control Division, FCD. Each platform will be responsible for product definition, manufacturing loadings, sourcing, lead and secondary product manufacturing strategy, sales and execution. ","Several process functions, like financial systems, project management, supply chain, research, human resources and information technology will provide consistency of processes across the platforms. We're excited about this change, as we drive specific focus to each platform on a worldwide basis. ","Overall, bookings increased from $4.2 billion to $4.7 billion year-over-year. Bookings grew nicely year-over-year by focusing on our aftermarket strategies and strategic growth initiatives in emerging markets. Opportunities continued to be mixed, with strong activity in most power markets, the chemical, general industries and upstream oil and gas. Aftermarket opportunities remain strong as we continue to redeploy resources and increase our capabilities through our services and solutions platforms. ","Overall, the project business remained competitive. We continue to approach opportunities strategically by balancing pricing discipline, project win rates and market share targets, factory loading considerations and long-term business considerations. Large project pricing, however, remains very competitive in the current environment. In the oil and gas area, there's a shift of activity towards upstream production. In particular, natural gas has a growing focus, even as shale gas finds in North America have kept domestic prices low. Investments in new refineries continue to be driven by Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil and India. Oil and gas production spend could increase mainly because of the depletion rates of current fields and higher costs of developing new harder-to-find oil and gas deposits. While we expect long-term market growth to remain robust, we also see the near term being moderated due to economic uncertainty in Europe. As a result, we continue to view the immediate future as mixed, with opportunities continuing to present themselves in the emerging markets. ","In power, activity is focused on China and India and particularly on the supercritical side driven by reduced emissions and efficiency. Nuclear power opportunities continue in various countries around the world, including the recently announced Vogtle plants in Georgia. Natural gas reserves have created opportunities for combined cycle power plants, particularly in the developed regions like the U.S. The chemical market in general is focused on the Middle East and China for new construction and MRO activity in North America and Europe. With recent finds of the shale of natural gas in the U.S., the use of natural gas as a feedstock has raised opportunities because of its low cost and available reserves. Refining, petrochemical and chemical plants will continue to vertically integrate. This is due to the proximity of the feedstock and the need of customers to drive more margin in countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Russia. ","General industries, including pulp and paper, mining and distribution, have seen a general increase over last year and have rebounded somewhat from the 2010 levels. Bookings in 2011 were dominated by the oil and gas industry of roughly 40%, with chemical at 18% and general industries at 22%. ","Sales for 2011 remain roughly at the 2010 splits by region, with North America at 32%, followed by Europe at 23% and emerging markets at 45%. The Middle East continues with the refinery and petrochemical investments, even though there continues to be general unrest in some areas. ","Asia Pacific continues to drive forward with investments in power, driven by the coal-based economies of China and India. Original equipment and aftermarket, bookings and sales saw good growth on a yearly basis. Original equipment bookings and sales grew 11.1% and 8.2%, respectively, year-over-year. ","Aftermarket bookings and sales grew 9% and 17.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis comparison. The workforce of skilled engineers with our customers continues to retire at an accelerated rate. This should result in an increased reliance on suppliers, like Flowserve, and drive the demand for offerings like our integrated services and solutions. ","Over the past 5 years, Flowserve has continued to make strategic investments in our most important resource, our people, specifically in engineering and leadership capability. Flowserve has added nearly 1,000 engineers over this period, representing a compounded annual resource growth rate of over 9%. ","In addition, Flowserve has trained over 1,200 managers since 2008 in management and leadership foundation courses, with nearly 50% occurring in 2011, as we build our leadership bench for the future growth. ","Flowserve has grown our employee resource base in emerging markets by over 50% since 2006, with 23% of all employees now located in emerging markets. Overall, we are excited about the infrastructure developments we see across the industries we serve. ","Now let's review the various business segments in detail. The Engineered Product Division grew bookings 12.3% in Q4 versus prior year. Sales grew 13.8% over the same period. Bookings growth in Q4 came from the chemical, oil and gas power, and general industry businesses. Regionally, much of the bookings and sale growth in Q4 came from North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America. ","Gross margin was 34.5% in Q4, down from prior year. Operating margins, however, were 18.7%, based on operating and income growth of 12.2% from prior year Q4. On a full year basis, bookings grew 4.1%, with solid growth in chemical, power and general industries. ","Sales grew 7.8%, with regional growth in North America, the Middle East and Asia Pacific, followed to a lesser extent by Latin America. Operating margin was 17% for the full year in a mixed market environment. Aftermarket bookings and sales increased both in Q4 and the full year. Q4 bookings and sales increased 7% and 14%, respectively, and full year bookings and sales increased 9% and 16%, respectively. ","Our aftermarket business continues to strengthen. Services and solution opportunities also continue to grow, gaining interest from our customers by focusing on energy efficiency and operating cost reduction. ","Overall, Flowserve has 450 global customer alliances, of which approximately 112 are fee based. The power market, in general, saw good growth on a yearly basis, in spite of the continuing effects of the Fukushima incident. ","Projects in fossil, gas, solar, geothermal, wind and biofuels are proceeding and present opportunities for bookings growth. The chemical market again saw good growth, especially with the opportunities that gas presents itself as a feedstock versus liquids. ","Oil and gas opportunities continue to present themselves, particularly in the Middle East. Proposal activity has been robust in this area, even though the oil and gas business was down about 2.5% from prior year. ","Overall growth in general industries, including mining and paper, provide for good diversification of our product base. In the face of competitive pricing environment, we continue to focus our lower cost sourcing, cost management and productivity improvement using our well-established continuous improvement programs. ","We also positioned ourselves for growth by taking advantage of emerging markets. We invested in more strategic localization efforts in Brazil, India, China and Russia, and we continued to differentiate our integrated solution offerings through expanded asset management contract offerings. We completed our acquisition of Lawrence Pumps and integrated it into the business in Q4. ","Lawrence is a premium brand name in the oil and gas and chemical sectors. Their products are well known for their reliability in harsh, critical service applications. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to grow and deliver value through bolt-on additions. Lawrence Pumps is now part of the EPD portfolio. ","The Industrial Product Division, IPD, is improving, with increased bookings and sales in Q4 versus prior year. Orders were up 5.3% in Q4 versus prior year, thanks to the increases in chemical, power and water business. ","Regionally, that growth came from North America, Europe and Asia. Sales were up 14.3% in the quarter based on North America and Asia Pacific projects. Operating margin was 9.1% for the quarter, as we continue to work off lower margins in the backlog from prior periods. ","We are also continuing to work on increasing the performance and efficiency levels of our IPD plants. On a yearly basis, bookings grew by 9.4% on the strength of the chemical and general industry business. Regionally, the growth came from a strong Asia Pacific and Europe and, to a lesser extent, North America. ","Sales grew 9.7% on a year-over-year basis with strong growth coming from North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Operating margins for the year were 7.2%. We continue to optimize certain structural parts of our business, including an increased emphasis on on-time delivery and overall unit efficiencies. ","Both bookings and sales grew in the aftermarket business for the quarter and full year. Aftermarket bookings in the quarter and the full year grew 18% and 9%, respectively, while sales grew 14% and 17%, respectively. ","IPD will continue to stay focused on improving operational efficiencies, on-time delivery and overall contract execution. IPD remains committed to reaching its operating margin target of 14% to 15% by 2015. ","The Flow Control Division had a solid quarter of performance. Bookings were up 15.2% versus Q4 with strong growth across all sectors, including chemical, oil and gas, power and general industries. ","Regional booking growth was strong in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Q4 revenues were up 5.6% versus prior period, with strong growth coming from the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America. ","Gross margins of Q4 were up 180 basis points versus prior period, based on stronger showings in the oil and gas businesses. Operating income increased 18.3% versus prior year Q4. The overall book-to-bill ratio was 1.0 for the quarter, while the book-to-bill ratio on a yearly basis was 1.09. On-time delivery to our customers was 91%. ","For the full year, bookings increased 22.7% over prior year based on the growth in the oil and gas, chemical and general industries. Sales increased 23% versus prior year. Latin America and the Middle East lead the increase, coupled with strong percentage increases in Europe, Asia Pacific and North America. Operating income increased almost 29.3% versus prior year. Aftermarket bookings and sales for the full year versus the prior year increased 7% and 23%, respectively. ","In addition, all customer channels to the market, original equipment manufacturers, engineering and procurement and construction, end-users and distribution, grew in bookings year-over-year. Overall bookings growth reflected our investments in emerging markets, particularly in the Middle East and Asia Pacific, along with the strength in our core developed markets. In our industrial markets, the chemical industry continued to see strong Q4 growth, driven by smaller capacity increases and MRO activity. ","Renewed interest in chemical plants is beginning to form in the Middle East based on their drive to be recognized as a petrochemical hub. This is also the case in the U.S. based on the abundance of relatively low priced shale gas. Germany and key markets in Asia reported strong MRO activity. We also secured new orders for the silicon chip production for the solar business. ","In the oil and gas business, we have seen continued interest in the LNG market, particularly in Australia, and some interest in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, again, based on the abundance of shale gas. Proposal activity remained strong with the gas projects, LNG projects, pipeline initiatives and Middle East activity. Shifts from gas to liquid in the U.S. have been a continued topic in the North American market. The power market has not yet stabilized. This is due to the nuclear reports due out of China, the continued discussion of the fossil coal EPA requirements in the U.S., and the overall inquiry and the interest on combined cycle plants. ","Solar projects continue being discussed, along with renewed interest in biomass projects, albeit on a smaller scale. In general industries, pulp and paper in South America continued to drive forward, as well as the overall distributor business. The distributor business increased over 22% year-over-year, as this relative market continued to gain strength. Some project orders were also realized in the steel industry for air separation plants and in other industrial gas applications in China. ","FCD's key initiatives will continue to drive our aftermarket and original equipment penetration into the emerging markets, particularly in China, Latin America, the Middle East and Russia. Our focus on on-time delivery and quality will provide FCD with customer growth platforms for the future. ","And now I'd like to turn this back to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thanks, Tom. So let's take a look at 2012. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital deployment, as we work to balance and align our growth initiatives with our desire to return capital to shareholders. ","Yesterday, we announced a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 a share, which is the fifth year in a row we have increased our dividend. We expect CapEx to be between $120 million and $130 million in 2012, as we continue to grow the business and support our customers. We expect pension contributions of $20 million to $25 million and have required debt principal payments of $25 million. We outlined our revenue targets a few weeks ago and expect to see a 5% to 7% growth in 2012, excluding the impact of potential acquisitions. Moving to our 2012","[Audio Gap]","quarter of 2012 is expected to be impacted by some low margin, late project shipments booked in 2010 and early 2011 and a reduced level of aftermarket shipments compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Earnings will be further impacted by the effects of the stronger dollar. We expect negative translation effects, given the average euro rate of roughly 1.4 in the first half of 2011 versus the 1.3 we have seen so far this year. ","In addition to the translation effects last year we saw from a weaker dollar, we also expect the $0.11 gain from a transaction standpoint we saw in the first quarter of 2011 not to recur. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2012 full year guidance of $8 to $8.80 per share, including $0.50 of negative foreign currency impact. And now I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Mullin","Thanks, Mike.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just around working capital. Maybe if you could just comment on what levers you're focused on. I know your targets out there on working capital, Mike, you mentioned them. But maybe if you could just talk about what structural challenges you may face in improving that working capital, given some of the factors inherent in your business.","Mark A. Blinn","Okay. Well, why don't I turn it over to Tom and then to Mike to, kind of, walk you through it, one from an operational and the other one just, kind of, from a financial targeting.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, so, Hamzah, what I would say on the working capital from an operation perspective, I mean, what we're going to concentrate on is on-time delivery, obviously, documentation and the closure of that documentation towards the back end of the contracts. We're going to look at lead times because, obviously, that can help also on the working capital as we now deploy more lean into the businesses. And then, basically, getting through the units in a high efficiency, the throughput overall in the businesses. Those would be the 3 or 4 operational things that I would concentrate on. Mike?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, I agree exactly with what Tom said. And also, we'll obviously address it on the front end, too, as we go through the bidding process of looking at certain things. So it's really a 2-phased approach. One is addressing on the front end as we go onto new orders; and then second, is putting some procedures in, as Tom mentioned, operationally in what's in place today. As far as metrics to look for, I think we ended the quarter at 75 days DSO. We're going to drive that down into the 60s, that's our goal. It's about $13 million to $14 million for every day we reduce that. So I think there's a good $100 million out there of monetization on the AR side. On the past due backlog, we mentioned we reduced that by 20%. We think we've got at least another 20% to go, and that would be a monetization of another $60 million to $70 million. So we've got work to do. But it's in our sights, and we've done it before, and we just got to get busy and focus on that over the next several quarters.","Mark A. Blinn","And Hamzah, I'll just add, structurally you asked, if you look at this industry back '07 and '08, very strong pricing environment, and we use the term that people were basically putting cash forward for manufacturing slots. So you were able to command more cash at that period of time, and that's the one dynamic, as you've seen, is just gotten more competitive and the capacity we've talked about, the ability just to command that market in general, us and our competitors, has decreased. I think the other thing is, when we talked about this, is when -- as you move more to emerging markets, high-quality customers on the end, but they do tend to pay slower. So I think those are some of the structural issues that we've seen overall in our industry. But I think the message for you is, as we talk through these concepts of working through the cycle, as we talked about, and that working through this past due backlog and some of the opportunities Tom has around operations, that all fits, and the output of all of that is working capital.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Very helpful. And just a follow-up question. As you look at your current product portfolio, are there any product gaps right now that you need to address, either organically or acquisitively? And maybe if you could also comment on your thinking around whether -- what your views are on the frac pump market. I know you're not in that market right now, but do you find any other markets attractive right now that you're not in? And maybe also just on the product gap side, if you have any, going forward.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, a lot of questions, and this is really the subject of a lot of our strategic discussions, and I'll try to encapsulate it shortly here. I mean, I think when you look at our product gaps, we addressed one opportunistically with Lawrence Pumps. We've developed the first phase of our chemical pump in the IPD business, which was introduced. We need to bring the next generations to market. Because on the ANSI standard, which is the American standard, we have the leading product equipment. We need to develop more for the ISO standard. So I think there are opportunities. Now I don't think there's a product that we look at that we said is going to fundamentally negatively impact our business if we don't have. It's more around opportunity. Now when you look at the mining industry or the frac pumps, those are strong markets right now. And you can't be all things to all people. You've got to look at how you get selectively into those markets, consider that they do go through cycles, they're in strong cycles right now, and penetrate it as you can. ","Think about it, though, when something is really hot to go get it in organically, you're going to pay quite a bit for it. I mean, the market is not going to give it away for free. So I think -- that's how we think about these opportunities. We have the opportunity to develop some incremental capabilities internally in the Mining business. We have a good competitor in that area. They're very good at what they do. But we always feel the market likes competition, and so we seek opportunities to get in there as appropriate. But again, you take a step back. When you look at inorganic, what we want to do is be able to leverage our existing sales and aftermarket platform and be able to realize that return for our company and our shareholders over a reasonable period of time in terms of internal rates of return. So that's how we're going to think about it. And we'll keep approaching our product offering. We're very detailed in terms of how we look at it. But I think one of the things with all the products that we have, we have a lot of technology, a lot of capabilities that we can adapt to different markets. A good example is some of the equipment that we've adapted for the tar sands would not have been thought of 10 years ago, 10, 15 years ago, but that has good penetration up in Canada at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of things. One is on IPD. And I was wondering if Tom could just comment on what he's thinking about for that business. And maybe it's still kind of early days, but that path to 14% to 15%, I mean, is that going to be kind of back-end loaded? Is there some low-hanging fruit that we could see, kind of, progress in the next 12 months and then kind of move gradually there? I mean, how should we think about that target because it seems like there's still some pretty significant operational challenges in that business?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, I mean, I would say there are some operational things that we have to take a look at. But the 14% to 15% is achievable over the next 2 to 3 years. If you look at our coming out of the gate here in terms of 2011, we had good orders, good sales. So I would say the front end of the business is beginning to work well. Again, we have opportunities on on-time delivery. We have opportunities on the quality side of the business. Certainly, the working capital. I've mentioned before in terms of the low-cost sourcing, this business is shorter terms, similar to the Flow Control Division where there's significantly more low-cost sourcing around the world in FCD than there is in IPD. So that's an area that we can begin to get some additional margin out of. Certainly some of the things like lean and manufacturing optimization we'll begin to target. And I would also say the supply chain, in general, will be an area that we'll provide a lot of focus on certainly in 2012.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then you made a comment in the prepared remarks about Europe. I was wondering if you could talk about whether since you gave the outlook back in December, is Europe tracking, kind of, weak as expected or is it weaker or stronger?","Mark A. Blinn","It's pretty much along the lines as expected, Robert. We saw that -- if you look at our bookings, EMA was the one that really -- that was negatively impacted last year. And we've seen kind of a similar approach this year. The real question is, as you take a step back is, I think there's consensus that they're going to go into recession. The question is how long and how deep? And I think a lot of that hinges on how quickly they can take action to basically firewall their credit-related issues and to get an accord amongst the countries as to how they're going to proceed going forward. You've seen some improvement there, but really until there's a firm understanding of how they're going to move forward, you wouldn't see, necessarily, the impact overall in our business.","Thomas L. Pajonas","And I would add, I mean, Europe on a year-over-year basis was only about 2% off. And on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it was essentially neutral.","Michael S. Taff","The only thing I'd add there, Robert, is obviously -- we talk about --  a lot about our exposure to the euro and the quantum of the dollars. But that's not just strictly business that stays in Europe. That's business we're doing with customers where our contracts are valued in the euro but actually the products go outside the country to other places.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. And then just finally on EPD. I look at the backlog there exiting the year into '12. It's about the same as what it was going into 2011. I know the bookings started to accelerate in this quarter, but it\u2019s probably more of a 2013 impact on the P&L. I mean, you think the revenue will grow in EPD this year?","Mark A. Blinn","Robert, I don't want to give guidance beyond what we've given you. But the 5% to 7% range kind of helps you understand how it will grow across a couple of them. What you saw in EPD was -- coming into the year, it was still, as we talked about, choppy and competitive. So you focus in these engineered areas on loading your factories, absorption, also around price. But what we talked about in the middle part of the year was we saw some stabilization and increased selectivity. It was that selectivity in effect that kind of kept it flat, if not slightly down on the OE side year-over-year, but we continued to drive the aftermarket business. This is kind of how you manage these big long cycle engineered facilities and opportunities, as you move out of a cycle. So as we look forward, what we do have to do, and it's in EPD and IPD and a little bit in FCD, is clear the past due backlog that's been around for a period of time. And that's for a number of reasons. It could be supply base, some of the issues that we've had or really some of these projects just haven't come online as originally scheduled, and customers weren't anxious to take the equipment. But that will start to clear in the first half of this year. We'll work through that. A lot of that is in EPD, and we move forward. But I think, as you look at revenue this year, we will remain selective and drive the aftermarket business overall. And as I mentioned in my comments, we do see some of these project opportunities coming back over the horizon. And with that, we think pricing will ultimately follow.","Michael S. Taff","But, Robert, as we said in our prepared comments, we do feel good about the revenue projection and trajectory on in the 5%, 7% growth on a consolidated basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a couple of quick ones, verifications. On the tax rate first half, you're expecting -- would you expect the tax rate in Q1, Q2 to be above that 28% to 30% range?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, you said 28% to 30%. I think, overall, Charlie, I think what you'd say is that, we feel good on an annual basis that our structural rate will remain in that 28% to 30% range. Quarter-to-quarter, it's going to bounce around. There's a lot of things that drive that, whether it's revenue mix, profit mix and things like that. But on any other basis, we still feel comfortable that our structure rate being in that 28% to 30% range.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. It's not fair then to say that the first half might be a little heavily weighted towards a higher tax rate just because of the mix of shipments going out the door?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, I mean, it's certainly -- it could be. It's just -- a lot just depends on where that's coming from and all that. So it's hard to project quarter to quarter. And I think we really look at our tax rate more on an annualized basis versus a quarterly basis.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And did you quantify realignment costs for IPD in '12?","Mark A. Blinn","No, we didn't, specifically. I mean, we're -- it's relatively small. We're pretty much through all that. We'll have some residual realignment cost, a couple of million dollars.","Michael S. Taff","Yes, I think most of it is going to be more of larger, just paying some bills and cash flows versus [indiscernible] at this point.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then one more, just -- I want to look at the U.S. nuclear market maybe a little more closely and the opportunity there, because you had Southern Company come out and get approval for the first 2, to build first 2 reactors in over 30 years. You've had the NRC come out the past few days proposing new safety regs in the U.S. You've got the Nuclear Energy Institute out there saying that nuke companies are buying a lot of equipment. Can you maybe give us a sense of what you view the opportunity in the U.S. is over the next 2, 3 years on the nuke side?","Mark A. Blinn","Let me just respond with the high level theme, and I'll turn it over to Tom. I mean, I think this is what we've been talking about for a while. Nuclear power represents 20% of the power supply globally. And if anybody thinks they're going to diversify away from it over a short period of time, that's just not the case. You can see it in certain isolated areas where they've moved away from it in countries, but in general, this is a viable, long-term, well-established supply of power globally. And that's what we try to say as we -- you can see the short-term impacts of some of these things, but the U.S. is a great example. It's a key source of power. They don't have alternative ready supplies, alternative power and emerging powers. Those aren't going to replace these base standards of power over the short term. So it's a high level theme to think globally as it relates to our business.","Thomas L. Pajonas","And I would add to that, though Charlie, that if you look at the U.S., there's 104 reactors in the U.S. A lot of them are coming up for relicensing, so that's going to present opportunities for us over the next several years. The aftermarket parts and services has continued to be robust over this time period because many of these plants are plants that were built in the '70s. And like you mentioned, Vogtle got its construction and operating license just a few days ago, and we participated in that particular project. And that commercial operation is coming up in 2016, 2017 for those plants. And then you also have SCANA, which has not gotten its COL yet, but that supposedly is coming up for review here shortly. And that's a plant that's similar to the Vogtle plant in South Carolina, 2 plants for that. And those also have a 2016, 2019 commercial operation date. So I think we\u2019re going to see a mixture of some new plant constructions, aftermarket and relicensing going on, as we go forward here over the next several years.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","When you guys get orders for nuke work, is it come out of EPD or Flow Control or is it rather evenly split?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, we have -- I mean, if you were to look at the Vogtle and SCANA without getting into the actual details, I mean, it was pretty equally split. Valves participates on both of those plants. Also, the EPD group participates on those plants on the pump side. Obviously, on the seal side, they go along with that. So we have both opportunities. And I think I've mentioned before, a typical plant could be anywhere from $60 million to $80 million on a typical nuclear plant, not including the aftermarket over the next 30 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, and what I would say is this. Certainly, I mean, the FCD business has performed well over the last several years, but we have a very capable person in there that's been part of the succession planning for the last 4 years. And I hope and expect, based on the objectives that he's been given, that he's going to take that business to the next level as it goes after emerging markets and gross margin and those type of things. A lot of my emphasis, because I have -- there is a, I would say, a different base in FCD right now, a lot of my emphasis will be on the pump side of the business. We've talked about IPD in the past, and we have a road to go to get that up to 14% or 15%. But I think the road largely is in our internal responsibility to get there. I think the market is there for those products. We need to get better on the on-time delivery, pretty basic. We need to get excellent on the quality, which is what our customers expect that those products get out there and are tested and pass testing the first time and get out to field and work with no subsequent revisions. So we -- I feel pretty good that we got a view of what needs to be done. Now it's the amount of backlog that has to come through, and it's the length of the projects that will determine, ultimately, how that margin begins to develop over the next several months.","Mark A. Blinn","Let me add a couple of things to both of those. One is, Tom has a -- and all of them has, really, a good group of people in there. So one important message is as we look at this opportunity, and yes, Tom is busy, he's always busy, but he's got some really good folks to help him out. And I think that's important to understand as well. And of course, and I made this point in the Investor Day, we all have a tremendous amount of confidence in Tom and his team. And so I think -- I just want to make sure that's very clear here as we look forward. And then, Scott, just again on your currency issue. I mean, it was against the full year. If you look at the currency benefit we got, it was rather small for the full year. But a good way to look at it is there's above-the-line and below-the-line impact. And look, if a dollar strengthens 10% against all of our foreign currencies, we have a disclosure in our K. And if you think about 70% of our businesses in those foreign currencies, that's a 7% hit right there on -- as it kind of flows through. So what's important -- a lot of people get focused on our below-the-line, but the currency hits us above and below the line. It's part of being predominantly an international business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So could you talk a little bit about the price competition you're seeing on the engineered pumps versus the IPD segment? Are you seeing more competition on the pricing side and the more standardized IPD products versus the engineered products at this point, or is it pretty broad-based?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, the big -- we've talked about this before. The big large projects that you see out there are still competitive. Because if you look at our industry and the capacity, which is getting incrementally utilized, but that's one of the best and most efficient ways, efficient in terms of you can get it, get it to that capacity, getting that capacity utilized overall in the industry. It's the heritage of our industry. It's the old iron concept of our business overall. It's these big, big projects. And so they're fairly -- they are competitive at this point in time. When you look at FCD and IPD, those can -- it's probably not as broad based. You may have pricing competition in certain areas. But you tend to have more pricing power quicker because of the short cycle nature of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about these lower margin shipments coming out of backlog. That's been kind of a key theme for a number of quarters now. And a few quarters ago, we were talking about lower margin business and backlog that was booked at less favorable pricing during the downturn. And now we're talking about past due backlog, which is more related to either a customer delay or an execution issue or what have you. So I guess the question is, are we done with the low margin business that was booked during the downturn? And are we now just focused on kind of cleaning up our own execution or customer delays and working on past due current backlog?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, there\u2019s still both. And some of them are both. And what I mean is some of the ones that were booked years ago that they haven\u2019t taken delivery on or are late in delivery, those were projects that were competitively priced and haven't gotten any better in terms of their margin profile. And then you have the projects that were booked in '10 or '11 that are not due to be shipped yet that are still coming through in a more price competitive environment. And then you have some projects that were booked early part of last year, which have run delayed more shorter cycle mainly in IPD, which have been delayed in cost. The general theme is the longer -- and ENCs [ph] know this, customers know this. This is why lead time is so important. The longer a project stays in the plant, the more costs attach to it. So it's really a combination of the things. But in general, the market-driven impact, what you heard from us in the summer was selectivity and stabilization in these bigger projects. That will take whatever the lead time is, but typically, a year-plus. So the market-driven aspect, you can start to see clear towards the latter half of this year. The past due typically comes at the end of a cycle. Those are the ones that are late. We're going to -- we talked about -- we really started talking about those on the third quarter call. We expected to get those out over the next couple of quarters. Fourth quarter, first and second quarter is primarily where we'll get most of that moved out. So those are the 2 forces that are driving it.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Right. And you said you moved out $60 million in Q4, and you're planning to do another $60 million in the first half. But I thought I heard a 20% number on the call today. Can you explain what the 20% is? Is $60 million only 20% -- or is that 20% of this past due backlog?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, that's correct. I mean, we\u2019re always going to have some past due backlog. And we measure that as a term of our efficiency and on-time delivery and all. And when you have the multitude of projects and the size of business we have, we're going to have some of that. What's happened over the last several quarters is that's gone up probably about up to about $120 million, $130 million. So what we mentioned is that we've shipped about $60 million of that in Q4. We've got about $60 million additional to get down to kind of our normalized past due backlog, which we measure as a percent of backlog, and generally, kind of best in class is in that 5% to 7% range.","Mark A. Blinn","So with historically, there's always an element of past due backlog, but a couple of things about it. It's not necessarily all low margin past due backlog. If you look back in '08, '09, that was not the case. We had past due backlog. You will always have it for certain reasons. Because what we do is we're very rigorous to measuring to the contractual date. Even though the customer may have asked you to extend it for a period of time, it becomes past due backlog. So we want to keep the metric very, very pure so -- what Mike was talking about. But keep in mind, stuff moved in and out of past due backlog in the fourth quarter.","Michael S. Taff","But in quantum, that balance reduced 20%. And again, we think we've got another 20% to go to kind of get it below that $200 million mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So just a follow-up to the last question on the past due backlog. Is the right way to think about that the past due backlog that's shipped in the fourth quarter and scheduled for the first half, that's the most material impact, for instance, on margins? And once you get that, you're sort of back to, kind of, a normalized level of where the past due usually runs?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, that's what we anticipate. What Mike talked about is as we move into the back half of the year, we'll get to more normalized levels. And our expectation is Tom, over time, will drive those normalized levels to new lower levels. So we don't -- we're not satisfied. We're just going back to where we were before. But I think, just a couple of things to think about. Past due backlog that is late, that is, comes from a competitive pricing environment is low or no margin type of backlog that goes through. So I think that's the distinction I want to make is we could have -- we had past due backlog coming out of the last strong cycle, and it still had good margin in it. So I don't ever want to associate past due backlog across the board is 0 or small margin business. But in this instance, what we have is backlog that came out of a competitive environment and that has been delayed. And those 2 things will compound to a low margin backlog. That's probably the best way to think about it.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right, that's helpful. And then maybe just on IPD. One of the trends this year, there was price pressure like in some of the other businesses, as well as some higher material costs. Just wondering how that feels now on the pricing side, whether some of that pressure is relieving and how you feel your, kind of, price cost on the material side is balanced as we go into 2012.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, I do think if you look at '11, I mean, there was some pricing pressure due to the competitiveness that lingered around there. We did have some, maybe some slightly negative or neutral material. I think we're probably going to see the material maybe take a slight upswing, but that's some of the forecasts that have been out there. I would say, on the short cycle business, we've been indicating that seems to be have been rebounding through 2011. And I would consider the short cycle business to continue maybe with that trend going forward; a little bit different than the longer cycle business where we\u2019ve mentioned that we still have some of that price competitiveness.","Michael S. Taff","And as I looked at Tom's opportunities, the market-driven price we talked about. But I also see that Tom's going to be able to get more pricing powers as he continues to improve the execution because that's one of the primary determinants of price in the short cycle business. You've seen it in FCD. This is why we talked about -- look at FCD to see what the opportunity can be in IPD, is he drives cycle times down. And matters of that, he's going to get pricing power.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Bremer.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Let's stay with the FCD for a minute, very nice growth year-over-year. Looking pretty much at the sales for the fourth quarter was up less than 6%. And the bookings, especially on the aftermarket there, were down 10% in the fourth quarter. Is this just sort of like a timing issue that you called out in your release? Or is there something more here that needs to be focused on?","Mark A. Blinn","Taking a step back, looking at the year, I mean, a big contributor to what you saw on the bookings and sales was the acquisition. So I think this is why we're excited about the Valbart acquisition. They grew the business, they were able to grow the operating earnings, and it was right along our strategy. It was a product that we needed, that we had the platform to deliver, and FCD did it and did it very well. When you typically look at it, and you can look over a couple of years, you've seen, oftentimes, Q3 can be stronger than Q4. I think the most important point on this, I can say, is we've said we're not a quarter-to-quarter business. Don't look for a trend overall in FCD or in anything else unless we call it out on a quarter-over-quarter basis. They had a great year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Two follow-up questions. One is, if you can comment a little bit about some of the operating initiatives on Lawrence Pumps? And anything that you've seen on the upside or negative in terms of surprises? And then lastly, if you can comment on section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, if you've seen any project activity relating to that?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I'm going to defer on the 316(b) to somebody else in the room because I don't know what it is. But I can comment generally on Lawrence Pumps. As you take a step back, it was a good operation, functioning very well, great product. We've been very pleased with that acquisition so far. So we haven't broken it out specifically or anything because we've really integrated it into our business, overall. But we're thrilled with that acquisition.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","How have you started to leverage the sales force? I mean, I guess that's what I wanted to get a better handle of is, where are you getting the leverage or where you expect to see the leverage?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, if you think about it, if you look at us versus a lot of our competitors, we have a very broad product offering. And that's important for, we think, a concept around balance of plant. You look at some of these big facilities, and Lawrence Pumps is a critical service piece of equipment. So now our sales force, after we train them, and they've known about the product, many of them have coveted it for many years, is they take a step back. Now they have another arrow in their quiver when they go in and talk about an opportunity, be it an original equipment, greenfield opportunity, a brownfield upgrade and repair or, more important, on the aftermarket side. Now they have another product that they can take care of, another product that -- to bring into their portfolio. So what we do with that is, it went from a Massachusetts-based with some sales agents around the world to, all a sudden, it had over, close to 1,000 people that were immediately trained in the product and were capable of selling -- capable in selling it, understood it. And they understood it before. They were well aware of the product. So that's what the opportunity is on the sales side. And now, if you've been to one of our QRCs, I mean, it is capable of servicing, repairing, upgrading one of these Lawrence Pumps. So now all of a sudden, as opposed to the piece of equipment being served by a local agent, which is oftentimes the case, our sales person there says, \"Look, we'll take this and that and this other piece of equipment to our QRC and take care of it.\"","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Beach.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have a question about aftermarket. Are there any new drivers to sustain this, I'll say, give or take, double-digit, low-double digit growth that you see emerging here in 2012 into 2013? For example, outsourcing, is it showing some accelerating trends? And is there anything else that would, kind of, drive and sustain this good growth?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think it's more around market positioning and opportunity. As we talked about in the Investor Day, the external market growth was certainly moderated for this year and stronger in subsequent years. But I think it's really riding on some of the momentum that we've been talking about up to this point. I can go through a couple of them. FCD's further penetration in the oil and gas industry. A couple of years ago, they were heavily concentrated towards the chemical side. They have now a strong and increasingly stronger position on the oil and gas side as well. It's pushing technologies out. It's getting in front of more customers on the aftermarket side. So it's really more of the same in light of some of the challenges that you see out there around Europe and other regions.","Thomas L. Pajonas","And I would add to what Mark indicated that our coverage in all areas around the world currently isn't the same. So for instance, great opportunities in China and Latin America right now for aftermarket coverage, same thing in Russia. So as we start developing those areas along with the Middle East, that will give us opportunities. We see a lot of clients continuing to move towards, I would say, total cost of ownership in their overall strategic plan, as they look at managing their assets, which get us into now more fee-based LCA arrangements with them. So that's also a good opportunity. And I would also say, as you see the oil and gas business, the power business go to more critical applications, higher pressures, higher temperatures that also brings that aspect into it requiring more maintenance or more governance on the overall plants.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Mike Mullin","Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with the company's performance in 2013, including our strong third quarter results. The key factor driving our significant operating and earnings leverage across the business is the commitment of our dedicated employees in executing our initiatives and strategies. Their efforts have prepared the company for growth.","Our focus over the last 18 months on operational improvement and capital structure efficiency position the company for upcoming market opportunities. Profitably growing the business and delivering value for our shareholders remain our top priorities. We delivered on these priorities during the quarter. We turned mid-single-digit revenue growth into double-digit increase in operating income, which resulted in a 30% improvement year-over-year in EPS. In particular, we were encouraged by the strong flow-through to gross margin and operating margin. Our solid performance and improved operating margins resulted from strong revenue growth in EPD, improved IPD operations, consistent strong performance in FCD and reduced SG&A in each segment. We again demonstrated the earnings leverage available within our diverse and stable business profile, and the propensity for further operational improvements is significant.","We remain committed to delivering value to our customers and shareholders by focusing on growth, operational excellence and volume leverage, thoughtful cost control and optimizing our capital structure efficiency, including returning value to our shareholders. We believe this formula of disciplined growth, improving operations and reduced share count is the key component to our solid year-to-date results in 2013 and provides the foundation for continued earnings leverage over the coming years.","Speaking briefly to our end markets, some uncertainties remain. The world economy is fairly sluggish, and the unpredictable political environment creates delays in investment decisions regarding major, long-term infrastructure projects. Despite these issues, we are encouraged as Europe has demonstrated stability and signs of improvement. North America has been steady, and good opportunities are ahead on the strength of oil and gas and chemical projects. Macro growth in Asia is expected to continue, and our objective is to increase our presence. Latin America should see increased customer spending over the next few years, assuming currency and political stability, and we continue to believe that Russia and the Middle East will require increased investment to further expand and update their capacity. In fact, we have started to see a few customers proceed with large infrastructure projects, but as expected, they have been very competitive. Considering large project activity is not yet ramped to the level we anticipate in the near future, we will remain disciplined and selective. We expect that the pace of these opportunities will quicken as evidenced by a number of significant projects awarded to EPCs in the energy space and, in particular, some large chemical projects in the Gulf Coast. These awards and the continued progress of other projects we are tracking are good leading indicators of our OE business.","We were pleased to receive a few medium-sized orders during the third quarter, including one project order for approximately $30 million. These awards, in combination with our steady run rate original equipment business, resulted in our highest quarterly level of original equipment bookings since the first quarter of 2012. Our confidence, that the cycle is beginning to turn with a low-cost natural gas tailwind, continues to build. Backed by solid original equipment orders, we are pleased with our overall third quarter bookings level, which exceeded $1.2 billion in total. This sum represents a 3.7% increase year-over-year and is the third sequential quarter of total bookings growth. This quarter's growth was achieved despite a difficult compare period. As you may recall, the 2012 third quarter included large bookings in excess of $90 million in IPD. Aftermarket bookings of $479 million remain solid as we continue to execute our global end-user strategies. As discussed previously, many of our refining customers had deferred some of the scheduled maintenance since late last year due to strong margins. However, these deferrals are temporary and the needed maintenance work will build, so we expect the situation to abate in the future and ultimately return to normal seasonal activity.","Looking briefly at segment performance. EPD's earnings power was demonstrated in the third quarter with nearly 1\/3 of its $84 million revenue increase flowing through to operating income despite the increased sequential legacy shipments. IPD's operational results continue to deliver year-over-year improvement, increasing gross margins by 120 basis points and delivering operating margins of 11.3%. This trajectory maintains its trend line and remains on pace to achieve the segment's targeted range for operating margins of 14% to 15% by 2015.","FCD, which has had strong and consistent growth in operating performance for many years, delivered its highest gross margin since the first quarter of 2010. The operational excellence demonstrated in this segment reflects the opportunities for all of our businesses.","Looking forward to the 2013 fourth quarter and beyond, we expect to continue building momentum and anticipate growth ahead. With another quarter of solid operating improvement behind us, I remain confident the management team and our employees are focused on the right areas. We are taking the strategic actions needed to capture opportunities within our core markets, operations, cost structure and existing global footprint.","Let me now turn the call over to Tom for his operational review.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I, too, am pleased with our third quarter financial results. This performance is visible evidence of the operating progress we have made. Our disciplined investments in the operating platform are delivering returns. These initiatives, including improved quality, project management, aftermarket service capabilities, project pursuit and sales organization initiatives, will position Flowserve to meet or exceed customer expectations and capture opportunities from a strengthening cycle.","Over the last year or so, we have talked about the importance of improving our key metrics and processes. One area where we have made significant progress this quarter is with on-time delivery. During the third quarter, we drove our past due backlog below 6%. This is a quarter level not seen since 2009. In a continuous improvement environment, we recognize that our work is never complete. We still have working capital and cash generation goals to achieve. But with our recent steady improvement of DSO and on-time delivery, it gives me confidence we are pulling the right levers, giving our people the necessary tools to reach our goals and will enable a high level of performance going forward.","Our strong operating performance also helped drive impressive gross margin expansion. This increase occurred in spite of a somewhat lower aftermarket percentage. We also generated outstanding flow-through as our focus on controlling costs resulted in lower SG&A across our segments and allowed more of a top line growth to result as income. Sequentially, we also had a sizable increase in the shipments of legacy backlog.","Turning to our order activity. We remain optimistic. Third quarter bookings were up 3.7% year-over-year, driven by growth in all regions, except Latin America. EPD bookings were the highlight within our segments. EPD increases total bookings by over 20%, primarily driven by 53% growth in original equipment. Flowserve's consolidated bookings this quarter once again demonstrated the value of our diverse end markets and regional exposures. For instance, IPD bookings were down on a tough compare to last year's third quarter. However, excluding the impact of a group of large orders exceeding $90 million last year at IPD, its bookings would have increased roughly 18% this quarter. Similarly, FCD's bookings were down 2% for the 2013 third quarter, but year-to-date remained up a very solid 6.6% for the year. As Mark discussed, our bookings continued to rely on our reoccurring aftermarket and run rate activity. However, we did win a few medium-sized projects in the third quarter. This type of OE work, in combination with the EPC awards we have seen, is a positive sign that the market is nearing a turn. We remain confident that the number of large projects are in the pipeline and expected for release over the next few quarters. I will again emphasize, however, that our approach to bidding will remain disciplined. Executing on the processes deployed throughout the organization over the last 18 months has proven successful and remains critical to the overall long-term quality of our backlog.","Summarizing our end markets. The chemical market remains strong and the outlook is very positive, further buoyed by recent EPC project award for new ethane capacity in the Gulf Coast. The announced level of North American shale gas-related investments is impressive, valued at over $70 billion, and the majority of this capacity is destined for ethylene or ethylene-derivative projects.","The Middle East is also continuing their drive towards downstream diversification, while Asia and Latin America are reassessing their chemical development plans.","Turning to oil and gas. Current oil prices, and the positive long-term outlook, clearly support major investments. Significant refinery projects in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America are expected. North America continues the strong growth in pipeline construction to address new pipeline capacity requirements, refinery upgrades in gas processing and gas-to-liquids plants to capitalize on advantaged natural gas and oil supplies. Also in North America, we see a shift in the coming opportunities. Western contractors executing oil and gas projects that will remain here, particularly along the U.S. Gulf Coast, should be an advantageous development for Flowserve, considering our presence in the region. Expected changes in Mexico, allowing foreign participation in its oil and gas production, should provide a potential opportunity for us.","Additionally, we are pleased that LNG production and export terminals in North America continue the permitting process, which could be another source of growth. In other upstream regions, floating production, storage and offloading FPSOs; opportunities remain steady in Brazil, Africa and Asia Pacific.","Moving to the power market. We see it growing driven by the fossil-based initiatives in China and India. The Middle East also signals strong future growth both in conventional and solar power. North America and Europe remain slower due to conservation and low growth in energy demand. Recent EPA rules for coal plants may require carbon capture, which is still developing. Nuclear power remains in transition, although even Japan is considering restarting a number of plants. Additionally, opportunities continue in upgrades, operates [ph] and recertification of aging, existing plants. Finally, we are seeing an increased focus globally on natural gas fuel combined cycle plants. Our general industry markets continue to see high activity levels in global fertilizer projects. Mining companies are investing more carefully of late, but good levels continue in parts of Southern Africa, Latin America and North America. The desalination market is also displaying encouraging signs as industry experts expect new plant orders increasing over the next few years.","Finally, our distribution business, primarily valves, was very solid. This activity largely derived from orders supporting global oil and gas projects.","Wrapping up, our operational progress over the last 1.5 years is significant. However, I'm equally encouraged by the propensity of the organization to continue this momentum and capitalize on additional opportunities. We look to finish the year strong, and I'm confident that our improved operating platform and solid backlog have us well-positioned to deliver on our full year commitments and set the foundation for the future.","With that overview, let me now turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Mark and Tom have pretty well covered our operational overview and business outlook, so I'll quickly discuss our financial results in greater detail.","While Flowserve's value proposition is much more than any individual quarter, we are pleased with our reported results and continue to gain momentum. We generated strong leverage off solid revenue growth of 5.4% on a reported basis and 6.4% on a constant currency. This brought our year-to-date constant currency revenue growth to 4.9%, which is right in the middle of our 2013 revenue growth target range of 4% to 6%. Our OE to aftermarket sales mix this quarter shifted 1 percentage point to 62% OE versus last year, which pressured gross margins.","Looking at margins. As we indicated last call, we expected third quarter gross margin pressure in EPD, which occurred as we shipped a sizable amount of previously delayed legacy backlog. Offsetting this and the lower aftermarket sales were strong gross margin performance in IPD and FCD, which together, enabled impressive gross margin improvement of 100 basis points. This improvement demonstrates the impact of our bidding discipline and selectivity. It also reflects the solid operational improvements that Tom discussed.","Turning to SG&A. We drove a reduction of absolute dollars spend in each segment, excluding corporate. This resulted in a decrease of 70 basis points in consolidated SG&A as a percentage of sales, and was driven by disciplined, thoughtful cost control and solid leverage, notably in EPD. We continue to focus on our longer-term goal of driving additional leverage from this expense as we target SG&A, as a percentage of sales, to be consistently in the 18% range. The initiatives we are currently executing, combined with a growing top line, should keep us on pace to deliver on this commitment in the coming years. The strong leverage in our business was demonstrated again this quarter, with a 16.7% increase in operating income coming off the 5.4% reported revenue growth. Operating margins increased an impressive 150 basis points to 15.7%, primarily driven by the 220 and 210 basis point increases in EPD and FCD, respectively.","We continue to believe we are on pace to achieve our consolidated operating margin objective of 100 to 200 basis point improvement by 2014, off of year-end 2012 levels, as well as IPD's targeted operating margin goal of 14% to 15% by 2015. For the second consecutive quarter, we saw a relatively calm foreign exchange environment. As such, we experienced minimal impact from the sequential mark-to-market of our currency hedges and our balance sheet items in nonfunctional currencies. Our tax rate for the quarter was 30.6%, and we anticipate this 31% level for the fourth quarter.","Turning to cash flows. We delivered solid improvement year-over-year and sequentially. Flowserve generated $142 million from our operations during the 2013 third quarter. Capital expenditures were $34 million and we repurchased $64 million of our shares. At quarter end, we have $473 million remaining under our current buyback authorization. We will continue to execute on our strategy to efficiently deploy capital to the most accretive, long-term alternatives, including organic and acquisitive growth and returning capital to our shareholders.","As in prior years, we expect to generate a significant portion of our full-year operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we continue to focus on working capital initiatives to address identified opportunities for improvement. Our goal remains to consistently generate annual free cash flow near our net income level.","Turning to primary working capital. We produced some improvement in the 2013 third quarter year-over-year with a reduction in DSO by 5 days. This builds upon the progress we made in the second quarter with year-over-year improvement of 3 days in that quarter. Inventory turns remained essentially flat with the 2012 third quarter; however, we were especially pleased with the significant progress on our goal to reduce past due backlog, achieving a quarter end level not seen since 2009. These steady improvements in our DSO, combined with the reductions in past due backlog, provide confidence that we are progressing towards our working capital goals of mid-60s DSO and inventory turns of 4x to 4.5x.","Looking ahead to our EPS guidance and outlook. We are raising the low end of our 2013 guidance range to $3.33 from $3.20 per share and leaving the upper band at $3.53 per share. Our confidence in this move follows our strong year-to-date results, as well as our continuing operational improvements and solid performance of the run rate and aftermarket businesses. Similar to last year, our full year share repurchase activity may impact average share counts such that full-year EPS could be slightly lower than the sum of the 4 individual quarters. Considering we're near the midpoint of our organic sales growth guidance, we left the 4% to 6% range changed on a neutral FX basis.","Turning to our spending priorities. As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to return value to our shareholders and remain committed to deploying cash to the most accretive long-term alternative, including bolt-on acquisitions. Importantly, we will invest in our business to deliver profitable growth and solid organic returns. Forecasting 2013 CapEx of $120 million to $130 million to further increase our worldwide capabilities. Other uses of cash we expect this year include pension contributions and scheduled debt repayments, but these amounts remain fairly modest in comparison to the other priorities. In the fourth quarter, we amended, upsized and extended our senior credit facility. We very much appreciate our banking partners' ongoing commitment to Flowserve and look forward to working with them over the coming years.","With this amendment, we will have under $1 million of noncash expense in the fourth quarter, but we expect rapid payback on this investment. We believe our capital allocation approach with a targeted debt-to-EBITDA between 1x and 2x provides the flexibility to grow the business organically, return capital to shareholders and invest in strategic bolt-ons, and will continue to produce solid returns for shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jay.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on some of these larger projects, Mark, could you maybe comment on how you plan on balancing, taking on lower margin OE work with the potential of potentially getting the lucrative aftermarket revenue stream from that versus just completely walking away from some of these projects?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, that is an essential part of our sales and operation process when we look at a project opportunity. So to give you an example on 2 different types of projects, on a water project where we know there won't be a lot of aftermarket attachment, we've got to get our economics in the original equipment bid. If you look at a project like we did in the Middle East, the Yanbu one, which was very competitive, had little economics on the OE side. We're going to build a QRC near that facility and be able to harvest the aftermarket for years. So our process is designed to look at really the long-term economics. We look at it as almost like investing in a bond. And you look for the type of returns you're going to get over the horizon of your investment, keeping in mind some of these investments will be out there for 20 and 30 years.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then any comments on the uptick you saw in EPD bookings? Specifically just your thoughts around these medium-sized projects beginning to hit versus some of the larger projects that maybe some of your competitors have said have gotten pushed out a bit?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, some of these mediums were a part of very large facilities. We were just very laser-focused in terms of the type of projects that we took on them. But the uptick is just that. It is the early stages of what you're seeing in the project opportunities that are out there. So this is typically the way a cycle goes through. The big projects never come as quickly as you'd like and -- but what you start to see are some of the longer lead time, more complicated-type products that get put out. They tend to be smaller orders. And then you move into the other stages of the projects. So it's a good -- definitely a good leading indicator as we look at the project opportunities over the horizon.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And just a last one for me, I'll turn it over. On the M&A landscape, any thought process there? You guys have been out of the market for a while. Has anything that's changed there?","Mark A. Blinn","No, and we haven't been out of the market. We've -- you haven't seen anything -- we've been fairly disciplined, but we're actively looking at opportunities for growth. Keeping in mind with the opportunities we have organically, we're going to remain disciplined and selective in terms of what assets we take on and how quickly we can lever them. What we look for is something that we can lever on our platform pretty quickly. If you look at Flowserve, we have a very expansive platform, a broad product set. And what we want to be able to do is really take this and drive quick revenue growth and margin improvement when we bring an asset in. We don't want to spend a tremendous amount of time with complex, multiyear integration.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is a question more for Tom than anyone. When the projects that you're referring to and have been referring to for a while finally start to get released by the OEs onto the EPCs, where do you think that happens first? I'm assuming your thinking there is kind of broad-based, but maybe more tilted toward North America? Are you thinking it's going to be more tilted towards chemicals? Just give us an idea of how you see the sequencing of this.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Well, if you take a look at some of the large projects, I mean, we're having some good activity now down in the Gulf Coast. You've seen some of the recent EPC announcements there on some of the ethylene business on the chemicals side. So my expectation is that's some of the larger projects you'll begin to see in the U.S. There's also some good LNG activity with the permitting process going on as we look at exporting out of the U.S. So I would say, you're going to probably see some of that and we've already seen some early indications with some of the EPC announcements. I would also indicate the FPSO activity has been good around the world, particularly in Brazil and some of the other areas. Combined cycle power plants, we're seeing a pick up there. And I would say, the pickup is certainly in the Asian region, the Middle East. And we've seen a lot of activity now in that area now starting to come into the U.S., particularly since the U.S. coal market is going through some changes at this point in time. So I would say that the chemical market, in particular, you'll see the projects, see it on the combined cycle power plants, certainly the FPSOs and -- what I would say, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. This is a question now for Mark. The increase in your footprint that you're referring to in some of the emerging markets, could you give us a little bit more of what you meant by that? Are you talking -- I assume you're talking QRCs, but I mean, headcount, where is it going, when is it coming?","Mark A. Blinn","No, it's actually manufacturing facilities, so that we can bring product to market in those locations. So in China, we're actually building our third manufacturing facility there. It'll be complete. We're actually opening it next month. In Coimbatore, we're going to open our third block of manufacturing in that area. So we'll have multiple facilities. The significance of that in terms of growth, Scott, is that, that's how you access those markets is you -- with local manufacturing, local sourcing. So when we think about how we enter into an emerging market, the first thing we think about is how we're going to migrate products over into that market. You got to create the manufacturing to do that because they'll only let you import for so long. And also, you need to be competitive. So what that means in terms of this capacity there, first and foremost, is it's going to give us more penetration, a better competitive footprint in those markets to grow the business there. We've got a lot of opportunity in China in terms of being able to grow that business. And then ultimately, these facilities, the secondary benefit is they help support our operations around the world in terms of LPO\/SPO, so that we can drive our manufacturing costs down.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, so it's nothing incremental versus what you guys have been doing. I guess, I thought that you meant something new on the board for QRCs. You're not saying that?","Mark A. Blinn","No, these are manufacturing facilities, what I was referring to. And the term is, \"must be present to win,\" in these regions of the world. And we're expanding our presence not only physically, but in terms of the products that we offer in those markets as well. Now on the QRC front, those are very much driven by where the capacity that needs either physical capacity support or human support and that's where we basically will put those resources. So when you're looking over in Asia, you're talking about Malaysia and certain parts of the region there, even Vietnam where they need support, we have been adding QRCs in those regions.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. Last question. This is kind of back to Tom, and you and I talked about this at the Analyst Meeting. I just -- you guys continue to show this resilience in your power business that's not really being seen on the, certainly, on the manufacturing side or the generation side, I should say, by others. You alluded just now to at the end of your comments that the U.S. business, you're kind of seeing what everyone else is kind of weak. What are you guys doing differently today or is it just that your footprint is able to garner new business. But you guys have been outperforming that market now for probably 2 years, I'd say. What is it that you're doing there that is really kind of enabling that?","Thomas L. Pajonas","I mean -- Scott, I mean, I think the #1 thing is we've got a very diversified portfolio not only of products, but of assets on the ground in order to service those markets locally. So I would say that, that's one of the biggest things. The other thing I would say is that we have been active obviously in India and China and that coal market is still doing pretty good there. The nuclear market, we've maintained as we've discussed before, all of our certifications over the years, even though that, that market has been going through some changes. So as those revamps and upgrades have now switched on the nuclear side from all the new builds that they were going to do maybe to those revamps and upgrades, recertifications, we're right there with our assets to be able to do that. The solar market, we're still seeing the solar market being active in Spain and Africa. And obviously, we have facilities there. And then lastly, even though the coal market is going through some changes on a worldwide basis and we're seeing some aftermarket pressures certainly in the U.S. on that, we see a pickup on the combined cycle power plants coming because of the low cost of natural gas. So I would say it's a diversification of our assets and products and some movements in the markets as I've indicated.","Mark A. Blinn","So, Scott, one thing to add on, if you look at one of our presentations from a couple years ago, we said our business is linked to global secular trends around population growth. With the broad product opportunity around the world, what it allows us to do is to tilt into those secular trends as opposed to what may be a more episodic trend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So first, on the margin line, obviously, really strong performance there. Could you just talk about your view on the sustainability at these levels, particularly EPD, FCD, where there was some very strong leverage that you saw in the quarter. Anything to suggest that on a forward basis, this isn't a pretty good base to build off of?","Thomas L. Pajonas","You know me, Mike, I won't guide specifically on margins. But go back to our statement that we made at the beginning of this year around propensity in our business. And I think an important message here not only in terms of what you're seeing in the financials, but our ability to compete for opportunities going forward is the platform is improving. And so what you are seeing, particularly in EPD, is that we've seen some of the facilities start to execute better, not all of them. Some of the facilities are starting to execute better, which helps them penetrate the customers better. And then you add to that good fixed cost leverage on the SG&A line, and that's what drives margins. So despite the fact that gross margins had decreased, we get good operating leverage on SG&A. And that's the way that business is. Keep in mind, a lot -- just -- if you take a step back and think about where a lot of the costs in a long project are embedded in cost to sales in the gross margin line because you allocated to the specific project. Turning to IPD, what we are pleased with is that we saw good gross margin improvement, which is reflective of the improving operations. It didn't get the fixed cost leverage because on the sales side, that was expected. Our priority with IPD has been improving the platform. Because if you grow a business when the platform isn't ready for it, it's tough. You let your customers down. We've seen that movie. So now what we're focused on in IPD is driving growth in that business so that we can continue to get the operational leverage in the gross margin line but to start to cascade it on the G&A line. They've been very good with costs. And then on the EPD [ph] line, I think the way to think about that business is, as I mentioned, that business has been performing at what we think is a very high level for a number of years. It's had the benefit of processes that we're putting in place across the company for many years, and that's why you see it operate so strong. So that's probably the way to think about the business. And then overall, the last remaining thing in the P&L, is if you look at, in a sense, the corporate line is that we just need to be disciplined and diligent as we have over the couple of years of controlling corporate costs. Those are things that we have direct line of sight to and are within our control. Mike, to a question we had earlier, the improving platform and the margin power that we can deliver, does help us participate at good levels in the project opportunities that are going to start coming up. Now we will remain disciplined because you live with this backlog for a long time. If you think about it, the backlog, the duration in our backlog last year to this year has decreased significantly, and the economics has improved substantially.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes sense. That was the color I was looking for there. And then 2 related questions, one, what does the utilization look like now through the portfolio, at least generally? And then second, when you think about the throughput in the operational improvement initiatives you guys are pushing forward in the platform, you obviously said, it's stickier at some places than others. How far down the road would you characterize the process is today?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean we're all -- especially with the capacity that we're adding, we're always looking at how we optimize our capacity at a holistic level and we'll always continue to do that. And that may be what products do we put into some of our mature market facilities that we can leverage the LPO\/SPO strategy? So we're adding product capabilities through R&D and development. But we also look at, as we've done, we consistently are looking for how we improve it in those facilities. I think in terms of the operational improvement, we still have probably 2 or 3 years to go to get to where we expect this company to be.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. And then the last one is, could you just talk a little bit about industry pricing dynamics, how much stability that you're seeing there? Obviously, internally, you're doing a lot better job of being more selective, but how does the landscape look beyond just what Flowserve's doing?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think there's -- as I mentioned, there's the external and the internal. The external is -- is you anticipate with these projects, the first one to come out tend to be competitive. Because as we've had this discussion, everybody's anxious to see these, they want to grab them when they -- when these opportunities come out. So that's the external force. What will happen though, is over time with the cadence of the projects as they come, they tend to become less competitive. They're still competitive, and they were competitive in '08 as well. I'm not suggesting they're not. I think the internal thing is equally important. Our ability to compete. There's still a lot of leverage we're pulling in this business to make sure we can drive our efficiency to much higher levels, which enables us to certainly compete better. And I think that's a good example when I went back to IPD. Getting that platform improved helps them compete better and it's the same thing in EPD as well. What we've seen is the good consistent performance in FCD has enabled them to really compete well and respond well and drive growth. So those are the aspects of competition. We're operating our business if it's going to remain competitive because good competitors out there, what we see in a lot of the competitors that you are certainly familiar with is, I think, they're driving discipline as well. A lot of things we've been talking about, we hear them talking about as well, which is not a bad sign for our industry. But these first projects will tend to be competitive.","Operator","And our next question comes from a Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I just want to touch on EPD, specifically on the OE part of the business. I guess, the one thing that really kind of stuck out to me today was how strong the OE sales were in the quarter. And you did have very strong orders in the quarter as well, but kind of looking over the past year, I mean, the order profile has not been that strong. I always kind of sense EPD being a fairly long-cycle business, 12 to 18 months from order to delivery. And so the Q3 results really does not reflect that type of pattern. I'm just curious, is there a shorter-cycle complexion to the business that maybe I'm just missing? Can you -- if you could touch on that, that would be helpful.","Mark A. Blinn","Over half its sales is aftermarket. So -- I mean, we need to always remember that, that over -- and that's a very, very short-cycle business. So you've seen that consistent growth in the aftermarket. And while it's not double-digit order growth and sales growth year-over-year, it is very high margin. So it has great contribution to the gross margin and to the operating margin line.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. But, Mark, I was specifically referring to the OE part of the business, though, kind of comparing the trailing 12-month sales order profile versus what you did in sales in the quarter, on -- specifically on OE. It just does not kind of jive with what we've seen -- jive with the patterns on the order front. And I always got the perception that it was a long-cycle business. So the performance you had a year ago would be kind of showing up today.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, a couple of things, the duration of their backlog as we moved it out has certainly shortened. So fair to say that the long-cycle nature as we've taken some of these legacy projects out has certainly become shorter. They do have some shorter OE, run rate OE business, absolutely in the business. But I think that's part of what you're seeing is the -- and now some of these medium-sized projects come in, in the order book. So I think as you look at that, the long-cycle nature of that business is working through the cycle going back to 5 years ago, right? They were heavily loaded with long-cycle backlog coming into 2009 and 2010. It was high-priced. That carried them and their margins for a number of years. Then there was still long-cycle business at that point in time and -- but it was -- the economics were significantly different from the '08 time period backlog, and that's starting to run through as well. We had quite a bit of that in the backlog last year. So that's starting to run through right now. But with their improved execution and some of the opportunities that we're seeing, they're starting to fill that backlog back up. The difference is, it's better quality, it has better economics and we're executing on it better. Did that answer your question?","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes. But just kind of looking -- maybe taking a step further, I know you don't want to give 2014 guidance, but kind of looking at the order trends in the first half of 2013 on the OE side, I mean, you were down between 10% and 15%. I mean, conceptually, are we thinking that the EPD, OE sales could kind of level out over the next 12 months even though your order profile continues to improve?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, you're right, I don't want to give guidance, but I think you hit it on an important trend. We were sitting here in the fourth quarter of last year, and if you looked at the prior 3 quarters of sequential bookings, they were down. And go from that point, now you look over the last 3 quarters, sequential bookings have generally been up, and the same thing is in EPD as well. That's a good sign for sales growth opportunities in the future.","But you're right, I don't want -- we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We typically put out guidance right at the beginning of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Let's talk about IPD for a second. I guess, you touched on this a little bit in a prior question, or an answer to a prior question about the growth platform. But I mean, you're talking about it on a 300, 400 basis points upside over the next couple of years from where we are coming out of Q3. And I'm just wondering if you can maybe -- what are the growth initiatives that get you to that kind of -- what is significant upside in the margins over a relatively short period of time?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, the #1 initiative is and continues to be improving execution. A lot of the IPD business is short cycle. And if you can't take care of your customer where [ph], they'll go somewhere else. So that's definitely been the #1. We wanted to get this thing improved before we started to grow it. That was a priority. Now we're turning our sights definitely to growth. So when we look at opportunities, product development, one of the areas that we expect to see growth in is, remember, we talked about the ISO chemical pump, some other product development areas, one of the questions earlier was on inorganic opportunities. Some of the assets out there you see could fit into this segment fairly well. But the key is going to be around execution because if you respond very quickly to a customer, they need it and you can actually get some power -- pricing power in doing that. So it is and has been around execution. Some of the -- we have actually, in a sense, given up some growth to prioritize execution over the last couple of years. But I think now we're in a good position to drive it.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just to one of your points on the inorganic growth opportunities. So as you look out into that pipeline, are you saying that there are acquisition opportunities where the margin profile of those potential deals would be margin-accretive to IPD when you roll them in?","Mark A. Blinn","That's a good premise. We look across, really, many of our segments in terms of many of our business platforms, so we just don't isolate it to one. I was just responding to your specific question about IPD. But that's absolutely the case. What we want to do is -- margin accretion is important and everything like that, but our primary premise on looking at an acquisition is getting an internal rate of return. And generally, we like 15% or greater, which ultimately should correlate to margins over a period of time. But as you know, sometimes, certainly with purchase price accounting, it takes a while to get there. But we look in terms of internal rate of return in the business. And so what we wouldn't want to do in IPD is something that we think has good margin improvement opportunities is to pass it up just because it won't get us the margins we need next quarter. That would be playing it too short term.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And if we just look at EPD for a second and a little bit back on the prior question about the OE orders, which were up pretty strong. I apologize if you covered this already, can you give us a sense of kind of end market of where those are coming out of and duration of the OE orders that you took in the third quarter? Or when they'll ship?","Mark A. Blinn","Sure, sure. I mean, the concept of run rate business, and we talked about a medium-sized order, really correlates to duration. So it's fair to say that you compare year-end backlog to where we are right now, the duration is shorter, especially as we moved some of what we called legacy and past due backlog through the system, which I can assure you has -- had very little economics to it. So the point to that is, we're still in what I'd call more of a shorter-duration-type booking environment, but we'll expect the longer ones to start come in.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, I would also add on the EPD side, I mean, just looking at some of the industries, the chemical bookings were very strong. The oil and gas bookings were also up. We had the power bookings, if you take a look at the -- we actually had -- the power bookings were up because of some desal projects that we're working on. And then if you looked at the regions, with the exception of Latin America, all the other regions were also upping the business. And the other good thing on the large projects is we're also seeing good FEED and pre-FEED activity on the large projects. So we're continuing with that trend. The EPCs are in there with the FEED work. We're also seeing now some of that FEED work result in bidding opportunities where the EPCs are now winning those larger projects and going into the bidding stage, particularly in the oil and gas, as well as in the power stage.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question on refinery maintenance. You mentioned that that's been deferred. When -- in a typical cycle like this when margins are strong for them, what -- when would you usually see that come back? Is that sort of a next year event when you would see that activity pick up?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, there's -- weather, especially in the Gulf Coast region, isn't a factor like you'd see in other areas where they have to do their maintenance during -- like in the power industry, they have to do it in the cool spring or in the fall. But basically, what you see in this industry is when margins expand out, they want to refine as much as they can because -- and that's their opportunity. So what they'll try to do is push out the times where they ultimately have to take it down. They can only go so far because the highest cost to them is if something goes wrong, if something breaks down in the facility. So -- and again, what you've seen right now with oil costs had come down a little bit, especially in the Midwest, that's going to push their margins up a little bit. So they'll continue to try to push this maintenance as long as they can, but it's really going to be more site-specific. There are certain critical points where they won't go past in terms of maintenance because then they run the risk that the facility shuts down on them. But in general, what you see is when refining margins gap out, spend will get deferred. And we've been living with that for a couple of quarters now. As Tom mentioned on some of what you've actually seen, we've been able to grow our aftermarket bookings despite the fact that some of the U.S. fossil power plants have been shut down.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. And then on SG&A, I know your target out for 2015 is in the 18% range, I think. You're getting great leverage there. Is the 18% sort of a long-term kind of run rate for the model? Are you starting to see more structural leverage maybe from some of the initiatives you've been putting in place over the last year or 2?","Mark A. Blinn","I think, in general, what you've seen to this point is a shift, not a change, but a shift in the culture. And these things take time. It can often be humbling in these roles to know that some of the changes you make take years to do. So we've seen some of that, I think, really getting down into some of the initiatives. We'll start having these opportunities over the next couple of years. But it's really reflective, we think, of driving a change in the culture, executing some initiatives, but investing in the business. So what -- companies can drive these things down to very, very low levels if they're willing to compromise some opportunities, some high-return investment opportunities in the future. We don't want to do that. So when we look at that objective, we took into consideration the change in the culture, driving some initiatives, the benefit of One Flowserve, which helps us leverage our G&A, but also where we wanted to invest.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then one last one on cash flows, showed some improvement there in DSOs. Can you maybe give us some more details on how you've been implementing those improvements so far, kind of what we might look for over the next 2, 3 quarters in terms of implementation process or milestones? And maybe if you could add some color on the inventory turn side, specifically with OE starting to pick up and how we should think about that?","Michael S. Taff","Jamie, it's Mike. I think we're pretty pleased. Again, I think, as Mark said, it's certainly a shift in the culture and we're not there. We're in the implementation phase. As you know, last year, we spent a lot of time kind of assessing the situation, and so now it's implementation. And so as I've said before, the easy part has been completed, which is the assessment. So now we know what we need to do, and now, we're in the implementation. But it's a big network. We've got a lot of locations out there. So I think you'll see incremental improvement, and that's why we set long-term goals. We're probably a little bit behind where I thought we would be, probably 1.5 years ago when I set these targets. But I do see some of the culture starting to shift, and I see the importance that both the financial organization, and importantly, Tom Troop's [ph] operational organization is putting on, on working capital and managing that working capital. So that's really what it's all about. It's process and procedure and culture changes that we're doing, both on the receivables side, as well as the inventory management side. We're getting guys in from all part of Tom's operations involved, both from the procurement side, doing a better job of on-time procurement. We're getting project management folks involved on that as well. And also, it's really throughout the organization and all. So I don't think you'll see a sea change quarter-to-quarter, but what we're hoping to see is incremental improvement quarter-to-quarter over the next 1.5 years or so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wondering what's your base case assumption around when you'd see book-to-bill for the company start to more notably expand beyond 1x? And is that literally Q4, Q1, or is it more kind of mid to later 2014?","Mark A. Blinn","Steven, nice to meet you. I think we met you one time before. We don't go -- being not a quarter-to-quarter business, we don't go specifically and give book-to-bill or any kind of bookings guidance in the business. I think if -- just to help you understand growth opportunity in our business, frankly, if you look at the backlog at the end of 2011, it was higher than the backlog at the end of 2012, and yet we've been able to grow in revenue -- grow revenue this year. This is the issue of the duration of the backlog, how long it is down [ph] there and how long it takes you to roll through your P&L on the revenue side. So a lot of our backlog now has a shorter duration, shorter cycle. And we're pleased with the earnings trends over the last 3 quarters. So it's a good way to think about our business. And when we start booking these projects, especially the big ones, you do take some POC revenue on some of them. So you get the benefit of some of them as they start to come through, but they'll tend to hang in your backlog a lot longer. That's why we've been so focused on the growth of our run rate business and our aftermarket business. So hopefully, that can help you think about how we think about growth overall in this business. I think from an earnings standpoint, what we don't want anybody to underestimate is our contribution rate of an incremental dollar revenue to the gross margin into the operating line as well, gross profit and operating line as well. So with the improving operations, with our cost controls, we're able to drive growth in our earnings. This year, it's been multiples of what you've seen in the revenue line. So hopefully, that helps you think through this in our business because what -- the duration of the backlog is how quickly it'll convert into revenues.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's very helpful. And in terms of just understanding lead times a little bit better, because you referenced some of the U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical awards that have already been made at the EPC companies, when do those start to hit your order books and -- or those of your competitors?","Michael S. Taff","Well, it depends. In the competitive landscape, it depends on the lead times required for the products. So there are some products in a large refinery, so gas compressors, which have a much longer lead time and some of our products as well. Even within our product spectrum, we have different lead times. Often, we talked about the valves tend to be some of the shorter lead times in these. So it's really going to be dependent on the products relative to our industry. The complex equipment tends to be more early on in the project because they require long lead times of manufacturing. Having said that, what we've been focused on, and this was my comment earlier about our ability to compete and respond, is we saw it happen in the pipeline industry in 2011, and frankly, we didn't fully participative to the level we wanted to because of lead times. The shorter lead time on the margin got you the project, even with some pricing power. So we're taking the approach that we're not going to rely on lead times in and of themselves to take care of our business. We're going to drive for the shortest lead times possible to be responsive.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Jay Roueche for closing comments.","John E. Roueche","Thanks, Paulette.

And good morning, everyone. We'll quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results this morning. Additionally and more importantly, I'll outline the actions we are taking to improve our operating and financial performance. ","Let me begin by saying that overall I am pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance which delivered full year results in line with our expectations discussed last quarter. The downturn in our served markets during 2015 was more severe, widespread and persistent than we and the industry at larger originally anticipated a year ago. The sharp declined that began in upstream oil and gas spread across the industrial complex as year progressed. Compounding the challenges in our served industries, the strong dollar was also a major headwind throughout the year. And regionally petroleum driven economies in most emerging market such as Latin America remain more challenged. ","Against this market backdrop, I'm pleased with how our organization responded. Our employees remain committed to our customers and continued to deliver quality products and services through our strong operating model focused on execution. Importantly, we've taken definitive, proactive measures to better competitively position Flowserve for long-term growth and value creation. While we anticipate ongoing headwinds in the coming year, we are confident that the actions we implement in 2015, and the expanded program and growth indicatives we will discuss today, provide us with a solid foundation to drive profitable growth through the market cycle. ","As we look to the future, global macro fundamentals suggest that Flowserve's end markets will continue their longer term secular growth patterns confirming we serve the right strategic industries. Population growth in an emerging middle class will drive energy demand. And aging infrastructure in energy, power, chemical and general industries will require refurbishment or replacement. Our end markets are inherently sound over the long run. Although, they are currently cyclically challenged. While we can't control the near-term cyclicality, Flowserve is well equipped to weather period of volatility. And our track record demonstrates that we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term industry growth drivers. Even as we plan for a lower for longer environment in the near term. ","Let me dive into some of the actions and opportunities we are pursuing. While leadership and technology products and services are fundamental tenant of our competitive model, the markets we compete and demand that we are also competitive with our cost structure. In 2015 and continuing into 2016, the actions we are taking are transformational for Flowserve. In essence, we are structurally repositioning Flowserve for the future. First, we are aggressively taking actions to align our SG&A cost structure to market realities. These decisions are difficult and we consider our options thoughtfully before acting. We are not taking these actions lightly as they impact our most valuable asset namely Flowserve associates. ","In addition, we believe the current cycle creates the right environment to accelerate the structural changes we've addressed in prior calls. These actions are critical to leveraging our global operating model and establishing a flexible, responsive manufacturing network that addresses the need of market and customers. Against both of these objectives, we've made significant progress against our previously announced $125 million realignment plan. In the fourth quarter, we executed over $50 million of activities bringing the full year 2015 investment approximately $80 million. This investment includes the closure or repurposing of seven manufacturing facilities and a few redundant QRCs, while reducing over 5% of our workforce since first quarter of 2015. Beyond this announced program, we also made significant stride in integrating SIHI and achieving the synergies we expected to date as part of our transaction economics. Our ability to execute on our diverse set of initiatives during 2015 has provided us the confidence and the ability to accelerate even more of our longer-term plans. We developed these actions over a number of years and initially expected and extended timeline to implement. However, current market conditions provide the opportunity to act now. ","As such we are now expanding the previous $125 million realignment initiative which we expect to execute over two year period. We now envision a total investment of around $350 million including about $50 million of expense that is below the operating income line. With expected annualized savings of approximately $215 million once completed. With approximately $80 million of realignment expense realized in 2015 excluding SIHI initiatives, this leaves us $270 million remaining to execute over the next two years. ","While some of our initiatives are in respond to volume reductions in the current market, a majority of the actions we are taking are structural in nature, focused on capacity optimization, product rationalization, supply chain optimization and developing a low cost manufacturing base for competitive positioning. Together this will fundamentally change our engineered business. We've demonstrated, proven success in our ability to transform manufacturing capacity and permanently reduce cost. ","During 2016, we plan to accelerate the closure or repurposing of eight facilities that were part of our longer term plan. Additionally, we will further delayer the organization which is intended to increase accountability and performance. ","In summary, when our expanding program is complete, we expect to reduce our manufacturing footprint by approximately 30%. Improved plant and machine utilization and significantly increase our manufacturing capabilities and labor hours in low cost region. We expect to realize savings of approximately $125 million in 2016 and $185 million next year. We've a proven record of reducing cost and are confident that we can deliver on this plan. ","In addition to our ability to drive further cost out of the system, I'm equally encouraged by growth opportunities that are available to Flowserve. For instant, we see significant upside for growth in aftermarket and MRO. We have a QRC network that is well positioned globally. Our core aftermarket activities of parts, repair and service have shown the resiliency we expect even in 2015. And while we won't predict the timing, we do realize there is a building aftermarket tailwind coming from last year's deferred maintenance activities. ","As we've seen in the past, the longer facilities continuously run, the greater the workload is available to us when customers do catch up. And while much of our MRO sales were classified as run rate OE, this activity demonstrate substantial aftermarket attributes. ","In short, a significant majority of our annual revenue is brownfield in nature serving existing infrastructure that is permanent and need regular attention, which we believe provides opportunities to improve our share of the customers operational spending. For Flowserve and our shareholders, this work forms an attractive recurring revenue stream created from decade of our installed base. And we intend to increase our focus on this aspect of our business with a number of initiatives. ","We are also committed to remaining a significant, competitive supplier into new, large product opportunities that make sense for our business. The logic is simple. Project work absorbs cost in our manufacturing facilities and keeps Flowserve as a technological leader and innovator in our industry. Additionally, custom and highly engineered products inherent in our EPD segment create a new installed base and provide a competitive advantage for future aftermarket and MRO opportunities. ","We believe with the manufacturing and product optimization strategies we are implementing that Flowserve will remain a strong competitor in the marketplace, while the quality of our products brand and operational excellence remain key selling point. We also see sizable opportunities in our industrial business. IPD is done an admirable job of lowering cost to drive margin performance in recent years. But the priority had is growth. We've recently named a new leader for this segment that brings proven track record of the success to drive IPD forward. ","One of the unique opportunities available to us is to drive increase sales through the distribution channel. Our valves business recognizes about 40% of its revenue through distributors. IPD has a number of products that are applicable to this avenue and we are pursuing it aggressively. Additionally, our acquisition of SIHI has enabled alternative, go-to-market method with a greater focus on run rate business, which we can incorporate with existing IPD products. Additionally, we now have a more extensive portfolio that we can better leverage as a result of the Innomag and SIHI acquisitions. Both of which primarily serve the chemical industry. Even in the challenged market, we believe IPD is positioned for stronger growth long term. ","In fact, we see opportunity to gain share in the marketplace across our strategic product line. With a depth and breadth of our unparalleled flow control product and service offerings, Flowserve is well positioned to continue adding value for our customers. Likewise, this frame agreements, multiyear performance contracts and preferred supply arrangement and traction in the industry, Flowserve compete very effectively as we currently have over 400 such programs predominately with substantial customers. And we believe there are still opportunity in our customer focus initiative and end user strategies. ","Lastly, Flowserve continues to demonstrate operational excellence and a continuous improvement culture that drives result. We continue to lower the cost of poor quality, pursue outsourcing opportunities and leverage our supply chain and logistics, all in an effort to drive out cost. At the same time, we are committed to producing innovative products and enhancement for the industry and we'll continue to demonstrate discipline in our pursuit of new work. ","Before turning it over to Karyn, who will cover our recent financials in detail, let me finish by saying that while our end markets remain challenged and maybe for sometime we are in top of it. Flowserve is and will remain a strong competitor with the ability and culture to drive performance. ","Let me now turn it over to Karyn and I'll return afterwards for my final comments. ","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks Mark. As we indicated in our preliminary release several weeks ago, 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings were in line with the expectations we conveyed during the third quarter call. A stronger performance this quarter leveraged strong shipment levels consistent with our traditional seasonality. Our adjusted fourth quarter EPS of $0.89 excludes realignment expenses of $0.31, negative below the line currency impact of $0.06, $0.02 for the non-cash valuation allowance and the Latin American deferred tax asset and SIHI impact of $0.01. Partially offsetting these items is a $0.05 benefit from the reduction of contingent consideration related to a 2013 acquisition. All in reported EPS was $0.54.","In our preliminary release early this month we indicated our fourth quarter adjusted EPS would exclude the reserve established for in at-risk customer. As we've shown today, we did not add back the $0.06 incurred since we view this as part of our business and wanted to be consistent with prior quarters. But to compare on an apples-to-apples basis with our preliminary release, our results were at the high end of our expectations. ","The reserve in question is related to an at-risk customer and includes the write-down of inventory, work in process and receivables from European company that has formally indicated it needs to rework its liabilities and if unsuccessful is at risk for insolvency. When market conditions get challenging we recognize we will see the occurrence periodically. While Flowserve generally does not have customer concentration issues, we do strive to take all the steps we can to protect Flowserve assets. ","Turning to our bookings. On a constant currency basis, they declined 24.8% in the quarter excluding SIHI's contribution of $54 million. As a reminder, both the 2014 fourth quarter and full year had record levels of bookings which created tough comparisons. Looking further at our bookings profile, original equipment orders were down 32.4% or organic aftermarket bookings declined 13.6% in constant currency. As Mark mentioned, our core part services and repair aftermarket business has largely shown the resiliency we expect during 2015.","While we have experienced some maintenance delays, the larger headwinds we face from reduced level of CapEx driven aftermarket projects such as efficiency upgrade as well as few parts tied to new units. Similar to all of 2014, our end markets during the fourth quarter continue to be impacted by low and volatile oil and gas prices. A strong US dollar and emerging market weakness. Certain end markets even deteriorated further in the quarter as oil drifted lower and uncertainty increase. ","For instance during the first three quarter of 2015, our bookings in power, chemical and general industries held at better than we experience in our oil and gas markets. The trend changed a bit in the fourth quarter as we saw these markets taking additional step down as customers deferred capital investment and pulled in their maintenance budget conserving cash. Likewise in our regional basis the Middle East and North America were better performers through much of 2015 but this trend did not continue in the fourth quarter. ","However, Europe produced some relative improvement and activity levels versus the first three quarters of the year. Latin America, our most challenged region throughout 2015 remains extremely soft with delays occurring in nearly all projects with our important customers in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. Considering the quarterly volatility in our served end markets and region we experienced this year, our visibility heading into 2016 remains limited. ","From a sales perspective we generated $1.3 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% on a constant currency basis including $76 million from SIHI. This was also a 17.4% increase sequentially again reflecting Flowserve's normal seasonality. Excluding SIHI's contribution, sales declines 4.3% in constant currency compared to last year. Again our aftermarket business held up better as sales increased 2.2% on an organic constant currency basis. For the full year 2015. Flowserve's constant currency revenues increased 2.4% including $294 million from SIHI.","Looking at our margins, even with Q4 revenue declines in over 12% in tough pricing environment, adjusted gross and operating margins declined only modestly demonstrating Flowserve's strong operating performance, a shareholder alignment and focus on cost. Additionally, the increased mix of aftermarket sales and some savings from our realignment actions also contributed. ","Considering we are at a challenging part of the cycle we are focused on effectively managing our SG&A expenses. Our fourth quarter SG&A declined $23 million year-over-year, or 9.1% excluding the impact of SIHI, realignment and the benefit associated with the reduction in acquisition related contingent consideration. The decline is primarily due to lower variable composition and modest realignment benefits. ","Our fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29.3% and 29.1% were in line with our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a reported basis, the fourth quarter and full year tax rate is elevated as a result of accrued exit taxes for site closures and a non cash valuation allowance we took on certain deferred tax assets in Latin America.","Turning to cash flow. Flowserve generated total operating cash flow of $286 million in the 2015 fourth quarter or approximately $2.18 per share. Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter as we continue to make discipline investments in our business to support long-term growth.","We also repurchased approximately 1.2 million Flowserve shares during the quarter. And for full year 2015 we returned almost $400 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Approximately $160 million remained available under our current share repurchase program at yearend. ","Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share which includes approximately $0.10 of above the line currency headwinds. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14% including a 2% currency headwind. Additionally, it reflects yearend 2015 foreign currency rate, commodity prices and market conditions. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million and a tax rate of 30% to 31%.","We also expect the quarterly phasing of our guidance to follow our typical seasonal trend. Although the first quarter is likely to be slightly pronounced after challenged Q4 books an improvement should follow. Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI, quality through its realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration cost, below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discreet items. We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will be reduced versus in elevated 2015 level where we increased manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and purchased a license enabling increased aftermarket opportunities.","We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plan to cover service cost even as the US plan is largely fully funded currently. ","With that review let me turn the call back to Mark for his remaining comments. ","Mark Blinn ","Thanks Karyn. In closing, Flowserve expects near term market visibility to remain limited as customers calibrate around the persistent macro uncertainties. We expect this will result in continued delays in investment decision. However, as you have heard the near term market challenges provide us the opportunity to focus on cost take out, our operational performance and growth opportunities while remaining disciplined in our bidding. We believe Flowserve is well positioned with its extensive portfolio and consistent operational excellence. We've demonstrated success through prior cycles, controlling what we can by leveraging our one Flowserve initiative performance culture and comprehensive product portfolio to drive profitable growth. ","As we've articulated today, we are aggressively pursuing the sizable opportunities available to us to optimize our manufacturing portfolio and footprint. And we will pull the necessary levers to not only manage through the current market but to position Flowserve continue to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. ","Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hi, good morning, guys. Mark, so as you know Flowserve's overall business tends to be relatively late cycle. So how do you guys get a read on energy CapEx cuts which I know you know have accelerated over the last couple months when you are setting guidance? More specifically, how much concern do you have for additional pressure on your midstream and downstream oil and gas businesses? Really end markets like pipeline, LNG, even refining given relatively recent CapEx cuts?","Mark Blinn ","Yes. Thanks Ande. So a lot of cuts that you talked about are typically been with the multiple nationals. We do still see project activities with some of the state owned company around the world particularly in the Middle East. But to your point a portion of our business primarily in EPD is what you call late cycle. And as we talked about before and you started to see this happen in the middle part of 2014, they start to curtail their CapEx expenditures, you've seen this with the multinationals trying to protect their dividend. And the fact is as those things can go off the drawing board, get pushed a little bit and they don't come back real quick from -- primarily from the multinationals so they don't decide necessarily over night to bring it back online. But typically these are in their long-term plan. So this is part of the reason if you take a step back and looks why we primarily focused on our engineered business with some of these realignment activities. We've been looking at these for years. If you look at what is occurred over time and it's important that people understand this, we came through a strong cycle in 2008 and in 2009 we adjusted to market and they picked up relatively quickly. There were still quite a bit of activity in the Middle East. But more importantly what we did as we started setting up a lot of our SPO facilities in India, China, enhance the one we had in Mexico, built up more capabilities and our LPO\/SPO strategy is designed to start to qualify these, so that ultimately we can move the product and work to those locations. So we had these things on the drawing board for a while. What this late cycle component does is gives us time to go ahead and execute the backlog that we've had for the last year, year and half and we still have backlog and there are projects that would still come into backlog but for the most part we execute that and then start moving those capabilities to these low cost regions of the world. If you look at around some of the pipeline and other activities, some of those are on some of our run rate business and that's not as late cycle. And a lot of that is we talked about earlier some brownfield activity. So there is still some good brown field activity because what happens is lot of these facilities continues to run and they still need repairing and upgrade. So it kind of walking through it what the market environment does allows to do and this is why we are doing it as it allows to plan and execute and accelerate some of our what we call transformational activities around restructuring primarily in our engineered segment. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it, that's helpful, Mark. Okay, so let me ask you about the aftermarket in the context of you mentioned last cycle, obviously the last cycle, very different cycle but the aftermarket was flat in a difficult market. Aftermarket bookings in 4Q were down 11%, so the question is how do we think about your aftermarket business in the context of some of these big customers seemingly continuing to pull back on maintenance spend? Do you think you can maintain or increase the level of aftermarket bookings from the mid-$400 million range that you had this quarter or could it go lower still in the current environment?","Mark Blinn ","Well, if you look back to the prior cycle we saw something similar in that there was a -- they defer their spend as long as they could. But it came within the year back at towards the end of 2009, some of the spend activity. First of all, you talked about Q4 and the year-over-year compare we had about $550 million of bookings in Q4, 2014. That was a very, very strong quarter. That had a lot of parts tied to new unit. It also had a lot of upgrade projects. So those are small projects within the aftermarket portfolio. If you strip that down and you look you can see that our run rate base maintenance was down only slightly year-over-year both on a quarter bases and on a year-over-year basis, consistent with what we saw back in 2009. So we'd expect that to stabilize unless there is any kind of disruptive event that occurs out there. I mean what our industry saw across the board was very little activity in Q4 particularly on the project and even on the run rate side. That was reflected in our bookings. But we've seen some stability in the aftermarket business. My comments earlier are some of the deferred maintenance will need to come back and come back online. What we are looking for is to see where the efficiency upgrades come back in and while the rationalizing CapEx that may take some time. So that's market driven. From our standpoint, what we need to is to continue to execute on some of our end user strategies. I talked about this before but frankly we don't know where all of our installed base, we are working with some of our teams to increase in inventory where that is so we can call on those customers. They want to us help them; we just need to know that they are in and call on them. So we are going to continue to execute end user strategies like that in an attempt to grow the aftermarket business in any environment. And in fact if you look over the last 7 to 10 years, you've seen a fairly consistent strong growth through cycle. Most of that is not the net incremental and installed base. A lot -- there was a base amount of net installed base that went it. But the fact is the growth rates were higher than that. And that was primarily from executing these end user strategies. But when you look at our business, when you have volatile moves in oil, it takes everything with it. Everything tends to move in tandem when things tend to stabilize and normalize out even at lower levels then you can get what I would say is differentiation in your end user strategies. And any other strategy you want to execute. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","Right. So if I'm hearing you correctly, as soon as oil stabilizes if it has stabilized you should see more normal aftermarket behavior. Is that fair?","Mark Blinn ","That's fair. I mean if you think about customers they are trying to figure out what the number is. And they make investment decisions, capital decisions all around that. So I think that's part of what you see in the industry is that volatile moves and we saw it when oil moved up by the way back in 2007 so rapidly, volatile moves tend to increase the correlation of bookings and all other activity to that movement in that underlying resource. When things tend to stabilize then end users can start making investment decisions that are more longer term but when the short term is so volatile it's just tough to make a decision. That's why everybody is. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Please go ahead. ","Mike Halloran","Good morning, everyone. So first just kind of finishing rounding out that last thought, it doesn't sound like you think that there's a shift going on in the customer base in the aftermarket side between insourcing that type of work or outsourcing it to providers like yourself. So maybe you could just touch on that a little bit and if there's any change in trend line there if it's pretty normal relative to what you would have seen in previous cycles.","Mark Blinn ","Yes. I don't think there is any significant shift. If you think about it Mike you look at the complexity of the equipment of that goes in. That tends to lead to more outsourcing because a capabilities internally for the complex work. They are always going to look to absorb their fixed cost and good times and bad. So the trends that are occurring is the equipment is becoming more complex that is certainly one, also a lot of the resources internally to our customers are aging and retiring. And they would prefer to outsource that work. And then you add to that some of the capabilities we have around the end user. And this is going to be an opportunity. It's not just amount -- it's not just maintaining repair and servicing but its how do we get more efficiency out of those products. We haven't seen a lot of that recently, but that will -- that trend will continue. But short term Mike in fairness everybody looks to cover any of their fixed cost. So I can't say that didn't happen on the margin. But that's not a long-term strategy for refinery or any kind of processing plant. It's just trying to bring that in internally. Short term maybe some of the things I'll do but on the complex equipment they will tend to let the experts do it. ","Mike Halloran","Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And then on the IPD plan to move towards that distribution market, I guess a question on balance, how do you balance moving new products into that market versus an ability to maintain a margin profile, and speaking more on the idea of the level of engineering and aftermarket that's going to go through the distribution channels a little lower. So just talk about how you can protect the margin profile if not even do better than that as you move into new channels there.","Mark Blinn ","Simply answer I point FCD, I mean they have done thing, same thing. You can make money through your distribution channel. I think if you take a step back and look at IPD, our focus was on improving the operations and the margins which we've done. If you look at all the adjustments and take out at-risk customer, we were over 16% in the fourth quarter. So from our standpoint mission accomplished in terms of the margin improvement but some of my comments earlier were this group broke out of engineered business and we've a real opportunity to improve how they go to market. Various channels configure to order on electronically in terms of been able to response. Some of these pieces of equipment are couple hundred dollars, $500, $600, $1000, $1500; the customers aren't as price sensitive. They just wanted it and they wanted it now. So if we can execute through our online capabilities and improve those or through a distribution channel, typically you can command margin because they need these for their brownfield activity. So I think part what we are lining out for you is this is a segment of our business and we frankly we've learned a lot from the SIHI acquisition. This is a segment of our business which has some great opportunity. We just need to improve it. We need to improve the way we go to market and how we execute into the channels. And Mike you've always known me I'll say if things aren't operating the way they should be, I'll tell you this is one that has real opportunity for improvement on the top line. ","Mike Halloran","Great, I appreciate the time, Mark. Take care.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead ","Charley Brady","Thanks and good morning. Yes, hi, Mark. The commentary on EPD, on the bookings in the quarter obviously really heavy aftermarket weighting 72% or so which is I think probably unusually high for that business. You kind of understand why given that that's a large project business. But I'm wondering can you maybe talk about the margin impact on that significant mix shift and aftermarket versus OE, when you tie that in with obviously you've done some absorption because the OE is just dropping off I guess my question at the end of the day is what level can you maintain the margins with aftermarket to offset the absorption issues you're hitting on EPD?","Mark Blinn ","Yes. You are trying to find a math of what's kind of the inflection point but you are right with low level bookings in the project business you will have an absorption issue which can get pretty expensive. And part of the reason not necessarily just the Q4 bookings but part of the reason we are addressing that net segment. Charley, we had looking back to 2014 and folks would have considered that a decent market and a good year for us. We had about $150 million of under absorption in our business. And a lot of that was in that engineered segment. That's what put us on the path toward what we -- at that time it was going to about a five or six years transformation of that business. You never get your under absorption down to zero but you certainly can get it to run $50 million to $70 million in your business. So I just wanted to make that point around that engineered segment because that's a lot of the reasons we are taking those actions is to help it variablize and be much more competitive and not have to deal with under absorption. It had an overhang coming into this downturn and so part of that is we need to attack that. Once we attack that I think you are going to need to see higher levels of project bookings. In Q4, there were lot of projects that were right there in front of us and they got pushed. And that's not a typical because the customer can wait a couple of quarters and see where market settle out and it's very, very competitive. And it's to their advantage to wait over a short period of time. So I think what you are going to see is as we start to address that we'll deal with the under absorption, the after market mix will help but there is a lot of large expensive facilities in this division. So it's going to need project work but will offset that by starting to take cost out. That's also some of the facilities we took out last year. So I don't have the exact math because part of it is how we get to the cost both in terms of the gross margin line under absorption and the fixed cost as well as we mentioned earlier we are taking action in some of those areas as well. And then where the aftermarket business comes in. ","Charley Brady","Okay, thanks. And just my follow-up here is on M&A just quickly, I guess does the current market environment as lousy as it is in oil and gas change your thinking directionally on where you want to look towards M&A as you look out to your pipeline and maybe does it move you toward areas that maybe a year and a half, two years ago you might not have been thinking a strongly about?","Mark Blinn ","Right. Well, let me tell you one of our biggest cash M&A opportunities is this restructuring. It's got a great return but Charley, no, we had our line aside on certain industries which we find attractive and the real question is at what time do they make sense. I think what you don't want is for us to decide all a sudden to go in a left hand turn direction into some area that's not core to us, just because it may be viewed as relatively cheap. So it's fair to say that we are still focused on the areas where we think we make money. The chemical industry, we've talked for years around the opportunity around upstream, additional downstream or service capabilities. We made a small service acquisition last year. So we are going to stay focused on where we think we make money long term. There were a couple of things we need to think about. One is we don't want anything to conflict with these restructuring activities because this is a high return on our investment and we need to executing very well because our customers are relying on that. The other thing to think about is just we need to make sure we are very thoughtful with our cash both in terms of the restructuring and our shareholders as well. There is always opportunities use your stock as currency but we have to look at that relatively to the asset that we are looking at. So we are clearly opportunities may come in this type of environment especially for company like ours that has a very strong operating platform. But we need to always balance that against other priorities and what I'll tell you is when we can return $215 million, a lot of it is going to be permanent in our business with $350 million of spend, that's pretty compelling. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone. I'd like to just ask a couple of questions about working capital and perhaps get Karyn's take on this now that she's been there for a while. You ended the year with core working capital about 35% of 2015 sales which has gone up considerably over the last few years. What tactics are you guys using to get that down? What's a long-term target look like and how long does it take to get there?","Karyn Ovelmen","There are several things going on. First on the account receivable side, we are seeing slower payment in particular Southern Europe and Latin American customers. They are continuing to pay but albeit just slower. Accounts payable is down with inventory up, majority of those increases in inventory are in working capital. So adding cost but not necessarily in purchase parts, it's more labor and less payable associated with that inventory. Also in terms of accounts payable negotiating the terms with suppliers. We'll pay according to terms and all through 2015 there is an emphasis to actually paying on time. We've a lot of local suppliers so paying on time helps the timing and on time delivery as well as directionally pricing. We have been focused locally at the site in terms of improving working capital. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings release call, we are stepping back and looking at this now going forward on a more global perspective. And really looking to implement in global standardized procedures around billings and cash and collection as well as order and purchasing. So those are the type of things we are going to look at those types of programs to take time. I think in addition with the realignment going on, we will see improvements ultimately when we get through this process. It will take a couple of years but as we consolidate and streamline our sites, we should see improvement in working capital but in near term don't expect any significant swings. ","Nathan Jones","Understand that. If you think longer term is there a number that you think Flowserve's structure should operate in terms of a percentage of sales in working capital or working capital turns or however you would like to frame it? Because it does seem like there's probably several hundred million dollars in working capital that you could free up to put to better use.","Karyn Ovelmen","We do believe there are some values there. We don't have specific target at this point like I said we are going to look at this in a more standardized global perspective so versus really at the local site. But yes we do believe there is some improvement there but we don't have specific target at this time. ","Nathan Jones","And Mark, I think you mentioned in response to one of the last questions that there were a few projects right there in front of you in the fourth quarter that got pushed. Are those things that got pushed significantly or are they imminent? Could those orders come through in the first half of the year or have they been pushed further out at this point?","Mark Blinn ","No. These were fairly well down the road and they just seemed to move. But they can move from quarter-to-quarter. We've seen this happen before but we did see they moved in. And Nathan they can move still another quarter or two easily. We still have confidence they are going to come online but remember they are very competitive. We will response but only to a point because if you remember back in 2009, 2010 and 2011 we had a lot of backlog they didn't have value to it. And that doesn't accomplish anything for us. So it is a competitive environment. These things tend to push. We have confidence some of them particularly in the Middle East are going to go forward. But just remember environment is very competitive. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Joseph Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joseph Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I guess my first question is on the restructuring plans, Mark. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the magnitude and the cadence of the restructuring in 2016? And then specifically, is it fair to assume that a lot of the actions or a disproportionate amount of the actions are occurring in EPD?","Mark Blinn ","Some of the large transformational one in the large plant are in EPD, yes, Joe. And a lot of these as you -- as we talked about are in OECD countries and quite a few in Europe and they take time. You got have a long planning process in terms of just dealing with your constituencies but generally what my comments were is we expect to see about $125 million benefit this year, $185 million next year. So all other things being equal you get an earnings lift next year from just these restructuring activities. And then we will see the run rate in 2018 which will take us up to $215 million.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay and then from a cost perspective you're incurring about $150 million this year, is that kind of ballpark-ish the right number?","Mark Blinn ","I think that's number yes that we talked about earlier, yes. ","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. And then maybe my one follow-up is really around pricing. It looked like your gross margins in the fourth quarter decelerated a little bit versus the rest of the year. Just curious to hear what you're seeing on the pricing environment. Have things have gotten worse? And given that you have seen significant CapEx cuts to start the year from some of your customers, I'm just curious to hear what you're hearing from your customers today. ","Mark Blinn ","Well, some of those margins in the fourth quarter had these two customers issue right that we talked about it. And so if you -- in a lot more up in the gross margin line but in general we are actually pleased that our margins held up relatively well. But what you will see in the gross margin line is the pricing environment and to the extent we can offset by some of the restructuring activities. Because lot of those fit into gross margin line to the extent they impact manufacturing facilities. It's just going to be the timing in terms of one week and execute them, some of that is outside of our control. But we are seeing from customers and just remember we didn't have a really strong pricing environment in 2013 and 2014. It was okay versus the last cycle we had a tremendous pricing environment in 2007 and 2008. So but we are certainly seeing it down get competitive at that point in time. The other thing that we will have to deal with is the top line goes down is under absorption. And how quickly we can offset that with some other restructuring as well. But pricing environment is competitive. We saw this back in 2010 primarily because a lot of the project activity in 2010 was in the Middle East and that is always competitive in just about any environment. Typically you have Korean engineering and contracting firms there, they tend to be very competitive on price and demand out of their suppliers. So we are starting to see a very competitive environment. The real question Joe is how long this is going to last because the late cycle part of our business which is the projects which as we talked about has been well less than 20% of our business. It tends to-- the opportunities tend to move out quick and move back slowly.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Berry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Phillipe Forlorne","Good morning, guys this is Phillipe Forlorne [ph] on the call for Rob today. So first question, going back to the restructuring, I mean the benefit of course looks up nicely versus the previous target but the return on the investment looks lower. Is that the message that incremental savings are becoming harder to find and is there any potential upside to these numbers if the environment were to get worse?","Mark Blinn ","No. The numbers are really reflective of the type of restructuring that you have. I mean when you $125 million for $125 million is pretty much one for one payback or one year payback. You don't typically see that in Europe. It cost more but the fact is those savings are permanent. An also what you saw was a lot of the initial part was what I would call volume related headcount reduction as opposed to permanent closures of facilities. But when you close a facility anywhere but particularly in any OECD part of the world and particularly in Europe, it cost more than the savings but the savings are permanent. I think the important thing to think about when you take a step back is if you look at our business, lot of heritage capacity going back 10 years was in very expensive parts of the world. And we are changing that. And so what that all mean is even some of our OECD facilities are going to be have higher load levels and higher engineered equipment in them, and we are going to get more advantage of some of our low cost manufacturing around the world. So that's why we are trying to emphasis this is permanent. This is the kind of thing that would have addressed that $150 million of under absorption back in 2014. And not only would that have significantly improved margins once executed. So as you think about us moving through the cycle and more margins have been this is something that will all other things being equal relative to last and we think that things are going to -- some things are going to change. But the fact is if we had this type of manufacturing profile four five years ago, our margins would have been a lot higher. ","Phillipe Forlorne","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then on your 2016 outlook does that imply any recovery in refining MRO spending? And what's the latest outlook there given your discussion with customers?","Mark Blinn ","Well, there is an assumption that there will be some stabilization in some investment in some repair and maintenance in the business. But we are not really expecting the aftermarket upgrade and certainly not the tied units to come back during that period of time. But it does have some of our initiatives around improving the go-to-market strategy in IPD within that. So it's not matter of us just sitting back and letting the market deal what they are going to deal. We have to go and execute some of our strategic initiatives to achieve our guidance. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Chase Jacobson","Hi, how are you? So Mark, you talked about increasing the aftermarket sales and doing a better job tracking where your equipment is going. But you also talked about more sales going through distribution which I thought would maybe make it harder to track the products and capture the aftermarket. So I guess one, can you address that? And two, as you do try to track the products better and capture the aftermarket are you putting more people on the ground or are you doing something where you're adding more technology to your products?","Mark Blinn ","Yes to both. Nobel technology to the products some monitoring capabilities, boot on the ground but also technology system to track our installed base. Going back to your earlier question, the distribution channels, those are out and present there, we are just not taking full advantage of them in our industrial product segment. And these distributors they can carry multiple product line and are responsive on one or two product basis to a customer that need it fairly quickly. The end user strategies are really designed around where there are substantial installed based. If you look at some of refineries around the world, there are hundreds of pumps that are out there. And all over the world, if you look at our heritage brands going back many years, there were literally some pumps that were installed in the 70s that were still supplying parts to in remote parts of the world. So it's really around getting our hands around that, inventorying it, making sure we are calling on the customer. So one of the things that we've done this year and you alluded to a little bit is really increased our focused on our sales organization and how we get out to customers on account basis. And get more share of their wallet. Well, part of it knows what customer to call on and on what product they have in their facilities. So we will be the first to tell you. We can do a better job on that. That is one of our key strategic end user initiatives this year. So if you think about how we rolled it out over the last couple of years, we've increased our QRC network and we will continue to do that. We've worked with systems and some end user strategies to help them develop and understand how they can bring more efficiency out of an existing facility. Because even right now they are looking for higher yields out of their processing facilities. The other element now is making sure that we have the right people calling on the right customers, not just out of QRC but our sales people and that's a separate and distinct strategy from using the distribution channel. Distribution channel has been very powerful for our valve business. We just haven't levered it on the IPD side. But your point is fair. A lot of this is OE that goes through distribution as opposed to service and repair work. But a distributor, they want to get certainly margin as well but what we found and you've seen in our valve segment is we can still get good margin on product that goes through distribution because keep in mind what the customer is looking for is they are looking for that product there very, very quickly. These aren't multimillion dollar pieces of equipment. These can be in hundreds or even in low thousand. So time is of the essence. ","Chase Jacobson","Okay, that's helpful. And then when you do your due diligence on some of the larger prospects, I mean it seems like always and especially in this environment the customers tell, whether it's the E&C company or the equipment suppliers they tell you that the projects are going forward until they are not. So I guess what is Flowserve doing differently now to make sure that you're putting more resources after the projects that are actually going to go forward versus the ones that are just always out there and always getting pushed?","Mark Blinn ","Well, if you think about it, when we interact with these customers we are doing a lot of the design work for these products, for these facilities, working on standardization. Some of our large customers we have quarterly meetings with them to go through exactly what they are planning. It's in nobody's interest that the both sides don't understand what's going to happen. And what I mean by that is a customer -- if they are going to go forward with the project they have reasons, long-term reasons to do that. They may push it a couple of quarters. So once the project starts moving down the road, we have pretty good sense it's going to go forward sometimes, it get cancel. We saw that last year some projects that we thought really were going to forward they get cancelled. It was by a multinational that was very focused on short-term capital. But we see projects drop off or the one that are in the ideation phase that are going on the drawing board. And as people look for visibility around the underlying value the resource they may put them off at that point in time. But I think what I want to explain to you is there is a lot of work that's done before these things are bid. So in doing that we get pretty good visibility.","Thomas Pajonas ","Yes. And I would add to that we do take a look at, is the financing in place with the project, and is the projects have off take agreement in place for the commodity that they are producing. We also have different levels of activities so something that is in their earlier stages we would deploy a budget level of resources. If all these things that I mentioned and Mark mentioned are in place then we will deploy more elaborate resources in order to go after that potential proposal. So we have a pretty good system for weeding out those are in early stages versus those that are more firming up and getting ready for real proposal activity. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Jim Foung from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Jim Foung","Hi, good morning everyone. So I just wanted to maybe you could size up the opportunity in terms of selling the industrial pumps through distribution. How large is that opportunity for you? I presume it would be incremental to what you're doing now.","Mark Blinn ","It is incremental. If you look at our valve business approximately 35% to 40% of their business goes through distribution and we are sitting probably less than 10% on the industrial side. So if -- and in fairness I would say that 30% differential is all incremental because part of what we need to do is have disciplined around what products go through our sales force and what goes through distribution because frankly a sales organization would want to have all other products at their disposal to sell, but the fact is they are only really focused on selling a few and we've seen that. So but a lot of that is going to be incremental in the business if we get it up to the right that our valve business is operating at. ","Jim Foung","So net you're in the distributive -- you're in a lower margin through the distributors, net-net your bottom line would improve from just the higher volume.","Mark Blinn ","Well, you do get higher volume but as I mentioned earlier time is the essence and so it's while distributors can make good margins, we make decent margin on products that go through distribution. If there was a significant margin differential, companies like ours would go direct to market. But the fact is there is a lot of value in our distribution channel. And Jim we are not talking about big, big projects going through distribution. Again this could be $1500 pieces of equipment and where the distributor add value is they carry an array of products tha they can serve the customer fairly quickly, often times they are proximate to him and so I am not saying a customer is price sensitive but they are really focused on getting that -- having that product available along with some other products that we may not serving to that customer, getting response quickly and getting their facility up and running. ","Thomas Pajonas ","And Jim if you look at distributors, there are many different types of distributors that add value. Some are just buy and resale, some will add content to it, some will add an engineering value added to that. So that distributor is really a route to market that we choose based on the value added that distributor can bring to that product in the territory region that the customer is in. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonny Wright from Nomura. Please go ahead. ","Jonny Wright","Good morning, guys. On the restructuring if we can just look at that from a different angle, so I think historically in the valves you always hear a lot about increased competition from low cost Chinese competitors. You guys are now looking to kind of pivot the manufacturing base away from developed economies into places like China. How do you maintain the Flowserve brand whilst doing that with your customers? And also how do you think about avoiding passing that price, passing the cost discounts on to the customer in the form of just lower prices and becoming more of a like-for-like competitor with the low cost Chinese guys?","Mark Blinn ","Well, you keep in mind low costs Chinese are typically are in lower tier products. So some of these are very, very highly engineered piece of equipment. And we don't necessarily see a lot of competition from Chinese suppliers. These are high end controlled valves actuation, highly engineered pieces of equipment. But here is the important thing. The way we do this is with the permission of our customer. So part of what we've been working on over the last couple of years through the LPO\/SPO strategy is working with our customers to qualify some of the manufacturing in low cost parts of the world. And don't just mention China because labor rates are gone up quite a bit there. We are talking about various parts of the world, India, Mexico. But the other thing to remember with our customers as well is often times they want to deal with the OECD facilities so sometimes what we do when we talk about repurposes, we'll make that facility engineering assembly in test, it will still be the front end but a lot of the activity around the value add to the piece of equipment will be done in a lower cost part of the world. So I am not suggesting customers on highly engineered pieces of critical equipment are wholesale moving everything to low cost parts of the world. That may occur over time and we are prepared to move with them and doing that. But I think the important thing these aren't commodity sold by the pound type equipment that typically get fully converted over to a low cost region of the world. And we don't expect that to occur over the short term. But we expected to occur faster than what it occurred over the last 10 years which is why we are taking these actions, one of the reason we are taking these actions. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. ","Brian Konigsberg","Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions, most have been answered, but can you just give a little bit more clarity on the restructuring or the spend you're doing below the operating income line? What are you targeting specifically and what type of savings is associated with that action?","Mark Blinn ","Yes, I mean below the line typically those are going to be exit taxes, any non cash asset write-downs or certain things that are sitting below the line but lot of those are going to be exit taxes in the business. It's just not easy to move from OECD countries. ","Brian Konigsberg","Okay. So is there a payback associated with that or is it just spending that needs to be done because of the move?","Mark Blinn ","It needs to be done as part of the move. I'd look at it holistically and just take a step back and say we are spending -- we are going to spend $350 million, most of it is cash, there is some non cash component to that, most of it is cash to get $215 million of savings all of which is cash. It's still a great payback.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes. And also just maybe can you expand a little bit upon just the customers from you had a bad customer expense in the quarter, obviously there's stress really across the globe in the oil and gas space. Do you see -- what do you see from the rest of the customer base? Are there other accounts that are particularly stressed at this time where you might have to take similar actions over the course of 2016? Any color on that would be really helpful.","Mark Blinn ","Well, I mean things could have been typically a lot of our customers are -- we don't have high customer concentration in terms of sales. But they are certainly at risk parts of the world. If you look at Latin America, they are certainly things that are going on down there. I mean we don't typically have -- we serve a lot of large customers and but these things going to occur, I mean one of these was a relatively medium sized distributor or small size distributor that went out of business. So you typically when we you see the strain in our industry, it typically occurs in the first 18 months maybe two years. We don't supply necessarily a lot of the upstream, smaller upstream type companies E&P companies that you are hearing about. A lot of the companies that we serve are large names or ongoing process capabilities. But we watch this very carefully. ","Brian Konigsberg","If I could sneak just one last quick one in, just on free cash flow, so I understand you had high CapEx in 2015 associated with the move presumably? But even if you normalize that, we haven't seen net income equal free cash flow really since 2007 at this point. I know there's a question on working capital previously. But can you just maybe conceptually just talk about where you think this business should be on a run rate basis from a free cash flow conversion perspective. And I don't think you gave 2016 expectations. I assume that's going to be trailing as well. But if you could talk around that subject it would be helpful. Thanks.","Karyn Ovelmen","Yes. So going forward from a cash flow perspective, first quarter they are generally is more cash outflow from our operation associated with taxes, those types of things that we have in the normal first quarter cadence. Our capital expense will be significantly lower. We had approximately $180 million in CapEx in 2015. Our expectation is that's going to be more in line with around $110 million in 2016. So in 2015 we had higher than normal CapEx that are licenses and carryover CapEx work in 2014. Generally speaking on the working capital like I said with this market it's little tough. We don't expect significant swings in our inventories to go forward. And like I said over the course of the next few years as we execute on the realignment, we do have expectation that we will be able to bring working capital down but don't see any significant levers in the short term. ","Brian Konigsberg","Do you think that net income and free cash flow will be able to converge sometime over the next couple of years? It just seems to have been to so well below net income for an extended period of time, I'm just trying to get a sense of should we be expecting this business as it's it runs and you expect it to be run to be converting into free cash flow in line with the net income?","Mark Blinn ","In part of our reducing complexity is designed to that. It should start approaching it. It's going to take a while. I mean we are going to consolidate facilities then Karyn in the years out has initiatives that we start driving shared service models and things that help really drive more efficiency across the system. But let's keep in mind we are fairly distributed company across multiple countries and multiple facilities but no question that as we take out 30% of our capacity and doing some of the reductions in complexity which we think our customers are going to demand long term. We should get better free cash flow in our business. We've been as frustrate as anybody else has in terms of trying to seek that goal but we are determined to get there.

My name is Paulette and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Roueche, you may begin.","John Roueche","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you participating in Flowserve's 2016 second quarter earnings call. Joining me this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Karyn Ovelmen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up to your questions. And as a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available. Please be aware that our earnings materials do, and this call will, include non-GAAP measures. Please review the reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to our reported results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which can be found in both our press release and earnings presentation.","Please also note that this call and our associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements which are based upon forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management as of July 28, 2016. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control. And except to the extent required by applicable law, Flowserve undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements.","We encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's earnings materials, as well as our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are all available on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Mark Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. Let me start with a quick overview of the quarter.","First, Flowserve delivered solid financial and operating results in the second quarter. This performance, including our adjusted EPS of $0.57 per share, was generally in line with our expectations and kept us on pace to deliver within our prior guidance range for the full-year, although we did tighten our range this quarter by modestly lowering the upper end.","We continue to make significant progress in our transformational realignment program to optimize our manufacturing platform and reduce our cost structure. Additionally, we are seeing early traction from some of our growth initiatives.","I will review a few key highlights and then Karyn will discuss our financial results in greater detail.","From an operational standpoint, our continuing focus remains to improve our on-time delivery, reduce past due backlog, ensure best-in-class quality, enhance our sales process, and project management capabilities, minimize the impact of restructuring on day-to-day activities and further leverage our supplier relationships. Our employees have supported these efforts, and I'm generally pleased with the operational execution that we've delivered, even while undertaking our realignment efforts and facing a challenging market backdrop.","During the quarter, we saw less volatility in some commodity prices, most notably crude oil. While this stability is encouraging, we still expect our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multi-year nature of infrastructure original equipment investments, the more important criteria for our customers is stability and it will likely require several quarters of consistency before investment spending actively resumes.","Despite the headwinds in many of our sectors and changing end market dynamics, our primary efforts remain on structurally improving our company, controlling our costs and positioning Flowserve for profitable growth and increased shareholder value creation.","These efforts include strategically repositioning our capabilities, aggressively aligning our manufacturing presence with our served industries for the long term and responding to current market environment, while permanently reducing under absorption in our system, pursuing our growth initiatives and enhancing our value proposition for our customers.","As noted earlier, we continue to make solid progress on our realignment program, delivering approximately $27 million of savings in the second quarter. To date, we've initiated actions on two-thirds of the facilities we expect to either be closed, repurposed, or sold. Importantly, we remain on track to meet our goal of reaching approximately $100 million of incremental savings which is expected in 2016.","In terms of specific locations, we have ceased manufacturing and completed the product transfer at an IPD facility in the UK. And in Canada, we closed an EPD facility and also divested a non-strategic foundry. We also have initiated the process to transfer capabilities from our Dubai operations to another location in the Middle East and are nearing completion on closing a Dutch location where manufacturing has now ceased. During the third and fourth quarters, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites and continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year.","While we identify most realignment costs incurred for your analysis, it's important to recognize that our reported and adjusted numbers do include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We should also see the benefit of eliminating all the duplicative costs resulting from the transition.","With each site undergoing restructuring, we obtained valuable lessons learned and applied them to subsequent locations. Overall, the pace and progress of our restructuring is on track and we are confident that this realignment program will position our business for long-term success.","Looking further at the market and bookings within our served industries, overall for the quarter constant currency bookings declined approximately 10% against last year's strongest quarter, as lower OE bookings and project awards more than offset the 2.3% growth in aftermarket bookings. Sequentially, our bookings increased 4%, reflecting both our resilient aftermarket franchise and normal seasonality.","I spoke about the challenges of the original equipment business already, but we\u2019re pleased with this quarter's year-over-year increase in constant currency aftermarket bookings, which is the second consecutive quarter of this growth. Our aftermarket franchise largely demonstrated the kind of resiliency we expect even in these tough markets. And while operating budgets have remained constrained, this quarter's level was also supported by increased emergency response, brake fix type activity and the return of a few small upgrade projects, which were notably absent during 2015.","Overall, we remain in a period of rolling deferred maintenance where many of our customers are catching up on the 2015 deferrals, but delaying activity previously scheduled for 2016. This practice will not likely continue indefinitely and we expect to benefit as operating budgets normalize.","We've also recently see more customers enquire about new or extended long-term lifecycle agreements, or LCAs. We view this activity as positive. In these agreements, we seek to add considerable value to our customers while driving volume for Flowserve.","From a segment perspective, we are particularly pleased with IPD's bookings growth of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. For some time, this business had largely leveraged EPD's oil and gas project work. Under new leadership, IPD is returning to its industrial root and demonstrated some early traction in our commercial initiatives for the segment, including increasing our exposure in the profitable chemical sector and other general industries, and better leveraging the distribution channel and growing its run rate in small project activity.","Additionally, IPD has benefited from the ongoing integration of SIHI's products across Flowserve's selling platform, including product pull-through across Flowserve's broad portfolio. In fact, this enabled the former SIHI entity to achieve one of its highest levels of quarterly bookings to date in the second quarter.","Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis, oil and gas declined 20% in the quarter, which impacted each of our segment and reflected the broad based pressure on our oil and gas customers' budgets. Oil and gas is our largest served market and this industry has been challenged for over a year and a half now.","Power bookings decreased approximately 9%, driven by declines in the IPD and FCD segments. EPD's bookings were essentially flat, including strong nuclear aftermarket orders in North America and Europe, and our success in shifting certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers.","Going forward, we continue to expect combined cycle investment in North America, while China continues to invest in nuclear where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. Solid IPD bookings partially offset EPD's 18% decline.","As previously mentioned, IPD's distributor initiatives showed progress and we intend to utilize this channel to target previously un-served markets. Flat FCD bookings were supported by solid defense-related orders in Europe and global pulp and paper activity. Broadly speaking, distributors remain challenged. While we believe destocking is largely complete in this channel, they are now maintaining inventory at lower levels and often ordering only when they have a customer order in hand.","Chemical bookings were essentially flat in the second quarter, supported by a strong increase in SIHI bookings. We continue to see some delays in the expected ethylene-driven derivative plants as well as the second wave of crackers, but we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East supported by low cost feedstock.","To wrap up, we are confident that we\u2019re taking the right actions to position Flowserve for the future and we are encouraged by the progress made this quarter. Although our served markets remain volatile and challenging, our first half results were largely in line with our expectations and we expect a stronger second half of the year with seasonality, cost takeout and backlog shipments as the key drivers.","Aftermarket is showing resiliency during this time and if extended market stability occurs, we do expect growth in the original equipment orders to ultimately follow. Nevertheless, we expect our customers will remain deliberate near term and early projects to be very competitive. In this environment, we will remain disciplined.","I\u2019d like to leave you with a final thought. While we are very much internally focused on cost reduction and structurally rightsizing our operations in this environment and making good progress, we are also positioning Flowserve for the eventual improvement in our markets. We continue to invest for long-term profitable growth, including in the distribution channel and other industrial opportunities, as well as new product development and improvements through our disciplined R&D process.","I am confident in our ability to execute our strategic vision and the extended outlook for our served markets, as well as our capabilities to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.","Let me now turn the call over to Karyn.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials, our results were largely in line with our expectations. Bookings were highlighted by a growth in our aftermarket business, albeit still at low levels, and we also delivered sequential constant currency aftermarket and OE increases of 5.6% and 2.5%, respectively.","Based on our first half 2016 results and our expectations for the year, we have tightened our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance, while maintaining our full-year 2016 revenue outlook. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 was driven by our continued operational execution and a solid level of shipments even with the challenges that come with executing significant realignment initiatives.","Our second quarter adjusted EPS excludes $0.11 of realignment expense and $0.01 associated with the SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges which were partially offset by a gain of $0.03 from below the line currency impacts. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.48, which included an above the line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.01.","Q2 revenues of over $1 billion decreased 11.7% or 9.7% in constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 6.2% compared to 2015 levels. Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 4.2% in the second quarter, but remained elevated as a percent of sales due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing impact of expected realignment savings from our ongoing cost reduction efforts in higher cost regions.","Turning to margins, second quarter adjusted gross margins were 32.7%, down 130 basis points from prior year and excluded realignment charges of $8.9 million and SIHI charges of $2.1 million. Reported gross margins were 31.6%, which were negatively impacted by lower volumes that resulted in increased under-absorption as well as work that reflected the challenging pricing environment booked over the last year and a half.","Similar to the first quarter, IPD continued to be particularly impacted by under-absorption in many of its facilities in high-cost regions due to a nearly 18% revenue decline. We continue to expect margin improvement in this segment through the year from our realignment initiatives and the continued integration of SIHI.","Our second quarter tax rate of approximately 29% was slightly below our full-year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. Looking at bookings in greater detail and on a constant currency basis, original equipment at bookings declined 19.4%, while aftermarket realized a 2.3% increase over the prior year.","From a regional perspective, Europe's bookings increased 9.1% constant currency, while North America was down 10.6% and Latin America and Asia Pacific were down mid-teens. The Middle East was particularly challenged. Last year this region continued to invest in the downturn, but in the current environment we see limited project activity occurring and aftermarket work is being deferred.","Turning to revenues, we delivered modest constant currency growth in the Middle East, which was realized from the backlog built during last year's positive booking environment. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe saw constant currency sales decline in the 8% to 12% range, while national oil company challenges in Latin America drove a constant currency decline of nearly 32% in that region.","Shifting to our realignment program and the approximately $27 million of savings realized in the second quarter, this progress keeps us on track to achieving our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016.","We expensed $20 million in the second quarter related to these efforts, bringing the first half 2016 total expense to approximately $34 million and we continue to expect an expense of roughly $160 million during 2016 as we continue to execute on a number of planned actions during the second half of the year. For the total program, we expect our $400 million multi-year investment to drive estimated total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million.","Turning to cash flow, through June 30, 2016, operating cash flow was down about $15 million versus a year ago as cash outflows related to realignment exceeded our book expenses. However, free cash flow improved roughly $62 million compared to the first half of 2015, due to elevated capital expenditures last year related to the purchase of an aftermarket license, and carryover investment on our new Chinese valve facility. We returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends, while our realignment program used approximately $34 million of our cash during the second quarter.","As many of you know, typically the majority of our operating cash flow is realized in the last two quarters of the year and we expect that to be the case again this year likely with more weighting on the fourth quarter.","Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, while we see continued pricing pressure and caution in our end markets, we remain confident over the longer term that our diversified end markets, comprehensive product portfolio and geographic exposures coupled with our strategic growth initiatives and transformational realignment plans position us for the future.","However, there is still uncertainty given ongoing macro and political issues, including the impact of the recent Brexit vote. While we have limited direct exposure to the UK, the potential broader impact of the event on the UK, European and global economies is still largely unknown.","Based on performance for the first half of 2016, our backlog and its expected recognition combined with our expectations at the current market conditions will largely persist. We tightened our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share.","Due to the expected timing and margin of scheduled backlog shipments as well as our recognition of realignment savings, we expect our performance will be even more heavily weighted on the fourth quarter results compared to prior year's. On the top line, our 2016 adjusted EPS target range assumes revenues declining 7% to 14% compared to the 2015 level and this range includes a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of about the line impact.","Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low to mid $60 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of other potential discrete items.","Moving on to cash usage for the year, we continue to expect full-year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $115 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. Scheduled debt payments for the remainder of the year are $30 million and we also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs, even as the US plan remains largely fully funded.","With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay.","John Roueche","Thanks, Karyn. Operator, we have concluded our prepared remarks and would now like to begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert Baird.","Michael Halloran","First on the IPD margins, obviously a couple quarters in a row here of some challenges there, how does that cadence look through the back half of the year? What were the pressure points in the first quarter and second quarter here? And do those start diving off a little bit when you get to the back half and how should we think about the progression?","Mark Blinn","A couple of things; three things to think about in that business. One, it's in transition from a realignment standpoint. We talked about one of the facilities that was closed in the first quarter. And also in the transition as we take costs out during the course of this year from the SIHI acquisition a year ago and then finally its transition over to more of the industrial and the commercial approach. It's working through that, and what you see is it's not getting fixed cost leverage because the outflows of the project oil and gas year over year.","So when we look at that business, we know it's going to be challenged from a margin standpoint during the course of the year, but we expect to get realignment costs and the SIHI costs out toward the back half of the year and then continue to drive and get the fixed cost leverage in the business. We think we can get the margins back up in this business to good levels, but it will be much more of an industrial type business at that point in time.","Michael Halloran","So basically modest progression in the back half of the year and then more meaningful as the cost savings take over?","Mark Blinn","Yes.","Michael Halloran","And the second question just on the downstream spending outlook, a lot of conflicting thoughts there, right. On one hand you are seeing some stability emerge in the aftermarket, slight uptick in some of these larger turnarounds and obviously there's been a lot of deferrals that need to get vetted out at some point. On the other hand, you see crack spreads that are struggling a little bit right now. There's a lot of inventory and there's concerns about what the majors are going to do with their spending. How are you thinking about the downstream environment going forward next two to five quarters range and all those competing things that meld together?","Mark Blinn","Well, that's just it, I think you identified there's a lot of competing information, so we've taken a conservative view on the downstream activity. Aftermarket has shown some resilience. Some of the small projects are needed to just maintain levels of efficiency. But when you start to get the projects, we definitely take a conservative view. And, Mike, that's why if you look at our restructuring activities, we've had this view for a while.","I think when you've heard us talk we said we're going to take a lower for longer approach, conservative, aggressively restructure, particularly our custom engineered business, and then when the markets come back we'll get leverage from that. So we've taken a conservative approach. Most of the costs and a lot of the benefits are in the custom engineered design towards those downstream projects, and we do know they will come back at some point in time, but we will have a custom engineered business that will be more efficient than ever.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mark, so aftermarket awards in 2Q are on an absolute level; we're back to levels of the first three quarters of last year, actually, before oil and gas spending really fell off a cliff. So do you think they just level off here for a while, given still the uncertainty in the markets or could they start to move higher from here? You talked about potential for a refinery, turnarounds picking up, or simply maybe customers who previously deferred spend now actually spending, so what do you think from here?","Mark Blinn","A couple ways to look at it. I think from a market-driven standpoint \u2013 and one thing I want to make a point, a lot of our aftermarket opportunities are end-user strategies, where we go in and help people in any market improve the efficiency. We didn't see a lot of that last year because the reaction on the OpEx budgets was to constrain everything. But if you look at from a market-driven activity, I made the comment earlier we're in a rolling deferral period where you'll see an uptick there as if there's pressure that comes off the operating budgets. We don't see that over the short term. The market needs some stability.","You look in the backdrop of what's occurred, the concern with the majors over having to cut their dividend has certainly abated, but they're still being fairly conservative. So from a market standpoint I think we'll continue to see the rolling deferral. But the opportunity for us is to continue to execute on our strategies, because the nice thing about installed base, it's permanent, it stays, and they're always looking for efficiency. And that's what we like relative to even what we saw in 2009. They're not shutting a lot of facilities.","They are running them, and the one way you can improve your profitability is to make it more efficient. But I think from a market standpoint, we don't expect the budgets to snap back here short term. But we will continue to drive our end-user strategies. We saw a little bit of benefit of that in the second quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mark or Karyn, can you talk about how to think about EPD revenue moving forward? There are a couple puts and takes in the business obviously, stabilizing aftermarket we just talked about, but it's still weak projects business. So EPD revenue, it did turn down in the quarter, but you've got backlog down now over 20%. So should we think that EPD revenue could be down double digits at some point over the next few quarters before it starts to rebound?","Mark Blinn","Let me help kind of line out how to think about it. A big part of our aftermarket business is in that segment. And so you'll get the benefit from the market and the execution of the aftermarket strategies. Now, there's no escaping the fact that one of the biggest things that moved the needles is the projects. And I just want to make a distinction.","While it moves the needle on revenue, keep in mind it doesn't move the needle as much on earnings, especially now as we start to restructure that custom engineered business, because if revenue goes down and you have a lot of under-absorption, it can impact your earnings. But as we start taking these costs out, keep in mind those projects are very competitive in good markets and bad, but it does tend to move the needle on revenues.","So from our standpoint, until we see some project activity, we don't think that custom engineered business is going to see an uptick trend in its revenue, which is a component of the EPD business from a revenue standpoint. And again, that does move the needle. If you look in the aftermarket, we're encouraged by what we see in stability and sequential and year-over-year increases, that is also our most profitable business and drives a substantial amount of earnings. So, think of it two ways. One in terms of revenues and earnings, also think a third component of what we're doing with the cost structure in that project-related revenue.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Karyn, one quick clarification, it looks like last quarter you were saying that you're going to get $125 million of savings in 2016 in total. Now, you're saying you're getting $125 million by the end of 2016, with $25 million of that in 2015. Is that a different forecast? It's just a bit confusing I think.","Karyn Ovelmen","Nothing's changed there in terms of outlook for spend as well as the savings for 2016. So year to date, the expense is $33 million and inception to date our expense is $150 million. So of the remaining $250 million to spend, about 50% of that will be in 2016. So 2016, we are expecting to have $100 million of incremental expense. So the total for 2016 will be $125 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Mark, if you could answer this question it would be helpful. You've got a backlog which gives you visibility. You've got a little bit more stability in the aftermarket and we are largely through the month of July. So we know where the bookings are laying out. Would you say at this point you are in the middle of your sales range for the full-year, maybe toward the weaker end of that or toward the better end of that?","Mark Blinn","Well, I think Karyn made in her comments, Scott, and that's going to indicate where we are in the range from your modeling is a lot of our activity has and does occur in the fourth quarter. So we still have a big ramp up in terms of sales, but you're right, it is in the backlog both in the aftermarket and the original equipment. But just to be clear, there is an element of revenue during the course of the year that is still yet to be booked into backlog and will need to be shipped out.","Scott Graham","I guess the genesis of that question is that it doesn't really look like the OE bookings improved at all in the second quarter, whereas my sense from the first quarter was that you had a bit of a bump up off of very weak levels early in the first quarter and that got better as the quarter progressed. That doesn't look like it happened this quarter. Is that a fair statement?","Mark Blinn","Now, I'm just trying to think of \u2013 we saw some OE bookings, a small project that came through in the second quarter, I think in just trying to understand your math a little bit here, Scott.","Scott Graham","Very simply if I'm putting your numbers incorrectly, which I think I am, OE bookings in the quarter were down 22; in the first quarter they were down 17. You did face a more difficult call it stacked two-year comp, but even considering that, the OE being weaker in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis than in the first quarter, stock comp let's say maybe equalizes that but...","Mark Blinn","I got it. Yes, it does. It does equalize it. We had a real tough comp in Q2. So I wouldn't look at the year-over-year comps first quarter to second quarter. It's probably better to look in terms of what's happening on a sequential basis as we build backlog, or as backlog gets depleted. We built some aftermarket backlog, but our OE backlog particularly our big project backlog has been running down. But we did have a real tough comp in Q2 of last year.","Scott Graham","Moving on to the backlog itself, the margin in the quarter was, as has been discussed, on the weaker side of things. I'm just wondering, I know you are really being steadfast in your discipline with bookings. The margin weakness let's say a little bit more than what we've seen certainly in the first half as well is more volume than anything that's coming out of the backlog that is really weak margin. Is that a fair statement? You know where I'm going with this, Mark.","Mark Blinn","I do.","Scott Graham","A few years ago the legacy margin \u2013 legacy backlog that stayed with us for a lot longer than we thought, that's not what this is, right?","Mark Blinn","No, it\u2019s not. What you're seeing is fixed cost leverage and it's mainly volume related. And it's the fact that, I think we made this point last time, particularly in the areas where we're taking costs out, we can't take it out as quickly as volume declined. The other thing, and I alluded to this in my comment, is in the margin business when you restructure a business and all the activity that's going on, think about it, we've got ultimately will impact 30% of our sites.","You have sending and receiving sites; you have all types of activities that occur with that. That impacts your business negatively. That's why we want to get through this quickly because when you do that, you naturally get a lift because you don't have the distractions you have in the business. So when we look at our margin profile, we see and understand what's going on in IPD, that had an impact in terms of the integration of SIHI and the volume leverage as well. We also recognize in our custom engineered business that volumes have come down, but it takes a while to get those costs out of the business.","And then generally broad-based a lot of our other costs, structural costs considering where they are take time to get out. You add onto that the fact that when you make these kind of changes, there are costs in the system that we don't call out necessarily in realignment or in our otherwise results that impact your business negatively. Anybody that goes through a major restructuring like this, and we're executing very well, has those knock on costs. We expect them, we deal with them and we know we'll get through them.","Scott Graham","That's fine and that's extremely helpful, and that dovetails into my third and last quick one, possibly more for Karyn. When are we more through that? When is that more in the rear view mirror? Some of those duplicate costs and some of the potentially lost revenues, is that not until first quarter of next year?","Karyn Ovelmen","As we've indicated, 2016 is the year of major shifts that we have from a manufacturing footprint perspective, so heading into the end of 2016, as well as the beginning of 2017. So it's really coming out of the latter part of 2017 when we'll start to have the sending sites have shut down. We'll start to see any losses are under absorption or inventory carry there. So it's really more towards the latter part of 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair.","Chase Jacobson","I wanted to follow up again on the OE bookings and revenue dynamic. The OE bookings have been declining pretty steadily. I know you're coming off a tougher comp from 2014, but in total they've been coming down at a double-digit rate now for six quarters in a row. And this was the first quarter where we really saw the OE revenue decline pick up to double digits. Is that OE revenue decline going to get worse as we go over the next few quarters, just given how soft the bookings have been?","Mark Blinn","Chase, we don't break out guidance by OE and aftermarket. But what you can do is look at our guidance for the year, and you can see what stability we've had in the aftermarket business and make your own assumptions about that. But you can see \u2013 and then also the run rate business, it would tend to be more stable. And then on the margin what will impact revenue is going to be the project business. And that's what you're really seeing in terms of the revenue declines. It's primarily driven by projects that were booked in 2014 and there was good project activity there.","It wasn't necessarily at a very, very high price, but it was an okay market at that point in time. Those are rolling through backlog. That's also going to be the pacing item for taking the costs out of our custom engineered business, because when a plant is full with backlog, you don't want to start restructuring the facility. So what that reduction in backlog does allow us to do that you can't see at this point because we're still executing on it is taking those costs out of that business.","Chase Jacobson","And on the pricing, we've been hearing some mixed things I think from some of the other flow control companies over the last couple weeks, some talking about the tough pricing in oil and gas spreading into other markets like power and some talking about companies actually becoming more disciplined and the pricing stabilizing. I'd like to get your updated thoughts on the overall pricing environment in your industries?","Mark Blinn","Power has always been competitive. That's new not new news at all. It's always been a competitive business. Definitely on the project opportunities it\u2019s competitive, but I can tell you that the market and the peers out there have been relatively disciplined, certainly relative to what we saw in 2010 and 2011. So there's been discipline out there and we assume a competitive environment, and that's why we go after the costs and actually increase some of our resources on the supply chain side, but no rational competitors out there at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","So I guess my first question, I fully recognize it's probably early to ask this question, we've got another five months left in the year, but maybe as we think through 2017, Mark, at this point what are your planning assumptions for growth? Do you think that you guys can grow in 2017? And the reason I'm asking the question is really because I'm trying to get a sense for how to really think about your margin trajectory for 2017.","Mark Blinn","Again, I'll go back to my statement. Remember projects are not as profitable on the margin side, especially if you don't take the costs out the business. The way we look going forward is we want to continue to execute on our commercial strategies, and we think we have growth in that.","A lot of that is our OE run rate business, that's IPD. Look, you saw some traction in this quarter on IPD. That came as expected, actually a little bit earlier than we expected, also growth in our aftermarket business. Those are two contributors to our earnings and margins significant going into 2017. Then a lot of it will depend on how bookings come in in the second half of the year, both on those and any project activities.","We're not seeing or expecting or planning for a lot of big projects to come back here over the short term. We think the market needs to see some stability. If they do, they might start ordering some of the long lead time items in these large projects. But I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we'd see that in our order book this year. Could materialize next year and to the extent there is percentage of completion on them, we can take them into revenue, but that really depends on when we start to see them.","Joe Ritchie","And then maybe you touched on the aftermarket piece, it's nice to see the sequential trend the last two quarters. Based on what you're hearing from refineries today, somebody mentioned earlier there's a bunch of puts and takes, is $480 million the right run rate moving forward or do you still expect there to be some lumpiness in the trajectory of those orders over the next few quarters?","Mark Blinn","Well, a small amount will move the needle on a percentage basis. It doesn't take much in terms of our compares, but generally what we saw in the first quarter was a base level, which we were very pleased with, some stabilization. And I think one of the things just to understand our business, if you look at over the course of many years, even at the last downturn, our aftermarket bookings base resilient level are higher than they were before. The reason for that is this primarily, executing our end-user strategies, getting more penetration into customers\u2019 facilities, more share of their wallet. We will continue to focus on that to drive what we'd see as self help growth in this business despite whatever market conditions can be.","Joe Ritchie","And maybe one last one for Karyn, can you talk about the free cash flow dynamics a little bit? I know that you're more second half weighted, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you expected to be more 4Q weighted as well and fully recognize during this transition that you have some elevated inventory levels. Can you talk us through how to think about normalized cash for you guys and when does that start to normalize, is it a 2017 phenomenon?","Karyn Ovelmen","Through the end of 2016, we should see some liquidation through the year, but however as you mentioned that should be potentially offset with some of the build up from realignment. So as we're transitioning through realignment, we have the potential there to have elevated inventories through 2016 as well as 2017. From a receivable perspective, we have seen some delays, in particular in Latin America. We've got full disclosure in our Q there regarding particular inventories that we're looking at and so we'll continue to work through those.","Inventory, of course, is going to be reflective not only of the realignment, because it's very important as we go through the transition to ensure quality service on time to our customers during the transition. But in terms of executing our strategies, there's other strategic initiatives that could potentially result in carrying additional inventory. But of course those also result in higher margins. But we'll continue to work through that, we continue to see some delays with customers as they push out taking delivery. So market conditions are also playing there a bit.","But as we go through the realignment, the expectation is that with reduction in the sites by definition we'll have more optimized product management, more optimized supply chain and of course more optimization in terms of our inventory turns. Once we get through that realignment, we'll then really start to look at it from an enterprise-level overall from our receivables, payables and inventory from enterprise [standardized] processes and going through that project to really focus on fine-tuning the metrics in the targets there. But key right now is to get through the realignment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust.","Charley Brady","Just a question on the commentary in the prepared remarks or maybe it was the Q&A, the amount of revenues that are being delayed or held up by the transitory activities of realignment and restructuring and moving stuff around, can you quantify the magnitude of what that revenue is in the pipeline but just can't get out the door because of various realignment activities?","Mark Blinn","No, we really haven't quantified. We want to just comment generally to help folks understand what happens when you realign a business, because you're moving product, you're shutting down a facility, you typically have employees in production at the sending facility and the receiving facility. All kinds of things can occur where it gets held up in the system. You work with your customers on this. Fortunately, because of our strong execution historically and the lead times, we're not a bottleneck in a product right now. As a matter of fact, we still are the point where we try to deliver to customers and they're not ready for it.","I think what we wanted to do is illustrate that there are costs, revenue, working capital associated with moving one plant to another location. These are not standard widgets that we make that you shut it down a facility and you just stand up the other one, you're moving project management, engineering capability, pattern capabilities, all type of things, know-how, employees to the receiving site, and then you've got to be able to stand it up and you overlap. It's kind of like when you integrate to or switch over a very complicated system, there's a lot of overlap that you need to have.","Charley Brady","I understand. I guess the point I was really driving to is understanding how much pent-up demand is in your internal channel that maybe is a headwind to the revenue growth this year or is in fact as you go through this, how much of that would get released this year versus having to drag it into 2017? I'm trying to get a sense from a down 7% to 14% revenue outlook for this year, the influence on that of just internal changes you're doing that's holding stuff up that otherwise would be flowing out the door.","Mark Blinn","That's fair. Let me try to answer it this way. It wouldn't move the needle on that guidance too much if it wasn't occurring. So I don't want to suggest it's anything really, really significant, but what's driving our revenue this year is primarily the market conditions offset by some of our strategic initiatives. As you've seen out there, it'd be a tougher revenue guide this year if we weren't executing on our aftermarket and run rate business initiatives.","Charley Brady","And switching gears, if I look at the guidance, the EPS guidance and square that with revenue guidance and drill that into margins, you look at EPD with aftermarket going to 70% plus of sales in that segment or bookings in that segment, which is unusually high for that business, how much of the mix shift \u2013 you get a positive margin mix shift on a higher aftermarket percentage, but you've got an absorption issue to offset that, if you look at the back half and you look at your backlog, particularly in EPD, how much does that mix shift to a very high percentage of aftermarket, presumably it's probably going to creep up a little bit more as you go into Q3, how much of that offsets the absorption issues you're having that can drive margins higher in the back half of the year?","Mark Blinn","The absorption issues are being addressed by the cost takeout. That's the primary thing that we're doing to address the absorption in the business. Now, to your point, what allowed us to be \u2013 have the confidence in our range is going to be the aftermarket business and the run rate business, which is more profitable. But what I'd tell you is there is some impact on the absorption from the other business besides the big project business, but most of it is going to be in the cost takeout.","Charley Brady","So the negative impact I guess as we go through the year on absorption is shrinking because of the internal realignment transformation stuff you're doing, correct?","Mark Blinn","That's right. And one point I think we made on the last one, when we looked at the beginning of 2014, and this is important, we had over $160 million of under-absorption within the four walls of our company. So, we're addressing what I'd say is under-absorption we came into this market and under-absorption caused by the environment that we're in. So there's a lot of opportunity there to take costs out.","Charley Brady","And just one more quick one, on the aftermarket side of the business, you talked about break\/fix type business. Have you seen an acceleration of that or maybe the better question is has that break\/fix mentality stabilized, it sounds from your comments like maybe that still has yet to happen?","Mark Blinn","Break\/fix is not market driven, it's event driven. In other words, when you run a facility flat out and you're trying to capitalize on spreads, whatever you can generate in the revenue, break\/fix tends to come in and you don't plan for it. We actually try to help our customers try to avoid it. But that is what happens when you defer maintenance.","You don't go to standard takedown, scheduled takedown. You'll run into more break\/fix, because these things are designed to run for a period of time, and if you think about it from a flow control item if one of those goes down then basically it impacts the operation of your facility.","Charley Brady","That's the point I was trying to get to is are you seeing an acceleration or pick up in break\/fix because in fact the customers are pushing stuff out to the very limit that it can get to and sometimes it breaks sooner than they thought it was going to.","Mark Blinn","We're seeing it as a result of the deferrals. We're in a rolling deferral, so we'll see if they get back onto a schedule and stay ahead. But if they push it out, then you'll see more break\/fix activity.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Mark, if I could go back to APD and the margins for a minute, you talked about four big buckets for the margin issues that you're having there at the moment, which is absorption, increased expenses from the realignment, taking costs out of SIHI and the transition to industrial. And you also talked about the realignment taking out some of those absorption issues. So all of those four impacts should be relatively transitory. All of this stuff is planned to be finished by the end of 2017. If we held everything else constant, where do you think the margins in IPD should be in that timeframe in say 18 months once all of this stuff is behind you?","Mark Blinn","I made the comment earlier about two things. One, in IPD we think we can get it back to where the margins were before and even improving, because it will be a different business. It will be less of what I'd say the big projects; it will have fewer of those in there and more on the industrial side. It's going to take some work.","I think the other thing is I commented earlier on our custom engineered business, which is primarily within EPD, plans we put in place starting in 2014 and have continued to execute are really to designed to make that more efficient than it's ever been. So when you look at two of our important components of our business, these are really designed when we get through it to make them as efficient as ever or more efficient.","Nathan Jones","So given that and given where the margins were, is it an unreasonable expectation to think that margins in that segment by the end of 2017 are going to be double digit to low teens?","Mark Blinn","I mean if I execute well and we can drive that, we'll need some top line. That's going to be important. You've got to give me the top line variable, but if we can have some market support and execute on the strategies then we can drive the margin improvement to that level. But there is going to be a fixed cost leverage component to that business.","Nathan Jones","On a little bit of a more positive note, you talked about getting some traction on some of the growth initiatives, the long-term agreements on the aftermarket picking up. Can you talk about some of those things that are going to have a more enduring benefit to the company rather than just talking about the cyclical pressures that we're under now?","Mark Blinn","A couple of things. We've seen improvement in our distribution channel. In the aggregate, it's actually gone up slightly, but that's with a fairly significant decline year over year in North America. Where we're seeing the benefits, believe it or not, are in Latin America as we bring new distributors on, rationalize some of our distribution, improvement in Europe, and looking over the horizon at Asia as well.","Another one is just on our general commercial strategies, we haven't gone into a lot of detail, but how we've lined up our sales organization \u2013 we've always been very good at pursuing projects and I think we'll always be very good. We've got a great team doing that. But where we really invest a lot of time and effort is getting more share of the wallet, more around our channels to market, e-commerce and we're seeing traction there. It's very early days there is what I would say.","So those are some positives we certainly see. As we move this business, we're always going to have the project side of our business. We like that installed base, but increasingly and to the credit of bringing the folks in from SIHI, we've learned a lot around how profitable that business can be and how we can grow it. So early stages there on the project business, we've always been fairly solid. It's really about being more efficient, and on the aftermarket it's continue to drive our end-user strategies.","Nathan Jones","And then on SIHI, I think one of the attractive parts of that business was going to be able to leverage your global sales force to more deeply penetrate markets with their products. Can you talk about how successful that's been, and also any color you can give on leveraging your aftermarket network to capture more of their aftermarket business?","Mark Blinn","I would say we've been slower to leverage our sales force and our aftermarket for all the right reasons. They have a really solid, capable channel to market in terms of e-commerce and sales approach that we're actually adopting in our organization. So we've gotten a benefit from that. And we have yet to really scale it globally the way we need to, both on the original equipment and on the aftermarket.","It's delivered good solid aftermarket, but it's still \u2013 would say it's still fairly European-centric. But what we've done is we've been able to \u2013 really the improvement was taking what they had and leveraging it across our organization. So the better opportunities are still ahead of us with that, what I'd say, market and commercial opportunity in SIHI.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Just a question, you talked about your own restructuring process, and the way I see it's more focused on taking overhead out of the system versus the capacity. As we think about the industry, do you think any actual capacity is being taken out versus just overhead?","Mark Blinn","Absolutely, we're taking it out. We're going to take out about 30% of our facilities. A significant amount of the spend particularly in the custom engineered is capacity takeout.","Andrew Obin","But the way I think about it, isn't the plan that you're going to take out the manufacturing footprint but you put in more value streams in existing facilities, it's not like you're not going to be able to manufacture, you're just going to be able to manufacture with less overhead, right?","Mark Blinn","You're going to be able to manufacture in over less square footage over more efficient machines. We're going to actually leverage \u2013 in part of this we're moving some of the sub-manufacturing on non-critical items to suppliers as well. So we're pushing literally some of the manufacturers to third-party, but the key is there will be less square footage, much more efficiency. Now, if your question is are we going to get better fixed cost leverage, yes, but the biggest component of fixed cost leverage overheads, call it SG&A, is going to be volume related.","Andrew Obin","I don't think I'm making myself clear. People actually shuttering capacity, do you think when the industry is done with the restructuring, the ability to manufacture number of units is going to be the same or increased, or do you think the industry as a whole will be able to make less stuff? That's what I mean, because you will have your capacity. You'll still be able to deliver all the same products to your customers, just at a much better cost structure.","Mark Blinn","Got it. In terms of our ability to address the market, I can't speak for others in general, although I do know capacity is getting taken out. But I can tell you our approach is we actually will be able to deal with more volume. Why? Well, when you have a very efficient facility believe it or not they actually can crank out more volume, less under-absorption, it cranks out more volume, more automated machinery, leveraging third-party suppliers. So we have no concerns about being able to address industry demand at all.","Andrew Obin","Let me ask another question, what are you hearing from your customers about their access to capital, right, because I think last year people were clearly capital constrained because they had debt obligations, they had dividend obligations. This year it seems they are generating more cash. They've cut costs. What are you hearing about their ability to access capital? What are you hearing about their ability to go to banks and access capital? Are things getting better?","Mark Blinn","Well, yes. In general they absolutely are. Keep in mind a lot of our customers are big brand names and have plenty of access to capital. I think what we are seeing is that some view of stabilization, although as I mentioned earlier we need oil to be stabilized for a couple of more quarters here, but generally no concern over access to capital. What you did see was the marginal ones that we dealt with were impacted last year.","There are some regional elements as you look around the world; parts of Latin America are definitely very challenged, but that's been the case for a period of time. We see that in \u2013 Brazil has certainly been impacted for a period of time. But a lot of the large ones around the world are well-capitalized.","When you look at the industry in general, as you well know, a lot of them went over the last couple of quarters and secured their balance sheets. Typically if we have exposure to those folks, we would have had a letter of credit anyway, but it is good for the industry that they were able to go out and either sell some of their reserves forward or issue some equity and they did, or else also go out and raise debt. That was good for the industry, because in February there was a deal of concern, not saying that they're necessarily out of the woods, but certainly the industry is in better shape than it was four months ago.","Andrew Obin","And just last question if I have time on M&A, do you think there is opportunity to pick up some assets in this environment for you guys to be a consolidator or are you just too busy with internal stuff?","Mark Blinn","Well, make no mistake, our restructuring and realignment is an absolute priority. It is a $400 million acquisition that will yield $230 million of benefits. No acquisition can ever compare to that. Having said that, what we have seen is valuations have normalized some and we just need to be disciplined and opportunistic out there as we look at opportunities. But our priority is going to be the realignment, absolutely. But we'll weigh any opportunity against what our priorities are and we've got really good teams and people here that can do many things and do them well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna Financial.","Robert Barry","It sounds like pricing has stabilized a bit, but I'm curious to what extent you think the P&L in the quarter is still reflecting bookings that were made under more favorable pricing? And where I'm going is I'm just curious how close you think gross margin down 150 basis points in the first half is versus where we'll end up bottoming there if pricing is actually stabilizing?","Mark Blinn","It's still a competitive pricing environment, Robert, especially on the projects. I don't think there was a lot of 2014 pricing in our revenue in the second quarter, so we're sitting pretty much reflective of market conditions since the downturn right now in our P&L. We are where we are in terms of where the pricing environment, no big uptick, no big downtick in the pricing. It's competitive on the projects, so that's going to be project by project, the backlog that we had is pretty much rolled through. So really the margin profile going forward is going to be around the cost takeout.","And again, I'll mention just where a lot of these costs are, it takes time to get them out of the business. Also mix, one of the things with less project activity, assuming that it doesn't impact absorption as much is that you get more favorable mix. That's why we need to take the costs out, particularly on the custom engineered side and then what we can do on executing on our run rate strategies.","Robert Barry","[indiscernible] guess on where we might bottom out on gross margin?","Mark Blinn","We don't want to guide on that because anything can impact gross margins in any one general quarter. And where the volumes too, Robert, that's going to be an issue as well. So don't want to guide specifically on those, but a lot of our actions are designed towards enhancing our gross margins and getting the fixed cost leverage across SG&A.","Robert Barry","Just a quick follow up on the aftermarket and these life cycle agreements, I'm just curious whether they are a significant part of the aftermarket bookings? And where I'm going is just whether these LCAs are impacting the pace at which we think or should think about the aftermarket bookings reading out into the P&L?","Mark Blinn","They\u2019re still relatively small, but consistent. Historically a lot of them were in our seal business, but increasingly we're seeing them a little broader based. It's still relatively small and the point I want to make is we have to go out and earn our aftermarket every day in this business.","But what we did see is there are benefits in the environments that we're in, believe it or not. And that is one that customers want to tend to make sure in this environment they go with very, very solid suppliers, suppliers that can deliver on time and a good quality product, can meet the engineering specs.","Another thing that's important is they're looking for cost efficiencies as well. Part of the value proposition in the lifecycle agreement is going in and saying, look, we'll work with you because we do this all the time in terms of managing your costs down over a multi-year period. So they're looking for more value and we're certainly in the position where we can deliver it to them. That's really the benefit we've seen in this environment because it goes directly to their operating budgets, it gives them visibility and it gives them more efficiency.","Robert Barry","How does the accounting work if you book a multi-year agreement? Do you book the whole value upfront in bookings and then it reads out through the P&L?","Mark Blinn","No. You recognize the revenues as you deliver the product as you get paid. So there's nothing up front.","Andrew Obin","From a bookings perspective, though, how much...","Mark Blinn","You book it as order.","Andrew Obin","The full value of the...","Mark Blinn","Yes, you don't book everything up front.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research.","John Walsh","Thanks for fitting me in here after the hour. I wanted to ask a question about the cash expenditures for the restructuring actions into next year, so is there a range you can provide, the $200 million to $225 million of cash spending, how to think about that over 2017 and 2018?","Karyn Ovelmen","So basically from the actual expense going out into 2017, basically you should be looking at it in the concept of approximately $160 million for 2016. Incremental to that will be in 2017 approximately $90 million for a full spend in 2018 of approximately $400 million.","John Walsh","And then just thinking about the deltas, I know there was a little bit in the earlier answer, but deltas around debt reduction payments, pensions, some of those items you called out on that slide as we think about 2017, the deltas if any of those become tailwinds or further headwinds?","Karyn Ovelmen","Going forward, currently we are paying about $15 million a quarter in terms of paying down debt, so about $60 million annually. And 2017 will be consistent with that on the debt payments.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time.

My name is Adrienne, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations.","John E. Roueche","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation in today's call to discuss Flowserve Corporations' financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013, which we announced yesterday afternoon in our press release and Form 10-K filing.","Joining me on the call this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Taff, Chief Financial Officer.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the call to your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. Before turning the call over to Mark, I would like to remind you that this event is being webcast and an earnings slide presentation is available, both of which are accessible through our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","An audio replay will also be available on our website approximately 2 hours following the conclusion of the live call. Both the audio replay and the slide presentation will remain on our website for a period of time over the next few weeks.","Finally, please note that today's call and the associated earnings material contain forward-looking statements that are based on forecasts, expectations and information available to management as of February 18, 2014. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control. As such, we encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's press release and slide presentation, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K filing for the year ending December 31, 2013. All of these documents are also accessible on our website in the Investor Relations section.","Finally, please note, except to the extent required by applicable law, Flowserve undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of today's forward-looking statements.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Mark A. Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Overall, I am pleased with our operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2013. Our employees remain the key to our performance, and we are all committed to delivering value for our customers and shareholders. We are One Flowserve continuing to build on our performance culture and challenging ourselves to consistently exceed our customers' expectations.","Considering our results announced yesterday, we're essentially in line with the upper end of the range we provided a few weeks ago. Today, I will speak more to some themes and major strategies we've implemented, their impact on recent results and our expectations for improving performance in future periods.","For several years now, we have focused on operating and financial improvements within the 4 walls of Flowserve, and that work continued in 2013 and will remain an area of focus in 2014 and beyond. These efforts have generated substantial returns with strong contributions to gross profit and operating income, driving the third consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. One of our early internal strategies was One Flowserve. I have regularly referenced it, but its ongoing importance shouldn't be overlooked.","As a pure-play Flow Control company, we increasingly recognize synergies between our segments and product offerings. Our progress and opportunities include: better utilization of our global network of Quick Response Centers, offering our full portfolio to key common customers; measuring performance metrics consistently across the organization; implementing best practices and operating with common processes; and leveraging our corporate functions and centers of excellence, like R&D and supply chain.","While the propensity for further operational improvement remains, our progress on this initiative has already resulted in strong earnings leverage and margin expansion. During the year, our end markets experienced low but accelerating growth, and we remain confident that capacity expansion in the energy markets is on the horizon. By geography, we remain encouraged in North America, both for original equipment and aftermarket. We saw several North American projects awarded to EPCs for chemical and LNG projects. This movement is a good leading indicator for our original equipment work.","The North American aftermarket was sluggish in 2013, as refinery maintenance delays served as a headwind to the region's aftermarket work. However, we do expect a return to more typical maintenance schedules this year, and the announced activity along the Gulf Coast supports this view.","Europe continues to demonstrate stability and indications of modest growth. Assuming currency and political stability, Latin America should see increased infrastructure spending over the next few years. In Russia and the Middle East, investment to expand, diversify and update their capacity is needed, and we've seen a few larger projects move into the buy phase for our products in the Middle East.","Macro-growth in Asia is expected to continue, and our objective is to increase our presence. In all regions, similar to prior cycles, we see the early project opportunities as very competitive.","Another strategy of initial focus is our discipline around the bidding process. Here too we have made significant improvements to ensure that the new work maintains or improves the quality of our backlog.","Even as we've experienced a soft multi-year cycle for large project work, the results of our improved bidding discipline are evident in the higher-quality backlog rolling through our 2013 results and are demonstrated by our strong fourth quarter bookings growth and really, the order levels we achieved throughout the entire second half of 2013. As a result, the quality of our backlog is better today than it was a year ago.","In particular, our run rate original equipment bookings have grown nicely and created a stable higher-margin sales platform, along with our aftermarket franchise. Given that anticipated large project activity did not materialize into orders during 2013, our efforts to increase this run rate business delivered solid overall original equipment bookings growth.","From an aftermarket perspective, we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year bookings. Despite a decline in our largest aftermarket region, North America, the overall level of bookings further validates the actions we've taken on our strategic localization initiatives which facilitate our customers achieving increased uptime and efficiency from their process equipment.","We also continue to invest in our end-user strategies to better serve our customers, including the opening of 2 new QRCs. I was also pleased to see FCD deliver 9% bookings growth and increase sales in the aftermarket area. It demonstrates another example of the benefits of our One Flowserve Flow Control platform.","Our efforts growing the run rate original equipment business and the aftermarket franchise delivered on the mid-single-digit revenue growth guidance we issued originally in 2013. This modest top line growth, combined with an improving backlog and solid operational execution, produced meaningful margin expansion. A key to our 2013 progress included IPD's 12.2% operating margin, a 180 basis point increase from the 2012 levels. This improvement keeps IPD on pace towards its 14% to 15% operating margin target by the end of 2015.","With its platform strengthened, our focus now turns to growth in IPD. Our goal of consistent business growth and operational excellence to drive value is core, but it also dictates that asset optimization remains a key priority. We took a number of actions in 2013, including the first quarter's joint venture transaction in FCD, as well as this quarter's realignment investments, which will generate quick returns and more efficiently utilize our assets.","In addition, we continue to target inorganic bolt-on acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we complemented our pump portfolio with sealless pump technology through the acquisition of Innomag. Similar to prior bolt-on acquisitions, we targeted a technology gap with the opportunity to leverage the acquired products across our worldwide sales organization and capture the aftermarket opportunities of a previously underserved install base.","The operational excellence initiatives we've implemented over the last few years are central to this bolt-on strategy, as we have increased our capability to efficiently manage and integrate bolt-on opportunities. Even as more and more parties have become interested in the Flow Control space, we believe our disciplined approach to M&A is effective for Flowserve, our customers and shareholders.","When evaluating investments, which include organic growth initiatives, divestitures, realignment initiatives or acquisitions, we operate our business with an owner's mindset to drive long-term shareholder value. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation, returning value to our shareholders within an efficient capital structure, including our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1 to 2x.","During the year, we returned $535 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and took advantage of attractive debt markets to obtain low-cost, longer-term capital.","Turning to 2014. I am encouraged for this year and beyond. While I am pleased with the progress we made in 2013, our ability to build on the operating momentum we've achieved over the last several years is substantial, and I believe tremendous propensity remains.","We continue to expect significant investment in new capacity in the energy markets, but we'll focus near term on those items we can impact. We believe we have further earnings opportunity through improvements in customer service, on-time delivery, low-cost sourcing, reduced cost of quality and working capital improvement. We will continue to build on our $2 billion aftermarket franchise while growing the run rate original equipment business. We will invest in our people and advance our culture of performance.","In summary, we expect to profitably manage and grow our business to create long-term value for you, our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I am also proud of the operational progress we made in 2013 and over the last few years. Our operational strategies and initiatives, including One Flowserve, focus on the customer, disciplined process improvement and performance culture have driven synergies across our segments. The result of these initiatives are evident in our strong operating performance, which drove impressive gross and operating margin expansion for 2013 in spite of a lower aftermarket sales mix headwind.","Our disciplined investment in the operating platform are delivering returns and demonstrating improvements in a number of areas, including quality with over 2,100 CIP trained employees, supply chain, our focus on the customer through our project manager process, our aftermarket service capabilities, product innovation, and our research and development process, project pursuit, including sales proposal initiatives, the new sales organization and focus on our global customers, and our asset utilization through our lead product and secondary product centers.","Our central focus is developing a culture of performance that consistently delivers notable results. I am confident that propensity remains for an ongoing operational improvement.","Opportunities remain to pull levers previously outlined and others across our broad product, geographic and industry exposures. Last quarter, I highlighted the reduction in our past-due backlog metric, as we drove it to the lowest quarter end levels since 2009. This solid performance demonstrated the impact of our ongoing operational excellence efforts. However, in our continuous improvement culture, we recognize that our work is never complete. I am pleased to report that during the fourth quarter, we made further advancements and reduced our past-due backlog percentage to near best-in-class levels at year end. This performance helped drive the related increase in inventory turns and generated real cash flow improvement. It also showed that by focusing on and managing key performance metrics, we can achieve significant progress.","Similar opportunities remain in other aspects of working capital such as DSO and I am confident that with our continued focus on the process and the tools we provide our people, we will make solid progress in 2014 and beyond.","Turning to our order activity, we remain optimistic. Strong fourth quarter bookings were up over 17% year-over-year on a constant currency basis with growth in all regions, including notable activity levels in Asia Pacific. Europe appears to have stabilized in 2013, and we delivered bookings growth in that market for the first time since 2010.","Original equipment orders were up over 23% on a constant currency basis, as momentum in all of our segments improved. Consistent with the rest of the year, the impressive fourth quarter OE bookings did not benefit from the anticipated larger project activity but was a result of our focus on run rate work. This improvement in OE run rate environment over the second half of 2013, combined with the EPC awards we have seen, are positive indicators that the market is turning. We remain confident that a number of large projects that are building in the pipeline, and we look for the pace of awards to increase through the year.","As we have emphasized, the first few larger project opportunities that we have seen were competitive, both in price and terms. And we expect the first phase of these projects to remain so. Our approach to bidding, however, will remain disciplined, as we expect order momentum to build. Flowserve is also able to focus the customer on the benefits of our technical capabilities, on-time delivery performance and localized presence. Our disciplined approach to project pursuit and bidding that we have deployed over the last 2 years has proven successful and it remains critical to the overall quality of our backlog.","Now summarizing our end markets. The oil and gas market remained strong, with current oil prices and the positive long-term outlook supporting major investments. New refining capacity investments are expected in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Additionally, Kuwait's long-delayed Clean Fuels Project has recently been awarded to EPCs.","North America continues in the strong growth in pipeline construction, refinery upgrades, gas processing and gas-to-liquid plants to capitalize on advantaged natural gas and oil supplies. Longer term, opportunities in Mexico should improve following recent policy reforms expected to increase production levels.","From an aftermarket standpoint, we expect increased activity in the Gulf Coast following refinery maintenance deferrals over the last 12 to 18 months. The chemical market also remains strong and the outlook is very positive, as plans for new ethane capacity in the Gulf Coast advance.","The announced level of North America shale gas-related investments is impressive, valued at over $70 billion. And the majority of this capacity is destined for ethylene and ethylene-derivative projects, as the U.S. has joined the Middle East as a low-cost feedstock leader.","The Middle East is continuing their efforts towards downstream diversification, while Asia and Latin America are reassessing the chemical development plans based on continuing opportunities in the U.S.","Moving to the power market. We see it as growing driven by fossil-based initiatives in China and India. The Middle East also signals strong future growth, both in conventional and solar power. North America and Europe remain slower due to conservation and low growth in energy demand. While nuclear power remains in transition, we see continued development in China and discussions of new capacity in some regions of Europe. Additionally, opportunities continue in upgrades, uprates and recertification of aging existing plants.","Finally, we see an increased focus globally on natural gas combined-cycle plants, with U.S. expansion potentially negatively impacted by pipeline constraints. Our general industry markets continue to see high activity levels in global fertilizer projects. Mining companies are investing more carefully of late, but we continue to experience good levels of activity in parts of Southern Africa, Latin America and North America.","Finally, our distribution business, primarily valves, continued its solid performance with increases year-over-year. Wrapping up, our operational progress over the last 2 years is significant. Following the strong finish in 2013, I look forward to 2014. Encouraged by the propensity for the organization to continue this momentum, make further operational progress, deliver on our quality backlog and capitalize on expected opportunities as support from our end markets accelerates. With that overview, let me now turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Mark and Tom have pretty well covered our operational overview and business outlook, so I will discuss our financial results in greater detail and then provide some color on our 2014 guidance.","We finished the year strong with sales of nearly $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We grew revenue by over 5% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, constant currency revenues increased by 5%, or right in the middle of our 2013 revenue guidance range.","Turning to margins. Even with the 2% mix shift towards original equipment and realignment charges, fourth quarter gross margins improved 20 basis points from the prior year to 33.9%. Excluding the impact of realignment, the improvement was 60 basis points compared to the prior year.","For all of 2013, we delivered a gross margin improvement of 80 basis points despite a 1% OE mix shift. Excluding the impact of the fourth quarter's realignment charges and cost of sales, gross margins improved 90 basis points.","Turning to SG&A. For the full year, it increased 10 basis points as a percentage of sales to 19.5%. However, looking at it more normalized, it was down 30 basis points after adjusting for the fourth quarter's discrete charges and the $14.3 million of SG&A benefits in 2012. This is an area we have focused on and we are pleased that over the last 3 years, our normalized SG&A spending has remained pretty flat. We believe opportunities remain in the system. And as such, we'll continue to work towards our goal of an SG&A percentage of 18% over the next few years.","With gross profit improvement and our focus on SG&A, we delivered a 110 basis point improvement in operating margins during 2013 to 15.3%. At this level, we achieved the goal we set in early 2012 for a 150 to 250 basis point margin improvement by the end of 2014 from a 2011 base.","However, we still have this year remaining in our goal timeline with continued opportunity for further improvement, so we're not done yet. Finally, our fourth quarter tax rate was 25.9%, which was lower than our previous expectations, as we were able to realize the benefit of some favorable resolutions of tax items.","Our full year rate of 29.5% however, was generally in line with our initial tax rate guidance of 30%.","Turning to cash flows. We finished the year strong as is typical with the seasonality of our business. We generated $378 million in operating cash flows in Q4, bringing our full year cash flows from operations to $488 million. While I am pleased with the cash flow generation for the year and the quarter, we still stay focused on this area. Our goal remains to consistently generate free cash flow near our net income level.","Our 2013 CapEx was about $139 million north of our rate of depreciation, as we continue to invest in organic opportunities for the long-term growth of our business. During the year, we invested in: new capacity in China, a new facility in Brazil, expanded capacity in India, the Americas and Europe, new QRCs and expanded nuclear capabilities, to name a few.","Finally, we continue to execute on our strategy to efficiently utilize the balance sheet, while at the same time, pursuing profitable growth investments and accretive bolt-on acquisitions, like Innomag.","We returned over $535 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the year and issued $300 million in long-term notes in the fourth quarter, as we maintain our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio between 1 and 2x.","Turning to working capital. As Tom highlighted, we made good progress on inventory. We continue to reduce our percent capacity backlog and drove inventory turns to 3.5x, a solid improvement over prior year's 3.2x.","While we delivered year-over-year DSO improvement in each of the first 3 quarters during 2013, the fourth quarter was flat with prior year at 75 days. I'm disappointed in this pause in our progress, but I remain convinced we have the right plan and people focus on driving improvements into the mid-60s. We continue to deploy CIP assets across the business to evaluate and improve our processes. I'm confident we are taking the necessary steps to achieve our working capital goals and look forward to return to meaningful progress in 2014.","Moving to our 2014 outlook and EPS guidance. We are reaffirming our 2014 EPS guidance of $3.65 to $4, which we originally issued a few weeks ago. Similar to recent years, 2014 should reflect traditional seasonality with earnings weighted to the second half of the year. Absent any transactional gains, such as those that benefited EPS in the first quarters of 2012 and '13, we would expect over 80% of our full year 2014 target range will be generated during the final 3 quarters of the year.","In addition, we will continue to execute on our strategy of efficiently deploying capital, including annually returning 40% to 50% of our running 2-year average net earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","At year end, $384 million remained available under our current share repurchase plan authorization. Earlier this week, our board approved a 14.3% increase in the quarterly per share dividend, further emphasizing our commitment to shareholders. This represents the fourth consecutive annual double-digit increase. This year, we expect to invest $130 million to $140 million in capital expenditures to continue profitably growing the business organically and to further increase our capabilities around the world.","Lastly, I'd like to remind you that we will host our Analyst Day in Raleigh, North Carolina on March 26. This year's event includes a tour of our large engineered valve manufacturing facility in that city, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. Please reach out to Mike or Jay if you're interested in participating and haven't received an invitation by the end of this week.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jay.","John E. Roueche","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we have concluded our prepared remarks this morning and would now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just want to focus on the industrial products for a second. And the margin performance there was certainly better than we were looking for. You called it out in one of the -- on slide on the segment. I wanted to just get a little more granularity on where that business is going. You're moving up, you're getting pretty close to your target there. Do you see a runway beyond your initial target? I know you don't put guidance out there right now but can you give us a sense, because it sounds like you're getting there a little maybe quicker than certainly we thought you were going to. How much of that we saw in Q4 is permanent? How much of that maybe was driven by seasonality factor?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, first of all, Charlie, I'm glad to be on this side of this conversation because 2 years ago, we were telling you it was going slower than we anticipated. So it's been pretty much in line. And you, as you know, our focus has been on fixing this platform. So it's fair to say we have not run it as quickly as we could have because it wasn't where we needed it to be. And then the second thing is, when we get this thing to '14, to '15, then we can talk about where from there. We just -- we're focused on getting it there first. Q4, you can see in many of our divisions, typically, you get good fixed cost leverage. It tends to be our highest volume on the revenue side. So that will tend to benefit margins during that period of time. So it's really better to look at just the annual margins in terms of improvement because we do have seasonality in our business. If you think about it, we ship to a lot of national oil companies, parts around the world, where they have annual budgets and they either get the equipment in at the end of the year or they basically start all over. So that's what drives the seasonality. But we are pleased with the improvement. It was one of the reasons we were encouraged and brought Innomag into the platform because we think it's not where it needs to be, but it has certainly improved. And the other thing I can tell you, and it's very basic to our business, margin is an indication of how well we're executing or not executing for that matter. And when we execute well, our customers give us more orders. So what we're doing now is we're focused on growing that platform.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, I guess -- I mean, look kind of on the back of that. I mean, the Q4 bookings were up pretty strongly. If you can kind of -- and maybe you could do this for all 3 of the business segments, your top line guidance of 3% to 6% for the year, can you give us a sense of kind of, in line, above, below across the 3 segments?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, we don't break our revenue down by segment at all, Charlie. So let's just stick with the 3% to 6% across the board. I think the areas of focus that we talked about over the last couple of years, and it's pretty consistent, is our valve business has been operating very well and we're really driving for growth. And even last year, how do we optimize and better penetrate the markets. On IPD, there's still some improvement. We want to drive growth. On the EPD side, we're really focused on growing that aftermarket platform and the run rate and being very disciplined on these projects. And what I mean by that, just to give you some color, and I've made this comment before, you go back to 2010 and your focus was on absorption because you didn't know when your markets were coming. As we start to see them come, you can be much more disciplined and focused on making sure your backlog continues to progress over the period of time, especially when you have the run rate and aftermarket business that we do. It gives you the opportunity to be a little more flexible as to when you take these projects in. So as you think of our 3 platforms, solid operating, consistent operating business on the valve side, driving for growth, the same thing in IPD, and maintaining discipline in the project business in EPD, and really, all of our projects but driving that aftermarket growth.","Operator","And we have Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse on line with a question.","Flavio S. Campos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Flavio, I'm standing in for Hamzah today. You guys touched a little bit on this on the EPC side, and on Middle East, as well. If you could give additional color on your visibility on the larger projects. And maybe any single timing about enrolling for bookings or any additional color on that?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. Well, around the timing, I mean, we've been talking about these project opportunities since 2013. And so what you see is with the size and complexity of this, and I think you're hearing this from EPCs, what people are doing is measuring twice and cutting once before they execute on these. They are going to move forward with them and I think you consistently see that terminology when the awards are going to the EPC firms. But from us, again, they can move quarter-to-quarter. And so what we're talking about from our end is staying focused on growing aftermarket run rate business, make sure we're very disciplined because when these cycles come, as you saw back in 2006, '07 and '08, they're here for a period of time. And what you want to make sure is that when you're in that cycle, you don't have things in your backlog that you felt that you had to take at unfavorable economics. So that's the way we're approaching these cycles. Again, what I made in my initial comments was we -- if you think about the project business, really, with the exception of the Middle East, a little bit in '10 and '11, it's been fairly soft since the middle of 2008. And the fact is with cycles is they go down and they go up. We're due for an upswing. You're hearing it from EPCs, you're probably hearing it from our competition as well. When it will materialize, on what day or what quarter, can move especially as these things are very large and complex. But we're confident it will come. Until that point, we're going to continue to do what we're doing.","Flavio S. Campos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's great to hear. And just as a follow-up. If you could give us some detail on how pricing is doing right now and if you guys have a long-term outlook since that the industry is a little more rational right now, post acquisitions and maybe with the impact of larger projects absorbing some capacities. Just some color on pricing.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think our comment was that in the big projects, is certainly remain competitive. This is what you see on the front end of the market. Our competition is very good. It's very capable. And so they're seeing exactly the same thing. So it's really more looking at our industry. As these projects come in and capacity starts getting allocated to these project, the next thing that we'll tend to drive is price to a certain degree and then lead times in the business. But frankly, really, lead times are the last thing that owners want to push out. They want to get these facilities up and running. The longer they take to put together to assemble and ultimately, commission, the more cost attached it. That's just the way it is. So price tends to come in first. But if price starts to get a little out of whack, what they will do is start extending lead times.","Flavio S. Campos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That makes sense. That's helpful. And just as a final question, a little more on the modeling side. What are you guys thinking about assumptions on FX and the impact of devaluation we had last year, which is baked in your guidance range? And if that affects the way you're looking at emerging markets are at all or not?","Michael S. Taff","Yes. I mean, our guidance assumes basically FX neutral from what we said. So I mean, just depending on where that goes, it could be headwinds or tailwinds. But it's basically based on an FX neutral basis.","Operator","And we have Scott Graham from Jefferies on line with a question.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I do have 2 questions for you. The one, I think is an easy one, and we flushed most of this out last night with your guys. But the backlog being down on a year-over-year basis for 5 straight quarters, Mark, Tom, the bookings have been kind of sluggish up until the fourth quarter. Is there anything more we should be reading into the backlog decline? Or is it more that just the last 6 or 7 quarters before this one where things were a little slow?","Mark A. Blinn","If you look at our bookings trend, actually, they trended down towards the end of 2012 and then trended up over the last 4 quarters. I think one way to look at our backlog and our comments around past due and legacy, if you look at our original equipment backlog end of '12 and end of '13, if you take out the legacy and past due, actually, original equipment backlog would have gone up. Keep in mind, past due and legacy backlog typically, it doesn't have any profit, doesn't have an economics to it because my comment around lead times and everything, by that time, if it's past due, the economics are usually gone. And actually, there's a cost associated with it. So if you look at our OE backlog, absent the legacy and past due, it actually went up year-over-year.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. I had a feeling that that's what it is. And also, your focus on higher quality projects and all that dovetailing into that same thing. Next question was really about SG&A. And I think it was Mike that mentioned the goal continues to be 18% of sales. How much does the move of the EPD margin -- I'm sorry, the IPD margin to your goal? How much does that net you in SG&A benefit toward that goal?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, if you look at the results over the last couple of years, they've done an excellent job of really controlling those costs and holding them relatively flat. I think, as you look at our SG&A to achieve our objectives, Scott, a lot of the opportunity will be in the EPD side. Because while typically, the gross margins in large projects, because of the way they're bid and everything, are less than run rate and less than aftermarket they are large dollar amounts and you get good fixed cost leverage on the SG&A line. And I think you saw that a little bit in the third quarter of last year, where we had the good leverage on the G&A line in the EPD segment. So that's one that's more what I would call just the way financial presentation is. When you got strong top line growth from projects, even though the margins on big projects are less, you do get fixed cost leverage on the G&A line. In IPD, what that SG&A has been really on very, very good cost control, which is what you do when you're fixing the platform is you reassign those costs to their more optimal use. And that's what they've been doing. And on the FCD side, just a solidly run business. So you want to see SG&A grow, but not as quickly as the top line because what you're doing is you're adding sales folks. They've been adding aftermarket capabilities. So that's the way to think of SG&A across all 3. And then I think you and I had a discussion about this 8 years ago. I mean, on the corporate line, it's just staying focused that we hold those costs as constant as you've seen we've really done over the last 4 or 5 years. That's your SG&A story.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So it's really not a cost cut thing, it's more of a kind of maintain it where it is and let the revenue bring it down on a percent basis.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes and no. I mean, believe me, there's a lot of activity going on underneath that number where we are adding costs on the R&D side and taking cost out. So it's fair to say we are cutting costs in certain area. We don't go into them specifically. But we -- we're not in an environment where you saw back in '08, where our markets are going away from us and you don't invest in any future because you don't know when it's necessarily coming and you just cut costs. I think it's been more we have taken some costs out, but we have certainly invested in our R&D platform and other things as well to drive growth.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right, that's great. I do, though, have one last question, if you don't mind.","Mark A. Blinn","No.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","When we X out the charge this quarter from cost of sales it looks to me like your gross margin was up about roughly 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. I just kind of wondering if you can give us something specific, great, but just sizes of the buckets would be helpful. How much of that 100 basis points in gross margin was mix versus One Flowserve with Tom Pajonas head -- manning that, how much of it was operating leverage? What items went the other way? Could you give us some ideas on what those buckets were and their sizes?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. Actually, mix went against us, right? So you had a shift to more original equipment. And I think we talked about this years ago. If you look at the margin differential, 30 bps is probably a good proxy for what a 1% move in mix means, either way, if you just think about the margin differential. But I would say it's mostly really attributable to One Flowserve because what you haven't seen is necessarily big absorption gains that you see -- that we saw in 2008. You saw a lot of price and absorption during that period of time. That comes -- that is also a benefit when you get projects in as you absorb your factories better. But I would attribute it really to the One Flowserve and the efforts around that. And in that is going to be of course, improving, and improving is the operative word, execution, the quality of the backlogs, some of the things we talked about around the discipline, the focus on the run rate business. So that's really what's been driving it.","Operator","And we have Mike Halloran from Robert Baird on line with a question.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So on the, call it, the run rate business, obviously, a lot of focus has been on when these large projects are coming out. But that run rate business is a large chunk in your portfolio from the original equipment perspective. Maybe you could try to frame up what the opportunity looks like on a forward basis just in terms of how much replenishment opportunity is there from underinvestment and what some of the internal focuses have been to help drive that business high over the last couple of quarters?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, Innomag is a great example. That's -- those are basically sealless pumps. They apply to the chemical industry. And they're just -- think of them as smaller projects, replacement OE. You know ever to a certain degree the MRO, as we call it on the valve side, that when one fails or needs repair, they just replace it. So there's been a lot of focus on that. And that's where we really focus and we have the opportunity to improve our distribution channel. So that's one of the things that we are really starting to put some effort in right now to drive that run rate business, as well as Tom alluded to one of the things we did last year is we're putting additional focus and resources and structure around our sales organization to create the right incentives for folks to really go and drive some of those smaller opportunities because if you think about any organizations where there's large projects, history indicates that the sales organization is typically tilted towards the big projects because that's the larger dollar amounts, that's where you can fill your quotas quicker. So what we've been doing is focus on our channels to market, both internal and external, to drive that. But I will go back to some of these things. Execution remains a key because if you're replacing a piece of equipment, they need it on time and if they don't, they'll go to somebody else. So a lot of these things we've been doing have been trying to drive that business. And I think part of it around the sales organization that I talked about, is just create a culture that recognizes and rewards that.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Makes sense. And then on the aftermarket side, obviously, healthy growth there. Comps were a little bit easier. But just curious if there's any change in your shifting dynamics there in terms of your ability to go out and capture non-Flowserve aftermarket business. Or conversely, if you're seeing any increased competition of folks trying to come in and capture your stuff.","Mark A. Blinn","The competition has always been there. We've got, as I said, good competitors. They have service capabilities. We maintain still the best opportunity out there is going to be the customer, is to do the things like we did in the Dow Benelux a little over a year ago is, to go and get those mandates, those opportunities to help them with their uptime. I think the only trend I talked about in my comments that we saw last year was some sluggishness in North America, which is one of the bigger aftermarket regions.","Operator","And we have Nathan Jones from Stifel on line with a question.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","If I could just focus in a little bit on the CapEx side. Your CapEx numbers have been pretty elevated for quite a number of years now. And I understand that's investment in organic growth and take great returns in there. Can you talk about how much further opportunity there is to continue to invest in -- at elevated levels in organic growth?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, Nathan, this is Tom. I would say there's a lot of opportunities on certainly, the CapEx supply to R&D in terms of selling materials and coatings, diagnostics. We do a lot of efficiency CapEx also in our plants relative to the equipment. We spent a lot of time on making sure that our safety numbers are also -- are world-class. So we invest consistently in that particular area. In addition, we are continuing to add ERP systems as we look at centralizing more -- some more of those particular areas and also business intelligence CapEx in the business. And I would say, we still continue to have a lot of opportunities in the CapEx area with that $130 million to $135 million spend that we've been able to maintain over the last couple of years.","Mark A. Blinn","So, Nathan, one of the things to think about, with the exception of safety, which we think has an infinite return, we look for a 15 plus internal rate of return on our capital expenditures. So be it a new facility in China and India, which we opened one last year and we'll open one this year, Brazil was in 2012. The QRCs that we've added. So we've added hard assets to drive revenue. When we look at some of the things that Tom talked about in terms of R&D, we're looking to invest in these to drive revenue and growth and we expect a return on them. So I think your way of looking at our capital expenditures is the levels we spend it indicate the level of opportunity we think we have to provide that in excess of 15% internal rate of return to our shareholders. Again, save [ph] and except safety because safety is good business.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, Nathan, the other thing to keep in mind is, we talk about this a lot, I mean, I'd say well north of 50% of that's been rated is really growth related. So from that, we have pretty minimal, what I'd call, kind of maintenance capital requirements here at Flowserve. So always think of sort of a large piece of that as growth related.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","That's good color. On the past-due backlog, where are you at with that now? And is it possible to quantify what the margin impact was in 2013?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, as Tom talked about, we're near what good levels will be. I mean, there's still opportunity for improvement in the past-due backlog. And I think we talked about levels that were 7% plus at one point in time and we were closer to 4% at year-end. So we saw good improvement there. There's still improvement -- opportunity for improvement. I think the way to think about it is that's typically business that has little or no gross margin associated with it. And so there's still the SG&A component to it. So the -- specifically, quantifying the margin, I honestly don't have those numbers with me right now. But they do have a margin impact year-over-year. We saw it from '12 to -- '11 to '12 and then '12 to '13.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So it will obviously, be a tailwind for '14?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, we still had some past due and legacy backlog in 2013. So part of the opportunity in '14 is we cleared a lot of that last year.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And one quick one for Tom Pajonas. Could you just talk about what activity you're seeing in the pipeline markets, specifically outside the U.S.?","Thomas L. Pajonas","I would say, certainly, the U.S. is probably the most prolific in the pipeline area right now. But good pipeline activities still exist in Russia, as well as in China. So those are the, I would say, the 2 primary areas. And to a lesser extent, but still there in Latin America.","Operator","And we have Andrew Obin from Bank of America on line with a question.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question in terms of just backorder growth -- backlog growth. We've been getting calls from investors concerned about slowdown on CapEx, oil and gas CapEx. The fear is that this is somehow going to be a replay of what we've seen in mining. And I was just wondering, how much visibility do you have in terms of your bookings growth throughout 2014? And just the second question is, we have been hearing from some oil and gas equipment companies that they do actually expect maybe a pause in orders in 2014. And how does it relate to your business, which I understand is a different business, but still, we'd love to hear what you think about it.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, when you look at the oil and gas industry for us, a lot of what we do is supporting existing capabilities. So our run rate and our aftermarket business, which represents about 80% of our business. In terms of the new projects that you're seeing out there, I mean, you've heard the commentary around the energy market, LNG, chemical is energy as well in my view because of the feedstock is going to be natural gas, which leads to the pipelines and other production capabilities around that and also, around the world. I mean, when you go and look at areas around the world, and there was some commentary even Tom made, some of the infrastructure needs to be upgraded and repaired. They are still adding some capacity in different parts of the world. Low natural gas and oil production in the United States. So it depends on what the oil equipment is. But ours is kind of -- if you think about Flow Control, it's really basic to a process. So some equipment may be a marginal enhancement around the process or a specific complex application, which could be marginalized for a short period of time. But when you look at ours, ours is very basic to core of the process itself. So when we see these facilities come on or the pipelines being built, we know that's going to create demand for our product down the road.","Thomas L. Pajonas","I'll just add one -- just add a few specifics on the back of Mark's comments. I mean, there's a lot of activity in LNG in the U.S. and Canada. We've spent 5 project in Canada alone, 4 in the U.S. that have been granted licenses out of about 20 proposed export terminals. So that looks pretty good. And this whole area about LNG and transportation business could create opportunities for natural gas in North America. European refineries are going through some changes right now on that side of the business. But as the other question came up on the pipeline, the pipeline growth is pretty good in the U.S., Russia, as well as China still. And we're still seeing good Middle East oil and gas. Brazil, offshore, oil and gas. And Russia, oil and gas business in general. So we've got projects out there in the oil and gas side. And you've heard some of the EPC comments from some of their investor calls, they've got good order growth on the oil and gas side also.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a question, just a follow-up on in terms of M&A. You have been more rational than some of your competitors in terms of what you guys are willing to pay. Do you feel you're at a disadvantage with your more disciplined approach and just more -- a little bit more color on the M&A market, just given how excited people are about Flow these days.","Mark A. Blinn","Right, well I mean we're disciplined, I wouldn't necessarily say more rational. Think about some of the other transactions that have occurred. I mean, they've gone to financial sponsors hands and the financial sponsors have the opportunity to use leverage and to drive return. So for them, that's very rational. Some of the strategic moves over the last couple of years have been some assets that have traded hands because they needed that product base, that platform. So it had strategic value, which encouraged them to pay a higher price. I certainly can't argue with that. When we look at M&A opportunities, one thing to keep in mind is we have a very broad product portfolio set. So what we're looking to do is fill in between those opportunities, and that will also dictate ultimately the price that we pay for it. But for any company, if it's strategic and you can create the type of returns that make sense for your shareholders, then you'll pay that appropriate price for that. And for those that are really looking to focus and get into the flow control industry, to them, that makes sense.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Then can you feel you can operate to pretty low in this environment and still be able to source quality deals?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, we definitely do.","Operator","And we have Steve Fisher from UBS on line with a question.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","As you guys think about 2014, which of your initiatives do you expect to produce the most incremental improvement, be it on-time delivery, cost of quality, low-cost sourcing? It sounds like past-due backlog has already had the biggest incremental impact or a big one. So what about the rest of them?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, it's -- there's a lot of ones that have ongoing benefits. I mean, I think the improving execution you're seeing, we still don't have all of our facilities to where they need to be. Some of them have quite a bit of work to do. And that not only provides opportunities in terms of efficiency or margin improvement in that facility, but also you'll find customers willing to give more work when they can execute well. And then the other thing is depending on market dynamics, I mean, we may pull different levers. So I don't want to just say this is what is set on stone right now to what we're going to do and we're not going to change course. But going back, and I hate to give you a broad answer, but it is really the way we think about these things. Kind of our suite of One Flowserve initiatives that we put in place, that type environment, that type of culture takes really years to build into a business. We're only 2 years into it. And we're starting some other initiatives as well. So what I'd say looking broadly is I think the focus on the 4 walls was a big contributor last year and it's certainly going to be a big contributor this year.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then it sounds -- it doesn't sound like your approach to selectivity changes in 2014 versus what it was in 2013. But I guess, to what extent do you expect the need to be selective to change in 2014?","Mark A. Blinn","My comments earlier is you're always hopefully selective, it's just what are you choosing against? And my remarks earlier around 2010, you're selectivity was focused on absorption because a large engineering facility that isn't absorbed can get very, very expensive. So your selectivity and your variables that you look at around do change over a period of time, as you move into what are you seeing market opportunities coming for a period of time. And remember, the projects -- I'll just go back and you don't have the benefit of history, but some of the projects we took in '06, '07, '08, lasted in our business in some form or fashion all the way almost to 2011. So when we are selective, we need to think multiyears in terms of how this thing is going to play out. But I think now where we are, what we talked about is making sure that we're maintaining or improving our backlog, that we are where we are need to be, and that is be aggressive where we see a good long-term aftermarket opportunity, where we can take advantage of our LPO\/SPO strategy, where we've got a good relationship, broad relationship with a customer across our 3 platforms and we want to make sure we really leverage it, those are going to be the variables that come in around selectivity.","Operator","And we have Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research in line with a question.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So I just want to actually come back to, I think it was a question that Andrew asked about, just kind of concern about oil and gas CapEx and how it might relate to pricing. So you discussed some of the large projects were very competitive at the very start, which is not very surprising. But how much do you think that is coming from project to owners just being a lot more concerned about what they're paying for equipment and spending on their projects wanting to get the most bang for their buck, just given that there are, I guess, more constraints on CapEx than there had been before.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, I think that's issue we talked about. It's not just a concern in general, it's the size and complexity of these projects. They want to make sure -- you used the term getting the most bang for their buck. I mean, keep in mind, at times that's lowest cost and particularly, you see a lot of that in the Middle East. But in other parts of the world, that's around efficiency, making sure the process conditions are right, making sure you have the right support long term. So what I want to suggest is they are certainly competitive, but they want to make sure that you can deliver a quality product on time because they -- in the world, you may pay less for a piece of equipment, but if it doesn't work, it is worthless to you. So I think you're absolutely right, is what they're seeing is the size and complexity of these projects and they're just being very thoughtful. They need them, they need the infrastructure, but they're just being very thoughtful, and that's what tends in these cycles to kind of push things out. What you saw -- the reason it ran up so quickly, so fast back in '07 and '08, is you all of a sudden saw all the material cost and all these commodity costs spike so quickly. And what was happening during that period of time is these folks would budget these projects at X and the next time they went through a budget effort not too long afterwards, it was 1.5, 2x. And so they had to rush to market because they were concerned that 2x could go to 4x. And you saw that with kind of the commodity boom at that point in time. And this one, what you're seeing is the commodities are elevated. Certainly, oil is. Commodities justifying spend and infrastructure. But they can certainly be very thoughtful. That's not a bad thing for our industry because when you see a spike up like you saw a number of years ago, they start splitting orders. It -- they start extending lead times. Those -- that's how the market responds. So we see a fairly orderly move is for everybody. Do we all wish it would have been sooner? We certainly do. But we also understand why these things take time. Meanwhile, as we made in our comments, what we're going to do is continue to focus on what we can. The 4 walls, driving the run rate, driving the aftermarket business, which has really been the primary contributor to our earnings.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Fair enough. And just on the projects that actually have been led from the EPC perspective. Obviously, they are fairly large. And I think you can argue on average, they are larger than what we saw last cycle. How quickly do you think that will absorb industry capacity among your peers and start to make it a more attractive kind of good process for you to get involved?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, that's a good point. It depends on the pace at which they come and the lead time. I think what you'll see is they're going to try to keep the lead time short so that the project costs don't increase. And I think as these projects start to roll, and we've seen some, they've certainly been competitive more recently. But it doesn't take too long for the industry to try to allocate the capacity. Having said that, we've added capacity in certain regions of the world. A lot of that to address the opportunities there. But still, that represents capacity under our LPO\/SPO we can use around the world. So it's -- I think it's a little bit of -- it's a broader market than it was 6, 7 years ago because your buyers are now stronger in China and other parts of the world. And so it's a broader base that's going to drive the spend. But I think as you see this, what's going to happen is they're try to keep their lead times down, and that will start utilizing our industry's capacity. It really depends on the pace at which they come on.","Thomas L. Pajonas","And I would add to that. I mean, you basically are going to look at 3 areas, as Mark has kind of already alluded to, you always look at the engineering area. You look at the supply base and you look at the construction piece. Depending on regionally, how things are concentrated, you could have overcapacity in any one of those or under capacity. So it will depend -- the goals are the generally 3 areas that are indicators for you.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","If I could sneak one last in, just for Mike. So just on the working capital initiatives. With a large cycle in front of us, obviously, that would typically require working capital build, not a reduction. So how difficult is it going to be to achieve your targets over the next couple of years, given the cycle is really only just starting?","Michael S. Taff","Yes. Brian, a lot of that just depends on how well we do on the front end. I mean, a part this whole front end project when we talk about our selectivity and discipline, not only is it relates to the margin in the project, it also relates to the terms and conditions. And part of those terms and conditions is -- are the cash flows associated with those projects. So it's on us to do a good job of negotiating those terms upfront, to make sure that these large projects require advanced procurement, that we say, at worst-case, even cash flow. So that's something that Tom's group and the legal group have done of great job on putting some new initiatives in place as we look to these projects. And also, working with finance and operations and legal. We'll work hard to make sure we try to get terms that are agreeable to both us and the customer.","Mark A. Blinn","And further that, just to be clear. I mean, our goal is to have an improved working capital efficiency platform versus the last cycle. But to your point, when the cycle builds, depending on how quickly it does, it tends to tap your balance sheet. And then when the cycle turns down, as you saw in 2009, it'll tend to liquidate. But -- and you saw that in the last cycle. But I think what we want to make sure as clear is we want to have a more disciplined, efficient process relative to the last cycle.","Operator","And your last question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair.","Chase Jacobson - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can you just remind us on these big chemical projects, what the lead times are, what the normal lead times are and how long it takes from the time of award until we start seeing the revenue hit the income statement?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, if you take a look at, let's say, some very large projects, if you define it that way, from one, EPC gets an award to one. Flowserve gets a PL, could be anywhere from 6 months to 1 year. And then on these very large projects, if you're looking at a pump, it could be 18 to 24 months between PO and shipment. Keep in mind also that depending on the job, you also may be doing percentage of completion accounting so that you are taking revenues and operating income through those projects if it's percentage of completion. That then varies depending on when you go to medium, then those things coming down by 30%, 40% on the medium projects. But that's the order of range that we talked about on the very large projects.","Chase Jacobson - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So based on that and looking at some of these ethylene projects and when they're expected to start up, I know you guys have been talking about having visibility into them for a while. But it seems like they should be coming pretty soon. You also talked about competition. Are you aware of any of these that have already been let to any of your competitors? Or they're still all out there as a Flowserve opportunity?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Well, just to give you some maybe specifics. In Q4 alone, there have been several ethylene projects that have been announced, one in Baytown, Texas, one in Louisiana, one in Ingleside, Texas and another one Point Comfort, Texas. So we're starting to see these ethylene projects in the U.S. come pretty good. And again, you're beginning to see other areas on the oil and gas side worldwide. Some of the big EPCs have announced projects now in Kuwait and Oman. You've got some desal areas. I know it's not chemical but again, we're starting to see some of those announcements come out, and then you can add onto that the timeframe that we just gave you on the large projects, for when we -- potentially if we're successful winning the bid could see those projects.","Mark A. Blinn","So I mean, they do take a while to come to us. What you typically see are some of the longer lead items that go out first. They get bid first. And for us, the pumps are in the middle of the way and the valves come afterwards. And then the other -- your other question is we have, we do and we will continue to always have competition out there that will be bidding on projects as well.","Operator","We have now reached our allotted time.

Thank you for joining today's earnings call. Flowserve finished 2018 with a strong fourth quarter. We continued to build on the operating improvements from prior quarters, delivered enhanced earnings, and grew the business with our third consecutive bookings quarter over $1 billion.","I\u2019m pleased with the progress we are making in our Flowserve 2.0 transformation journey and the increased engagement of our associates. We have better visibility, a defined improvement plan called Flowserve 2.0, operational momentum, and we are beginning to execute at a higher level companywide.","Let me begin today by providing some comments on our fourth quarter and full-year results, our operations, and our end markets. For the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.58, which represents growth of over 16% both on year-over-year and sequential basis.","For the full year, Flowserve delivered adjusted EPS of $1.75, which is at the high end of our revised guidance, representing approximately 29% growth compared to full-year 2017. We successfully avoided the operational issues that were encountered in 2017, and we improved the performance in each of our segments throughout the year.","One area of intense focus in 2018 was margin expansion. For the quarter, we increased adjusted gross and operating income margin by 300 and 170 basis points, respectively. For the full year, we delivered a 90-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross margins and 100 basis points in adjusted operating margin.","Our progress with margin expansion is driven primarily by our actions within the transformation program, and specifically from the commercial and operations work streams.","Turning now to our markets and bookings. The overall conditions in our end markets remained generally stable in the fourth quarter despite the volatility in commodity prices. While the quarter did not include any individual large projects, we did book a number of $5 million to $15 million awards across each of our end markets, and again saw growth in our aftermarket bookings.","Bookings of $1.05 billion were the highest level we\u2019ve delivered since 2015. Year-over-year, it represents an increase of 6%, including headwinds from currency and divestitures of approximately 4%. For full-year 2018, bookings were over $4 billion and were up 5.7% compared to 2017.","The general health of our markets, coupled with the growth initiatives we have implemented thus far as part of our transformation are key drivers of these results.","During the quarter, we delivered strong results in our aftermarket franchise with the highest level of bookings since 2014, representing growth of nearly 15% year-over-year or over 18% on a constant currency basis. This quarterly performance helped drive full-year aftermarket bookings to a year-over-year increase exceeding 10%.","The commercial intensity program embedded within Flowserve 2.0 has our aftermarket organization focused on growth and further capturing the opportunity inherent in our large global installed base.","Additionally, our customers appear more focused on facility maintenance, facility efficiency, and meeting regulatory requirements than we have seen in the past few years, leading to additional opportunities for growth.","Turning now to our booking by end markets, and starting with our largest market oil and gas. Bookings in the fourth quarter increased 14% year-over-year, driven by EPD where we continue to capture downstream investment, including highly engineered products critical to refining modifications for clean fuel production.","Additionally, one of our strike zone initiatives that we have discussed previously is our focus on North American pipeline projects. In 2018, this commercial focus drove several wins across segments including roughly $20 million in the fourth quarter, and we have good line of sight into a number of additional opportunities in the first half of 2019.","For the full year, oil and gas bookings were up 8%. Based on our customer discussions and the status of their pre-FEED and FEED activities, we expect increased investment in 2019 for both upstream and downstream oil and gas despite recent oil price volatility.","In chemicals, our quarterly bookings increased approximately 3% year-over-year on 18% growth in FCD and a 3% increase in IPD which more than offset the decline in EPD. On a full-year basis, we delivered growth of 6%, with all segments contributing.","We remain confident in the North American ethylene project pipeline and we also expect increasing investment in Asia and the Middle East as oil majors and national oil companies increasingly pursue integration of the petrochemical value chain.","The power market remains our most challenged industry, where fourth quarter bookings declined 17% year-over-year, although EPD was essentially flat. For the full year, power declined about 11%, with only IPD delivering growth.","We continue to have muted expectations in the power markets near-term due to industry wide headwinds. Fossil opportunities in Asia remain challenged and competitive. Nuclear build in Asia continues, while Western nuclear new builds are limited and most of the opportunities lie in extending the life of existing facilities, upgrades, and maintenance.","However concentrated solar power continues to be a niche opportunity for Flowserve in a growing renewables market where we have a differentiated technical offering. General industry bookings increased 13% year-over-year this quarter, primarily driven by FCD\u2019s growth of over 40% and strong distribution activity.","EPD also contributed nearly 11% growth. This end market includes the mining and pulp and paper industries, which contributed quarterly bookings growth of 50% and 30% respectively, although both markets represent less than 5% of our overall mix. For 2018, general industry grew over 12% year-over-year.","Lastly, the water industry, which represents the smallest category we breakout on a standalone basis, declined 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter representing 3% of our total bookings. For all of 2018 water increased approximately 3% compared to 2017 due to strong performance in EPD with several larger flood control awards.","Looking at bookings by geography, we delivered solid quarterly and full-year growth in most regions. Compared to the 2017 fourth quarter, North America was up 11% while the Middle East and Africa increased 16%, and Asia Pacific was up 21%. ","Europe decreased 6% while Latin America decreased 15% off a very low base. For the full year, North America, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa increased mid-to-upper single digits while Asia-Pacific and Latin America each contributed 3% growth.","Let\u2019s now turn to our performance by segment. I will start with IPD where we continue to make good progress. The segment delivered reported and adjusted operating margins of 9.6% and 10.2%, while making significant strides on the operational turnaround in the reduction of past due backlog.","We are encouraged with this step up in performance, but recognize that much work remains to drive a consistent operational excellence, on time delivery and customer experience that is needed and expected. We believe that continuing to improve our performance will get us closer to achieving the desired mid teens operating margins from the industrial product portfolio.","While the quarter results were buoyed somewhat by fourth quarter seasonality. We are encouraged with IPD\u2019s progress and continue to believe we are on the right path. EPD also had a solid fourth quarter bookings in that segment increased 12% year-over-year including 20% aftermarket growth.","Additionally, we made meaningful progress on past due backlog and improved adjusted gross and operating margins by 200 and 250 basis points, respectively year-over-year. We are fully focused on leveraging the full capability of our engineered pump portfolio to better serve our customers and ambitiously grow our business.","FCD continues to perform a high level, the segment has consistently delivered strong operating performance, including this quarter's adjusted gross margin expansion of the 100 basis points to 36.3% even as revenue declined 5% on a challenging compare.","Throughout 2018, we improved our ability to deliver predictable financial results and limited much of the quarterly operating income variability that we have seen in the past. We have an extensive valve portfolio and we are well-positioned to take advantage of the expected increase in project activity during 2019.","I will now turn it over to Lee to discuss our financial results in greater detail, and then I will return for closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A. Lee.","Lee Eckert","Thanks, Scott and good morning everyone. Looking through our financials as Scott highlighted, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 in the fourth quarter and $75 for the full-year in-line with our revised guidance we provided as part of third quarter results.","On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was 48% which included realignment and transformation expense of $0.13, a penny of below the line currency impact and $0.04 of benefit related to U.S. Tax Reform.","Fourth quarter sales of $987 million decreased 4.6% versus prior year, which included approximately 4% of headwind from currency and divested assets, sequentially fourth quarter revenues increased 3.6%.","As we discussed previously, our traditional seasonality marked by a strong fourth quarter top-line was muted somewhat in 2018, due to the new accounting standard implemented at beginning of the year. For the full-year revenues were $3.8 billion an increase of 4.7% compared to 2017, with all segments contribute to year-over-year top-line growth.","Turning to our margins, fourth quarter adjusted gross margin increased 300 basis points versus the prior year to 33.7%, which is the highest quarterly level since 2015. IPD\u2019s 830 basis points year-over-year improvement represented over half of the increase.","Additionally, as our transformation initiatives are taking hold we continue to focus on project execution, disciplined cost control and improve the quality of our backlog. On a reported basis the 300 basis point gross margin increase was driven by essentially same factors as realignment expenses were roughly $11 million for both 2018 and 2017 fourth quarter.","For the full-year, adjusted gross margin improved 90 basis points year-over-year to 32.3%. Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A increased a modest $3 million due to elevated corporate for discreet litigation accruals and expenses, sales commissions and medical claims.","On a reported basis, fourth quarter SG&A was further elevated due to transformation expense, which we expect to see decline in future periods. For the full-year however, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points to 22.8%.","With strong gross margin improvement and an ongoing focus on cost control, Flowserve\u2019s fourth quarter adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points year-over-year to 11.9%. IPD\u2019s significant 950 basis point improvement coupled with EPD\u2019s 250 basis point increase more than offset FPD decline in higher corporate cost.","On a reported basis, operating margin increased 80 basis points where improved operating performance more than offsetting eight million increase in adjusted items, primarily related to transmission cost. For the full-year 2018, adjusted operating margin improved 100 basis points to 9.8%.","Our reported effective tax rate 18.1% benefit from the true up associated with last year U.S Tax Reform accrual. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for the quarter of 26.1%. For the full-year, our adjusted tax rate of 27.1% was in-line with our guidance of 27% to 28%.","Turning to cash. Our fourth quarter operating cash flows were again seasonally strong at $164 million, primarily due primarily due to working capital improvement and building upon the progress of the preceding two quarters.","Our free cash flow in the quarter was $130 million, or roughly $1 per share revenue representing a conversion rate, well above 100% of our reported and adjusted net income. Capital expenditures for the quarter in year were $34 million and $84 million, respectively.","We continue to pursue IT investment in the quarter that support and enable our Flowserve 2.0 agenda, we continue to invest in various growth and restructuring initiatives. For the year, we returned approximately $100 million to shareholders through dividend and repaid $60 million of term debt.","With our strong fourth quarter cash flow, we ended the year with solid cash balance of $620 million, an increase of $90 million from the end of 2018 third quarter.","As I mentioned, we delivered modest primary working capital improvements during the fourth quarter with working capital percentage of sales of 27% representing both year-over-year and sequential improvement of 90 and 190 basis points, respectively.","As I shared with you at our analyst day in December, free cash flow conversion and growth is a significant opportunity for Flowserve. We certainly acknowledge much work remains to achieve the consistent level of cash flow conversion that we believe Flowserve can and should ultimately deliver.","A number of our Flowserve 2.0 transformation initiatives are focused on obtaining the systems and process improvement tools directed at all aspects of both the order to cash and sales and operational planning process. We expect additional progress in 2019 and beyond, as we continue to target our longer-term aspiration of 100% plus free cash flow conversion.","Turning to our 2019 outlook. We are targeting full-year adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.50 a share on expected revenue increase of 4% to 6%, including approximately 2% of expected headwind due to currency and divested businesses. This level of performance would very much keep us on track with our longer term 2022 targets we laid out in December.","The adjusted EPS target range exclude expected realignment and transformation expense of approximately $55 million as well as below the line foreign currency effect and the impact of central other discrete items which may occur during the year such as acquisitions, divestitures, tax reform laws, et cetera.","Our outlook assumes that volume, price and productivity will offset the potential incremental headwinds in 2019 due to inflation, FX, merit and the planned increase in research and development in IT investments.","Both the reported and adjusted EPS target range assumes current FX rates and commodity prices. Our expectations are based on 2018 year-end backlog, anticipated booking level and the continuation of our current market conditions.","Net interest expense is expected in the range of $55 million to $57 million with the tax rate of 26% to 28%. Additionally, we expect traditional back half weighted seasonality similar to the 2018 quarterly phasing of cash flow and earnings.","From a 2019 cash uses perspective, we expect to return approximately $100 million through dividends to our shareholders. Capital expenditures are expected in the $90 million to $100 million range, we also expect full-year, debt repayment of approximately $60 million and to contribute approximately $20 million to our global pension plan, mainly recover ongoing service cost as U.S plan remains largely fully funded.","Now, let me turn it back to Scott for his closing remarks.","Scott Rowe","Thanks, Lee. As we wrap-up, I would like to spend a few minutes on our 2019 outlook and the progress of our transformation efforts. Many of you joined us at our Analyst Day in December, when we laid our transformational initiatives and longer-term expectations in greater detail.","For those who may have missed it, the presentation and audio from the event are still available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","To summarize the key takeaway, we are executing our multiyear transformation with a sense of urgency. We are changing the culture, improving employee engagement, simplifying our process and creating an operating model that will weather different market conditions.","Our long-term focus at Flowserve is to grow the business, expand our margins, improve return on invested capital and enhance the organizational health of the Company. As our fourth quarter results demonstrate our actions are beginning to bear fruit.","While we are improving we still have a long way to go, but we are committed to implementing lasting change to create sustainable long-term value.","As we previously announced, beginning January 1 of this year, we combine our IPD and EPD segment into one closure comp division. This new operating and reporting segment further simplifies and standardizes our operating model.","While we do expect to drive modest cost savings as a result the real catalyst with the combination is to drive productivity and value for our customers. The initial response from customers has been very positive. We fully expect to see this new organization will greatly enhance our customers experience with Flowserve.","Turning our expectations for 2019. We remain confident in the stability and continued growth of our end markets. Our growth oriented transformation initiatives provide the opportunity to outperform the underlying market while our cost in operational initiatives can further drive margins.","We believe that we have the opportunity to grow adjusted EPS nearly 20%, again year-over-year when we use the midpoint of our guidance. The transformation activities that are underway give us confidence that we can produce a sizable improvement. With the traction we gained in 2018 on our operational improvements, we are confident that we can deliver on our 2019 targets.","While we have delivered some additional financial from the transformational program, we are still in the early days. With each quarter, we expect to gain momentum, which will put us on the path to reach the longer-term targets we laid out in December.","I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we have made including the ongoing engagement and commitment of our associates. We are taking the right actions to build the performance and accountability driven culture to create value for our customers and our shareholders alike.","Operator, we have concluded our prepared comments and we would like to open the call to any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Hammond","Hey good morning guys. Just maybe you could talk about the disparity between aftermarket growth and OE and how you think those trends as you look at visibility shape up as you move through \u201819.","Scott Rowe","Sure. Let me start with aftermarket and then I will hit the OE. We are really pleased with the growth and what is happening in the aftermarket program. As I talked in December at the Analyst Day, we launched what we\u2019re calling commercial intensity. And essentially what that is -- and we went through it again in December.","But what that is, it is really looking at what do we have from an installed base perspective, where our QRCs are and really maximizing the opportunity at each of those locations. And we launched this in the summer of last year and we are really seeing very positive results.","We have now done pilots in each of the major geographies we are pretty much in place and live across all of North America, most of Europe, and we have just started in Asia Pacific. And so, this commercial intensity program is really helping us to grow the business. On top of that, we are seeing some macro trends that are helping us in the aftermarket side as well.","And what that is, is just after several years of delayed spending on maintenance and the focus on reliability, we are seeing a renewed effort in renewed spending and maintaining equipment and making sure that they are using our products and our service. So, the aftermarket growth has been really positive and we definitely expect that to continue as we go forward.","On the OE side, it really hasn't been bad, it\u2019s just lower than what we are getting with the aftermarket side, and what I would says is as we transition into 2019, our OE visibility, particularly on the project side is significantly higher than what we had at the beginning of last year.","So our project pipeline is reasonably full. What we are seeing from the big customers that report externally is that their capital is at or above what they are stating for - at or above for 2019 over what it was in 2018, and then when you look at the EPCs, their backlogs are higher than they were over last year as well.","And so, our project pipeline remains really healthy, and we feel good about the MRO and the aftermarket side. So, we are encouraged about our growth activities and prospects in 2019.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay, great. And then it sounds like you are making progress on past due backlog, can you just give us a sense of where you're at in kind of getting that fully caught up and kind of fully behind you from here. Thanks.","Scott Rowe","Yes. We are making progress on past due backlog and in the fourth quarter we made significant progress, and so I\u2019m not going to say we are completely out of the woods here, because we are not. We would have liked to make a little bit more progress in the fourth quarter than we did, but what I would say is on the IPD and the EPD side, we took a big chunk of capacity past due down.","We hired a new Vice President of Operations in July, we formed a new manufacturing organization in 2018, and all of that reorganization, the talent improvement, and the focus is absolutely driving the right results.","As you know and most people listening to the call, the past due backlog was really a headwind and hurting us in lots of different ways. It\u2019s hurting our customer relations, it\u2019s hurting us on revenue. It was incurring more costs and hurting on the gross margin, and then it hurt us on the working capital with built-up inventory and delayed receivable collection.","And so getting this behind us is a huge focus. And what I would say is, we are in a substantially better place than we were in 2018, and while we are not quite to the level that we expect what we want, we are actually really close to where we need to be.","And so as we go forward, really, we are not going to let up on the focus of past due backlog and on-time delivery, but we are really going to start focusing on lead times for our products and making sure that we can be extremely competitive getting our products in front of customers at the time they need it.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. Thanks Scott.","Scott Rowe","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning. So, I guess could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing out there in terms of pricing and maybe provide some context around material costs. I know, obviously you talked about productivity in there as well and there is general inflation, but maybe just trying to isolate pricing by itself and kind of the price\/material cost equation.","Scott Rowe","Yes, sure. Let me just start, I will take general comments, and I will get real specific on the pricing side. Generally speaking, and as you saw throughout 2018, we were able to grow our margin because we were on the right side of the price\/cost curve. And so, as I discussed before, we did several price increases at the beginning of 2018, which offsets the inflation in tariffs and other headwinds that we had in the global environment.","And so, we feel really good that we have got the right focus and the attention on that. Now, as we switch to pricing for 2019, we announced our price increase actually in December of last year, and it is fully in place today across all of our products.","The big question now is just how sticky is that and how much can we get, but what I would say is, at Flowserve, we are in a privileged position of having great brand recognition and being on ADLs [ph] around the world. We have got to translate that into better pricing.","And so we are going to be pretty aggressive on the pricing side, again as evidenced that we have already announced our price increase and we are locked in. And then the other thing we have done is in the Flowserve 2.0 transformation office, one of the work streams is focused and is all about pricing. And so when I tell you about general price increases, that's great, but it's really there to stay current with inflation and what is going on.","On the strategic side of pricing we are getting a lot more analytical and sophisticated about making sure that our price distribution internally is where it needs to be and that we are capitalizing on all the opportunities that we have.","And so you know that work is now starting to come through and we are seeing positive results of the analytical aspect of pricing within the transformation. But I would just say for 2019 we feel really good, we are going to be on the right side of the price cost equation.","What I would say is you know, it\u2019s still a volatile environment in terms of tariffs and trade and things like that and so it\u2019s obviously something we are staying very current on and we are staying abreast of. But right now given everything we know, we are in a good position with our newly announced pricing and we will move forward.","And then just the last thing I would just say, just like when we think about our competitors, it\u2019s still not an environment that I really like and we are seeing other competitors not necessarily follow suit.","And so when we see that we are prepared to walk away from some of the business that doesn't make sense for us or doesn't give the margins that we want, and I think that's a little bit of a change from where we were certainly in 2017 or maybe 2018.","But I also believe that the marketplace in general is moving in the right direction on pricing and I think we are moving into a good spot for 2019.","John Walsh","Great, that's a good color, thank you. And then maybe just a follow on here, as we think about the incremental margin that you're expecting in 2019. I guess at the segment level you have been executing in like a low 40s the last two years, is that still the right zip code to think about for 2019?","Scott Rowe","Well we don\u2019t give guidance on the segment level, and so I think what you can look at is the general 2019 guidance on the revenue side and EPS, it implies that we continuing to expand margins through 2019. And so with the transformational activities around supply chain and cost takeout in the pricing that we discussed, we fully expect to increase growth and operational margin throughout the year.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a follow-up on that price cost discussion. Scott, when you talk about having put price increases in December, did you think the fourth quarter benefited at all from some pull-in form the first quarter? We have heard a number of companies seeing that, people trying to avoid those price increases. Any sense that that happened this quarter?","Scott Rowe","Yes, Deane it\u2019s a great question and its actually what we expected and it didn\u2019t happen. So we were fully expecting to see a little bit of an uplift particularly on the valve side on the FCO side with some pull in business and it didn\u2019t materialize.","Now we gave them more than the December window and so we are getting some benefit of that in January, but certainly have not seen an outsized uplift because of the price increases going in place.","Deane Dray","It's really interesting. So how precisely can you gauge whether an aftermarket order is coming in? I guess, would it be because it's coming in at the old price or is there any way that you can be more precise in knowing and order's coming in like organically into the fourth quarter as opposed to trying to avoid the price increase?","Scott Rowe","Yes. This is really a good question. One of the reasons we set up the pricing work stream and the transformation was because we didn\u2019t have the analytics and the visibility to really understand this is as well as we wanted.","So what I would say at Flowserve is, we are getting a lot better at understanding the nuances on this, where we can really see those with our distributors and the ones that - particularly the ones that stock products right. And so there we have got some history with them and we can see what they have historically done when we announce price increases and that\u2019s both on the valves new and the aftermarket.","And we can get a little bit of that with our parts business with your preferred partners. But what I would say is that the visibility isn't as good as what we want and part of that transformation effort is to really get more sophisticated and analytical with our whole pricing.","Deane Dray","Got it. That's a really helpful answer. And that just begs the question of how has the first quarter started out in January, if you could?","Scott Rowe","Yes, so right now I mean we wouldn\u2019t have gone out of the guidance that we did, if we didn\u2019t have a good data point here in January. So I would say normally we would expect a showdown in January on bookings a little bit, but right now out of the gates things look pretty good both on the aftermarket and the OE side.","We feel reasonably confident in the first half of the year that we will continue to grow the business. I would say the only concern that I have for 2019 is and I talked about this before, the project business we have good visibility on and we see projects being awarded and our bookings for projects going up throughout the entire 2019.","Where the concern could be is on the MRO or the base of the aftermarket business in the second half of 2019. So that's what we are watching really carefully, but right now at least the preliminary signals at the beginning of the year are still positive that the base business or the MRO business is still continuing at a healthy rate.","Deane Dray","Good to hear. And just last question for Lee. I hate to put you on the spot, but working capital percent of sales in that 27% range did not improve year-over-year. Scott mentioned that you have got that drag from past few backlog, it's still inflating some of your receivables. But what is the target? And how quickly can you ramp down that percent of working capital for 2019?","Lee Eckert","So you definitely put me on the spot Deane. And it\u2019s an area that continues to be a frustrating area for all of us. As we have talked about at the Analyst Day and what we talked about in every earnings call, it is a significant focus. We are very focused on working capital and cash flow during the year.","One of the things that we are doing is changing our incentives to drive better working capital performance during the year. Historically, a lot of our incentives were more year end focused. So you have this big push at the very end, but during the year you would not have the intensity around it, we expanded our incentive plans include more leaders around working capital.","So we are I think pulling all the levers that is required to do it, but as we talked about at the Analyst Day, there are a lot of challenges given our systems and our processes and a lot of the Flowserve 2.0 is about putting plans in place to address those and put systematic fix in place.","So we are not going out with a percentage of how much working capital we are taking out, but I will tell you it is - we had internal aspiration and targets that we are going to make major steps in driving reduction both in inventory and receivables.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","Hi, good morning. I have got a couple of questions around the sales guidance, which organically looks like up 6% to 8%. And I guess, what I'm wondering if there is a reason that you went out with a number that large, and certainly understand the last couple quarters' bookings. But also, if you take a peek at the fourth quarter sales, those probably could have been a little bit better, whether that's a shipment issue or what have you.","So just two questions around the revenue guidance is: Number one, what kind of gets you to the high end versus the low end? And number two, there is an assumption in there of significant amount of book-and-ship business, and I'm just hoping you can give us some data points around that assumption.","Scott Rowe","Sure Scott. It\u2019s a great question and I think where we get confidence is our backlog is up year-over-year and so we had good bookings in Q3, we had good bookings in Q4. A lot of the bookings that came in Q4 were a little bit further in the quarter like book in late November and December rather than the beginning of the quarter.","And so we have got pretty visibility for revenue growth in the first half of 2019 and so I feel good about that and kind of the market comments that I just said is, we were tracking some good project work in 2019 and additionally, the health of the MRO business, which is very much a book-and-ship business throughout the year has started off 2019 in a healthy place.","In the last data point here is, while we have made significant improvement in past due backlog, there is more work to come and by clearing that and getting to the place that we need to gets our revenue into a place that gets right there within the guidance and so we feel reasonably good about the revenue guidance.","The upside, we mean we need to book some projects earlier in the year and then with the new accounting standard, the overtime or percentage of completion accounting we are picking up that revenue earlier than what you would have historically done with units of completion accounting.","But I think if we can get some of the - and when I say larger projects, you know I\u2019m thinking kind of $15 million to $30 million one, if we get those secured then is some real nice revenue uplift throughout the year there and would put us on the high side.","Scott Graham","And you are working on those projects? Is that on a pre-FEED or FEED basis?","Scott Rowe","As I have said before, we feel really good about the project pipeline right now. And so a lot of these are into FEED, they are at the EPCs. And quite frankly, a lot of them are out in the tendering and we are bidding on them right now.","So we have got a healthy list of projects and again, these aren\u2019t the mega, we are not looking at $100 million big project like we have announced before, but we are seeing a robust list of anything between kind of $15 million and $30 million with a few that are between $30 million and 450 million range and securing fewer those will put us more to the high side of that revenue guidance.","Scott Graham","That's great, thank you. And then if I could just ask a second question about our old friend, IPD, which really surprised me, and I suspect others. I'm sure that it wasn't all pushing out past due backlog for the delta in the margin. Could you give us a couple of things that really went right in the business beyond the past due backlog reduction?","Scott Rowe","Scott it\u2019s a really good point and we delivered the 10% adjusted OI, it was kind of what we had communicated publicly, kind of mid to high single digit.","So this is above what we expected. What I would say though is, the IPD team with David Wilson leading the charge here, has just done a really good job throughout the year putting the systemic and the structural things in place to move our margins back into our somewhat acceptable territory.","And a lot of that is the past due backlog reduction, we took some hard cost reduction activities throughout the year, but particularly in Q2 and Q3. We also divested the business that quite frankly was not performing well and was in the high cost region and the effort and the cost to turn it around was not worth the time or the effort in the distraction to do that.","So I think the combination of your cost reduction clearing the past due, the divestiture in the business and then what I just said and its going to sound probably - it\u2019s not the most sophisticated answer, but it really is blocking and tackling.","So we have got some really, really good products within the IPD portfolio and it\u2019s how do you capitalize on those products and make sure we are getting them to our customers and getting the margins that we deserve and how do we deemphasize them work that wasn\u2019t making money and not doing the right things and so moving away from that and really starting to focus on the place that we can create value and make money for Flowserve and for our investors.","And I would just say David brings that great perspective and the balanced approach that allowed us to move margins forward throughout the year.","Now what I would say is, I do want to caution we are probably not going to have a Q1 that we are going to generate 10% adjusted operating margin, but we are not going to be back to the levels that we had in 2018.","So we have made a step change improvement for the year, we do expect to go forward, our target in this business remains a mid-teens type business that would generate the proper return on invested capital in the industrial space.","And in order to achieve that, there are still some operational work that has to be done. There is further cost reductions, we have got to move the consolidation to pump platform together and get some other cost take out, we have got to be more disciplined on our pricing in our order execution and then we have got to continue to improve the operational controls at the manufacturing side in the operational locations within the business.","But great progress in the fourth quarter and while margins will come down a little bit in Q1, we fully expect to capitalize on this momentum and keep moving the IPD business forward.","Scott Graham","Thank you Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Hi guys good morning. Just want to clarify if I have heard it correctly that you guys said that you have more confidence in large project orders in 2020 versus MRO sustainability into second half is that correct?","Scott Rowe","For 2019 yes, we feel really good about the pipeline and the projects and again the large operators have communicated publicly their capital spending and you can see in the UTC\u2019s backlog that those projects are throughout FID and they are starting to move forward.","So we are in the middle of transacting and quoting for a number of large projects, we feel pretty good about the health of these projects. Now that can change and things do change, but everything we are seeing today, I would say that the 2019 project portfolio is better than where we are at in 2018 at this time.","Just I want to finish on MRO side. What I said on the MRO side is currently fourth quarter and our January data point looked really good. And so what we are seeing is continued MRO spend. The MRO spend can be cut off immediately and so if we have risk what I'm concerned about is a potential slowdown in the MRO business in the back half of 2019.","But right now, everything we see and where we were at the end of Q4 and what we have seen at the beginning of this year, all looks good that the MRO spending is relatively healthy and combine that with our internal initiatives then we should to grow the MRO spend as well.","Andrew Obin","Yes. I guess the reason I asked, because one of your competitors sort of highlighted the fact that they actually expect bookings to accelerate into 2020 and I guess they felt quite a bit better about MRO, but I think there were highlighting sort of pet-chem and LNG into 2020. Can you just talk about how much visibility you have on a longer term basis, because these are very long-windowed cycles and I\u2019m just wondering if you guys could actually see acceleration in bookings on OE work into 2020 if that\u2019s a possibility.","Scott Rowe","Yes. We are very focused on 2019 here, but I would just say, our lens and window is not as great as it needs or should be. But I will answer the question, again right now what we are seeing and I would say on the oil and gas side primarily refining and the midstream space plus the chemical space, there are a lot of project opportunities that go from 2019, 2020 and into 2021.","And what has happened is there has been a significant underinvestment over the last four years and so at some point that catches up, we showed this at in our pressure curves is in the December Analyst Day. And so if you believe the pressure curves and it's kind of the under spending theory and that demand stays somewhat constant or it grows a little bit then you get increased capital into 2020.","Now what I would say is I\u2019m not going to go a 100% and commit that 2020 is going to be a great number, but right now the project portfolios look pretty good and things are lining up to continued health in bigger projects and infrastructure spending for 2019 and 2020.","Andrew Obin","And how are you thinking just a follow-up, because the same competitor highlighted the fact that they sort of need to hire more engineers and field technicians. Imagining of planning of sort of roof capacity to meet the growth, but do you have the people and where do you get them?","Scott Rowe","Yes. So right now we are communicating a reasonably moderate growth level of 5% to 7%. We have plenty of people, we have got plenty of capacity and that is not a concern for us right now. There are some very niche aspects in our business that have grown at an outsize than others. And so that's an area where we have got to do some selective hiring, but in general this is not a concern for us at Flowserve.","Andrew Obin","And I will just sneak one more and I apologize. Just in terms of the mix OE and aftermarkets, are you guys being more selective on OE in Q4? Is that part of what happened in Q4?","Scott Rowe","No, I would say we started being more selective on the OE earnestly at the beginning of last year. And so what I would say is we have been selective. I don\u2019t think it's necessarily a cause for a little bit lower OE. I would say some of that was just timing of orders and some of it could be due to selectivity. So we have raised our margin expectations and we have raised our price when those things happened and we are not going to win some of the awards that potentially could have come our way.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. I really appreciate your time. Thank you.","Scott Rowe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Brett Linzey","Hi, good morning everyone. Just wanted to come back to the aftermarket, I mean very solid bookings in the quarter. I mean historically those aftermarket bookings tend to ship in the quarter, but you had sales only up modestly. So just trying to understand the disparity there it's been wider than it has been in quite some time. Is it the nature of the work or customers ordering further outs, preorder had a price any color would be helpful?","Scott Rowe","Yes. So no, again the MRO bookings and the aftermarket bookings in the fourth quarter were fantastic. What I would say is a lot of that came in a little bit later in the quarter and so we didn't get to do the book-and-ship that we wanted. But the backlog is up and we feel very good at converting that. Its typically very short cycle work within like you said it's within a three month window and so I would expect us to convert on the backlog and see nice growth in the aftermarket side of our business.","Brett Linzey","Okay good. And then maybe just shifting back to free cash flow, specifically working capital inventory and some on the asset side. It sounds like plans are under the way, you guys are making progress there to address some of those issues, but you are guiding for fairly strong sales for the year, which typically requires some working capital build. So I guess in that context do you think that working capital assets can be a source of cash this year given that balance?","Scott Rowe","I will let Lee to answer this question.","Lee Eckert","So Brett, what we are modeling right now is we are really driving to improve the velocity of those. At a minimum it would be nice to keep at least somewhat flat, but it could be slightly a burn depending on where the sales end up. So we are focusing on as I said the velocity and the of turnover both AR and inventory and obviously managing our payables correctly. So it will be nice to drive the growth and minimize the cash burn associated with that.","Scott Rowe","Yes. So really what we are trying to do is, if we can bring down the velocity on those two then it will offset the need of working capital build with the growth of the business. So I would say it\u2019s probably not going to be a source of cash, but this is a huge opportunity for Flowserve, we have got a lot of attention and focus on it.","What I would say is, some of the numbers don't necessarily show this, we have actually made tremendous progress in the back half of 2018, and so we fully expect to continue on that progress.","And then the other thing I want to highlight and Lee said this earlier, historically at Flowserve we have been very focused on working capital at the end of the year and while that's wonderful for one data point, it really doesn't drive what we want to do, it doesn't get the cash freed up throughout the year. It really doesn't help you on your long-term return on invested capital metrics.","And so we have really put the attention and focus on doing better on working capital throughout the year and in fact we are changing our incentive plans for 2019, it could be an average rather than an endpoint. And so I think we should see demonstrated improvement quarter-over-quarter on the working capital metrics throughout 2019.","Brett Linzey","Okay great and then maybe just one housekeeping. You mentioned in the release normal seasonality of the business, but it does sound like the savings may be further in towards the back half, is there any framework you can give us or guide post be it percent of the year first half, second half to help us calibrate things here for Q1, Q2?","Lee Eckert","Sure. What we said and I will just reinforce is that, I would use 2018 as the guidepost for earnings and cash. Our expectation is that year-over-year each quarter you will see an improvement and I would use that as the baseline.","The other thing I would just kind of maybe highlight from a modeling standpoint, and Scott hit on this a little bit earlier, we acknowledge at the first quarter of 2018 we did not have a - we had horrendous cash working capital quarter. We know that going into the first quarter of this year there is some seasonal bill, but we don\u2019t expect it to be to the full extent that happened last year.","We are as Scott mentioned, we put quarterly cards in place, we have an eye on it, we talk about it, in January we are talking about in February that we cannot have this huge outflow of cash in the first quarter like we did last year.","Brett Linzey","Okay, great. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones","Good morning everyone. Going back to a few questions here on the bookings. Aftermarket bookings at nearly $550 million in the quarter is pretty close back to previous peak levels on the aftermarket bookings side. You guys have talked about commercial excellence initiatives to try and drive better penetration into your current installed base. Can you maybe talk about if you're seeing any benefit from that or if getting back to this level is purely market lift and potentially there is some further upside from these commercial excellence initiatives or if that's already started to be embedded in this bookings number?","Scott Rowe","Yes. The initiatives within the transformation is called commercial intensity and we are defiantly seeing an uplift due to commercial intensity.","So it\u2019s both the internal efforts combined with some release of MRO and maintenance spending at the largest installations. So I don't know, it\u2019s hard to say is it 50\/50, is it 70\/30, but it definitely is a combination of the internal efforts and the market.","And what I would say is we have got really good visibility and I showed this example in December where we have a pilot in a target account, we are tracking to the uplift that I shared in December at those specific sites, which is mid-teens type growth improvement.","So we have validated that, this commercial intensity program is incredibly effective and like I said in December, there is really nothing novel or innovative about this, but it really is providing structure and process for our leaders out in the field to make sure that we are fully capitalizing on our installed base and in our service capability.","So just by doing that and putting this operating system in place, we are seeing this healthy uplift. We are not going to get that across every single location, but for the sites that we have designated as this is an opportunity, we are seeing the demonstrated kind of a mid-teens growth.","And so I would expect that to continue throughout 2019 and I said this is a little bit earlier, but North America we have gone live, we have now gone live in Europe and we are probably at about 60% deployment and we have just started the process in Asia Pacific and the Middle East.","But we are getting good uptick, the team is incredibly focused and I think really what it does is it put that aftermarket group now very focused and aligned to growth rather than just focusing on the margins and the delivery.","Nathan Jones","Okay. So that sounds like you think that there is upside on the aftermarket side to where the previous peak levels came in. On the OE project side, I mean, when we are in 2016, when you start getting these $5 million to $15 million or $15 million to $30 million projects, there is generally not a whole lot of margin associated with those and they absorb fixed costs. As we are coming out into a better demand environment, are you starting to see the margin profile that you can bid these projects had improved? Are you starting to see pricing on these things improve? Do we still need to soak up more industry capacity before you can really start to see those move?","Scott Rowe","Yes. it\u2019s a fair and a good question. And historically you are right, on large projects you attract a lot of attention, then there is a lot of different bidders for the EPC forcing the pricing down.","Again, I said this a little bit earlier, we are very focused on moving our margins up and we are not afraid to walk away from something that's not going to meet our margin threshold or the margin that we think we deserve or we are booking and executing these larger type work.","And so, we have turned work away and we are going to target areas and we are going to target partners where we know we can make the margins that we need to make. And when we look at the project portfolio and the things that we are tracking to in 2019 they all have a higher margin than what we have accepted over the last couple of years at Flowserve.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Maybe just a quick one on the backlog quality. I'm sure you don't want to talk about what the exact margin and kind of things are in backlog. But could you maybe talk a little bit about how much better that margin is in backlog now and at the end of 2018 than they were at the end of 2017? And if you expect that quality in backlog, that margin profile in backlog to continue to improve as we go through 2019?","Scott Rowe","Yes. So Nathan, I'm not going to give any numbers on that. But it's certainly implied in the guidance right and so you can see in the guidance that we are uplifting the margin percentage with where we likely ended on the EPS guidance. And I said this a little bit earlier, but we have really started to be selective and focused on margin in our backlog and really focused on pricing at the beginning of 2018.","And I would say throughout the year, we got better and better and so every quarter we have been able to get more confident in building that margin in backlog. And so we have got some pretty good momentum here. And I would say - what I'm talking about is it really applies more on the pump side than the valve side because which is the valves have historically kept reasonably good margins even throughout the cycle.","But on the pump side, we definitely expect to continue to expand margins given what we booked thus far and I don't see that changing here at the beginning of 2019.","Nathan Jones","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Scott Rowe","Thanks Nathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Charley Brady","Hey, thanks. good morning. Just kind of background on Nathans questions on the large projects out there. I guess more - kind of medium-sized projects. We are just hearing that the pricing competitiveness is still really, really tough out there and relative to what a normal margin might be considered, it\u2019s still maybe anywhere from 500 to 700 basis points delta. I\u2019m just wondering is that something you are still seeing, is that pressure lessening in all or is it is more confined in certain area than other areas, you are really not seeing that sort of pressure.","Scott Rowe","Yes. There is defiantly pricing pressure out there and what I would say is when you get an EPC that\u2019s launching five different bidding process and we have got a bunch of people competing then the margins are not going to be very good.","Where we have some proprietary technology and we are able to leverage that and then selectively add in other pumps and valves around that, then our margin profile moves up and it's in a much better place. And so part of our efforts within the transformation is to really get more proactive about our planning.","when I talked about sales and operational planning before, but we have implemented now our CRM system, we now have global visibility to demand and we have got a much better understanding of where capacity our capacity is and so we can make more informed decisions and be more selective about what we want to take and not want to take.","And so while some of these projects are going to command or get a lot of attention from our competitors and drive prices down, we are not necessary going to compromise on that and we are going to go find the ones where we think we can make the right money and where we can provide either the right solution or the right technology that brings Flowserve the value that it deserves in these projects.","Now the other thing I would say is, I\u2019m thinking more on the pump side here, if we look across the peer group and where folks are, we are starting to see some capacity fill up and I would expect the pricing should continue to improve throughout 2019, but what I would say is there are still projects and some activity out there that is not what I would have expected because I would have expected more discipline on pricing with the peer group peer at the end of 2018 than we saw.","Charley Brady","Scott that\u2019s really helpful, thanks. And then just one more for me on IPD. So the margin obviously in the quarter was a lot higher than we expected and then you come from that. I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of that I guess margin lift was due just from flushing out the past due backlog versus I guess the core business operations for lack of a better term.","Scott Rowe","Yes. I don\u2019t want to give in too many specifics, but I mean clearly it was a combination of all three things, right. It was the margin improvement, there was definitely some seasonality with the fourth quarter just in fact that we are so focused on end of year rather than all quarters, we had a little bit of that and then we have got some operational improvement and then we had this divestiture that was a losing margin business that came out of the system.","And just the combination of all of that and then back to what I said earlier, just the blocking and tackling and the basic fundamentals of running a business in a proper manner is allowing us now to get our margins into much healthier place.","What I would say is, 10% was better than we had expected, we had been saying kind of mid to high single digit and so we defiantly had some wins in the quarter, but we feel really good about the sustainability in 2019 over the full-year to continue to grow the full-year margins within that platform.","Charley Brady","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano","Hey guys, good afternoon. So I just want to start on cash. In the quarter I think on the operating cash flow side, some of the variance versus where many of us might have been seem to be unlike the accrued liability stays on rather than like a traditional working capital account. So one is there anything like we should know in that account going forward? And then Lee just like on your longer term 100% conversion how should we think about that? There is obviously a big move from where we are today. Like how linear should that kind of be? Or is it going to be kind of a step change towards as we get closer 2022? How do you kind of foresee that?","Scott Rowe","So let me answer the second question first. So I think one of the things on cash conversion that we are trying to improve upon is I would say is first the gap between reported and adjusted earnings. As part of my prepared remarks, I highlighted that right now roughly adjusted - adjustments roughly around $55 million. That is significantly lower than where it\u2019s been.","So the first thing is really trying to improve the quality of earnings and have fewer adjustments. So that\u2019s part of it. The second part of it is obviously the working capital performance, and just continue to expanding our margins.","So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say its linear, but we expect to do significantly better in 2019 than we did in 2018 and just having fewer adjustments to the step in the right direction. And as I talk about earlier, improving our working capital performance is also another step in that.","So we hope to get there sooner. We are not waiting till 2022 to get the 100%, but we are going to be - we are looking to make it I would say a relatively step function improvement in 2019 and 2020.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And was there anything in that accrued kind of category that need to...","Lee Eckert","Yes, I mean there was some adjustment around pensions, the discount rate change and that lowered some of our liabilities, but it really didn't have I would say an immediate P&L impact. The discount rates lowered that liability and there has been some adjustments around some environmental accruals and so forth. So I wouldn't point to something that is significant.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And then on margin. I mean two things here. One on IPD, obviously we don't want to get in a situation where it's a big surprise positively in 4Q and then it sets up to be a surprise negatively in 1Q just given where we are coming from on a comp basis. So historically it looks like 200 to 300 basis point kind of sequential move from 4Q to 1Q it seems like an average before things kind of went haywire.","How would you kind of handicap that now? And then like broadly with margins, I just want to get a sense of what kind of savings are you baking in into your 2019 from like the restructuring efforts, I guess the incremental inclusive of savings seem fairly modest given that kind of organic growth. I'm just trying to gauge your conservatism in that margin number.","Scott Rowe","Yes. So let me talk about the first quarter first. And Lee said this earlier, I think as you think about our earnings and revenue over the different quarters, I think using 2018 is the good go by in terms of what to think about.","On IPD specifically, it was a big quarter as what we had expected. And Q1 will not be as good, and so it\u2019s going to come down, I'm not going to give you exact number, but it will definitely come down.","But when we think about year-over-year, we do expect to continue to grow the IPD margins and quite frankly all of the platform margins. And then the second half of the question was - remind me what did you want in the second half there, was that more on the full-year right?","Joseph Giordano","Yes, I was just curiously like in your earnings guidance, how much like savings are you baking in from like the restructuring efforts that you have done in 2018 and you are planning on doing in 2019. This is like incremental theme even at the high end below 40% or so. It seems conservative based on the 6% to 8% organic growth for you guys, I'm just trying to\u2026","Scott Rowe","Yes. That\u2019s a fair question. I will just say, the way I look at it I is like a EPS from 2018 to kind of what we are guiding at the midpoint and its a 17% growth and so that doesn\u2019t feel conservative at all to me.","I get where you are going when you kind of back into that incremental margin and what the basis points improvement is. But what I would say is, we feel pretty good about the guidance, we think it is aggressive, but we also think its achievable.","We said this a little bit last year right, we are not going to put something out that we don\u2019t think we can make and quite frankly our internal plans and everything that we are trying to do would be higher than what we are putting out in the guidance for 2019. But we have got a lot of good momentum, we are doing the right things and if we can move margins up higher and at a faster rate than we are not going to let off of that.","Everything is wired around the transformation program, right so the pricing work stream, the operational work streams is around supply chain, cost takeout and the other things are all in full-motion and we are going to execute those as fast and as furious as we can throughout the your 2019. We are making good progress on this.","Joseph Giordano","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Hi good morning guys or I guess good afternoon. Thanks for fitting me in. just got a lot of grounds uncovered already, but I guess one thing that sticks out on some of your aftermarket commentary is that I think we came off a pretty strong second half in 2018 in terms of turnaround activity in refineries, the calendar looks good for the first half of 2019 as well. But I would imagine at some point you hit tough comps, is that part of some of that second half apprehension in MRO sustainability?","Scott Rowe","Yes. I think that certainly factored in, and then just quite frankly we just don\u2019t have the long-term visibility on MRO spending, right. We don\u2019t get a lot of communication here and hard to track it.","Like I said earlier, what we hope though is that the market and the spending levels increase and than what we do know is that our commercial intensity program are going to drive your growth above what we have had historically and expand our market share of what we have from the installed base.","So we have got that working for us and quite frankly just the question is from an customer standpoint how much spending and availability is there in the back half of 2019.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","And I guess that\u2019s kind of the corner at the center of the question is are you getting a sense in the marketplace that customers have caught up from unsustainably low levels of spending to where they are overspending near-term and growing from this level is not as obvious.","Scott Rowe","No. That\u2019s not what I said, let me be really clear. You know everything we are seeing right now points to continued growth. Right the fourth quarter is good, the data point in the first quarter is solid. And so we fully expect that MRO spending maintains or continues to grow.","What I\u2019m just implying is like if there were risk and pulling us down to the lower side of what we guided, then it could potentially be a slowdown in the 2019 MRO, back half for the year MRO spending.","But right now, we are not seeing that, we are not seeing it, but we just don\u2019t have that visibility that it continues in the back half of 2019.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one question for Lee around free cash. Lee I assume that you guys are call it working capital neutral, which would be some good progress given the level of growth that you're expecting in 2019. Just between restructuring and pension that it kind of brings down to somewhere in the neighborhood of 75% conversion, is that a good starting point or is there anything else on discrete lines that we should be aware of?","Lee Eckert","I think our aspiration is to be better than that.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Okay. Got it.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our second quarter results and our earnings of $0.90 per share. This performance keeps us on pace to deliver our full year targets.","Additionally, our quarterly bookings of nearly $1.4 billion highlight our growing aftermarket franchise and run rate business in the beginning of sub mid-to-larger OE awards.","Our solid bookings included over $530 million of aftermarket, and we increased backlog of $2.85 billion, up 11.5%, or over $290 million since year end. This increased level of orders supports our outlook for near-term revenue growth.","As a project cycle commences, we expect to see the traditional pattern where longer lead time products are awarded first, benefiting our EPD and IPD segments, both of which realized nice bookings growth in the second quarter.","With our key energy markets expanding, we will maintain the discipline and selectivity that has served Flowserve well and leverage our geographic diversity and pursue emerging regions with a cautious eye towards volatile regions such as Russia, Middle East and Venezuela.","Our employees' commitment and dedication is the cornerstone of our performance. We are gaining traction with our performance culture initiatives, while maintaining a high level of engagement and customer focus. Their efforts have delivered another quarter of solid financial results and enhanced our operational performance, which provides the opportunity for an increased focus on growth, both organic and M&A while continuing to meet or exceed customer expectations.","Sales came in below our expectations this quarter. However, this was largely timing related, including some delays due to customer change orders and delayed inspection. Mike will cover our financials in detail, but we remain confident that the second quarter's increased backlog will drive revenue growth in the second half of the year.","During the second quarter and, really, year-to-date, we have delivered improved margin performance. Each segment during the second quarter generated increases in both gross and operating margins. This performance highlights the benefits of our disciplined and selective bidding process, combined with our operational improvements and ongoing cost control focus.","We have made a number of margin-related commitments during the last few years. One was to increase operating margins by over 150 basis points above 2011 levels. We have now delivered 4 consecutive quarters above this threshold, even reaching the upper end of our stated range.","While we recognize margins can and will vary quarter-to-quarter, we have made significant progress on this target over the last 2.5 years, and it forms a solid foundation for the future.","A key component to our recent margin improvement continues to be driven by the IPD segment. As we have discussed the last few quarters, IPD has made significant progress improving its operating platform. This quarter's operating margin of 13.3% is closing in on the 14% to 15% target that we established several years ago. And we remain committed to achieving this target by the end of 2015.","To continue the margin progression at IPD, we have shifted its emphasis towards growth, and its 14.5% increase in bookings during the first half of 2014 is an excellent start.","Returning the focus to our total bookings. The $1.38 billion level this quarter was an increase of 12.6% year-over-year.","We're also pleased that aftermarket bookings continued its positive trend line, up over 5% this quarter, but the impressive original equipment order growth of nearly 18% really moved the needle.","The original equipment awards were a combination of a few large- and mid-sized awards and strong recurring run rate orders.","First half aftermarket bookings of over $1 billion in 2014 represent a 6.7% increase year-over-year and highlight the success of our ongoing commitment to end-user strategies in supporting our customers.","This consistent aftermarket business, combined with solid run rate activity, provides stability as the expected ramp-up in project awards begins to take hold.","We are very encouraged that this quarter's overall bookings growth occurred across all of our end markets and in every region. We believe this indicates an acceleration of project activity that supports our growth plans. Tom will speak to our end markets in greater detail, but looking at our business by region, following a few years of reduced activity, the Middle East rebounded impressively, with bookings growth of 20% in the first half of 2014.","After Europe showed signs of stability in 2013, we are pleased that this region's bookings growth was nearly 16% year-to-date, while North American bookings increased nearly 6%, supported by strong chemical and oil and gas production.","Latin America continues to face political and financial headwinds, but we are encouraged by modest bookings growth in the second quarter, as well as by recent actions in Mexico to increase oil production.","Finally, Asia-Pacific continues to be a focus area as our strategy is to further increase our presence and market penetration to support growth.","As we move into the second half of the year, we are supported by an increasingly efficient operating platform and opportunities in our key energy markets, both of which are expected to continue. I'm confident that our strategic actions taken over the last few years significantly improved our capabilities in operations around the world. These improvements will enhance our attractiveness to clients for new work. And while I am pleased with the demonstrated operating progress we have made across our segments, I'm equally encouraged by the potential for further improvements. We are committed to capitalizing on our opportunities to drive profitable growth and deliver shareholder value.","So with that overview, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter and first half results have largely rolled out as we anticipated.","As Mark mentioned, we did incur some larger shipment delays as customers deferred inspections or issued change orders. This just impacts timing.","The improvements of both our bidding process and our operating platform continue to drive our strong margins and earnings performance. I believe after several quarters of talking about it, we now see the acceleration in our energy markets beginning to occur, as evidenced by our strongest quarterly bookings level in over 6 years.","It is also worth highlighting that this quarter's activity is even more substantial, considering that currency, commodity and pricing levels were much more favorable back in 2008.","In terms of our segments, the EPD and IPD drove the growth, as pumps tend to have longer lead times and, thus, tend to be leading indicators.","FCD bookings were actually down for the second quarter, but this reflects the general lag between the pump and the valve business.","We expect FCD bookings to follow the leading indicators. And the valve sale in Q1 2014 also impacted the Q2 compare by about 3% on orders and revenue. While larger original equipment project activity is important for our long-term growth expectations, our run rate original equipment activity and consistent aftermarket business continue to provide a stable earnings platform.","I'm particularly pleased with our aftermarket performance. The second quarter of 2014 represents a third consecutive quarter with aftermarket bookings exceeding $500 million. And the last quarter was the first time we had delivered 2 straight quarters above that amount.","I truly believe we have taken this recurring higher-margin business to another level. Considering its attributes, this business will remain an area of emphasis. We continue to make disciplined investments in our aftermarket footprint, including the new QRC we opened in Asia-Pacific this quarter.","As we prepare for the building cycle and larger project work, I am confident that we are and have been focused on the right areas to capitalize on this opportunity through superior execution. Even after making significant progress over the last few years in our One Flowserve and other initiatives, we continue to believe significant propensity for further improvement remains.","Among others, these include operational excellence, ongoing focus on the cost of quality and on-time delivery, customer focus and localization investments, development of a performance culture and investment in global project management expertise.","The consistent margin improvement we have delivered over the last few years reflects the success of our operational initiatives, and this quarter's strong gross and operating margin improvement in all segments further validates our strategies.","Now looking at our end markets. Oil and gas activity was strong in the second quarter, with bookings growth over 25% and a positive long-term outlook. We booked our first ebulator order in North America this quarter since 2008. Ebulators have the longest lead time among our rotating equipment, which makes this award a positive leading indicator for upcoming refinery activity.","North America activity continues to be driven by pipeline construction, refinery upgrades, gas processing, oil sands development and gas-to-liquid plants, this being on account of favorable natural gas and oil supplies.","Additionally, continued opportunities exist in LNG facilities, particularly in the U.S., as projects progress through the regulatory approval process. Recent approval of condensate exports from the U.S. may support additional production.","We also continue to expect new refining investments in the Middle East and Asia. These refining investments plus those in other regions will likely challenge the European refining market.","Europe is, however, expected to increase diesel production. Brazil's proceeding with FPSO development. Longer-term opportunities in Mexico should increase following the recent policy reform intended to increase production levels.","From an oil and gas aftermarket standpoint, maintenance activity in the Gulf Coast continued the first quarter trend, with increased bookings growth off the lower levels we faced previously.","The chemical market also remains strong as new capacity investments in North America continue to advance, including ethylene and ethylene derivative projects, as the U.S. has now joined the Middle East as the low-cost feedstock leader.","Over the next decade, a 30% increase in U.S. chemical production capacity is expected.","In the Middle East, downstream expansion efforts continue. Meanwhile, Asia and Latin America reassess their chemical development plans based on competing opportunities in the U.S.","Now moving on to the power market. We continue to expect growth. China, India and Russia continue to pursue fossil-based projects. The Middle East also sees increased activities both in terms of conventional and solar power. North America and Europe, however, remain slower, due largely to conservation, the lack of a consistent energy policy and modest energy demand drivers.","However, the low price of natural gas and recently announced CO2 reduction guidelines should continue to drive the U.S. combined cycle market, subject to pipeline capacity.","Nuclear power remains in transition, but we see continued development in China, Russia and South Korea, and discussions of new capacity in some regions of Europe.","Following new safety standard requirements, Japan is moving closer to restarting a portion of its nuclear capacity, idle since 2011.","Finally, natural gas combined cycle plants are a global opportunity.","Strength in Latin America drove increased bookings in our water market, while strong activity in North America drove higher general industry bookings this quarter.","Wrapping up, I am encouraged as we head into the second half of the year. My confidence is rooted in the accelerating energy markets we serve and our enhanced operating platform that is now consistently delivering solid results for our customers.","We remain focused on growth, profitability, execution, the customer and driving returns for all of our shareholders.","With that overview, let me now turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Following Mark and Tom's operational overview and business outlook, let me now discuss our financial results in greater detail.","With our solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2014, we are on pace to deliver on our full year targets.","Second quarter EPS increased 7.1% to $0.90, and this amount included $0.03 of foreign exchange headwind below the line, severance and realignment expense.","In addition to the revenue impact of some customer-driven delays mentioned earlier, we also experienced the effect from the Naval business sale, completed last quarter, which will remain a headwind for the second half of the year as well.","Considering these factors and negative currency impacts on the first half of the year, we now expect revenue growth for 2014 to be in the lower half of our original guidance of 3% to 6%.","I was particularly pleased with the gross margin improvement across all segments this quarter as operational excellence initiatives continue to take hold and our disciplined bidding process has demonstrated its impact in our current revenues, as well as by improving the quality of our backlog, which will be recognized in future periods.","Our focused cost control was again evident in the SG&A line even as we continued to invest in our R&D, quality and project management resources, among other important initiatives.","Our total SG&A expenses declined year-over-year in the second quarter even as it increased slightly as a percentage of sales.","Our longer-term goal remains to reduce SG&A as a percentage of sales to the 18% range. I believe the programs we are executing and our ongoing cost focus, combined with a growing top line, will enable us to achieve this commitment in time.","Operating margin of 15.9% is approaching the high end of our previously announced 3-year margin-improvement guidance of 15.2% to 16.2% by the end of this year and includes solid improvement across all business units.","Additionally, IPD continues on track for its targeted 14% to 15% range by the end of next year.","In addition to the higher-quality work and operational excellence initiatives, we also benefited this quarter from a 1% mix shift towards aftermarket.","Below operating income, foreign currency had a negative impact of roughly $4 million in the second quarter versus a slight benefit last year due primarily to movements in the Brazilian, Mexican and Singaporean currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We continue to work to dampen the impact of foreign currency volatility on our results and monitor FX closely, as the strengthening dollar typically is a headwind.","Our tax rate for the quarter was roughly 29%, consistent with our expected rate of approximately 30%.","Turning to cash flows. We generated $74 million from our operations during the quarter, similar to last year. We delivered a modest improvement in our year-to-date operating cash flows and, consistent with the normal seasonality, expect to generate a significant portion of our cash in the second half of the year as we continue towards our goal of consistently generating annual free cash flow near our net income level.","Major uses of cash in the quarter included share repurchases and dividends totaling $65 million as we continue to return value to our shareholders. Capital expenditures were $22 million, and we repaid $10 million of debt. Working capital remains a key area of focus, but progress often feels 2 steps forward, then 1 back.","We currently are facing challenges clearing receivables in a timely basis in some emerging markets, such as Latin America. While the customers in these markets have consistently paid their bills, the persistent delays in payment are negatively impacting our DSO. We are taking a number of corrective actions to improve the situation, but it continues to take time and effort.","Inventory has increased due in large part to our growing backlog. Turns were relatively flat with last year as we continue with operating improvement resulting in our third consecutive quarter with past-due backlog below 5%. I remain confident that we are taking the necessary steps to achieve our targeted cash conversion levels and we'll continue to emphasize this area.","Moving to our EPS guidance and outlook for the second half of the year. We are reaffirming our 2014 earnings guidance of $3.65 to $4 per share following our solid first half results, continuing operational improvement and accelerating end markets. I think thus far in 2014, we've demonstrated our ability to grow earnings even in a modest revenue environment through higher-quality revenues and exceptional operating performance. With our 4-year revenue target now in the lower half of our original 3% to 6% guidance, it indicates we expect revenues will pick up smartly in the second half of the year from both increased activity levels, as well as from the backlog we've increased year-to-date.","Turning to our capital priorities. As mentioned earlier, we continue to return value to our shareholders and remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital deployment, including organic and inorganic opportunities. We will continue to invest in our business to increase our capabilities in emerging regions and our aftermarket strategies to deliver profitable growth and, as such, continue to expect CapEx in the range of $130 million to $140 million.","In summary, Flowserve's financial position is solid. We have a well-defined leverage and capital return policy. We're a strong cash generator and have sufficient capacity for growth investments. Much like other areas in the company, we have opportunities for improvement and believe the expected turn in the cycle will prove beneficial for Flowserve and our metrics.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jay.","John E. Roueche","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we have now concluded our prepared remarks this morning and would now like to open the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question online comes from Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on margins. And, Mark, you've touched on sort of your margin target in the prepared remarks. Maybe if you could give us a sense of how much of the low-hanging fruit on the margin side is behind you? You've done a lot of realignment work, you have the One Flowserve initiative. Is it fair to say that the margin upside over the next couple of years will come more from mix with the aftermarket and potential pricing rather than the cost side? Just trying to get a sense of where is the upside on margins going forward. Where does it come from?","Mark A. Blinn","Okay. Well, if you look across it, one of them is the fixed cost leverage on the G&A. If you think about it over the last -- in our year-over-year compares, we haven't gotten leverage like we did in prior periods because of the relatively flat revenue growth. So that's an opportunity on the fixed cost leverage side. Moving up the P&L, you saw good improvement on the gross margin side. But what I will tell you, Hamzah, is we still have some work to do in some of our facilities. So there's room for improvement there. I think we talked about in the Analyst Day, we're about halfway through where we need to be. It takes time to get the businesses running as efficiently as you want. And so there's still work to be done that will benefit the gross margin line as well. And then continuing to look at what we call continuous improvement or realignment, we see there's opportunities where we have under absorption. We've added new capacity in emerging parts of the world. It's very efficient capacity. So we're always going to have opportunities to drive additional margin through just continuous improvement and, really, looking overall at our footprint long term. And then you've mentioned also the pricing environment. So as you kind of move into these cycles, as we've talked about before, it certainly is competitive. We did -- we see it still in front of us. What you saw this quarter was, as Tom mentioned, some of the longer lead time products that we have really are what supported some of the mid-sized and one sort of larger project that we took in during the quarter, but that certainly is still in front of us as well. So that's really how you drive the margins in the business. And I think another thing is continuing to invest in our business in some of the products where we can command margin and drive our aftermarket growth. So we certainly have some opportunity as we look forward to drive margin in this business. But as you know, what we like to do is when we have our commitments, and Mike talked about them in his comments, we like to deliver on those and then we'll talk about where we're going from there.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And just a follow-up question. The second half sales ramp based on your guidance seems much higher than what you've seen in the second half on sales historically. I know you've mentioned customer change orders and some deferrals. Do you have any sense of how we should think about your confidence level in the second half on sales? Is it possible to quantify what was deferred? Any color there?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, yes. If you looked at -- we talk about where we are in the cycle, and I'll go back again to '07 and '08 just for kind of edification. That was a period of time where sales were coming almost as expected because there was a big push to get these things in the ground and installed because of what was going on with the commodity prices and economies. And the other thing, frankly, I'll tell you is when execution isn't at the level where it is now in our company, oftentimes we can become the gating item on a project. So with the improved execution, what we're able now to do is position these to be delivered to customers, but it's really up to them as to when they want to take it. The last thing they want to do is store a piece of equipment on site for a period of time because it sits out in the elements. So that is not atypical from this cycle. So as we look forward, what we see is we want to make sure we're ready to deliver these things. If they need some additional changes to the process, conditions or additional elements to it, respond to that, capture the value from doing that. But as we look forward, we do see typically Q4 is our, I guess, revenue quarter has been historically in our business. We know these projects are moving forward. We are not the longest lead time product on it, so we know that there's a lot of work that's been done on these projects and they're going to get installed. So that's how we look at it and when we do our revenue forecast going forward. I think what you heard in my comments is we expected a little more revenue up to this point, but what has occurred doesn't surprise us.","Operator","Our next question on the line comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the makeup of the 13% bookings growth? In other words, specifically, by -- you had a couple of references to longer lead time projects in the pumps side, which is obviously the business product line that carried the bookings this quarter. Typically, you are sort of 2 to 5, 2 to 6 quarters in terms of the monetization of the bookings into revenue. Has that -- is everything still -- the bookings, let's say, what percentage of the bookings is still within that range? And maybe this quarter, what kind of fell outside of that range to maybe a longer lead time?","Mark A. Blinn","Sure. Let me -- because -- and I'm going to do it intentionally, let me build from the bottom up because I think that's still an important way to look at our order book. We -- underlying our bookings growth, a lot of it was mostly driven by our aftermarket and run rate business. We did see one order around the $40 million range, which would represent about 3% in some of the longer lead time products that we talk about. Keep in mind, and I think we've discussed this before, Scott, those projects typically have percentage completion accounting. So if you're looking at how those convert to revenues from engineering to installation, it will be, in terms of how costs build up over that period of time is to how we'll bring that into revenues. The other middle sized ones were near at that level. So if you think about our order book and how it's kind of built, it's been really still the base things that we've been talking about before, the good aftermarket growth in the run rate business. Run rate can run 2 to 6 quarters depending on the type of product, where it is in the project, what the lead time potentially is in that business.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So what I think I hear you're saying is that the underlying -- a lot of the underlying bookings where the run rate business and whatever that number is, and then after that, you had the large order, which I'm going to assume what you mean by that this more than 6 quarters, although because that's percentage of completion, we'll see that beforehand. And then mid-sized orders, which would be -- maybe I assume more toward the 4- to 6-quarter territory.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. I mean, the mid-sized ones, especially -- and Tom commented on some of the longer lead time equipment, depending on where it falls within the accounting in terms of percentage of completion, but typically, those are fairly expensive pieces of equipment, those are long lead times. So to your point, I think that's right in the range that you've talked about.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So fairly balanced bookings, nothing that would make it so that the bookings that you had this quarter, this 13% uprising here, is all to '16. It's going to be sooner than that for the most part?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, that's fairly consistent. And I think you've heard that from the market in general, is the big project opportunities are still out there. What we saw this quarter was some of the longer lead times, typically our ebulators. And the point to that is those are good leading indicators. Keep in mind, by the time they're ordering a gas turbine or some of this longer lead time, there's a significant amount of investment that's already been made in the business. So it gives us the confidence that these things are going to move forward.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understood. And the second question is, and I don't want to read too much into this, but there was some wording in the press release around acquisitions and divestitures not affecting the lower end of the 3% to 6% guidance or, I should say, not inclusive. Are you seeing an improvement in M&A possibilities? Are you contemplating more divestitures? Again, is there something that I should be reading that -- am I reading too much into that or are things maybe a little bit more active?","Mark A. Blinn","No. I think -- well, let me kind of walk through. One, that statement is made just because we don't know what we may execute during the year. And so what we want to do is say, \"Here's our view at this point in time, it's January.\" We added Innomag at the end of last year, and we made the divestiture early on this year. What you should expect around when we talked about realignment, divestitures, or whatever it maybe is continuous improvement in our business. We want these things to earn the cost of capital and the good returns for our shareholders. And if they don't, then they're probably in a better position in other folks' hands. That's the message that I think we've been consistent on. The other thing, I think, to talk about is we're adhering to our bolt-on strategy. But one of the things with the improving platform is we feel more confident in being able to bring things and put them on our platform because it's reduced integration risk, and it gives us the opportunity on the margin relative to where we were 2 or 3 years ago to certainly be more opportunistic, but we are going to stay disciplined on it. Nothing is, really, in a sense, changed except for as this platform improves, what we do is it gives us the opportunity to be more opportunistic on some of the assets that are out there. I can tell you, it's still competitive for these assets. That's just the way the market is right now. There's certainly a bid in flow control, and we just got to be mindful of that, that we get returns for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question on the line comes from Charley Brady from BMO Capital.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just back to Scott's question on the backlog. I mean, how much -- I guess I'll just ask straight out, how much of the current -- or end of second quarter backlog gets recognized in the next 12 months?","Mark A. Blinn","You can look at our disclosures in our 10-K, and I don't remember what those numbers are, but typically in FCD and IPD, there's a substantial amount well in the 90% that roll out within the following 4 quarters. And I think at -- and I don't remember the disclosure, but it's probably around the same for EPD, especially when you consider the original equipment aftermarket mix that's in the business. So a substantial amount of our backlog rolls out in the next 4 quarters and going back to the aftermarket business, that tends to be shorter cycle over a couple quarters. A bulk of that goes out during that period of time. Run rate is shorter cycle. And then these projects, depending on their size and their lead times, will -- they'll roll through in percentage of completion, but typically they don't get shipped for, oftentimes, over a year.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right, okay. I just want to clarify that. On the aftermarket side of the business, given the strength you've seen in the aftermarket, can you talk about -- as you look at your installed base, maybe update us on kind of -- are you seeing a better capture rate on your installed base then you have, I don't know, a few years ago? Or what's -- is it just the fact that you have a much larger installed base and that's driving growth in aftermarket?","Mark A. Blinn","I would say capturing more of our installed base is an area of opportunity. And we will be discussing that more and more over the next 2 to 3 quarters with you because we think that certainly is a big opportunity for us, is to capture more of our installed base. We have done some of that. What you see in -- that can drive aftermarket a lot is our end-user strategies. Some of our what I would call consulting capabilities, in a sense, and I don't mean we have a consulting arm, but we work with customers around efficiency and uptime, because if you think about it, with energy cost where they are, the biggest cost on our customers face is operating these facilities, so they're looking for efficiency. So it's a whole set of strategies, which have consistently drove -- driven this growth over a number of years. And the point to that is in good times and bad, if we take good care of our customers, we can get growth in this business. So as you look at what can drive aftermarket, an opportunity for us is doing a better job of capturing our installed base in our business. I think we do a very good job in the mechanical seals businesses that we have. But certainly have an opportunity in the other rotating equipment and our valve business. And as we continue to deploy some of our end-user strategies, we think that will drive growth as well. And then also, just one other thing, and I think we talked -- I know we talked about this in 2008, 2009, with some of these projects, as they come in, oftentimes there's what's called commissioning spares. Basically, when they start up a new facility there are spare parts that are required as you gin up or prime the system, so that will be an opportunity as well.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And just one final one. Your commentary on IPD, kind of the shift in strategy there moving towards more of a growth orientation. Can you discuss that in a little more detail. I mean, what does that actually entail? What's the specifics on kind of looking at more growth than kind of fixing the business from where it was?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, one example is the Innomag acquisition that we made. Again, those are more opportunistic than anything else. Something that we mentioned during our Analyst Day is investment in the sales organization, making sure we develop products. For years, we've been talking about the ISO chemical pump that we brought to market. So spending more money in those areas and investing more in those areas to drive growth and -- because the one thing you got to keep in mind going back to 4 or 5 years, when execution isn't at the level that it should be, it's difficult for a sales organization, any sales organization, to sell into those operating units. So as we've improved those operations now, we can invest more on the front-end of the business to make sure we drive through the increasingly efficient operations. But those are the things that we're doing, really, across all of our businesses. Remember one of the fundamental tenets we believe in: If we execute well. We think that's our best opportunity to get our customers to do business with us, and they would tell you the same thing.","Operator","Our next question on the line comes from Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question just -- so the bookings commentary, that was helpful. That makes sense. I'm still looking at the second half ramp in sales. You're looking at high-single digits to get to the guidance range. So I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the cadence you had, some of the change orders, you had bookings this quarter. Just wondering, is it even heavier weighted towards 4Q than a typical year?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, again, I don't want to start parsing quarters. Look, I think going back to the original comment, the cadence in our backlog is driven as much with the customer right now as anything else. And the cadence in our bookings is going to be driven by markets and lead times that are required. So I can tell you right now, it's not -- as these things ramp-up, it is not a tight market, so that tends to shorten lead times on the products because time is money on these projects. If you go back to 2008, the market was tight, and so lead times were extended and I mean significantly, 30% to 40%. Something that would typically go out in mid-40s, we're going out 70 -- 72 weeks. So how this backlog rolls out is going to be as much driven by the customer if anything else. And in fact, that's what you've seen in the first half of this year. So as we look out over the horizon, as these projects start to mature and develop, that's going to drive it as much as anything else.","Michael S. Taff","Jamie, it's Mike. The other thing I would just add is just look at the increase in the backlog. Backlog's up $293 million since the end of the year, and then another metric to look at is backlog's up about $185 million year-over-year. And that $185 million is composed of $56 million. That's in aftermarket. And, certainly, we would expect that to flow through in the second half of the year. And then $129 million is up year-over-year in OE. And as Mark talked about, that's a combination of these run rate items, as well as some of the longer lead time items, so you'd expect some of that $129 million to flow into the second half of the year as well. And so that will help you little bit with the math as far as it gives us the confidence that we can hit the lower end of our guidance range.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on free cash flow. You've laid out the aspirational targets there for a little while. But just wondering what maybe should we expect in progress over the next 12 to 18 months, given that you've had some of the customer dynamics in Latin America and OE starting to pick up?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think we've really been working hard at that, and we've got a number of tools that we've actually are rolling out as we speak. They went live actually this quarter and a number of new process and procedures and all that. So I'm optimistic we'll see that. Certainly, some challenges with the Latin American environment, but, I mean, that's been a very good region for us for a long period of time. It's about 10%, 11% of our total revenues as a company in that region. So -- but I do expect that you'll see some progress over this next 12 to 18 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So my first question was really around the deferred shipments. Can you quantify exactly how much was deferred from a growth and EPS perspective and whether you expect that to come through in the third quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","Joe, actually, I'm having a little trouble hearing you on that. What -- can you state your question again? You might want to go a little slower. I think, you're getting some feedback.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry about that. Yes, so the question was really around quantification of the large shipments that were delayed this quarter into 3Q. First, your -- can you quantify the EPS and the revenue impact, as well as whether you expect that to come through in the third quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. I mean, we'll give you a high level. We saw probably about $50 million to $60 million of revenue roll through on these projects from one quarter to the next. Again, though, keep in mind, that can happen again in subsequent quarters as well, but that's generally what we saw relative to our original forecast.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And it clearly was a good order quarter for the company. Middle East, yes, it seems to be a big driver in the first half of the year. Can you provide some commentary on the pricing and competitive dynamics that you're seeing in the region today?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. I think I've made the comment before, and it still applies. That is, that's certainly a competitive area. When you look -- when you're bidding on projects now and the aftermarket opportunities, you can get certainly good margin on that. But the Middle East is competitive, but it's important. We have significant investments there. We've seen good growth there. It does yield great aftermarket opportunities over the long term, but it certainly is remaining and, we think, will remain a competitive market. We've seen that. That's been in our backlog for a number of years. So what you're seeing now is -- still reflects the competitive environment in the Middle East.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, but there was nothing -- you didn't sense any increased competition or the pricing dynamics intensifying in recent quarters?","Mark A. Blinn","No, no. It's been similar for quite a while.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I guess one last question for you. On the aftermarket, you mentioned that you're taking the order book to a new level. Given -- is this $500 million plus the right new normal just given your focus in your end-user strategies, potential better penetration in IPD and FCD? Or is some of this really driven by utilities and refineries that had deferred maintenance spend, you're starting to see -- you're seeing a pickup here over the last few quarters? I'm just trying to get a sense for underlying demand versus the opportunity for you to just increase your share.","Mark A. Blinn","I think the consistent cadence over the last 4 or 5 years has been an up step in the trend from our end user strategies. You've certainly seen where we're running refineries flat out in North America, and we'll see a decline year-over-year and that. But the general underlying theme in our business is, as Tom talked about, is we're driving aftermarket growth. That's been a consistent theme for 4 or 5 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","EPD bookings, I'd like to ask a question there. That was much stronger than we expected in the quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense for your view of the momentum there because as we go back to last year, we had a nice run up there as well from Q1 into peaking in Q3 before it backed off. And so I know there's some lumpiness here, but I think there's also some momentum building in these markets. So I want to get your sense in terms of timing. Was this a kind of the stars aligned kind of a quarter? Or would you expect the momentum here to continue?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, the EPD is 2 stories that are really very connected. The aftermarket growth, you're going to see a lot of that in the EPD segment. So if you look at our valve segment, historically, that percentage has held consistent because a lot of what's in their OE is quick turn MRO, which is like aftermarket, but you just replace a piece of equipment. We've seen good growth in IPD, but it's a smaller segment. So when you think about what drives EPD bookings, it's going to be our growth in the aftermarket business. And yes, to your point, these projects. So the opportunities that Tom talked about, these longer lead time products fall in the EPD segment. So I don't know not if it's much of stars aligning. It can be lumpy. And oftentimes, when we compare year-over-year as we will be next year, we may be comparing to the project that we took in this quarter and that was in the EPD segment. It can be a little lumpy, but what you should expect as these opportunities come on these projects, that it's going to really benefit the EPD segment. And as we drive our end-user strategies, they will certainly get a significant share of the aftermarket as well.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then in follow-up there. In terms of pricing, so you have the one notable project win in EPD, and I think you've said many times that you expect some of these early projects as the cycle builds to be very competitive, but you want to stay disciplined on your pricing. I'm just wondering, can you talk about pressures you're feeling from your customers? I think there's been a lot of talk about customers pushing back and rebidding projects. And how do you just balance that dynamic between customers not wanting to pay more and maybe some of your competitors are willing to be less disciplined than you?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I still maintain this: As I look at our competitors, they are all disciplined, and they do things for their reasons. The way we look at those opportunities is if we can deliver on time to our customer at an appropriate cost. And I think the message here is we've got to look at efficiency within our facilities to drive more cost efficiencies to be competitive in the market. I think where 2 competitors in our industry will have difficulty competing, one gains in the advantage over the other, is if they can't deliver on the lead time, if they don't have the technical capabilities, if they don't have the product offering, if they may not be able to support it over a period of time, and that will drive it. Now does that mean that on a certain bid, one might think it's more beneficial than the other and drop their price in the competitive bid process? Yes, sure, they can do that. They've always done that. But you were right, customers are demanding value, but if you can provide it, they're willing to pay for it.","Operator","Our next question on the line comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on M&A environment. I mean, you guys sort of said you will allocate capital in a disciplined way. Can you just talk about the M&A environment and if you think there are even any targets available in North America? What are you seeing in Europe? What are you seeing in Asia? Just a broad overview. Because I wonder if anything can be done at all over the next 12 months.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, I think we've been talking about this environment for a while, and we've been able to successfully bring in some bolt-ons over the last couple of years. There are assets out there. Some of the larger ones everybody sees and they're going to be fairly competitive in terms of people acquiring. From our standpoint, we really need to look at what we've talked about before. Can we drive the efficiency and deliver value to our shareholder by loading it onto our platform? One of the advantages we have is we've got a very broad platform, sales platform and aftermarket platform, which allows us to realize what I would say are the top line in margin synergies in the business, and then you can get down to the cost take out. But I know a lot of the market right now is around SG&A cost takeout or what's driving M&A transactions. We'll stay to, really, the strategic value first and being able to drive top line growth and leverage it. Now taking a step back in the environment right now, there are assets out there, there are assets that are coming out there. A lot of people certainly have their eyes on them, and we'll just have to be disciplined in the way we approach it. But as we talked about in our Analyst Day, over the next couple of years, our cash generation is going to support our ability to take advantage of it. We're going to stay disciplined. So it's opportunistic. If you talk to any company out there, it's one of the things that probably have the least control over is when an asset becomes available and is it going to be at the price that they want it. So we'll keep an eye towards that, but at the same time, what we want to do is to make sure we're focused on our organic opportunities in improving our business platform. Because, to my comment earlier, we've got plenty of room for improvement here.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Let me ask you just a follow-up question. Your execution on relatively weak top line has been pretty good. How do you balance margins versus execution when volumes start to accelerate? And what are you guys doing internally to make sure that you can execute on higher volumes without negative margin impact?","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, that's a great question, and I think that it probably has about a 45-minute answer, but I'll try to summarize it for you. Our lead product, secondary product strategy is to where we actually create more capacity in a product line globally. Not only does it drive efficiency, cost efficiency and the ability to deal with higher volumes, but it really positions us to be able to take care of customers all around the world and be responsive, especially where there's local content that's required. I think the other thing is just some of our work -- our focused initiatives around some of our facilities to get them improving and get better output. As I made in my comments earlier, in all of our segments, particularly in EPD, we have the room for improvement in some of our facilities to bring them to a better level of better level of efficiency. And efficiency doesn't necessarily mean cost reduction, oftentimes it means better throughput and really reducing the under absorption in the facility. So those are the things that we work on. The discipline around how we'll take an order in and make sure it's clean. It helps us to drive shorter lead times and more efficiency. Those are 3 examples of things that we're working on so that at the end of the day, it comes back to execution and being responsive to the customers and discipline in how you take these things. What we don't want to do is set ourselves up in the bidding process to disappoint our customer.","Thomas L. Pajonas","And as Mark mentioned, I mean, one of the bases for dealing with increased activities is to have a good base to begin with, that's where we spend a lot of time on over the last several years getting that on-time delivery, correcting the quality right, setting up the low-cost sourcing base and making sure that the businesses can take the load and execute on the base, and then gives you that opportunity to increase when that volume does start to come through the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Mark, I think this is probably the most bullish I've heard you on the project cycle since, I guess, the last recession. We're always looking at this not being a quarter-to-quarter business, and I think there's definitely a big change in tone from the last quarter to this quarter. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on where that confidence comes from and what you see out there in the market that's giving you the confidence to be a little bit more open about the way you're feeling about the cycle?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, one thing I'll emphasize that where the tone has been consistent is my optimism around the opportunities here in terms of improving the business and our run rate in aftermarket. But to your point, it is good to see some of these longer lead time products come in. Because we've been having this discussion now for 4 or 5 quarters of the opportunities are on the horizon, and we've all been patiently and, maybe some folks, impatiently waiting for these things to come in. So I think that's what gives us some encouragement, but I definitely want to make sure I'm balanced in saying that a lot of the opportunities are still in front of us. I think you've heard that generally from the market. We were pleased to see some of these longer lead time products come in during this period of time. And I think what's giving the most optimism or what I'm very encouraged about are what was in my comments. The margin improvement and the progress I'm seeing in this business gives us the platform to really be able to drive growth in this business, to remain competitive. That's what's been more encouraging. Simply put, it's good when a plan comes together. And we embarked on this a little less than 3 years ago, and I'm just -- I think you're hearing more than anything, I'm just pleased with the progress. That's what's driving my optimism more than anything else. The markets will be what the markets will be. We know what the secular drivers are in the energy industry around the world. I know we've got work to do. I'm also encouraged by that. As we sit here right now, I know we still have 2, 2.5 years more work to be able to improve our platform. So from management's perspective, when you have things to work on and your plans are starting to come together and you see your core base business of aftermarket original equipment starting to grow and continuing to grow and now you see some project opportunities come in, you're encouraged, but you're always balanced to know you still have work to do.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, margin improvements obviously have been excellent. Assuming that this cycle is as strong as I think most people think it's going to be, where are you in terms of capacity, I guess, just in terms of manufacturing capacity and then project management and all the other things that you need to deal with a big up cycle?","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, that's a good question. I think in the project management, we're still in the early to mid-stages in terms of bringing that discipline to the level where we need it to be, and we're working very quickly. We made a lot of investments in that area. On the capacity side, we have ample capacity. If you think about what we've added around the world, in Brazil and not only was it more square footage, but its state-of-the-art and the throughput and efficiency is significantly higher than the other facility that we had. We've added in China. We've added our third block in India. And then I think just our LPO\/SPO strategy, which brings up a lot of additional capacity, we're comfortable with the capacity we have going into this environment. Especially as we see right now, it's more of an orderly cycle than we saw in the last time, and that's good for our industry. So as we look at those 2 aspects of our capacity, plenty of square footage, not concerned about that. Some of the resources and capabilities we need to continue to invest in, but we're on it. And then just improving the operations, that's one of the best things we can do to create, in effect, capacity out of the square footage that already exists.","Operator","Our next question on the line comes from Jim Giannakouros from Oppenheimer & Co.","James Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","If I can tack onto that last question, as far as your aftermarket step up to the new run rate that you referenced above $500 million, how does that stand relative to your QRC capacity? Is that driving a need to expand it or capabilities above the aforementioned QRC facility construction that you anticipate as the large OE project wins come down the line?","Mark A. Blinn","The QRCs are one medium, one avenue, one tool we use to deliver our aftermarket capabilities. So -- and we've talked about this before. It's not like a retail model where you have, in a sense, same-store sales, and if you add more facilities that in and of itself will drive your aftermarket. There's got to be a need for that QRC there. Oftentimes, we are delivering aftermarket capabilities on-site in the facility without a need for a specific QRC. But having said that, our -- we have the opportunity to deploy more QRCs around the world. That will continue to support our growth. We just need to make sure there's the market there and the customer is ready for it on the QRC side and, really, that local presence.","James Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Understood. And one follow-up, if I may. Your -- the gross margin progression or the year-over-year improvement that you cited, particularly in the EPD, but across the board, really, can you at least rank order, if not quantify, the drivers that you've called out, such as mix and improving backlog quality and the execution on the plant floor, et cetera?","Mark A. Blinn","Probably on a comparative basis, if you're looking year-over-year, one of the primary drivers was the discipline we put in place 2 years ago. Somewhat of a contributor has been the operational improvement, that we're about halfway through. To a lesser extent, but that will abate as we look at continuous improvement in our facilities and actually as volumes increase, absorption. That hasn't really been as much of a factor. But if you rank order the 3, that's how we'd rank order them. By the way, there's other things like mix and product offering and things like that, that play a factor in it, but at the high level, in terms of what I'd call the operational excellence, things that we're working on here, those 3. That's how I'd rank order them. So the opportunities are improving the business, and then improving absorption in our factories through continues improvement, evaluating the capacity that we need, but also just volumes as well.","Operator","And at this time, I see we have no further questions.","John E.

Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call.","During the quarter, Flowserve delivered solid financial results and continued to make progress on our transformational initiatives. Each of our segments delivered on their plans for the quarter and together we modestly exceeded our overall expectations. We have more work ahead of us, but I am pleased with the results so far and the positive momentum that we have created.","Yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2018 financial guidance, which we continue to view as realistic, given where we are in the transformational journey. As I indicated when we first provided our targets in February, our internal aspirations are higher and that remains true today, but we first need to re-instill a culture of excellence, continuous improvement and focus on consistently meeting our commitments.","We have made significant progress in this endeavor, but there is more work to be done. Nevertheless, each month I gain confidence in our ability to execute and deliver results for our customers and our shareholders. I'll begin with some overall comments before going into the specifics.","First, Flowserve continues to capture opportunities from improvements in our end markets. We are pleased that our overall book-to-bill ratio remained over 1.0 for the quarter and the year, highlighted by strong aftermarket bookings in the quarter. Our sales growth of nearly 11%, combined with 110 basis points of higher adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted earnings per share of $0.41.","Additionally, we are aggressively pursuing our transformational strategy to drive operational excellence, reduce complexity, accelerate growth and streamline Flowserve's operating model. The company also recently agreed to a planned divestiture of certain non-strategic product lines in IPD, which we will close in the third quarter.","Turning now to the specifics. For the first time since the third quarter of 2015, we produced bookings over $1 billion in a quarter. The awarded work is broad-based and represents a 6.8% increase year-over-year. Oil and gas, chemical and general industry markets all contributed growth over 10%, an approximate 2% currency tailwind was partially offset by the 2017 divestiture impact totaling 1%.","In the second quarter, our largest project award was in the European water markets for approximately $25 million, which was recorded in general industries for a flood control project. The majority of our bookings growth is coming from smaller projects in the $3 million to $5 million range, which is more base or foundational business.","With improved project visibility and an active quoting funnel, we are optimistic about the near-term environment and believe we can deliver year-over-year bookings growth for the remainder of 2018.","As you may recall from the first quarter, we highlighted some of our efforts to increase price, not only to cover the cost pressures but also to start recovering from the challenging environment over the last few years. We continue to utilize price as a tool in selective markets and products and will do so in the future in a more analytical fashion, as we remain committed to building and maintaining a quality backlog.","We believe that these price increases have more than offset the effects of inflation and trade tariffs. As such, we see higher margins in our backlog today than at the beginning of the year. However, the global trade environment remains highly unpredictable. We will continue to monitor the market conditions and move forward with our strategy to localize our manufacturing, enhance our supplier network and increase price opportunistically.","While Flowserve's aftermarket franchise proved largely resilient throughout the cycle, we expected to see an uptick in customer spending this year. In the second quarter, we delivered aftermarket bookings of $504 million, the highest level since 2014, and up 10% year-over-year. Our discussions with downstream and petrochemical customers suggest they are focused on maintaining productivity and higher levels of production within their facilities. The increased demand is showing up in our parts, services and small brownfield expansion opportunities. We believe our aftermarket franchise with its global network of quick response centers is a true competitive advantage and differentiator for Flowserve.","Looking now at the second quarter bookings by served end-markets and starting with our largest market, oil and gas. Bookings increased 12% year-over-year, including growth in all segments, supported by an improved and stable commodity price and increased customer spending in the downstream markets. EPD's bookings increased approximately 5%, including a $10 million refining award in North America, while FCD and IPD saw a number of run rate awards across regions.","We continue to expect increased investment by our customers based on a strong pipeline of pre-FEED and FEED activities and projects progressing towards FID before the end of the year. Downstream projects in the Middle East and Asia Pacific appear to be the most active.","In chemical, our bookings increased approximately 13%, again, with all segments delivering growth. EPD led the group with a 23% year-over-year improvement, which included a $13 million award in North America. IPD and FCD contributed single-digit bookings growth. We remain encouraged by the expected growth in chemical investment, both near and longer term, as chemical demand is forecasted to grow globally. Plans for ethylene investment in Asia, the Middle East and North America continue to progress, including a number of projects currently in the backlog of EPC's.","Flowserve's power bookings decreased 7% year-over-year and remains our most challenged market. While IPD delivered strong 43% bookings growth, including two concentrated solar power project awards, where we have a differentiated technical offering, we continue to have muted expectations in the power markets near-term, as nuclear and traditional power generation have remained more challenged globally.","General industry bookings increased 15%, driven, again, by strength in all segments, including 27% and 12% growth in EPD and FCD, respectively, while IPD increased mid-single digits. The efforts in the distribution channel delivered strength from the Americas, European and Middle Eastern regions, while mining and minerals is a relatively small percentage of our business, mining activity contributed across all segments.","Geographically, North America and Europe grew 17% and 26%, respectively, and Latin America provided 56% growth off of very low comparable base. While Latin America remains challenged, we are pleased with consecutive quarterly growth in the region, which is up 29% year-to-date. The Middle East and Africa region and Asia-Pacific were down in the quarter, with each facing relatively strong prior year comparisons, but we remain optimistic in this region as infrastructure growth persists.","Turning now to our second quarter performance by segment. IPD returned to profitability on an adjusted basis, as its turnaround showed modest operational progress in the second quarter. We expect to gain further traction and deliver improving financial results in the second half of the year. In the quarter, IPD delivered revenue growth of 7.2% over prior year, which helped drive sequential and year-over-year improvements in adjusted operating margins.","Operationally, IPD lowered its past due backlog in the quarter, which impacts margins due to low-quality shipments. Reducing past due backlog in the near-term, however, remains a critical component to achieving our mid- to upper single-digit operating margin target in the fourth quarter.","I fully believe the operating performance improvements we are driving provide the necessary accountability and visibility to reach this interim target, but more importantly, to help position IPD to reach its full potential and mid-teens margin business over the longer term.","As I mentioned earlier, we're in the process of divesting two locations and the associated non-core product lines in IPD that have not been profitable for the last couple of years. This divestiture will enable the IPD team to focus on growth and restoring profitability in their core markets and products.","EPD delivered over 12% revenue growth in the quarter compared to the prior year on strong original equipment and aftermarket shipments, driving improvement in adjusted gross and operating margins of 110 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively. Actions continued in the quarter to realign EPD's manufacturing footprint to more effectively leverage and utilize our engineered capabilities and manufacturing network.","FCD also drove margin improvement on solid revenue growth of 11.3%, including a roughly 2% headwind related to last year's divestitures. Adjusted gross and operating margins increased 10 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, year-over-year. FCD expanded margins sequentially through better product mix, strong cost control and improved pricing. Our valves business has consistently delivered solid operating performance and we anticipate that full year 2018 will be no exception.","Returning to Flowserve level, we continue to believe the cycle has reversed course after a multiyear downturn and we are optimistic that our markets will continue to strengthen. From a project perspective, the global pipeline continues to grow, and as visibility increases, we expect to remain disciplined and selective to ensure our backlog quality.","Additionally, we believe the transformational activities we're taking across the enterprise will position Flowserve to better serve our customers, accelerate growth and drive value for our shareholders.","I'll now turn it over to Lee to discuss our financial results in greater detail and then I'll return for a few closing comments before we open the call to Q&A. Lee?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.41, modestly above our expectations coming into the quarter. The change in revenue recognition accounting standards, as we discussed in depth last quarter, added $0.07 versus accounting under the prior method.","As a reminder, the new accounting standard required adoption on January 1 of this year. The impact to Flowserve between the two approaches is primarily an increase in projects now accounted for under a percentage of completion method. We believe the margin difference between the two standards confirms the improved profitability we've received on recent orders versus orders in the backlog at the beginning of the year.","On a reported EPS basis, we earned $0.10 per share, which includes the adjusted items comprised of $0.13 related to the planned divestiture of non-strategic product lines in IPD that Scott discussed, realignment expense of $0.12 and the remainder coming from below the line FX, transformation and ASC 606 implementation.","Second quarter sales increased 10.9% versus prior year to $973 million. We incurred a roughly 1% headwind as a result of businesses divested in 2017, which was more than offset by organic growth as well as currency tailwinds, and a modest benefit from the new accounting standard. Aftermarket sales increased 12.4% year-over-year to $488 million, representing 50% of our total revenue for the quarter. Our original equipment sales increased 9.5% as compared to the 2017 second quarter.","Turning to gross margins, our adjusted gross margin of 31.9% was up 40 basis points versus the prior year second quarter. The margin increase is primarily due to volume leverage, cost actions and the impacts of profits related to the additional revenue recognized as a result of ASC 606. On a reported basis, our gross margin increased 140 basis points to 29.4% on volume leverage, cost savings, ASC 606 and lower adjusting item charges versus prior year.","Adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales declined 90 basis points to 22.7%, including improvement in all segments. The decrease was driven by increased sales leverage and tight cost control more than offsetting increased incentive comp accruals and the impact from the weakened dollar. Adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 9.3% in the second quarter and included a modest 30 basis point improvement in IPD, while EPD and FCD's adjusted operating margins both increased 170 basis points.","Our reported effective tax rate was elevated in the second quarter, primarily related to a product line divesture impairment where no tax benefit was realized on the charge. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%.","Turning to cash, we generated $64 million of operating cash flow in the second quarter, an increase of 50% over the 2017 second quarter. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $46 million, up over 50% from the prior year. We continue to maintain a strong cash balance at over a $0.5 billion as of June 30.","Capital expenditures in the quarter were $80 million, up about $5 million from a year ago, and we also returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends. Working capital was a use of approximately $25 million in the quarter. Clearly, not where it needs to be and remains a primary area of focus. We are making progress in our initiatives directed to all aspects of both the order-to-cash and the sales and operating planning processes. Much work remains, but we do expect to realize benefits in the second half of the year.","Turning to our 2018 outlook, with our first half results roughly in line with our expectations, we remain on pace for a full year and reaffirm our guidance including the adjusted EPS target range of $1.50 to $1.70 per share. We also confirmed our expected revenue growth of 3% to 6%, including a 2% full year currency benefit and roughly a 1% negative headwind from last year's business divestitures.","The adjusted EPS target range excludes the 2018 expected realignment and transformation expense of approximately $90 million as well as below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items, which may occur during the year. Net interest expense is expected in the range of $58 million to $60 million and we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range.","From a cash perspective, we expect to spend approximately $100 million in 2018 to pay dividends to our shareholders. Capital expenditures are expected in the $80 million to $90 million range, as we invest in technology to support Flowserve 2.0, and improve manufacturing productivity. We also expect approximately $60 million in debt repayment for the year and to contribute approximately $30 million to our global pension plans mainly to cover our ongoing service cost as the U.S. plan remains largely fully funded.","Now, let me turn it over back to Scott for his closing remarks.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Great. Thank you, Lee. In our past calls, I've discussed our early efforts to transform our business model to better serve our customers, engage our associates and reward our shareholders, which we've called Flowserve 2.0. This initiative is about taking the best from our past and improving on it for the future. Across the organization, we're changing the way we think, act and operate to better drive growth, improve processes and efficiency and reduce our costs.","As I stated in our first quarter call, the transformation is focused on six key areas: operations, commercial, growth, aftermarket, cost structure and working capital. We have largely finalized our plans and are now executing on these initiatives.","I will highlight that we're proceeding with the sense of urgency. The transformational change, like we're undertaking, is not easy or accomplished quickly. This effort will represent a comprehensive change to our business model intended to deliver long-term benefits to all of our stakeholders. While we've seen a few early wins from our efforts, we expect to see significant benefits building later this year and into 2019 and beyond.","In addition to the work streams that I just mentioned, we're also focused on improving the culture and organizational health of Flowserve. We have made significant leadership changes, including most recently a new Chief Human Resources Officer, a Chief Legal Officer and a new Vice President of Global Operations.","Within Flowserve, we're opening the lines of communication, focusing on employee engagement and have made Flowserve's associates a priority. I am confident that all of these actions will increase our ability to effectively support our customers, create a more meaningful workplace for our employees and drive significant long-term value for our shareholders.","We are planning to host an Analyst Day in December to provide an overview of the company and further articulate the initiatives we are pursuing as part of the Flowserve 2.0 transformational effort. We very much value our shareholders and analysts and look forward to seeing many of you there. We will provide additional details on the event in the coming months.","With that, operator, we've concluded our prepared remarks, and we'd now like to open the call to any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Scott, looking at the market bookings, $504 million, obviously, a good result. The highest aftermarket bookings we've seen this cycle from you guys. But maybe you could talk about the opportunity to improve on that result. I think, last quarter, you mentioned that you thought you weren't hitting on your true potential in the aftermarket business. And if anything this quarter \u2013 we've seen industrial and refining related aftermarket work accelerate. So have you stabilized your market share there when you look at your installed base? And can you materially improve bookings from that $500 million level that's been sort of a key barometer for you guys?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So, Andy, look, we are happy with the bookings that we got this quarter at $504 million and it's nice to get back into kind of a pre-recession type of number there. But I would say, we still have opportunity here. And so this is one of the work streams within the Flowserve 2.0 transformational office and it's about how do we capture the opportunity on the installed base.","All right. So we ate more than anybody else, have more pumps and more valves out in the field. And we've got to make sure we do a much better job of capturing the entitlement that we have from that installed base.","So I'd say our work here is not done. We're pleased with what happened in the second quarter. But I think as we start to really attack the transformation and looking at proceduralizing and formalizing the way that we really go after growth in the aftermarket, we haven't really reached our potential at this point.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And if you \u2013 focusing on rebooking (00:22:35) for a second, I mean if you look at the E&Cs, as I'm sure you do, they're talking about potentially doubling \u2013 some of them are talking about potentially doubling their energy and chemical backlogs in the current upcycle. You guys are very levered to refining, petchem and LNG. So you mentioned the FEED activity out there. How does it look in terms of \u2013 you're still kind of way below your peak, it looks to me like 70% below the peak in any given quarter. So how does it look to sort of get back to that level over time? Could this cycle rival other cycles that we've seen out there and how do we get there?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'd just say Andy, we're really focused on next quarter and the year. And I don't want to pontificate on multi-years out because we're really on a \u2013 kind of restoring confidence within Flowserve and doing the right things.","With that said, when we look at our bookings funnel and the opportunities that we have in front of us, we feel really good about it. And we've got more in the funnel today than we've had historically. When you look at our Q2 numbers, I highlighted some of the big awards we had, our water job for flood control, we did have a nice petrochemical award, but we didn't have any major projects in there.","And so, I think what you saw in Q2 is that we delivered a pretty nice number, over $1 billion, on base or foundational awards and now we're seeing our project funnel continue to increase. And so, ideally, what'll happen in the coming quarters is that we keep that foundational level, if not grow it, and then we start to add the projects on top of that.","Now, what I would say in the early projects that have gotten released is the projects \u2013 the bigger the projects are, they're still highly competitive and the pricing isn't necessarily where we would like it to be. And so, we feel pretty good about where our plants are in terms of capacity and we're going to be incredibly selective on what we take. We're going to make sure that the margins that we secure in that work are something that we can deliver nice returns to our shareholders.","But, overall, I feel really good. I think we're seeing nice growth in all of the markets, except for power. Our project pipeline is better and the activity is really good right now.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a very quick follow-up for Lee. If you look at currency, if you mark to market on the euro, I mean we noticed that you kept it sort of where it was. Does it impact that 2% significantly at all as we look at the guidance for this year?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Can you state that again? I'm not sure I caught the question?","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, you're based on $1.22 euro, Lee.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Obviously, it's at $1.16 nowadays. So how do we think about that in the context of that 2% that you have in the guidance?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So, I mean, the last three months, there was a pretty big movement. At the end of March, it was in the $1.20s. Obviously, the U.S. dollar strengthened in the last three months. So, we can't necessarily predict where it's going. We just thought to be consistent at $1.22 and our guidance is based on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO. Please go ahead.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. Nice quarter, guys.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Thanks, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. I wanted to ask about sales. And maybe the first question there is \u2013 if you guys don't mind, is telling us what the impact was of the accounting change on revenues in each segment?","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","We will do it in total, Scott, as opposed to by segment, but it was not really material this quarter.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. It's in our disclosure. It's roughly $10 million.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, if \u2013 since it's not significant, I'm sorry for missing that disclosure, but if it's not significant this quarter, that implies that the second half will be harder hit, which is that the reason why you're kind of kept your sales guidance as is or is it other reasons?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","No, I think our sales guidance is balanced of what we see and what we can convert. So, listen, we're kind of moving on. ASC 606 is the accounting standard and our guidance is based on that.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Scott, let me just talk specifically on the guidance. We think the guidance is realistic. And I've been here now for five quarters. And I think this is the first quarter that I haven't been surprised across any of the platforms and we delivered relatively what we expected to deliver.","And so, I just think at this point, we're not ready to step-up or make a change. We really are trying to instill a culture of accountability and ownership within Flowserve and we've got to do a better job of delivering to our original commitments.","And so I think the guidance, when we relooked everything and kind of where we're at, it was really about saying, hey, let's make our commitments, let's get a little bit closer through the year. And when we look at the back half of the year, it's a pretty significant step-up on the operational income side to make our midpoint of the guidance anyway.","And so I'd just say right now, we're locked in on that. We want to execute to it. We've got our team driving to the best we can. But ultimately, like I said in my prepared remarks, our internal goals are significantly higher and we're going to keep pushing and we're going to drive closer to a better place as we move forward.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you. That makes sense. So, my follow-up is simply based on how you're approaching your bookings. I know that you're saying that you're being more selective. I guess I'm wondering that, with the cost structure that was kind of laid at your feet, how much is that impacting your bidding. In other words, when you say selective, is that selective in the market or is that Flowserve selective because your costs are too high and you actually can't bid on some of this stuff?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, when I say selective, I'm really referring to more of our engineered business and engineered work in the pump side. And so that's very much a cost based model where we're building costs specifically to the project that comes there. And I'm not going to say that we don't have opportunity to reduce cost there because I absolutely think that we do and it actually is two of the work streams within the transformation. It's within our supply chain work stream and it's also in our design-to-value or just our product strategy approach on getting more configured-to-order and making manufacturing a lot simpler.","But I also think there's an element here of just the pricing side. And we were not as disciplined or as rigorous about really looking at pricing and understanding and really understanding the impact of what that volume at a facility would mean within our overall financials. And so, we made some adjustments to that at the end of last year. We've re-tweaked that after the first quarter. And I feel very confident about where our pricing is right now to continue to deliver margin expansion from where we are today.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys. Good quarter.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","Hey, just a question, can you just walk us with some very specific examples, because it seems you were lagging the industry for the past couple of quarters and now you're performing in line or better than other players in your space? What levers have you been able to pull in the past couple of quarters to sort of get back on track? Can you describe that in more detail?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, sure. I've been here five quarters and so that's as far back as I can go. What I would say is we've got the team highly focused now. And we had to make some changes in certain parts of the organization and so we've got some new players in place, and we're very focused. And like I said about the guidance, right, the first part is understanding what we're signing up for, both internally and externally, and then making sure that we have the plans and the process to deliver those results.","And so while it wasn't perfect in the quarter by any means, it was solid, and we had most of our businesses delivering on the top line and the bottom line where they need to be. We've got a lot more attention, rigor, visibility to what's important and we've got our teams aligned in terms of how do we make that happen. And I think that's probably the simplest way to say it is that we've got a much more disciplined and focused organization today than what it was when I started.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","So that should be structurally sustainable then?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","I sure hope so.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","And then, the other question, just thinking about visibility into 2019. One of the big debates a lot of oil companies are out there saying, they're focused on returning cash to shareholders, paying dividends, buybacks, exercising a lot of capital discipline. Without naming any names, are you seeing any of these guys starting to sort of actually talk about maybe, in fact, spending that cash into 2019, because I think one of the other companies in the industry did highlight that part of their funnel is, in fact, having discussions with large IOCs and that perhaps they are starting to sort of look at raising CapEx materially into 2019?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. And again, we haven't even started our planning process for 2019, and we're very focused on Q3 and delivering the year at this point. But what I'd say is, as we look at \u2013 again, we look at what's in our funnel and the activities that we're seeing, it's still very good. And really, when we look at the billion dollars that we delivered this quarter, there were very few projects that made up that work.","And so, I think I see a improving project environment as we go forward. Again, we have to be very selective on what we're willing to take and at what margins. But there's a scenario there, where we should continue to build on this base and start to add projects on top of it.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","But are you seeing any interest \u2013 and as I said this is not sort of about near-term bookings, but are you having any conversations with IOCs about sort of making capacity available for them in sort of second half of 2018, 2019 and beyond?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","No nothing specific about making capacity, but we are talking \u2013 we talk to our customers on a regular basis and some of them do share their future plans with us and what they are working on, and we feel good about that level of activity.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Charley.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, So, I just want to make sure I heard you clearly on IPD, as far as margin kind of rest of the year, would you \u2013 you're expecting improvement from where we are in Q2, implying that the losses there are essentially done and we're moving \u2013 staying at a profitable standpoint from that business?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, I would be really disappointed if we went negative again on the IPD business. And so, it's the first time we've gotten back to profitability now in several years and our plan is to continue to grow from here. And so we've got good line of sight of that. We've got \u2013 David and the team are executing and doing the things that we need to. We're clearing out past due backlog, and we're clearing out some real low-margin work that was in that backlog.","And so, we do have line of sight to profitability increasing in Q3. And ultimately, in Q4, we're still at the target of mid- to high single-digit margins for that business.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right. Thanks. And on seasonality, just broadly speaking, I guess, for IPD, but really across the board, any changes to seasonality this year in terms of the timing of when shipments are going to go out, or is it kind of normal seasonality you expect this year?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I would say normal seasonality. I wouldn't expect anything different, but we're also on a self-help improvement track. And so you should see the self-help continue regardless of seasonality.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Just one more for me, bunker fuel regulations for 2020 are getting a little more discussion. I'm wondering, as it pertains to Flowserve, what you maybe see as your opportunity there. Are you having discussions with customers today about what they're planning to do and change some of the operations and put new equipment in place to meet that regulation?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","I think it's something that our sales team are aware of. I personally am not as dialed into that as maybe as I should be. So, I'm going to pass on answering anything specific about bunker fuel at this point.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Scott, you just mentioned you've been clearing out all of that \u2013 the past due backlog. Can you calibrate that for us? That was a focus last quarter. Is that \u2013 where does that stand today?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. We're still not where we need to be, Deane. But what I would say is we did make nice progress in the quarter. It was about a 10% reduction across the board. And I'd say that the highlights were IPD and FCD doing what they needed to do in getting that down. We've still got a large project that's in our past due backlog with the EPD franchise. We expect that to clear in the third quarter.","And what I'd say is, I fully expect to take another chunk out of this in Q3 and hope to not be talking about past due backlog at the end of this year. And so, we are very focused on this. Obviously, it's harming our customers. But I'd say the other impact is that the longer product stays in our facilities, the more cost it gets incurred. So, it is weighing down on our margins as well.","And so, this is something we talked about as a management team almost every week and we've got a lot of attention on it. We know exactly what needs to be done. I do expect to get this cleared in the back half of this year.","Now, the other thing that I said, yeah, I talked about this a little bit in Q1, I'll just reiterate it is that what it highlighted to me is that our planning competency at Flowserve is not where it needs to be from a \u2013 for as big and as complex of an environment that we work in. And so, we've invested heavily on manufacturing and operational planning. And in February, we created the manufacturing and operational organization. We created a more centralized planning function and we're adding resources to this now.","And so that's going to take a little bit of time to get kind of best-in-class on how we think about production planning, materials management, but it is a major effort in the transformational activity and it's an area that we can significantly improve throughout multiple quarters.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then on IPD and the pruning of the non-core product lines, is there more to do there? And the process, were you looking at these just in terms of pure profit margin or was also the idea of producing complexity because that was also \u2013 that's one of your top goals that you've talked about?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So the two that we divested here were \u2013 it was kind of twofold. One is, they were non-core and they were never going to be part of our long-term growth strategy. And I think that was probably the single most important factor as we looked at it. And then the second thing is, it was a product line that we just thought was \u2013 for us to try to get it back into a place that made sense and get it to a market share position and a margin that was acceptable to Flowserve was going to require a lot of effort.","And so, when we think about prioritization of our resources, we chose to put them back into the core product lines within IPD and we chose to make a decision to put this into buyer's hands that we think could actually do a better job than we did. And so, we've been working on this divestiture for some time.","And unfortunately, when you're not making money, it's hard to sell businesses. And so, it's been a little bit of a complex process for us, but we're happy to get this signed. And we will close this in the third quarter and it will really help David and the IPD team focus on what's important and start to grow our business and grow the product lines that are core part of IPD.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just last question for Lee, when Scott rattled off the six focus areas for Flowserve 2.0, the sixth one was working capital. Do you have any specific goals today that you can share, a timeframe to hitting those? Is it for as a percent of sales and any calibration would be helpful?","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Sure. So, listen, where we are today is far from world-class. Our DSO is currently at 75 days. Our inventory turn is at 4 times. That does not include the impact of contracted assets. So, our aspiration is to get to what I would consider as \u2013 I would not say world-class, but we're like regional class.","And so, there's a significant amount of resources attacking our receivables, looking at the whole process, that whole order-to-cash process. And as Scott said in his remarks around S&OP, we're completely looking at our planning \u2013 our orders planning process to drive that. So, it is something that we look at a regular basis. There is significant amount of intensity and our aspirations are to get where it should be. Every investor is looking at us is what are we doing on working capital and we hear it. So, we are putting plans in place. And I expect around the December timeframe, we'll communicate those plans.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, as orders pick up and mostly maybe OE order start to pick up and start to become a higher percentage of the mix there, how do we think about margin \u2013 potential headwinds to margin as you go forward there? And how should we think about potential for costs needing to return to the business that you've been kind of lean on this year, into next year?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So, I think it's a really good question. I would say under a normal circumstance, those would be headwinds for us. But I'd just say, we had a lot of opportunities on our cost structure, both in the product cost and on the overhead and organizational costs.","And so, again, with the Flowserve 2.0 transformation, I think we continued to make progress in both margin categories. And I get we've got a lot of room to work with. And so, we're not going to let mix or OE versus aftermarket dampen anything at this point. We're going to continue to progress margin expansion.","And then, the other thing is that our facilities today are not as full as they need to be. And so with the additional work, we start to absorb a lot more. And that's going to take out a pretty significant headwind of cost that's still in the business today.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, fair enough. And then, when you're looking at bidding for newer projects and I think, obviously, before you're there, you got into some trouble with kind of not just the discipline on the total price, but maybe not evaluating all aspects of the project. Like, how are you factoring in the complexity of what you're being asked to do or the risk of who the counterparty is, given all the write-downs in like Latin America? Do you feel like now you're getting \u2013 if you're going to take on something like that, it's factored into the model and you're going to be compensated well in excess or at least adequately for that kind of stuff?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. No, this is really relating to the Engineered Products Division. And again, we put in a lot of scrutiny on what comes into the pipeline and what we're willing to take. And so I'd say, Flowserve has learned a lot over the last five or six years on how should we contract big project, how do we mitigate risk and how do we execute. And so, I don't anticipate to go backwards in that regard, but we have not \u2013 we have only improved our scrutiny of not only on pricing and margins but how do we execute the project and the terms and conditions that we're willing to accept.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then last for me, have \u2013 you mentioned when we all got together months ago about like the under penetration of automation within your footprint. Has that process kind of started? Have you started to invest there and deploy some of that technology or is that more of a 2019 and further (00:43:08)","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. You're referring to manufacturing specifically, right?","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Correct, yes.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. So we are lacking in manufacturing automation at Flowserve. And so, one of the things, and Lee mentioned it in his prepared remarks, right, our capital this year is largely targeted around IT systems improvements to support the transformation and manufacturing productivity or basically automation within the manufacturing.","And so we really have not begun that journey. We've just secured a new Vice President of Global Operations last month. And so we've got him traveling around the world now and visiting facilities, but we're going to give him a lot of freedom in terms of putting more technology into our facilities and making sure that we can be as productive as possible.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hi, Steve.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Can you guys just remind us what your opportunity set is on LNG plants? How big could your scope be on these projects?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I don't want to quantify the scope on LNG, but what I can say is that it's one of the few areas that we're doing a pretty good job of making sure that the pump offering and the valve offering can come together and we can be more of a combined proposal into that market. And so if we do things right, it's probably the best opportunity for us as a Flowserve company when we think about Flow Control.","So we're excited about the outlook of LNG. We're in active discussions with a lot of different customers at this point. And again, it's an area where we think we can bring valves and pumps into the foray and I think we can do pretty well there.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And on the guidance, I completely understand that you want to be accountable for delivering what you promised, but I'm wondering is there anything specific that you have concerns about or things that could still move around, be it input costs or timing of any certain projects or anything like that?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, let me \u2013 I'll start with that and I'll turn it over to Lee. But, again, yeah, I've been here five quarters and we've had one that's been somewhat respectable and without major surprises. And so for me, it's really around getting the operational discipline to deliver our results and not have major surprises. And so, the back half of year is still a challenge. And I don't think we're \u2013 we're not running this business as well as we can and we still need to improve.","And so, we're on a continuum journey and I don't think there's going to be major surprises to the downside. But at this point, again, we don't have the competency and the process control or adherence that we would want as we think about where we should be from an operational and manufacturing company.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Just as a reminder, the midpoint of our guidance is an 18% improvement year-over-year on EPS. We still have a long way to go. As we sit here today, we're at $0.68 adjusted. We need to improve our back half of the year by 40% to hit that guidance. So, I think our range is realistic, but as Scott has mentioned, our aspirations are greater.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Ashay on for Joe.","John E. Roueche, III - Flowserve Corp.","Hey, Ashay.","Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.","I guess just touching on orders for the second. Could you talk about your confidence in sustaining this $1 billion run rate going forward now that aftermarket is hitting $500 million and the project funnel is growing?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. I mean, we, obviously, don't want to go backwards. And so, for us, the funnel looks good. The activity is in a better place than we've seen and we feel pretty good about the outlook in the back half of the year. The concern is project timing and awards. And so that's what we're watching and we're trying to pull those forward and lock them into Q3 and Q4. But our intention is to capitalize on the momentum that we've started in the second quarter.","Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.","Got it. And just touching on cash flow for a second, nice to see this focus on working capital, but could you touch on CapEx requirements in the next year again, as you start taking more orders? Like, is $80 million to $90 million sort of going to be the run rate or do you have to take it up further? Thanks.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, I'll start with that and I'll turn it over to Lee. But I think $80 million to $90 million is a pretty good number. I don't see a material need to drive that up significantly higher. On the other hand, the one thing that is definitely going to cost us money as we move forward is, and we said this, part of our enablers in the transformation is our IT infrastructure and network. And right now, we're running on a lot of different ERP systems. And so the cost to get off some of those and get to a more consolidated basis is going to cost money.","And so, the big question is, can we do it within the range of kind of an $80 million to $100 million or do we have to move that up a little bit. But at this point, I don't see any need for a major roof line expansion exercise. We've got facilities in the right locations. We do need to invest in manufacturing technology. And so, I think as we go forward, it's a combination of IT and manufacturing technology, and I think we should be somewhere in that range.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. I'll just support that comment that what we're spending a lot of time is trying to spend the money smarter and more wisely. Historically, I would say there was somewhat of a peanut butter approach to where capital was allocated. We're developing a much more enterprise view and the most urgent projects are getting the capital where it's more consistent with our overall enterprise strategy.","So as Scott mentioned, the one outlier is potentially on the IT side, but we feel that we can still address the needs of the business and better put that capital to use with better processes.","Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.","Got it.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. And just to build on it, we brought our top leaders in, about 100 people, here two weeks ago. And one of the big things that we're trying to do is improve the financial acumen across our enterprise. And so, Lee spent a whole session on return on invested capital and what it means and how driving working capital down and how spending our money wisely can help return for this business and for our shareholders.","And so, we are getting much smarter and more strategic about how we do that and where do we deploy capital and what the best use of cash is. And so, I think as we go forward, you'll see a pretty marked improvement there and a lot more focus on what we do with that resource.","Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Farley from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Adam Michael Farley - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Good morning.","Adam Michael Farley - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","First question is around geographic strength. You called out the Americas, Latin America, another area. Can you just talk about \u2013 sort of give a little more color about what areas of strength you're seeing? And then also, for the rest of the year, what geographic regions do you think will be strong?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. We're doing well across all markets, but let me just kind of run through them. In North America, really, the growth there has been on the upstream side where Flowserve does not have the offering that we would like. And so, one of our strategies is start to migrate some of the products, both in pumps and valves, into a more of the upstream and midstream space.","And so, I'd say we're a little bit underrepresented there, but we have the ability to start to grow and move more products into that with the existing technology, but I don't see any change in North America. In fact, on the downstream side in North America, I see opportunities. And so that should be an area that improves and we get better. And then, additionally, in the petrochemical side in North America, we feel pretty optimistic about that as well.","The areas of growth for us would be the Middle East and Asia Pacific, and both on the downstream oil and gas side and the petrochemical. And that's where we're starting to see a lot of projects lined up nicely for us and we anticipate winning awards there in the back half of the year and into 2019 as that that pre-FEED and FEED pipeline continues to grow.","So, we feel very good about that infrastructure investment and things going there. Europe, it's not bad for us and we had a solid quarter, but I don't see tremendous growth there. And then, Latin America, I don't think we're ready for \u2013 Latin America, while it's going to improve, it's off a really, really small base. And so, we don't expect anything outsized in Latin America in the next 12 months.","Adam Michael Farley - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's really helpful. And then just shifting gears, you guys have been very clear on the need for operational excellence and you're doing a lot of work there. You're doing some divestitures of non-core product lines. I was wondering about M&A, just maybe talk about the pipeline there. Is there any like potential tuck-in acquisitions that you're looking at?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. Yeah. I mean both the pump and the valves space is highly fragmented, right. And so by definition, there are a lot of opportunities. And I'd say, even in the last six months, we've seen a lot of things come on to the market and a lot of things that are speculated to be on the market. And so it's a pretty dynamic landscape right now.","And I'd say, ideally, at Flowserve, we really want to be in a position that we can start to consolidate and be acquisitive, but be acquisitive on things that make sense, right. So, things that come in and fit our technology portfolio and align nicely with our long-term strategy and have the ability to leverage the aftermarket and QRC network that we have.","So, as I get more confident in our ability to execute, then I think you can see us be less defensive and move more offensive on the OpEx. But I'd say at this point, we're not there. We've got to start to improve with the working capital and the balance sheet items, and we've got to continue to get consistent with our operating results. But at some time, and hopefully, it's more in the near future, we can start to talk more positively about being acquisitive on the growth front.","Adam Michael Farley - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning and congratulations, Scott and Lee.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Walter.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","So I wanted to go back to the divestiture, and it sounds like they're small, but I wonder if you can talk to us about the cash inflow we might see in the third quarter. And then, is there going to be like a restated ops because of this or discontinued op?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, I'll take the over and then I'll let Lee answer the specifics there. But, I mean, look, this is a underperforming business that hasn't made money in several years. And so you're not going to see anything come in on our side. Lee, do you want to talk about the (00:54:10)","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. It's a pretty \u2013 like I said, as we disclosed that it's a very small business, and like some of our prior smaller disposition, we've not restated our financials and treat it as a discontinued business. So it'll be a variance for next year as far as the revenue side. It'll actually be accretive on the profit side.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, so the results of this business are in our Q2 numbers. They'll be in our Q3 numbers until we close the business.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay, great. So it's already in the guidance.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","Yes.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And if you split those businesses out, if you exclude them from IPD's operating margins this quarter, where would margins have been?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah, we don't really want to get into the specifics, but what I'd say, again, it was a loss-making business and it lost money year-to-date, but it was a marginal loss. And so it's...","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","It's $10 million per quarter. So the revenue is $10 million a quarter.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","There you go.","Lee Eckert - Flowserve Corp.","And so it's \u2013 this is not earth shattering. This is just \u2013 it's opportunistic to get out of a product line that doesn't make sense and focus on what's important.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. And the last \u2013 the other one is just to follow-on on the downstream comment that you just made about the funnel for the back half looking good. How are you addressing pricing? Within the funnel, are you able to get pricing? Are the margins expected to be good on the new business?","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Sure. And so, as we keep talking about, we are highly focused on margin expansion and getting the right work in the backlog that we know we can make money on. And just as a reminder, from what we talked about in Q1. And so, we've actually done two price increases at the beginning of the year. The first one was just kind of we hadn't done in a long time, we started to feel a little bit better at the market and so we did a relatively kind of across the board price increase. And then, on the back of the steel import tariffs at the end of Q1, we did our second price increase. And so that would be more on our configured-to-order and our base product. And so I feel very good and comfortable that we are in the right side of the price cost equation, and we're going to start to see that show up in the margins.","And then, on the EPD or the engineered-to-order side, we've been very ambitious about what we can get in that space. And what I would say is in Q2 or in the end of the year, Q4, and even into Q1, we had raised our prices pretty significantly. And as a result, had missed some orders that we were really \u2013 we would have liked to receive. And so, we've adjusted that moderately. But what I would say in that business is that, even with where we are today, we feel very good about the work that we're winning. And we think that \u2013 well, we know that the margins will be accretive to where we've been over the last couple of quarters at referred Flowserve.","So, I feel very good about our pricing and where we are with the inflation and the tariffs. And then, the other thing I'd add is just we still have a lot of room for improvement here. And so a lot of this has just been more looking at being reactive to what's happening in the marketplace. And so, now as part of the Flowserve 2.0 transformation, we're putting analytical tools and really taking a much more methodical approach to pricing and using data to help us and make much better decisions. And so, we're actively in the middle of that and it's a major initiative for us. And I think we're going to see nice results and certainly, with some market tailwinds here, that's going to help us capitalize on that as we go forward.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Sounds great. Thanks for that answer.","Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.","Yeah. Okay, great. Hey I do want to go one \u2013 the question back that Charley asked about bunker fuel and what we're doing about the regulatory changes there. So, I've received a note now and I have got a much better answer, but that does impact our bookings. And really, over \u2013 it'll impact bookings over the next couple of quarters and it's something that our team is highly aware of, and we've got a very nice product offering that supports that change. And so, we feel good about the ability to capitalize on that. And I think we'll see that in the back half of 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche. Mr. Roueche, you may begin.","John E. Roueche","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in today's call to discuss the financial results of Flowserve Corporation for the second quarter of 2013, which we announced yesterday through our press release and Form 10-Q filing.","Joining me on the call this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Taff, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Mullin, our Director of Investor Relations.","Following our prepared comments, we will open the call to your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. Before turning the call over to Mark, I would like to remind you that this event is being webcast and an earnings slide presentation is available, both of which are accessible through our website at www.flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.","An audio replay will also be available on our website approximately 2 hours following the conclusion of the live call. Both the audio replay and the slide presentation will remain on our website for a period of time over the next few weeks.","Finally, please note that today's call and the associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements that are based upon forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of July 25, 2013.

These documents are accessible on Flowserve's website under the Investor Relations section. Please note, except to the extent required by applicable law, Flowserve undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of today's forward-looking statements.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Mark A. Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with the operating and financial results for the second quarter, as our dedicated employees continue to deliver on targeted improvements across our operations.","Each segment contributed to solid earnings growth, demonstrating the leverage of our diverse and stable business profile, and the propensity for ongoing operational improvement is significant.","Our continued focus on delivering on our customer commitment, operational excellence, thoughtful cost control and capital structure efficiency are returning value to our shareholders, drove EPS growth of 27% year-over-year. We believe this formula of improving operations and reduced share count will produce our solid earnings growth for 2013 and provide leverage over the coming years as we prepare for more meaningful expected growth.","As we progress through 2013, we are capturing internal opportunities by improving the operations, positioning the company to more efficiently integrate and leverage future inorganic bolt-on acquisitions, optimizing our capital structure efficiency through returns to shareholders, and preparing the business to maximize earnings potential of large project work, which is expected to reach award stage later this year.","While this summer appears to be more stable than the last several years, economies around the world are recovering at different rates. Europe seems to have stabilized, albeit at low levels. We believe North America has good opportunity ahead on the strength of gas and chemical projects. While macro growth in Asia Pacific is mixed, our objective is to further increase Flowserve's presence in the region. Latin America should see increased customer spending over the next few years. And Russia and the Middle East will require increased investment to expand and update capacity.","As we have previously mentioned, large orders shifted to the right and none were booked again this quarter. This is nothing new, but we remain optimistic in our core energy markets and the significant build-out expected in North America and the emerging regions.","Given the current market environment, we are pleased with second quarter bookings of over $1.2 billion. This amount represents a 1.3% increase year-over-year and a 3.3% increase sequentially, reflecting the continued strength of our run rate original equipment and aftermarket business.","Over the last few years, we've grown this type of work into a strong, recurring franchise. In the aftermarket business alone, execution of our global end user strategies drove solid bookings this quarter of over $500 million, which is encouraging, considering the seasonality of our business and some ongoing deferrals of scheduled maintenance in certain regions due to strong refining margins.","Looking at margins. Our focus over the last year on driving improvements within the 4 walls of Flowserve drove a solid increase in gross margins. In particular, IPD and FCD realized significant improvement in gross and operating margins. Additionally, EPD gross margins were able to overcome an unfavorable mix shift through higher sales and operational initiatives to show an increase as well.","Our One Flowserve initiatives and other investments and operational excellence, including quality, project management and other company-wide programs focusing on the customer, are positioning the business to drive profitable growth.","In addition, solidifying an expense management culture remains a top priority, which will effectively support our operations as we generate strong leverage on these costs.","Looking briefly at segment performance. EPD's continued focus on operational excellence improvements and disciplined project pursuit has grown the top line and is steadily improving the quality of the backlog in this traditionally late cycle business.","IPD's operational improvements delivered impressive margins of 12.8%, demonstrating substantial progress towards achieving this segment's target range for operating margins of 14% to 15% by 2015.","FCD's strong and consistent operating performance was driven by operational excellence and increased leverage on investments to support the oil and gas markets.","Looking forward to the second half of 2013, we expect to build on the momentum of the first half. And with another quarter of solid operating improvements behind us, I remain confident we are focusing on the right areas and taking the right strategic actions needed to deliver on our commitments to our customers, while profitably growing the business and delivering value to our shareholders.","Let me now turn the call over to Tom for his operational review.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark discussed, we'll continue to focus on the customer and internally, on our operations and costs, as we build on the momentum gained last year. I'm proud of the substantial progress we have made towards our operational improvement targets and the return earned on our investments to strengthen our leadership and optimize our operating platforms. Impressive margin improvement, particularly in FCD and IPD, validates our customer focus strategy as well as our efforts to improve our on-time delivery, reduce cost of quality, and our ongoing investment in and development of our employees.","Our One Flowserve initiatives are also generating solid returns, as we leverage global competencies across our operating platforms in the areas such as project management, low-cost sourcing and research and development.","We continue to be excited about the propensity to improve our core business fundamentals, which include leveraging our global sales force as we focus on the customer and overall growth. The success of these efforts is evidenced, in part, by our strong margin improvement.","On a consolidated basis, gross margin increased 150 basis points year-over-year. At the segment level, FCD delivered impressive leverage by continuing to operate on a high level by focusing on quality, cost reduction and low-cost sourcing. In addition, FCD also benefited this quarter from a mix shift towards aftermarket sales. IPD's margins expanded again this quarter as well, with operational excellence initiatives beginning to take hold as we progress towards our targeted operating margin target of 14% to 15% by 2015.","Looking at our new work. Bookings this quarter were up nearly 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by run rate original equipment orders and aftermarket. This result demonstrates the value of our diverse exposures, and strong bookings in FCD more than offset decreased IPD bookings and relatively flat EPD bookings.","While our core reoccurring aftermarket and run rate activity essentially comprised all of our bookings, we do remain confident that a number of large projects are in the pipeline, and that they will begin to be released in the second half of the year.","Our approach to bidding will remain disciplined. While the first projects released during a market upturn typically tend to be very price competitive, I want to emphasize that we will continue to be selective.","The story in our markets and regions is very similar to the last few quarters. Our core run rate, OE and aftermarket activity has been stable as we prepare for the release of these larger-sized OE projects. Considering the value we bring to our customers on the front end of major projects, our visibility into their progress continues to give us confidence that these projects are nearing the bidding stage and on the path towards ultimate release.","The chemical market, in particular, is exhibiting strengthening conditions. Increased competitiveness of the U.S. upstream and downstream chemicals are changing the dynamics of global competition. Nearly 100 shale gas-related investments have been announced in North America with a value of over $70 billion, the majority of which are for ethylene and ethylene derivatives.","The Middle East is also maintaining their drive towards downstream diversification, and the chemical strength in India and China continues within these countries as they drive towards energy and manufacturing security.","Moving to the oil and gas market. Oil prices remain at levels necessary to encourage major investment and a positive long-term outlook for this commodity contingents. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, China and Russia are planning low sulfur fuel refinery projects, while North America is maintaining strong growth in pipeline construction, refinery upgrades and gas processing and gas-to-liquid plants to capitalize on the advantaged natural gas and oil supplies.","Additionally, we are seeing a shift in the coming opportunities in North America, as Western contractors prepare to execute oil and gas projects that will remain here, particularly along the U.S. Gulf coast. Floating production and storage operations, FPSOs, opportunities also remain steady in Brazil, Africa and Asia Pacific.","Additionally, proposed growth in LNG production and export terminals in North America and import terminals in Asia Pacific seemingly offset the slowdown in Australia, impacted by a slower China, national elections and a high cost of local project execution. Finally, Saudi Arabia, China, India and Brazil continue to drive major refinery projects.","We see the power market as growing. China and India continue with their coal-based initiatives, while the Middle East is signaling strong future growth in both conventional and solar power. North America and Europe remains slow, due to conservation and low growth in energy demand. Nuclear power is still in transition, although even Japan is considering restarting a number of plants. And globally, we see an increased focus on natural gas fuel combined cycle plants.","The available power industry projects, however, continue to be driven by fixed price turnkey terms, where pricing is the major consideration. Our efforts to build capability in our Coimbatore, India facility will help provide support to this market. And while aftermarket opportunities are also available on power, they are not as uniform globally, due to the shift occurring from coal to natural gas generation. In general industries, we are experiencing strong growth in global fertilizer opportunities.","Mining companies are investing more carefully of late, but we see good levels continuing in parts of Southern Africa, Latin America and North America. We are also seeing encouraging signs in the desalinization market, as industry experts expect new plant orders to rise over the next couple of years.","Finally, our distribution business was solid, driven largely by order supporting oil and gas projects globally. As we move into the second half of the year, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made over the last 1.5 year and the propensity in the organization to continue this momentum as we look to capitalize on additional opportunities.","With that overview, let me now turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Following Mark and Tom's operational overview and business outlook for the remainder of the year, let me discuss in greater detail our financial results.","We continue to gain momentum in the second quarter, with strong leverage of solid revenue growth of 4.8%. Our year-to-date revenue growth of 4.2% on a constant currency basis is consistent with the low end of our 2013 revenue growth target of 4% to 6%. The consolidated OE aftermarket sales mix was consistent with last year.","I was particularly pleased that gross margin improved 150 basis points to 34%, driven by impressive margin expansion in FCD and IPD of 280 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively, reflecting progress on our operational improvement initiatives.","EPD's 20 basis point improvement was also a solid performance, considering the headwinds from SG&A and business mix as compared to the 2012 quarter. This overall gross margin improvement demonstrates the impact of our discipline and selectivity in our bidding process, which we will maintain during the expected ramp in large project releases.","Turning to SG&A. We saw an increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales of 50 basis points, driven by a few discrete charges this year, totaling $4.1 million and a $3.9 million legal benefit last year that did not recur. Adjusting for these items, we saw a 20 basis point decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales, driven mainly by thoughtful cost control and solid leverage.","We will continue to focus on our longer-term goal of driving additional leverage from these costs, as we target SG&A as a percentage of sales to be consistently in the 18% range. I'm confident that the initiatives we are executing currently have us on pace to deliver on this commitment.","The strong leverage in our business was demonstrated with an 11.3% increase in operating income coming off the 4.8% revenue growth.","Shifting to operating margin. An impressive improvement of 90 basis points to 14.8% was driven by 270 and 250 basis point increases in FCD and IPD, respectively. We continue to believe that we are on target to achieve our consolidated operating margin objective of 100 to 200 basis point improvement by 2014, as well as IPD's targeted margins of 14% to 15% by 2015.","It should be noted, however, that margins quarter-to-quarter can be volatile and difficult to forecast. On last quarter's call, we indicated that we expected this quarter to face margin pressure from an unfavorable mix, which did not occur. But now, we expect that impact to affect Q3.","Below operating income, a relatively calm foreign exchange environment resulted in minimal impact from the sequential mark-to-market of our currency hedges and balance sheet items in nonfunctional currencies. As many of you know, this is a pleasant change from recent quarter's earnings volatility as a result of this line and continues to be an area of focus as we work to dampen the impact of foreign currency volatility on our results.","In the meantime, we will continue to monitor FX closely. However, a strengthening dollar typically is a headwind for us. Our tax rate for the quarter was 29.4%, and we expect to be in the 30% range for the remaining quarters of 2013.","Turning to cash flows. We generated $75 million from our operations during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million. And we repurchased $150 million of our shares, effectively completing our $1 billion share repurchase program announced last year. We have $536 million remaining on our current buyback program, and we'll continue to execute on our strategy to efficiently deploy the balance sheet and return value to our shareholders.","As in prior years, we expect to generate a significant portion of our operating cash flows in the second half of the year. Additionally, we continue to focus on our working capital as we methodically implement initiatives to address identified opportunities for improvement and work towards our goal of consistently generating annual free cash flow near our net income level.","Turning to primary working capital. We saw some improvement in the quarter compared to the 2012 second quarter, with a reduction in DSO by 3 days to 78 days. Inventory turns were essentially flat with the 2012 second quarter. Again, seasonally, these only modest improvements are not surprising. And we are still very much focused on our working capital goals of mid-60s DSOs and inventory turns of 4x to 4.5x. We believe these targets are achievable with our continued effort. As I discussed last quarter, I'm confident that we are taking the necessary steps to achieve this level, and we expect continued progress to occur in 2013.","Moving to our EPS guidance and outlook for the second half of the year. We are reaffirming our 2013 split adjusted earnings guidance of $3.20 to $3.53 per share following our strong first half results, continuing operational improvements and the solid performance of our run rate and aftermarket business. We continue to expect full year sales growth between 4% and 6% on a neutral FX basis after achieving the low end of the range in the first half.","Turning to our spending priorities. As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to return value to our shareholders and remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital deployment. Importantly, we will continue to invest in our business to deliver profitable growth and solid organic returns, forecasting 2013 CapEx of $120 million to $130 million to further increase our worldwide capabilities. Other uses of cash, we expect this year, include pension contributions and scheduled debt repayments. But even combined, this amount is modest in comparison to the other priorities.","We believe our capital allocation approach, with a targeted debt-to-EBITDA between 1x and 2x, provides a flexibility to grow the business organically, return capital to shareholders and invest in strategic bolt-ons and we'll continue to produce solid returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jay.","John E. Roueche","Thank you, Mike. We have concluded our prepared remarks this morning. And, Vanessa, if you're ready, we would like to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on margins. You spoke of some margin pressure shifting into Q3. Could you give a little more color? Is that projects that are being delayed that are shipping out later? And was that an EPD? Any color you can give there?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, we've talked about this before. If you look at the run-off in our backlog over the last year, a lot of that has been some of what I'd call the projects we took before the One Flowserve initiative. And some of those are still there. And so it's really those that are running off, they'll be primarily in EPD.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow up on margins. Maybe if you could talk about, after putting the COO structure in place a little over 1 year ago, maybe talk about what you've done, what's behind you already? What's yet to come in terms of IPD getting to that 15% margin rate? FCD, it looks like most of the low-hanging fruit is behind you. EPD, it seems like there's still some legacy backlog to cycle through. Any color you can give on what's behind you, what's yet to come?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, I'll try to just do it at the high level, maybe terms of innings as people talk about it. FCD has been performing at a very high level for a long period of time. And our COO, in fact, was running that. So I'd say 7th inning in that business. There are certainly still opportunity but the focus there, Hamzah, is on growth. And so you've seen that. We'll tell you what we're focusing on and hopefully, that's what we're going to be delivering. You've seen growth in FCD. That has been our priority. In the earlier stages, in both EPD and IPD, as we've talked about before in IPD, we got off to a slower-than-expected start but we're pleased with the progress. But there's -- our priority there is on improving basically the throughput in our facilities and the efficiency to take advantage of growth. And you've certainly seen the progress there, third or fourth inning, probably the same in EPD as well. EPD also has another aspect of being kind of a late cycle business that there will be a market aspect to it. But a lot of it is still what I'd call within our control. So that's probably a good way to frame it up. These things certainly take time, especially in the longer cycle segments. So really, if you think about it, we put the COO structure in place in the first quarter of last year. A lot of the processes were put in the second and third quarter. So we're starting to see the benefits of that. But they're working their way through it. And I think that's one of the areas why we're encouraged is when we look forward, we still have a lot of propensity in this business. We have a lot of opportunity to improve the operations. And again, FCD is a great example of that.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And just a last question from me, I'll turn it over. If you could just touch on the competitive environment that you're seeing out there. Some of your European competitors are going through some restructuring. Other players being disciplined. It seems like you have a good opportunity to take share. Any comments on the competitive dynamic environment you're seeing out there?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, yes, I mean, it's -- there are various things going on with competitors. But I think what you're seeing consistently, which we think is an endorsement for our industry, is a focus on Flow Control. And that really benefits the industry altogether. But you're seeing various things that are occurring. For the most part, what we are seeing relative to 2010 and 2011 is a thoughtful competitive environment. And thoughtful doesn't mean anything other than everybody is certainly focused on margins, everybody is focused on what they put in backlog as opposed to where it was then. And that's typically what you see when you start emerging from these cycles. Keep in mind, the long cycle business has been basically in a soft patch since, really, the middle part towards the end of 2008. So these are the way these things certainly cycle through, and you're certainly seeing that in the competitive landscape.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Hey, just on the margin pressure that's kind of moved from Q2 to Q3. What -- can you quantify that in any way as to what that might hit EPD yet?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, I think this will really go back to our statement, we're not a quarter-to-quarter business, and for a whole host of reasons. Some of these things can move as they did even from this quarter from one to another. I think, for the most part, a lot of the, what I'd call, pre-One Flowserve initiative backlog has run off. As I said, if you look at the year-over-year 8% decline, more than that amount is representative in some of the pre-Flowserve backlog, pre-One Flowserve backlog. But as we look forward, there are -- I mean, I think -- let's start from the framework of where we are right now. We have a better margin profile than we did last year. And the fact is, really, when the timing of some of these things come through, but what we don't want to do is start parsing here over the next couple quarters where the margin impact would be. Just look at the general trends. You can see the underlying efficiency and throughput is improving. I mean, we had this quarter, year-over-year, 70 -- almost 70% contribution margin at the gross profit line on basically flat mix. That's indicative of an improving margin environment here. But these things can move -- Charlie, in order of magnitude, you can think about $20 million, $30 million of a project that comes through it at little or no margin. You can do the math as to what the margin impact will be.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right, right, that's helpful. And just your commentary on the large projects that are kind of moving into pre-FEED theme [ph] into evaluation bid stage. Would you expect -- I know you think you're going to book some in the second half, would you expect some of that -- is some of that stuff short enough that you recognize the revenue? Or is this really all kind of 2014 work that we're looking at?","Mark A. Blinn","You could, yes. I mean, you could see some revenue, maybe some engineering work, some early stages. But remember, these -- although, I would say lead times are shorter than they were in 2007 and 2008, for the most part, you're still seeing lead times that are approaching a year on some of these things. So that would give you an order of magnitude of when we'll start recognizing the revenue. I think the focus, and it was in our comments, this year is really around improving the platform, moving some of the backlog through the facilities. And then, to a certain degree, share count. That's what's really driving earnings this year.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And can you give any more color on what types of projects these are? So end markets or geographies of where you're seeing the bulk of this?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I'll let -- Tom, can you turn your mic on? Tom will comment on that.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, just a quick overview. Maybe start with -- just by region. I mean, in South Africa, the solar opportunities look pretty good. I'll just quickly go through each one and highlight the big points. Latin America, looking like FPSOs. It's a good mining and aftermarket opportunity. Asia Pacific looks like FPSOs. Power opportunities, obviously, in the combined cycle gas area as well as refinery. Europe, we have some good aftermarket business versus last quarter, but I wouldn't say it's returned to the levels. Good Russian opportunities in power and oil and gas. I would say FPSOs in the Netherlands, in the European area there, is -- has been good in Q2. Middle East, we still look at those decell opportunities, as well as the power and the downstream chemical that go with the product diversification. In North America, as we've indicated in Q1, the pipeline business is good, good chemical business, as everything is shifting now to shale gas. And then, I would say, in Europe, overall, via chemicals, I mean, there is a general migration on the chemical side to Middle East, Asia and China. Although we're seeing some stabilization on the chemical side of the business relative to some of the economies in Europe improving. So I would say that's a quick overview. And then, lastly, nuclear. There's a lot of, I would say, ups and downs in nuclear, but Russia is pretty active with 9 reactors going on. Sweden announced it's upgrading its nuclear fleet. However, in the U.S., some businesses have announced the move to gas, although we are looking at building a couple of nuclear plants in the U.S. And then, obviously, China, Russia, as well as India, proceeding on their nuclear units. I would say that's a very quick regional overview.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Maczka with BB&T.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Wanted to touch on the projects again and the visibility in the second half. Your -- you commented, Mark, on the thoughtful competitive set, but yet now, we're also saying that the competitive bidding on these early jobs, it may be more competitive than maybe we were previously thinking. I'm just wondering, it sounds like your visibility and the way these projects are advancing is still there, which gives you comfort in the second half. But I'm just wondering if your visibility and your ability to win those jobs has changed at all because you're so disciplined with price and margin, which I think we all appreciate.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. No, the competitive nature of these projects, as it starts to cycle back, is not new news. I think what we've seen and, obviously, we've been bidding on some of these things, that's what gives us confidence is they're going to come. It's just to remind you, when, and I think we talked about this on the last call, when these projects start to come back and there's available capacity out there, it tends to be competitive around filling that capacity. And then they start to use price to rationalize that capacity. It's the way every cycle works. So this is not new news.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just one more. On the aftermarket bookings that were relatively flat this quarter, have you seen any change at all that you can detect in customer behavior there? Are there any deferrals in any way? I know you were up against kind of a record comp there, but any more color you can give on your aftermarket booking trends?","Mark A. Blinn","No, no. I mean, it's relatively flat, but we're talking about $0.5 billion bookings. And just look at the rolling 4 quarters and you can see that we're growing the business in excess of what the net installed base globally is coming online. So we still feel like we're getting good penetration and executing well. As you've seen in the past, any 1 or 2 quarters and compared to the prior year, flat or slightly unfavorably. And I think we were talking about this in 2009. People were worried that it was going to start to tail off. And in fact, what you've seen is a solid good mid-to-high single-digit growth over that period of time on a CAGR basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I just wanted to actually touch on the recognition of revenues again for the large projects. I think previously, when we talked about it, you noted it was likely to be on a percentage-of-completion basis, given the size of these and how you have to work through the engineering. So if you are booking awards starting maybe late '13 and maybe that slips into '14, who knows, but is this be going to be recognized more on an S-curve type fashion, where maybe the first, I don't know, 12 months or so, you're recognizing very little revenue and then it spikes higher? Just trying to get a sense of how those will actually ramp.","Mark A. Blinn","They ramp with your cost. I mean, it's really -- as you build cost into the project, you had your standard margin to that as you go through it, and that's basically how it builds up. You do make an adjustment at the end. But that's how percentage of completion works. And keep in mind, percentage of completion taking a step back runs at or less than 10% of our overall revenue.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. So it should be more linear rather than an S curve like we saw with EPCs?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I means, they go with cost. Costs aren't necessarily linear. So it's -- as you start to build cost, I mean, you may have some engineering work and then do some spec design with the customer. And then you start to order some castings. When the castings come in, the motors come in, as you can imagine. And keep in mind, and as we talked about before, in some of these big systems, 40% to 50% of the cost of that, the revenue base comes from other suppliers, like a big motor. So when that motor comes in, when you have a cost associated with that, obviously, you'll have a revenue component. So I wouldn't necessarily say it's linear, but it definitely lines up with the project.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then just maybe over to Mike -- I'm sorry, Mike Taff. So just talking more about free cash flow. You guys' conversion has certainly lagged net income for many years now. So you guys are working quite diligently on your working capital accounts. I'm just curious, at what point should we anticipate that you actually do achieve net income type of conversion? You actually -- I would think you should exceed that type of 100% conversion for some time. It looks like that's probably not going to happen in '13. But starting potentially next year, should we anticipate you start exceeding that level and then you level off around net income thereafter? If you could just give maybe some more definitive timeline as far as when we could anticipate that type of improvement.","Michael S. Taff","Well, I think as we said in our prepared comments, we've got a lot of initiatives underway. I think we're focused in the right areas and certainly, working with Tom's group, we're focused on the biggest components being receivables and inventories. But I think you'll see some of that benefit starting first half of next year and then continue through there. So I mean -- but long-term, as we get into 2014, that's certainly our goal, is to have a consistent cash flow that's near our net income level.","Mark A. Blinn","If you think about it from an order-to-cash standpoint on any project, with One Flowserve initiative, what we did is start it on the front end of the process. And frankly, working capital will tend to be what comes towards the end there. So what should give you confidence that we're going to get there is now you -- look now at the contribution margin and the gross profit line that is indicative of improving operations and execution. We do still have work to do on our operations. I definitely want to call that out. But then, that should give you confidence it's going to lead the working capital efficiency.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","If I could just slip one last one. Just, Mike, I think you also said -- Mike Taff. Again, sorry. I think you did say you're working on other initiatives to neutralize the impact of FX. Can you just comment on that? Are there some plans in place where we can start to see that transaction swing quarter-to-quarter and start to mitigate at some point?","Michael S. Taff","Well, certainly, we're pleased with the results this quarter, where we had essentially a minimal effect there. There are a number of things where we are working towards continuing to look at different hedging strategies and all and also, looking at whether there's ways to account for our hedging programs differently that would really just try to eliminate as much volatility as possible.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If I could start with a clarification. I think, Mike, during your comments, you said 100 to 200 basis points margin improvement by 2014. I think in January last year, the goal was 150 to 250 basis points. Is that a change or are you basing that over a different timeframe?","Michael S. Taff","It's over a different timeframe. We -- remember, when we put the 150 to 200 basis points, that was 1 year ago, January. So it was coming off of 2011 results.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's up 2012 results?","Michael S. Taff","Yes. Yes, we improved about 50 basis points in 2012.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, cool. Mark, thinking a little longer term and a little more strategically, it seems like we're getting the portfolio into better shape, One Flowserve's having its effect. When you think about M&A, obviously, Flowserve has not been very active for quite some time. Thinking about potentially larger deals or adding another platform or something more major in the M&A front, can you talk about what your appetite for that might be and what kind of timeframe you might think about?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, the timeframe is probably dictated more by the market than anything else. But I will say this. I think our focus is, if you consider the size and scale of our business, we don't feel at this point that we need to go and make a huge consolidation play in the industry. Consolidation be it more where you're taking capacity out, consolidating costs, basically, substantial integration. Frankly, what we've done between 2009 and 2012, with all the changes we made in our business, was almost like a large acquisition. And so we're very focused on continuing this momentum. Having said that, there have been, and the opportunity set is certainly a little light right now in the industrial space, but there have been and we think will continue to be opportunities of size that we would classify as a bolt-on, a bolt-on being where we bring in as a business and leverage our results platform, our aftermarket platform, certainly, our leadership team that we have in place right now, or even take something on the adjacent side that is focused around rotating equipment where we can drive our end-user strategies. That's how we think about it. And I can tell you, as we continue to improve operations, it gives us increasing confidence of being able to integrate one of these bolt-on acquisitions. So I think, from our standpoint, if you look at it, we want to make sure we maintain capital structure flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. But we also want to make sure that we drive improvement to this platform and don't do anything to set it back. But from a huge transformational industry consolidation play, we just don't see that that makes sense at this point.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one for Tom. Tom, orders in Flow Control have bounced back nicely after some negative growth last year. Is that growth coming short cycle through distribution or more at project basis? Does this feel like a bit of an early cycle period for Flow Control, and could we see that continue for a few more quarters?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Well, in Q2, the aftermarket business was up in Flow Control. So that's one area. But I would say, in general, it's the larger projects, the FPSOs in Brazil and out of Korea and off the European coast, as well as we've seen some good nuclear parts business for North America and Southeast Asia. And then, I would just say, long gas projects in the Middle East. Those are the main areas.","Mark A. Blinn","What you're seeing from that is, I think to your point, is a little bit of an early cycle read. And you're seeing it with other process companies as well. But I don't want to -- you said we haven't really made -- been too active in acquisitions. I mean, we acquired Valbart 3 years ago to get our presence in the oil and gas industry. And we consistently see the benefit of that acquisition in our results over the last few quarters.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So just in terms of distribution in Flow Control, how has that been over the last couple of quarters?","Thomas L. Pajonas","I mean, that distribution business was up in this last quarter. It was basically in the oil and gas area and the chemical market. And again, a little distribution increase we also saw in China based on the last 2 or 3 years' worth of the OE projects that we started to place down in there. And then we've had just a small amount of distribution on the U.S. power market. But that was up in Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask on the cash flow side, Mike, I'm looking at the cash flow statement on the press release end. The year-to-date investment in inventory and receivables certainly have improved. It seems to me that more of the working capital issue is matching, at least in the first 6 months of this year, of what you're doing on the asset side versus what you're doing on the payable and liability side. That's just a number. Is that a fair statement? And maybe what are you thinking on that? What's the plan to improve that?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, certainly, I mean, I think on the accounts payable side, you saw some usage on accounts payable. But I think that's just more timing than anything, Scott, on that same point. The accrued liabilities side, it kind of matches with what we've been talking about. One of the large users year-over-year, and for the first 6 months was deferred revenues. And as we talked about the lack of the large project bookings over the last several quarters, more on the run rate business and aftermarket business, you just tend to have less of that deferred revenue and upfront payments and all. So that kind of makes sense with where the bookings have been the last several quarters. I think as we get -- the long cycle business starts to increase into the second half of this year. And next year, you'll see that turn and be a bit more positive.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you, okay. And I also wanted to maybe talk again about the projection of -- your guys projection of when these things start to -- these projects start to get released and when you can start to bid on them. And maybe this is more of a question for you, Mark, than anyone. But also, I'd certainly -- any chiming in would help from the 2 EPC guys in the room. Is the turn, the potential bottoming of steel prices something of a catalyst for when projects get released? Essentially, where I'm going with this is do end-users say, \"Okay, steel isn't declining anymore; maybe it's starting to turn the corner.\" Certainly, it has bottomed. Is that a potential catalyst for projects?","Mark A. Blinn","No, it's -- I mean, we -- if there's a view of ramp and increase or extreme increase in material cost, like you saw in '07 and '08, people were hurried to get their capacity in place to process that, like you saw in the mining industry with some of materials. But steel may be an indicator of kind of general economic outlook, which will play through. But at this stage, where these projects are, steel prices, in and itself, are not going to drive what brings them this quarter, the next quarter. You think about some of these projects that we're talking about that we see on the horizon do going into commission in 2015, '16 and '17. And so, if you take a step back from there, they already, in a sense, kind of have their timeline that's built out. They need that capacity online, power, refinery or whatever it may be in those periods of time. That's why they can move a couple of quarters as they move through it. But steel, and you see that with any natural resources. Because of the lead times on this capacity, and sometimes, where we are in this stage with the pre-FEED and the FEED work done, the amount of investment that's already in it, that steel price or a marginal move in gold, a marginal move in oil, anything like that is not going to really change the pace of which these things go out.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's fine. That's really all I had with the, I guess, maybe the one I don't think that you guys called out any types of gains or discrete losses on disposals or anything like that. You would have called that out, right? So I'm assuming none this quarter?","Michael S. Taff","The only thing --, yes. No, we didn't. The only thing that we talked out discreet, I think, was in our press release. Pretty minor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So, Mark, your commentary around the cycle. I just had a quick follow-on there. You sort of mentioned the cycle has its pattern, this one's no different. What does seem different is Flowserve and the discipline and selectivity that's been happening. So I guess the question is whether -- are you going to participate at the same level at this cycle or are you going to pick your spots at certain points of the cycle? I'm just wanted your thoughts on that.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think, in general, as a company, our -- where we were versus the last cycle, far more disciplined and, certainly, improved execution. So I think you should expect that to continue. Having said that, I look at commentary from some of our competitors. And I think they're talking about increased discipline as well. So we wouldn't underestimate them by any stretch of imagination. But I think in general, if you're asking what's changed? Yes, there's certainly going to be more discipline. And if you look at -- there's a lot of changes this cycle versus the last. One Flowserve being one of them, the disciplined approach, the way we can utilize our capacity in our lead product, secondary product, we actually, in effect, have more and more efficient capacity to deal with project opportunities. Obviously, we're in different locations around the world where the opportunities are. So there's -- it's a long conversation. The next time I'll see you, I'll be happy to have with you around what's changed during that period of time. But you should expect continued discipline from us through this cycle. A lot of the reason is, if you look at what has really been carrying us for the last 3 or 4 quarters, it's been the aftermarket and run rate franchise and the improving operation is driving earnings growth. Great leverage on the gross margin line now and even all the way through the operating line.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. I'll follow on with the free cash flow discussion getting to near net income. Mike, I just wondered if you do win these, some of these large projects, let's say, in the back half of the year, early next year, knowing some of the working capital requirements on the project business, do you still feel you can hit 100% of net income next year with that mix shift?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, I mean, the key there, Jamie, is just really focusing on our terms and conditions. And that's part of our -- this month's [ph] activity. It's not just the margins we're putting in the job terms, the conditions are very important. And with that comes building milestones and things of that nature. So that's something that we continue to stress with the organization. And it's just important to stay in line with the customer there with our cash flow requirements on these big projects.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then one last quick one, if I could. EPD, there's a mention of a bad debt expense increase. Could you add some color there, magnitude of what the driver was?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, it was just -- it was one customer, and it's basically all taken care of. So it's not something that you'll see that would recur.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And so that might actually help margins play into the third quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, certainly. I mean, I'm not sure we'll get recovery from that one particular item. But it's relatively small. But it was a development project that we're working on and all. But it is taken care of.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Tom, you gave a nice outlook on the regional opportunity set. Do you have any sense of which regions are more advanced in their award process and may come in sooner versus those that are maybe going to be a bit later?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Well, I mean, certainly, if I looked at Europe, I would just say in general, Europe is, I would say, moving out of some of the economic situations that they've had over the last 18 months. But then, I would say in other regions, it's very dependent upon the type of product within the industry. So for instance, and obviously, in the U.S., you have pipelines, which is maybe different than, say, your coal-fired power plants, which is going through some changes and certainly, FPSO seems to be, I would say, prevalent at, certainly, in different parts of the world, Brazil and off the coast in Europe and so on. I would say it really depends upon a number of different factors.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like it's still fairly wide open as to where these first projects would come from.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, I would say the good news on the power side is that we're seeing a lot of power activity different than what was there in the past as one of the first, I would say, of these type of projects that previously were in FEED and pre-FEED, we're seeing them transition now to a -- an active bidding\/further potential buying stage after this bidding stage that we're going through right now.","Mark A. Blinn","I think the answer to that question and the way we go through it, there's probably some general regional overlays. But the way Tom goes through these things specifically should highlight why we -- and we know and have an understanding when these projects are going to come on, because they're very specific to the type of activity that's going on. But in general, I mean, I think our commentary around the regions was Europe is stable at low levels. North America, you're going to see -- they keep talking about a manufacturing renaissance. And relative to Europe, I do want to point out, 4 years ago, the commentary around North America was manufacturing was leaving. It wasn't going to ever recover. Things weren't going to be the same. And here we are, and it's quite different. I wouldn't expect anything too different out of Europe.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then in the second half, I guess, a question along the same lines. I mean, are you thinking that these awards have come to the market, it'll be just kind of one-offs or might it be a more robust flow of projects coming to market? Or is that more of a 2014-type situation or is it just too hard to tell on the timing of these bigger projects?","Mark A. Blinn","Probably fairly to really say that more general project activity will be 2014. I mean, they're all on-off, frankly, the way we work them. But I think more of a general project-type activity is going to be, across the board, is going to be 2014.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Bremer with the Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","This morning, one of your competitors had to adjust their guidance due to pretty much similar commentary from you guys in terms of a lack of large-scale projects, and some of them shifting to latter periods impacting the remainder -- remainder of '13. Should we be expecting, based upon your guidance, that we should be more towards the lower end due to this, at this point?","Mark A. Blinn","Bill, yes, I mean, we don't -- we certainly don't give guidance within the guidance. And my comments earlier around this year was the increased efficiency, which you commented on at the beginning, and share count is really what drives earnings this year. But one other thing relative to that competitor, who has got a great presence in oil and gas. They're more vertical across the oil and gas industry. We're more diversified across different sectors than they are.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Well, that's a given. Agreed. My second question is, has there been any type of repricing or cancellations in the backlog currently?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Repricing again is -- if you think about it, we have firm contracts when we go into these things. That's typically not a big issue. The pricing activity occurs before you get the contract, not necessarily after. And cancellations haven't been anything out of the ordinary.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Good to hear. And then, Tom, you mentioned you called out some of the pipeline activity. Can you give us a sense of primarily, is it shales? We really haven't seen too much on long haul pipe, especially here in North America as of yet. But maybe just give us an idea of the content of the pumps involved and your exposure to pipelines in general, just a nice little overview, if you may?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, I would say, generally, you're correct. It's not necessarily the long overhaul pipeline business that we're talking about. Most of this is associated with the shale and the liquids business. In a lot of cases, it maybe operates to an existing facility also on the aftermarket side of the business. So I would say, it's some new and it's also operates through existing systems on the pipeline business.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And would you -- how would you characterized your year-over-year in terms of this particular segment? I mean, would you say you're running 20% or 30% higher year-over-year at this point?","Thomas L. Pajonas","I would say the run rate business, pipeline business, I would say, is very similar and has been -- it grew nicely last year and the same thing this year, overall, as an industry. So I would say it's staying at the same levels in terms of the overall industry itself year-over-year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Radigan with KeyBanc.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one question. Tom mentioned $70 billion in shale investment on the radar. Are you similarly able to quantify the magnitude of projects you're tracking on an overall basis globally, just to give a sense of order of magnitude for the opportunity that's ahead here. And then how do you think about capture rate, either historically, or what your target going forward?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, we do track all that. But we don't this discuss that necessarily publicly. I mean, the general information around project opportunities is from third-party sources, which we use as well as available. But in terms of what we're targeting, there's certainly plenty of opportunity over the horizons over the next couple of years, but we don't go into that detail.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Two final questions. I was hoping that if you think about the -- your commentary around revenues for next year or at least this year was a year of, really, a year of execution and discipline and then next year is a year of growth. This year, you were talking about 4% to 6% top line growth. You indicated, Mike, that you're at the bottom end of that. So in order for you to exceed that number next year, what sort of bookings expectations do we have to see for the back half of this year on a year-over-year basis? That's one, and then I have a second follow-up.","Michael S. Taff","Well, I mean, for -- obviously, for growth next year, with some pickup this year or next year in the order book will drive revenue growth in the projects. But also, and I think equally or more important, continued growth in our run rate and aftermarket business like you've seen. One thing to keep in mind with these projects, when we book them, is that's revenue you take over a longer period of time. And -- but the shorter cycle run rate and aftermarket business, that tends to manifest itself in revenues quicker. So my point is, a company can have a significant increase in big project work that goes into their backlog but may cover revenue over 1.5 year. So that growth will be muted over that period of time relative to the booking growth in any one period. But the run rate business and the aftermarket business can grow quicker. And that's why we stay very focused on it. If you look at, over the last couple of years, we've grown those businesses. Those tend to be more stable margins. Aftermarket is high-margin business. So hopefully, that will give you some color.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That helps. I mean, obviously, you had difficult comps as noted in your aftermarket business. So we would need to see a progression of that aftermarket growth along with stable OE bookings. Is that pretty fair in order to see growth above this year?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, that's fair, yes. And just don't look at any one quarter. Because again, going back to the aftermarket, this is over $0.5 billion of aftermarket. We weren't anywhere near this size of aftermarket business 4 or 5 years ago.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Sure. And the other question is, the IPD margins were very impressive. And again, this goes back to your point about the aftermarket business. The bookings were down significantly, both on OE and then they were down for the aftermarket for that business. So you lose some of that operating leverage you have. You're obviously executing better. So is it intuitive then at the margins, you sort of take 2 steps forward, 1 step back on the margins that is sequentially, maybe it's a third or fourth quarter, we should see some decline in that margin on a sequential basis?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, as you're -- I think the way to look at margins, you're 2 step forward, 1 back may be when they're operating more efficiently and that the marginal impact of mix is really the primary driver of margin impact when you're improving your operations from where they are. I mean, believe me, they've got a ways to go. It's going to be more about your throughput and your execution, which has been a priority. So if you look year-over-year, we focus them on the run rate business. They had a couple of what I'd call medium projects in the second quarter last year that came through their bookings. But really, it's been around making sure that they're most efficient in taking good care of their customers. So I think over the near-term, as we continue to improve this business, I think more of the margin profile is going to be over improving the operations and getting better efficiency. And then, down the road, we'll get to the discussion of OE aftermarket mix, OE growth, aftermarket growth, that will start impacting margins. That's where we want to be with the business. If we get all of our businesses that way, like we are in the Flow Control division, then it's a different discussion.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So then, I shouldn't expect the IPD business margins to decline, given the decline in the bookings number?","Michael S. Taff","In and of itself in the bookings, no. They can have mix issues. They can certainly have things from quarter-to-quarter. We're going to 14% to 15% in this business over the next 1.5 year, 2 years. That's still a ways to go. One quarter to the next, things can change. We keep telling you, be careful to try to evaluate this on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Operator","And that was our final question. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche. You may begin.","John E. Roueche","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today to discuss Flowserve Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings, which we made public last night through our press release and Form 10-K filing.","As usual, participating on the call today are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Taff, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Mullin, our Director of Investor Relations.","Following our prepared comments this morning, we will open the call up for your questions, and more information will be given at that time.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's call is being webcast in coordination with an earnings slide presentation, both of which are available through our website at www.flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section. A replay will also be available on our website in approximately 2 hours, following the end of today's live call.

Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which provided a good finish to the year and culminated in our overall solid 2012 results, as we managed through a somewhat challenging macro environment. Throughout the year, we focused internally on our operational efficiency to drive earnings growth while continuing to position the business to capture expected improvement in our end markets, particularly the larger projects that we expect to move to the buy phase in the latter half of 2013.","Before highlighting the financial results, I would like to mention how proud I am of the dedication and performance that our employees exhibited during 2012 as we drove our One Flowserve initiative. Through their efforts, we continued to grow our business with a disciplined approach while leveraging our broad capabilities and driving an expense management culture throughout the company.","In our industry, bids, bookings and backlog are the critical first steps to delivering successful results for our shareholders. As 2012 progressed, we enhanced our order execution process and increased our discipline and selectivity. The result was not only bookings growth but also a higher quality backlog, both of which came despite larger-than-expected currency headwinds and challenges posed by geopolitical uncertainties.","Broadly, we saw solid activity across our major end markets, with the exception of the power industry, which softened. Original equipment orders during the year primarily consisted of small to midsized projects, as our experienced and broad sales organization concentrated on opportunities across all of our end markets, which, in general, saw some growth despite macro uncertainties and declines in certain markets. This smaller yet high-volume business that we earned is a strategic emphasis for us as it leverages our sales and engineering talent, our global platform and aftermarket capabilities.","As for large projects, we had only one large order booked in the third quarter, but we remain encouraged that pre-FEED and FEED work remains at high levels. And we continue to expect final approval of certain large projects planned in North America and other regions to occur in the second half of 2013.","From an aftermarket standpoint, our end-user focus and strategic localization continued to yield positive results in 2012, producing record aftermarket bookings exceeding $1.9 billion. A great example of our aftermarket strategy at work was a Dow Benelux 5-year service agreement that we signed in the third quarter. We will continue to target these types of arrangements, as our expertise is well-suited for customers who increasingly are looking for better alternatives in maintaining and optimizing their equipment.","By booking quality work and with improved execution, full year earnings per share were $8.51, up over 11% versus prior year despite significant currency headwinds. This delivered on our long-term goal of leveraging mid-single digit revenue growth into double-digit earnings growth.","Our improving execution and operational excellence also resulted in operating margin expansion of 50 basis points, keeping us on track for our previously announced margin target of 15% to 16% by the end of 2014. Key to this progress was IPD's impressive margin improvement of 320 basis points, as its realigned operations continued to gain traction.","The financial achievements in 2012 were due in large part to an internal focus as we leveraged our One Flowserve initiative to drive operational excellence across our business units. While opportunity remains, I am pleased with our progress on key initiatives, such as on-time delivery, working capital management, reduced cost of quality and low-cost sourcing.","We believe the internal progress we made this year also strengthens our ability to execute on potential inorganic growth. Our strategy is to target select bolt-on acquisition prospects in technologies and markets that complement our expanding portfolio and geographic reach. As we evaluate these prospects, we target opportunities where we can leverage our worldwide sales force, aftermarket capabilities and global platform to grow the business at a greater pace and enable pull-through of additional products.","In addition to our operational excellence improvements, we also executed on our capital structure strategies to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet, return value to our shareholders and position the business for profitable growth.","During 2012, Flowserve returned nearly $850 million to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We maintained a disciplined capital deployment process, which also included further investment in our aftermarket platform with 4 new QRCs, as well as localized manufacturing capacity in Brazil, China and India.","As we enter 2013, we expect to build on the progress already made on our One Flowserve initiative and capitalize on forecasted modest improvement in growth rates in certain regions of the globe in the latter half of the year. While some uncertainty continues, we are anticipating some modest improvement in the U.S., particularly in the second half of the year; stability in the European markets, although at low historic levels; and opportunities in the developing regions where we have invested in additional capacity.","Turning to earnings expectations for 2013. We provided guidance in January outlining our plans for double-digit EPS growth again. Mike will cover it in greater detail. But I would like to highlight that, similar to last year, we expect our earnings to reflect traditional seasonality and thus be back-end weighted.","Finally, I would like to share why I'm encouraged as we begin 2013. I'm confident in our ability to continue building upon the momentum achieved over the last several years. As you may recall, we began 2010 by integrating our front end, combining pumps and seals, realigning capabilities, filling some key product gaps and localizing to further capitalize on long-term opportunities in emerging regions. This last year was one of more internal focus as we drove our One Flowserve initiative to improve our operating platform and pursue cost leverage.","With anticipated improvement in certain of our end markets and continued operational improvements, we expect to profitably grow our business, particularly our valuable aftermarket franchise, and remain committed on creating long-term value for our shareholders.","With these factors in mind, yesterday, we announced that our board has approved a 16.7% increase to our quarterly dividend, a replenished stock repurchase plan of $750 million and a 3-for-1 stock split, subject to shareholder action.","Let me, at this point, turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Before reviewing our markets and operations, I would like to expand on Mark's comments regarding the progress of our One Flowserve initiative and the leadership structure put in place early last year.","First, I'm very proud of the operating leaders and their execution of key initiatives to drive operational excellence and cost management throughout our divisions. As a team, they have leveraged best practices across our platforms, improving functional performance in a number of areas, including order and sales execution, on-time delivery and low-cost sourcing, to just mention a few.","We also continued to develop our CIP platform, targeting quality and process improvements, reduced cycle time and lower costs. Approximately 1,700 CIP trained are certified green, black belt and master black belts are currently deployed throughout the company to drive the CIP culture we have consistently invested in for years, and they are providing a solid return on that investment.","Additionally, we continue to invest in our associates and have enhanced our organizational capabilities through training, leadership development, cross-business segment and functional development assignments as we look to institutionalize our succession planning, leadership competencies and performance management processes to ensure a sustainable business model.","Turning to the year, I am pleased with the progress we have made operationally. Consolidated operating margin improved sequentially compared to 2011, driven by the improvements in IPD and FCD. We expect to build on the progress we have made in IPD as we continue to target operating margins of 14% to 15% for the division by the end of 2015.","As many of you know, EPD operating margins were challenged during 2012, both for the full year and fourth quarter, as we continued to ship lower-margin legacy backlog that was booked in the very competitive 2010 and early 2011 timeframe. As we have highlighted since, the company has continued to improve the quality of our backlog. Further, we expect margins to improve for EPD in 2013 as the year progresses and the impact of higher-margin backlog shipping is recognized.","Let me now turn to our markets and outlook. Overall bookings for the year increased year-over-year about 5.5% on a constant currency basis. Once again, another year of strong aftermarket performance and solid levels of small to midsized projects were the key to this growth. Considering we only booked one large project order during 2012, which was for offshore equipment in Latin America, we're very pleased with the total amount of original equipment bookings.","Opportunities across our markets were mixed, again demonstrating the value of Flowserve's diversified business model as stronger activity in the oil and gas, chemical and general industries more than offset the ongoing softness in the power markets.","We benefited regionally as well, with strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific offsetting the Middle East and Europe.","Looking now at the fourth quarter, consolidated bookings declined over the comparable 2011 period by about 5.6%. As Mark mentioned, I believe this is more of a timing issue and doesn't change our opportunities ahead.","On the OE front, there are a number of reasons some of the large projects we have been following in North America and around the world have taken additional time coming to market. There's been some macro uncertainty that has slowed growth, but I believe the primary reason is just that the large projects take longer for the E&Cs and the end-user to reach agreement. And they never seem to move as quickly as first indicated. It's just the nature of the business.","However, the levels of FEED and pre-FEED work outstanding remain elevated, which is a good leading indicator for our business, as we continue to believe final investment decisions will occur in the second half of 2013 for many of these projects.","Turning to the fourth quarter aftermarket. North American activity was delayed in the fourth quarter as refineries temporarily deferred maintenance to capitalize on current strong margins while maintaining the high utilization rates. While it affected the quarter, there are some positive takeaways. Maintenance can only be deferred temporarily, so it too will come, and running at higher utilization accelerates the need for future aftermarket work. So again, fourth quarter bookings overall were much more a matter of timing issue than a change in our business.","So in short, we remain optimistic in our diverse end markets and the benefits they provide. Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil and India will continue driving investments in new refinery projects. The growing shale and tar sands products require pipeline projects in North America to transport the expanded production to refineries. Certain potential LNG projects in our industry are experiencing increased development costs, which may cause some reevaluation of the size, scope or timing of that activity.","New chemical construction continues, primarily in the Middle East and China, while ethylene projects in the U.S. are moving forward on the tailwind of low-cost natural gas and available reserves. We believe refining, petrochemical and chemical plants will continue vertical integration due to the proximity of the feedstock and the desire of customers to keep more of the total margin in-country. This is the development in countries like Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Kuwait and Russia.","In power, fossil activity at this time is primarily located in China, India and Russia, particularly on the supercritical side, driven by the need for reduced emissions and efficiency increases.","In new capacity, nuclear power opportunities are mainly occurring in China, India, Russia and Eastern Europe, while the upgrades and re-rates continue in our developed regions due to the strong economics these projects provide.","Natural gas reserves and environmental policies have created additional opportunities for combined cycle power plants, particularly in the developed regions like the U.S.","Finally, solar thermal remains a relatively small but rapidly growing market.","With that overview, let me now turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Mark and Tom provided an overview of some of our accomplishments in 2012 and outlook for 2013. I will provide some additional detail on our consolidated results, update you on the progress we are making in the area of cash flow improvement and then provide some color on our 2013 guidance.","In spite of the headwinds Tom outlined, we closed out the year with a solid fourth quarter, shipping a fourth quarter record of $1.3 billion and growing revenue by 6.5% on a constant currency basis. We were pleased with our full year revenue growth of 5.3% given the impact of the strong dollar for most of the year. Our growth was in line with the original 5% to 7% guidance despite the significantly higher-than-expected currency headwinds.","Full year gross margin was down 30 basis points to 33.3%, impacted by shipments from the remaining legacy backlog. We shipped about $290 million of this low-margin work during 2012, including about $80 million or 6% of sales in the fourth quarter. While we originally expected to ship most of these projects in 2012, we ended the year with a little less than $90 million remaining of this work due primarily to supply chain and customer delays, which is not uncommon. However, we expect the margin impact in 2013 to be down significantly from 2012 levels as we don't expect to ship more than half of this quarter's level in any period during 2013.","Fourth quarter gross margin improved 50 basis points from the prior year to 33.7% as operating improvements and a stronger aftermarket more than offset the impact of the legacy backlog shipments.","Turning to SG&A, it fell as a percentage of sales by 90 basis points to 19.4% despite an increase of approximately $17 million in variable incentive compensation as our focus on cost control yielded solid results. Opportunities remain, and as such, this area will continue to receive significant attention as we work to achieve our goal of an SG&A percentage of 18% over the next few years.","With the 50-basis-point improvement in operating margins in 2012, we remain on course to achieve our targeted improvement of 150 to 250 basis points by 2014 from the 2011 trough of 13.7%.","I am sure many of you are pleased, like we were, to see only a negligible impact of currency in other income in the fourth quarter. However, for the full year, we ended up with approximately $0.85 of headwind, well above our original guidance of $0.50.","Finally, our fourth quarter tax rate was 25.2%, slightly below our guidance of 26% and the full year rate of 26.3%. While 2012 reflected the benefits of favorable resolutions of tax items, we expect to return to a more normalized tax rate of 30% in 2013.","Turning to cash flows. We finished the year strong, as is typical with the seasonality of our business. We generated $394 million in operating cash flows in Q4, bringing our full year cash flow from operations to $517 million. While I am pleased with the cash flow generation for the year and the quarter, we continue our focus on this area until we achieve our goal of consistently generating free cash flow near our net income level.","Our 2012 CapEx was about $136 million, well north of our rate of depreciation, as we continued to invest in the long-term growth of the business.","Finally, we executed on our strategy to efficiently deploy the balance sheet and return value to our shareholders as we targeted a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1x to 2x.","We returned nearly $850 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the year.","In addition, we presented a comprehensive overview of our strategy to the rating agencies and received investment-grade ratings from each. We then took advantage of attractive debt markets, refinancing and increasing capacity on our senior credit facility and issuing $500 million of 10-year public notes.","Turning to our cash utilization slide, we have a historical look at how we have deployed capital over the last 7 years. We have taken a disciplined approach to evaluating and deploying cash and will continue to do so when we discuss our expected cash utilization in 2013 later in the presentation.","Turning to working capital. We saw a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, with progress reducing DSO to 75 days at year end from the 85 days at the end of the third quarter. However, work remains to drive this into the mid-60s, as we've indicated, and we remain committed to getting there.","We also made progress on inventory, reducing our percent of past-due backlog by 160 basis points. Again, I believe our inventory turn goal of 4x to 4.5x is achievable and would like to highlight a few of the initiatives that support my optimism.","CIP black belts are deployed across the business to evaluate and improve our processes. Our dispute management process is being refined to resolve issues faster. Working capital leadership is developing in our emerging regions.","From an inventory standpoint, we are working with our supply chain to better align timing of delivery with production needs. I'm confident we are taking the necessary steps to achieve our working capital goals and look forward to continued progress in 2013.","Moving to our 2013 outlook and EPS guidance. We will continue to execute on our strategy of efficiently deploying capital, including execution of our newly replenished authorized share repurchase plan of $750 million. Before the replenishment, we had spent about $100 million year-to-date in 2013. And we expect to repurchase shares of roughly $280 million to $300 million in total in the first half of 2013, effectively completing the $1 billion share repurchase plan begun in 2012. Following this investment, we intend to return to our stated 40% to 50% of net earnings payout policy over the next few years.","The board also approved a 16.7% increase in our quarterly per share dividend, the sixth consecutive annual increase and third consecutive double-digit increase. Additionally, a 3-for-1 stock split was approved subject to shareholders\u2019 approval of a request for additional authorized shares under our charter.","We believe, with these actions, combined with our drive to grow the top line organically and potential strategic bolt-ons, Flowserve will provide solid results to our shareholders over time.","This year, we expect to invest $120 million to $130 million in capital expenditures to continue profitably growing the business organically and further increase our capabilities around the world.","Finally, we are reaffirming our 2013 EPS guidance of $9.60 to $10.60, which we originally issued several weeks ago.","Similar to the last few years, we expect earnings to be second-half weighted. The first quarter will be a particularly challenging year-over-year comp, given the onetime gain of $10 million recognized on the sale of our former Rio facility in the first quarter of last year, a higher tax rate and the impact of the recently announced Venezuela bolivar devaluation. We estimate the devaluation will result in a charge of approximately $3 million in the 2013 first quarter with no immediate tax benefit, or roughly a $0.07 EPS impact.","This is the second devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar in the last 3 years. And while doing business in this country has its challenges, the region remains an important and profitable market in our strategy of targeting diverse geographies. As such, we continue to expect our presence here.","Lastly, I'd like to remind you that we will be hosting our Analyst Day in New York City on March 20 and look forward to seeing many of you there. Please reach out to Mike or Jay if you're interested in attending and haven't received an invitation by late next week.","As always, we value time with the financial community and our shareholders and look forward to several opportunities throughout the year to spend time together.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jay.","John E. Roueche","Operator, we have now concluded this morning's prepared remarks. If you are ready, we would now like to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to start just asking a general question about your conviction in your top line guidance, mid-single digits, given that bookings and backlog were relatively flat in the year and bookings, of course, trailed off in Q4. What is it that accelerates as we go into the year that would get us to that level?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, a couple of things. When you look at 2012 bookings, one thing to consider. The impact we saw was, one, around our selectivity to drive really value to the company and our shareholders. And also, you saw somewhat of a decline in Europe during the course of the year. So as we mentioned in our comments, that selectivity has really been in place since the first quarter of last year, so we're starting to lap that. Right? That had a year-over-year impact as you look back to 2011. And also, what we do see in Europe is stability, although at low levels, and so we don't expect a headwind from Europe, and then some signs of encouragement in the U.S. economy in the latter half of the year and then just the other markets. So as we look out in the course of this year, we were dealt some headwinds, some at our selection around selectivity. But again, that improves the margin profile in some end markets that we participate that have either stabilized or we see some improvement. So as we -- in a lot of our business, we talked about the aftermarket, which did grow steadily despite those things that I talked about, and our smaller run rate business, which we should benefit from that as very, very good business. I think the issue that it comes down to is the timing of these projects. We do spend a lot of time talking about these projects. But keep in mind, that's about 20% of our business. And we are encouraged to see the FEED work and the pre-FEED work and hope to see them materialize towards the end of the year. But again, that's 20% of our business. It tends to be very competitively bid. When you look at our margin profile, what those tend to contribute to is fixed-cost absorption. But it's really the aftermarket and the run rate business that drives our gross margins. So I think, as we look out, we think we've absorbed some of the things that were chosen on our part and also market-related that we think have certainly abated. We also have proven that we can grow our aftermarket business, which we've done in just about all types of markets over the last couple of years, focused on our run rate business. The improved execution that we've been driving through does bring more orders in because when you take better care of your customers, they respond better to you. Those are all the things that form the foundation of our anticipated revenue growth this year.","Michael S. Taff","Yes. I mean, Kevin, I'd note -- I mean, as Mark indicated, aftermarket is 41% of our revenue base, and you saw about $100 million improvement in that business year-over-year. So we talk about this $2 billion revenue franchise we have in that business, and it's really right there in front of us. So that's a key to that growth, is the continuing to get good growth from the -- from that aftermarket business.","Thomas L. Pajonas","And I would also add in there, Kevin, just to reiterate maybe on some specifics. I mean, the pipeline business in North America is increasing, and that's driven a lot by the natural gas prices and the liquids that most of the players are after. We got good growth in the chemical business, and we continue to see that going forward, particularly in North America going forward because of the feedstock. We also have the Middle East driving the chemical business as they diversify going forward. We do see the larger projects towards the back half of 2013. And as Mark indicated, that's based on the FEED and pre-FEED activity that we've seen so far. I would say the combined cycle power plants across the world are seeing an increase as a result of the natural gas price in the shift there. And I would say, in Q4, the high utilization rates, as I mentioned, created an opportunity for the aftermarket business going forward on the refineries in the U.S. And 2 other businesses, the desal business was a little bit lower in 2012, certainly at the beginning of the year, when we see an increase in that, particularly in the Middle East. Overall, in the solar business, even though that's dependent upon the government subsidies around the world, we are seeing interest in that again, again, in the Middle East. So there are some good favorable signs in terms of going forward.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Got it, very helpful. And if I could just ask one more. Can you comment on the EPD margin a little bit more? I know the comp was difficult, but it wasn't entirely clear to me why that margin was down year-over-year with the aftermarket mix actually increasing. And I know you had some bad legacy backlog still remaining there, but you had that in the prior year as well, maybe even more in the prior year.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, if you look in the prior year in 2011, believe it or not, EPD still benefited. There was some benefit from the '07, '08 time period. I mean, as you look at our business, we don't tend to cycle as quickly as other industrials. In our business, we saw the full impact of the decline in terms of the pricing environment going into booking and the competitive environment going to bookings in 2010 and the early part of 2011. So some of the effects of '08 in projects that were in bid phase in '09 were still coming through in EPD in the early part of 2011. And in fact, what you saw, you saw their margins tend to trend down during the course of '11 and then reverse that trend to a certain degree in 2012. I think the other aspect of that is there was certainly the legacy backlog that was weighing in there, and it was -- that legacy backlog, again, some of this is -- are good projects that were very competitive in '10 and '11 and that are going to yield aftermarket. But what EPD saw was a lot of their big projects were those legacy type in 2012, and they didn't get to see any of the projects from the '08 era kind of carry through. So we're not, certainly, concerned about their margins. The other thing you saw in the SG&A line is we did invest in the business, in the sales organization, in the aftermarket side.","So that's really the EPD story. We -- it will tend to lag what's going on. But if you look relative to some of its peers, very good margins in the business and certainly well positioned to drive incremental aftermarket and also to take advantage of some of these projects that are coming online.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was just hoping that you guys and, particularly, Tom could kind of characterize what you're seeing really today right now. I know you talk a lot about the FEED and the pre-FEED and what have you. The bookings declined on the OE side, I don't think that was a shocker. But I'm just kind of wondering what the tone of OE bookings are right now because we've talked about the FEED and the pre-FEED stuff in it. It just seems to keep getting pushed back a little bit. And what gives you the confidence, Tom, particularly, that you think that this is going to really start to come through in the coming quarters and right through to your bookings line?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, if I can just put it in context and just look at the full year first in context, I mean, if you look at oil and gas, the oil and gas for the full year was up. Chemical was up. General industries were up. The only industry that was really down for the full year was the power business. On the oil and gas, we indicated that a lot of -- even though it was up, a lot of the large projects still were not coming through relative to the EPCs. And we see a lot of that FEED and pre-FEED work as a precursor to the EPCs getting into the buy phase. And I also think that you've seen that in some of the EPCs that have recently gone through some of their investor calls. They've talked a lot about the FEED and pre-FEED work being up. If you look at the regions, again, what gives me some confidence going forward, the North America region was up for the full year. We still have a lot of pipeline activity going on. The natural gas situation is, I think, creating a lot of opportunities, both on the chemical and the power side. So that looks -- that, to me, looks positive. And we're also seeing that trend elsewhere around the world in general in terms of natural gas, as well as basic liquids. Asia Pacific was also up for the full year. Latin America was up for the full year. I mean, we all expected Europe to have a tough year, and it did. Europe was down. But I think we're seeing some basic, I would say, stabilization, not a consistent, yet, stabilization in Europe, but a basic stabilization. We're seeing some of our quicker-turn businesses, while they're not at the pre-2012 levels, I would say they're getting stabilized in that area. The Middle East was down, but I think we've talked about that in terms of large projects. So in the context of the full year, we see a lot of regions and industries, I think, in good shape. And when you look at the macro dynamics, as we've indicated, we had, obviously, the elections in the U.S. You had things going on in China which have now, I think, sorted themselves out in terms of the nuclear business. The first nuclear power plant has been granted construction since the moratorium has been lifted, so that's good news there. And we're seeing other activities on re-rates and upgrades on the nuclear side. The Latin America had several things going on, and we're starting to see some pickup there in offshore activity in Latin America. So we're seeing some good, I think, basic signs. The distributor business is a business that we look at Q4. The distributor business in the FCD business was up, both in Q4 and the full year. And that's one of the leading kind of indicators for us overall in the business.","Mark A. Blinn","So Scott, just a point of reference here. When we talked in early 2009, when folks were very concerned that it was going to drop precipitously, we said we see these projects and they're going to move forward, and they did. So we have the experience to know when you get to this level of investment, the pre-FEED and FEED, and you understand what's underlying these projects and their stories around the world. In Kuwait, they need clean fuels. In Brazil, they need to monetize the reserves that they've acquired. They've just had a lot of projects that they had to digest them. We know these things are going to move forward. From my standpoint, and I talk to customers, and one of the things that's typically at the first part of the discussion are the projects they're going to move forward with. But keep in mind, whether it comes in Q -- from our perspective or theirs, Q3 of 2012, Q3 of 2013, Q2, it doesn't matter necessarily from their perspective. We've been following some of these projects for years, but we do know they need to come online. I think the other thing to the point earlier was that we do -- we tend to spend about 80% of our time talking about 20% of our business, which are these big projects. Focusing on that 80%, the aftermarket business, which has grown; the run rate business, which we've seen grown as we grow our presence, as we continue to execute. I mean, one of the things we saw was good improvement in IPD. That gives us confidence as well. So as we're sitting here right now, we see a Europe which is at low levels. There's no guarantee it couldn't get worse, but it's at historic low levels from our business. And you've seen the impact over the last couple of quarters of the uncertainty in the United States around the political environment and what happened in China as well. So I think a lot of that is what gives us from where we are right now. And what we're seeing now is, obviously, we have sequester coming up. And so there's still some uncertainty and you still -- if you talk to CEOs and you listen to their conference calls, they're waiting to see what happens. But for the most part, we know there is demand for energy. There is demand for energy infrastructure. We know the refineries are running flat out. They need support. So that's what gives us confidence. It's very much on the ground and communications as well with customers.","James Foung - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, that helps me greatly. So if we were to look at, though, because you were both -- we're all talking about bookings here, so -- and those bookings kind of start to roll through in the second half of this year and on into '14. Would it be fair to say that, whereas 2012 was a year that was kind of above your targeted organic sales growth and margins generally flattish, that 2013, because the bookings were more selective and what have you, kind of first 2, 3 quarters maybe, the organic is maybe a little bit more muted and making essentially 2013 more of a margin-driven earnings, and then kind of things go back to top line back in '14. Is that a reasonable sketch?","Mark A. Blinn","That's well put, Scott. I mean, I think the discussion is not only about bookings, but quality of bookings. And the discussion is also how we take those higher-quality bookings and put them through our facilities, and this is from order intake to cash flow. So we're working on the whole value stream. Now that doesn't suggest, in any way, that we're giving up top line growth because we absolutely didn't in aftermarket. We want to continue -- I mean, those are good rates of growth for the aftermarket business. We want to continue to do it on the run rate. But I think what we'll start to see during the course of this year is the benefits of the One Flowserve initiative, the benefits of the selectivity that we've talked about and some of the focus, the benefits of the improvement in IPD. I think when we were sitting here a year, a year-plus ago, I said with IPD, it's a little frustrating. It's taken longer to get it started. But clearly, we've gotten some very good traction on that, and I think we can start to approach our objectives. So that is a good way of putting it. But what I don't want to leave on the table in this discussion is the fact that we are absolutely focused on growing our top line. But we will continue to do it selective. We could have grown it, even in the fourth quarter, at higher levels without selectivity. We just don't think that's necessary now like we did in 2010 and early -- in the first half of 2011 to load our factories.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think I'll start with Tom Pajonas. Can you give us some more color around on-time delivery, working capital management, reduced cost of quality and low-cost sourcing that you've quoted as improving? Perhaps, some numbers around on-time delivery or some examples? So just some color about the effect that, that's having.","Thomas L. Pajonas","I mean, if you look at margins, there's 2 or 3 things that we constantly work on, and that's also part of the overall One Flowserve initiative and the customer focus initiative. And it's really quality and on-time delivery. We've made, I would say, significant and good progress across our businesses in terms of on-time delivery. And again, our -- that has a lot to do with not only cycle time, but this meeting the commitments. And it also has to do with throughput in the operation, which helps out on the working capital. So we've improved on that over 2011, and we'll continue to work on that. Relative to COPQ, which is the cost of poor quality, where we look at warranty, we look at rework, we look at liquidated damages and other things pertaining to the execution, that is the second core of our business, along with the overall scrap in, as well as supplier, cost of poor quality. And we have metrics set up across all of our businesses. We continue and have made progress from '11 to '12 in that particular area, and we're going to continue to drive that forward over the next 2 to 3 years. So on-time delivery, COPQ are 2 key indicators that not only help with our overall customer focus initiative, they basically help with the throughput through the entire operation and allow us to execute a better overall in the business.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Are there any kind of numbers you could put around like the improvement in on-time delivery? I know COPQ might be a little harder to quantify for us, but has on-time delivery gone from 94 to 96 or...","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, I want to kind of stay away from giving specifics because, obviously, there's some competitive numbers in there. But I would say somewhere north -- certainly, somewhere north of 90% is where we're targeting. And obviously, we want our on-time delivery to be 100% if we can, just like the way we look at safety. But we're driving it through these -- the entire supply chain, and you just need to know that we know where our suppliers are. We know who the good suppliers are. As we go into countries and we do low-cost sourcing, we spend a lot of time on the deliveries of those suppliers through the supply chain, through our engineering, through bill of material generation, through our manufacturing facilities. We know where the pinch points are, and we look at the cycle time. And those 2 go in unison. The lead times, as well as the on-time delivery, will always be, again, drivers for us as we move forward.","Mark A. Blinn","Nathan, we still have room for improvement, though. I mean, that should come out in this discussion, is that we're still working on improving our on-time delivery.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And if I could just get one in on the M&A environment. You seem to be talking a little more constructively about the possibility of getting deals done. Can you comment on what the pipeline is like? I know prices out in the market seem to be pretty steep at the moment. And how you're thinking about that?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, I'll start with the second part of the question. In terms of price, we think about returns to our shareholders. And so what can we realize in terms of the value? How quickly can we generate the cash flow? It's really an IRR. So if you -- if there's a business you can't realize a lot of benefits and synergies out of, then that's going to command typically a lower price than one that fits right in and you can leverage up across your sales organization. But I think what you're seeing is we're sticking to what we talked about in terms of a bolt-on strategy or a business, and that really goes to good strategic fit, but also reasonable integration risk as well. And we were very focused internally last year. Having said that, if we would have seen an opportunity -- a bolt-on opportunity that could have delivered good value to our shareholders, we would have done it. We just didn't at that point in time. And the pipeline continues. You'll know -- you typically often see the big ones, but those tend to be less bolt-ons because they're out in the markets than anything else. But we're very focused on making sure we keep certainly a reasonable pipeline of them, like we did in Lawrence. That's been a very good acquisition for us. We've been able to integrate that very well and really leverage that business tremendously. So we'll continue to do that. I think the one thing, though, is we feel, sitting here this year versus last year and even the year before, that we have a better platform to load whatever inorganic opportunity we do find onto.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research Partners.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just first on, I guess, aftermarket, so just kind of the outlook for 2013. Maybe you could talk about how much of the growth you're expecting is just from general market growth versus actual share gains? And maybe could you just give us a sense of how penetrated you think you actually are on the customer base and where it could go?","Mark A. Blinn","On the aftermarket side?","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes.","Mark A. Blinn","There's still plenty of opportunity on the customer side. I think what you've seen in the growth over the last couple of years are the benefit of our QRCs and our sales network, and some of our ISG strategies have taken hold as well. Now the Dow Benelux example is a good one, where we basically took the business, for the lack of a better term, from our customer, and took over the service. There's still plenty of opportunities like those out there. And so as we look forward, there is -- I think there is an element, as Tom talked about, around deferred maintenance, particularly what you saw in U.S. refineries. That's going to represent an opportunity. Consistently, as we get through -- even in the power industry, we saw a good aftermarket business. But as they go through and make decisions around what type of feedstock they're going to use to generate power, if it's going to be combined cycle in many areas, that's going to be newbuild and that will feed into our OBD business. But if they're going to continue with the fossil, oftentimes, those things are -- or need to be upgraded and re-rated, same thing on the nuclear side as well. I mean, the nuclear occurrence was almost 2 years ago, and you're just starting to see the world start to emerge from that. But the fact is, those facilities need to be kept up and maintained. So I think there's typically a story around that. I also think that we get more flags on the ground in some of the strategic regions, as I've talked to you before. We would like to see a mature aftermarket delivery capability like we have in the Gulf Coast region in the United States and other parts of the world. We've continued to be focused on that. And so that's going to represent growth opportunity as well. So I think there's -- most of the growth that you've seen has really been around our intentional strategies that we'll continue to execute on.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Would you be able to maybe quantify, of the outlook you have for '13, how much of that growth is being driven by the assumption that you get more penetration, Mark?","Mark A. Blinn","I think -- I mean, as we look at 2013 in general, we think we're going to -- we expect to continue to execute on our aftermarket business and our run rate business. And to a certain degree, we see some of these projects coming in, in the latter half of the year. And so I think, if you kind of break it down, no, we're not going to give bookings guidance certainly within the aftermarket run rate business or anything like that, but I think that's a general tone as to what we see. And it certainly supports what we talked about in terms of anticipated growth. You've seen good consistent growth in the aftermarket business even despite currency headwinds.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Sorry, I would just add to what Mark is saying, just some items. A lot of coal to gas conversions taking place, pipeline upgrades, you have the nuclear re-rates and upgrades, as Mark has mentioned. We are seeing in China, India, in Russia this, I would say, environmental issues coming to the surface, which may mean changes to the existing plants, which generally translates into some aftermarket work there. And we have continued to add quick response centers in the -- over the world through 2012. We've added one in Russia and Madagascar, India, as well as in China.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And if I may, just actually one more. So just on the other 20% of the business, I know we focused in on a lot. But I'm just curious, so of the opportunities that you guys have, so obviously a lot of petchem being discussed, LNG in the U.S. and some select projects abroad, upstream oil and gas refining, Middle East, South America, how would you rank these projects as far as consumers of actual pumps and valves? Do some consume more than others? Does one segment offer a bigger opportunity relative to the other set? And really, even on the aftermarket, do some of these offer more aftermarket tail than others? If you could address that, that would be great.","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. I mean, typically, oil and gas, chemical offer a lot of aftermarket opportunity just because of the types of materials that are going through it. The water industry tends to be less burdened with aftermarket because it tends to be lower RPM, and you don't have a caustic material that's going through it. So I think that's one thing. But as we look at the opportunities in terms of OE, the 20% of the business overall, obviously, a big petrochemical facility, chemical facility, refinery have a substantial amount of our products on them. And it depends on the size and scope and the barrels per day that they're going to put out. And even if you look across the power industry in terms of the availability, the spectrum kind of goes from combined cycle. It does have our products, but not as much all the way over to the nuclear side, where they tend to be certainly higher priced and much more critical. So think about the critical and the pressure in terms of the application and the size of the facility, and that gives you an idea. And so as you look at -- what we like is we like infrastructure that's permanent. So a pipeline is permanent. A refinery is permanent unless they shut it down. Oftentimes, upstream production facilities can certainly move around, as you see with frac-ing pumps. But when we look at certainly those opportunities out there, there are plenty of downstream opportunities around the world in the Middle East. I mentioned earlier, in Kuwait, they need to go through a rebuild, a newbuild and an upgrade effort. And upgrades can be as extensive as a new facility, or expansions can as well. And also, you see -- we see trends up in the power industry as well, so -- and pipelines do as well. Pipelines are fairly extensive. They have quite a few pumps on them. They have valves on them as well. When you look at our Valbart valve, that helps secure a pipeline. These are critical applications. They do have aftermarket that attaches to it. So these can be substantial opportunities. And what you're seeing, even relative to 6, 7 years ago, is these facilities are getting bigger and more complex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Radigan from KeyBanc.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Mark, your point on the project business is well taken. But the commentary from the E&C seems to be getting increasingly bullish around the oil and gas cycle, particularly in North America. And I would just be interested in your thoughts in terms of the duration of this upswing when it finally does materialize because there's some pretty lofty numbers, I think, being thrown out there as to how long a tail this is. So I mean, how are you guys looking at it?","Mark A. Blinn","We tend -- when we tend to look at that opportunity, I mean, around 3, maybe up to -- extending out to 5, depending on how they stage out. But when they -- certainly, when they come back, that's the way we look at the opportunity when these things come back around.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then...","Mark A. Blinn","And that's -- by the way, that's how we're planning our business. So when we get together on Analyst Day and when we looked, even when we started talking 2 years ago, that's how we think of our business. It's a great question because that's how we have to think about our business.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then several of the western E&Cs are already talking about lining up resources for this upcoming cycle. Maybe a 2-part question. First, is that starting to have the favorable impact on project pricing that you would expect as you start -- as you're quoting these projects kind of in the pre-FEED timeframe? And then how does that impact your ability to find and retain engineers in that sort of high-demand environment, given that's part of the value add for you guys?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, that's -- let me take the second one. That's a great question because if you drive in Houston, you'll see billboards advertising for engineering and engineers. So it is tied in. I think we've talked about on these calls before, I mean, we've had a fairly -- a very intentional program around engineering recruitment, engineering retention in our business. We've taken a lot of our engineering capacity and put it in engineering centers in India and China so that we have that continuity and that, really, that leverage capability there. So we've certainly been looking at the resources. Going back to your prior question, what you tend to see in our industry -- and the pricing was its roughest in 2010 and early 2011. And then what you see in our industry is capacity starts to rationalize, to a certain degree. You saw a couple of transactions with some of our competitors where there was much more discipline in terms of the way they took the projects. Then as the projects come online, that will tend to drive incremental pricing. And then as capacity becomes constrained, our industry will tend to start using that pricing to rationalize their capacity like you saw really towards the tail end of the last market move in 2008. But again, if we see something like that again, that will be fine and well, although there was certainly a downside to that. When we look at our planning, we don't look and need or expect that type of environment to achieve our objectives. Really, what we want to do is make sure we've got an efficient platform, that we're disciplined. And then as we start to see price not only from the market, but for our ability to execute, we think that's very important because the other thing that can help with price is your ability to drive down cycle times in terms of manufacturing. So we're trying to position ourselves different from where we were before to really start to capitalize on price before it just becomes a market capacity constraint issue. So what you'll see is, as these things start to come online, it'll start to -- you'll start to see pricing improve beyond just the discipline that's come around. And in terms of our preparedness, we're always wanting to get better prepared, but we certainly think we've got the capacity in place to take advantage of these opportunities over that period of time. We'll stay focused on making sure we've got the personnel and the engineers in place to do that as well. And Tom will stay continued focus to make sure that we drive better throughput, as I mentioned on the question earlier, improve on-time delivery, do all those things that can help us capture as much of that as we can. And then when that occurs, and that is 20% of our business, start to reap the benefits from aftermarket.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, and I would add. I mean, one thing that the engineering staff wants to see is they want to see you making investments in your business in terms of technology, and we've done that in terms of research and technology. So we keep things state-of-the-art in terms of that perspective. And we also do a lot of investment in engineering systems, database systems, build materials, 3D modeling. And that also keeps us at the forefront of the technology, which our engineers, again, they respond to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jake Robinson (sic) [Chase Jacobson] from William Blair.","Chase Jacobson - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","It's Chase Jacobson from William Blair. Just wanted to follow up on the revenue questions. So it sounds like you had pretty good conviction that you can hit the mid-single digit revenue growth target with aftermarkets and small- and medium-sized projects. Does that mean that if some of the large projects come in, in the back half of the year, that there could be upside to that? Or do those projects really not contribute to revenue until some time next year?","Michael S. Taff","Yes, Chase, Mike. Yes, those are mainly 2014 revenues. We'll see some bookings, we think, that will come to market in the second half of the year, but those really don't come into meaningful revenues until '14 and '15.","Chase Jacobson - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on the cash flow. Really strong free cash flow in the quarter. Looking out through 2013, is that -- I mean, I don't know, I doubt the fourth quarter level is sustainable. But is it going to go back to the normal seasonality, where it's kind of lower in the first half and then picks up beginning in the second half? Or is there more room to go on things like inventory in the near term? Any clarity on that would be great.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, there is. And let me just clarify on your previous question. From that revenue, we really see that revenues as '14. We'll see the bookings in '13, but the revenue is really more '14-related.","Michael S. Taff","No, I think there is. I mean, we've still got more work to do on cash flows. We've identified the targets and kind of announced publicly what those targets are. But there's still work to do. We've identified where we need to make improvements. Most of those are process-related and procedure, as well as changing culture in the organization.","Operator","We have Sid Panda on line from RBC Capital Markets.","Sid Panda - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The first question was regarding the DSOs and the inventory turns. Where do you see slack in your operations right now that can help drive the improvement there?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Well, overall, I mean, we ended the year at 75 days DSO and I think around 3.2x turn, and we've indicated our targets. We want to drive that to the -- the DSO to the mid-upper 60s. So that continues to be a multiyear process. And so it's a marathon, not a sprint at all. But I'd say, it's around the world. It's a number of our operations. And also, again, as I've indicated with Chase, we've brought some consulting firms in last year, middle of last year, did a very detailed analysis across the globe and identified process and procedure changes we need to make. And we're in the process of implementing those. So I think the identification of it is kind of the easy part. The more difficult and the long-term piece is actually implementing those changes.","Sid Panda - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the second question was around bookings and, in particular, in FCD. That has seen bookings going down for like 3 subsequent quarters now. How should we think about booking trends in FCD in 2013 and the overall booking trends?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I think as we'd talked about earlier, I mean, FCD has a high exposure to Europe. So a lot of what you saw in terms of their book -- year-over-year bookings decline from 2011 to 2012 was the headwinds that you saw in Europe, which we, again, expect to stabilize. So if you look at '12, there were other things that were bringing bookings up in FCD. It was just primarily offset by what you saw in Europe as well. I think the other thing, as we look out into 2013, we made the Valbart acquisition, which has high exposure to oil and gas. We've got that integrated and working the way we want it. And so we expect to see opportunities in that as well. So that's what gives us encouragement around the FCD business.","Sid Panda - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So for 2013, I guess, would it be fair to say that the bookings growth would be led by the Engineered Products, or were the highest organically, followed by IPD and then followed by Lawrence?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, and we don't want to break it down individually. But what we're focused on is really driving growth in all of them, and so -- I mean, I think when we look at it, we don't want to go certainly one by one. Now EPD, both the bookings growth will depend on the timing and the nature of those projects. And to a certain degree, it's revenues as well, depending on when those projects come in because they do have percentage of completion. So they could pick up some revenue. But for the most part, the run rate business tends to be shorter cycle.","Sid Panda - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just because of the way -- and this is the last question. Just because of the way the FCD bookings were sort of down for that first 3 quarters, would it be fair to say that for the mid-single digit growth in 2013, that would be the lowest contributor there, the FCD segment?","Mark A. Blinn","No. Again, we don't want to parse them out individually because, keep in mind, we do leverage across these divisions, and these segments as well. So they are participating on oil and gas projects, along with EPD. So no, we certainly don't want to look at it that way. Of course, their bookings growth can be different because of either projects that came through from one period to the next. I mean, if you look in the compares in FCD, they had a large nuclear project in 2011, about $50 million, which is big, that they didn't see in 2012. And also, they saw a fairly large oil and gas project in 2011 which was very competitive. So I don't want to get into too much detail around each one of the segments. But the point is, is we're focused on driving growth, and we've talked about the mid-single digit over on that growth business. What that depends on is continuing to drive aftermarket growth, focusing on the run rate business and, to a certain degree, seeing some of the benefits of these projects towards the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","One question. Is there any particular part of your business that you feel as though, at this time, you don't have the adequate capacity, given the end markets that you're seeing going forward? Or better yet, the CapEx that you're sort of providing, can you sort of break down where that's targeted?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, the answer to your first question around products is we think we certainly have available capacity. Now some of our facilities, even at this day, are full. But we -- if you've -- we've talked about our lead products, secondary product strategy. We've been able to move a lot of that manufacturing and leveraging other facilities around the world. So if you would have followed our business build 7, 10 years ago, it was pretty much -- it was fairly product-specific to a plant. We've moved a lot of that over the last 3 or 4 years to be able to develop those capabilities in emerging parts of the world, not only for low-cost manufacturing, but those products are being used in the local markets. So we do -- as I mentioned earlier, we do feel like we have capacity and the ability to manage our capacity now and really with the opportunities we see over the next couple of years. Second part of your question, where our CapEx has gone, a big part last year was in Brazil as we opened that facility and we continued to build in China to serve that local market, and in India as well for products for that local market and to support our operations around the world. We've invested in QRCs. We've also invested some of that capital in R&D and systems to really support growth. So a lot of the CapEx has been growth. And as Mike talked about, we run 50 plus or minus on maintenance CapEx. But also keep in mind, some of that is updating some of our machinery. And if you look at some machinery that it's replacing, they tend to be highly manual, like a manual lathe. And there is -- the significance of that is it's labor-intensive. It is actually subject to a lot of rework because it's -- there's human activity in terms of the precision of the machining. And we've migrated a lot of this maintenance CapEx over to computerized machinery, which is just that. It has lower setup times. So when we get into cycle times in our business, we think about the setup times for castings. It has lower setup times, lower margin of error, higher precision. And so part of that maintenance CapEx is really to position us for the future, as well. So that's how we spend our CapEx.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Mark, can you comment just a little bit -- I mean, that's extremely helpful, and I'm glad you went into the castings. Can you go into pipeline the same way, of how you were -- I mean, we're all seeing the amount and the amount of backlog or the talks that we're hearing on the pipeline side. You guys do have exposure on the pump and the valve size for pipes on both liquids and gas. Are you set up appropriately that if this long-haul pipeline comes through and others do start flowing, are you ready for that? That buildup, that could be a real nice run rate for the next few years in pipeline.","Mark A. Blinn","Absolutely. We're ready and looking forward to it. As a matter of fact, it's been happening, so we've been participating in the last year on some of these pipeline opportunities. We like the business. As I made the comment earlier, fixed infrastructure is good for us because, if you think about the customer, they have to optimize it because they can't move it. And so -- and it's commissioned, and it's there and it's permanent. So where they need to spend their time once it's on the ground and running is, how do I improve it? That's our aftermarket strategy. If you look at equipment that can be moved to its next marginal use, that's not as good on the aftermarket side. So we like the pipelines because they don't move.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our allotted time.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche. You may begin.","John E. Roueche","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in our call to discuss the financial results of Flowserve Corporation for the first quarter of 2013, which we announced yesterday through our press release and Form 10-Q filing. Joining me on the call this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Taff, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Mullin, our Director of Investor Relations. Following our prepared comments this morning, we will open up the call for your questions, and directions will be given at that time.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call is being webcast and an earnings slide presentation is available, both of which are accessible through our website at www.flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section. An audio replay will also be available on our website in approximately 2 hours following the end of today's live call. This replay and the slide presentation will remain on the website for a period of time over the coming weeks.","Finally, please note that today's call and the associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements that are based upon information available to management as of April 25, 2013.

Each of these documents can be found on Flowserve's website under the Investor Relations section. And please note, except to the extent required by applicable law, Flowserve undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to publicly update any of today's forward-looking statements.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.","Mark A. Blinn","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with the operating and financial results for the first quarter. This performance highlights our employees' continued dedication to discipline growth, operational excellence and cost control, which provided solid margins and produced earnings leveraged from all segments. Together, these factors enable us to deliver on our commitments to both customers and shareholders. Earnings of $2.01 per share this quarter were solid, and I am proud of the operating improvements we have made and continue to make, which positions us to deliver on our full year targets.","First quarter bookings of approximately $1.2 billion were down slightly year-over-year, reflecting a continued focus on run rate and aftermarket business. We had strong sequential improvement as bookings improved by 9.9%, despite the continuation of macro uncertainty, in particular, in Europe. Our solid bookings demonstrate the benefit of our diverse end market and geographic exposures. Similar to the last quarter, the aftermarket business remained somewhat muted, as some refiners continued to defer maintenance to keep their operations running to take advantage of current strong margins. The original equipment business continued this quarter with smaller-sized projects, and we continued to see the larger project activity progressing towards the final investment decision, which we expect to begin in the latter half of 2013.","The solid margin performance this quarter from each division was largely the internal return generated on last year's internal focus in our One Flowserve initiative, which leveraged process expertise across the business. Tom will cover the operating improvement progress. But in short, this performance gives me confidence that our strategic focus on profitably growing the business while simultaneously controlling cost, will continue to deliver long-term value for shareholders. I have previously mentioned and can again assure you that opportunities remain available inside the company to continue growing and improving operations, and we're eager to deliver them.","Overall, I am encouraged by the long-term prospects of the aftermarket business as we continue to execute our end-user strategies. We have typically delivered consistent growth in bookings and sales over several years. The recurring nature, stable growth and solid margin profile provide a solid foundation for Flowserve.","Looking at SG&A, adjusting for the discreet items we disclosed in yesterday's press release, SG&A dollars were essentially flat year-over-year and declined nicely as a percentage of sales. While we are not forecasting flat SG&A for the full year, we do remain actively focused on controlling cost and fully intend to generate earnings leverage from this expense.","Looking briefly at segment performance. EPD's gross margin improvement reflects our disciplined project acquisition process, which has steadily improved the quality of backlog in this traditionally late cycle business.","IPD's operational excellence focus has delivered solid margin improvement with notable year-over-year gross margin improvement. We remain committed to growing IPD's operating margins to 14% to 15% by 2015.","FCD's solid operating performance continued to demonstrate its consistency. In this quarter, it also delivered strong bookings and revenue growth. FCD's results this quarter included some immediate gains from the Indian joint venture transactions, as we continued to optimize our asset portfolio. But the real value was strategic localization, as we retained key valve products and facilities in the significant and growing market, and sold nonstrategic assets.","Controlling our own destiny in this important market, focused on the oil and gas business with solid growth opportunities ahead, should benefit Flowserve's future. Internal transactions are often as important as external ones. And we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize the existing asset portfolio in addition to targeting technology and geographic additions through strategic bolt-on acquisitions.","I'm convinced that our operations are performing at an improving level that should allow us to meet or exceed customer expectations. The foundation we've set with our internal improvements should position us well when the large project activity is expected to begin in the second half of this year, particularly in North America. Bottom line, we remain confident in the medium to long-term prospects for energy infrastructure end markets.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2013, this quarter's performance is encouraging and highlights the improvements the operations team is making. We still have significant opportunities within our core markets, operations, cost structure and existing global footprint. Although we continue to experience some near-term uncertainty in certain markets, we do expect to gain momentum this year as we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our business. We built momentum in 2012 and are off to a better-than-expected start this year. Our goal remains to deliver value to both our customers and shareholders.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas L. Pajonas","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark discussed, the internal focus on operational improvements we made last year built momentum in the business and underscored my expectations for capturing additional opportunities for improvement during 2013.","Operationally, the first quarter was solid, as we continued to focus on the customer, on-time delivery, quality and supplier development. Our One Flowserve initiatives have leveraged global competencies across our operating units in project management, low-cost sourcing and information technology, to name a few, and opportunities for further improvement remain.","The progress we've seen in the gross and operating margins in EPD and IPD is encouraging, as we've worked on increasing the efficiency of our factories and look to be well positioned for the latter cycle projects, as they work through the bidding phase and near final investment decision. We will maintain our discipline and selectivity in our project pursue teams, and we expect to see continued improvement in the quality of our backlog.","And FCD, it remains focused on top line growth, delivering solid bookings and revenue growth in the first quarter, while achieving high levels of operating performance. Our strong team of black belts and green belts remains deployed throughout the organization to further drive efficiency and cost improvements. SG&A leverage remains a constant focus as evidenced by the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue this quarter, excluding AIL transaction cost of $1.7 million in 2013 and the net gain on the sale of our real assets of $10.4 million in 2012.","Let me now turn to our markets and outlook. Overall, we were pleased with the quarter's book-to-bill of 1.09. As Mark mentioned, we saw solid sequential bookings growth of 9.9%. As expected, small-to-midsized projects continue to support our OE bookings, as we have yet to see the release of larger-sized OE projects. We do see them progressing, however, as our work continued with the EMCs in our customers in helping progress these projects through the FEED to the bidding stage.","Aftermarket bookings grew nicely at 3.4%, or 4% on a constant currency basis, despite continued maintenance deferrals in some markets. Opportunities across our markets were mixed, as stronger activity in the general industries and water markets partially offset softness in the oil and gas, power and chemical markets. Regional strength in North and Latin America partially offset slower activity in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East\/Africa.","Turning to our end markets. Saudi Arabia, China and India continued driving investments in new refinery projects. Brazil is driving investments in offshore production, while North America unconventional development continues to create pipeline and downstream opportunities. New chemical construction continues, primarily in the Middle East and China, while ethylene and fertilizer projects in the U.S. are moving forward on the tailwind of low-cost natural gas and available reserves.","China continues to invest in coal to gas, and coal to liquid technologies as part of their strategic energy plans. We believe refining, petrochemical and chemical plants will continue vertical integration due to the proximity of the FEED stock and the desire of the customers to keep more of the total margin in country.","This is the development in countries like Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Kuwait and Russia. Global power markets remain competitive and continued to be impacted by the slow economic growth and post-Fukushima effects. Fossil activities, primarily located in China, India and Russia, particularly on the supercritical side, driven by the need for reduced emissions and efficiency increases. New capacity, nuclear power opportunities are mainly occurring in China, India, Russia and Eastern Europe, while upgrades and rerates continue in our developed regions due to the strong economics these projects provide. We expect China to release additional nuclear plants this year. Natural gas reserves and environmental policies have created additional opportunities for combined cycle power plants, particularly in developed regions, like the U.S. where older coal-fired plants continue to be shut down or converted to gas. Finally, solar thermal remains a relatively small but rapidly growing market.","As many of you know, our water markets have been relatively flat over the last couple of years. We delivered double-digit growth in our water bookings in the first quarter and see indications that some desalination projects are moving forward, increasing our optimism for this market.","So in summary, our solid first quarter start sets the foundation as we look to build momentum through the year and position the business to capitalize on opportunities we expect in the second half of the year.","With that overview, let me now turn it over to Mike Taff.","Michael S. Taff","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Following Mark and Tom's operational overview of the first quarter and business outlook for the remainder of the year, let me discuss in greater detail our financial results. While we encountered $0.24 per share of currency headwind this quarter and experienced a less than a complete recovery in our markets as Tom outlined, we did begin 2013 with a very solid first quarter.","Our sales of over $1.1 billion represented a 2% year-over-year increase, or almost 3% on a constant currency basis, and consisted of approximately 58% original equipment and 42% aftermarket, essentially the same mix as last year's quarter. I was particularly pleased that gross margin improved approximately 60 basis points to 34% as compared to last year's first quarter, and an increase of 70 basis points, sequentially. This level is the highest we've obtained since the first quarter of 2011.","While we were impacted by some remaining legacy backlog shipments, the margin improvement we delivered was aided by revenue flow through and is further validation of our project selection discipline, operational improvements and ongoing aftermarket focus. EPD's gross margin of 34.9% was the highest in 2 years and a sequential improvement of 130 basis points. We are clearly pleased with this trend, although we do expect it to be dampened somewhat in the 2013 second quarter, as we expect an increased percentage of OE activity creating a mix shift.","Turning to SG&A. It's not an easy compare. As reported, SG&A to sales increased as compared to last year's first quarter by 80 basis points to 21.4%. However, last year's $10.4 million gain on sale of operating assets lowered that period's SG&A amount and approximately $1.7 million of JV-related transaction expenses increased the 2013 expense. Excluding these items, SG&A dollars were flat and as a percentage of sales, it improved year-over-year by 40 basis points. Considering the Indian joint venture transaction occurred in March, we expect about $2 million of integration and related cost to be recognized in the second quarter within the Flow Control segment.","As we indicated in our recent Analyst Day, our long-term goal is to achieve recurring SG&A as a percentage of sales, to be consistently in the 18% range. We've made good progress annually over the last few years and the opportunities clearly remain. We will continue to dedicate significant attention to this opportunity over the next few years.","Operating margins were exceptionally strong at 15.5%. But clearly, this level benefited from the net gains associated with the Indian joint venture transactions. Excluding these transaction gains and expenses from both the 2012 and 2013 first quarter results, operating margins for Q1 would have been 13.1%, representing an 80 basis point improvement over the adjusted 2012 period.","A clear positive is that our recurring operating income improvement is being driven by the business as opposed to just cost control. It means the improved gross margin we've recognized is also creating leverage further down the income statement.","Below operating income, foreign currency had a negative impact of approximately $10.8 million. It had an outsized EPS impact of roughly $0.18 per share, as the Venezuela currency devaluation did not receive a tax benefit.","Other notable FX impacts came from the stronger peso and weaker yen on the respective local balance sheets. While we do not have any FX impact in our original guidance, the net gain on the Indian joint venture transaction made up for both of these below-the-line currency impact and the $0.06 experienced above the line.","Our tax rate for the 2013 first quarter also was outside our guidance range, coming in at approximately 33%. In addition to the after-tax impact on the Venezuela currency devaluation being the same as the below-the-line pretax amount, we also had a substantial tax impact from the Indian joint venture gains. Going forward, we expect to return to a more normalized tax rate of 30% for the remaining quarters of 2013.","Turning to cash flows. The first quarter, seasonally, tends to be a major usage of cash, and that was the case again in 2013. We used about $108 million in our operations during the quarter and another $212 million for share repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures and debt payments. We did generate a positive cash inflow from the Indian joint venture transactions netting to approximately $36 million.","We also accessed our corporate revolver for working capital during the quarter and ended the quarter with about $150 million outstanding, as it is certainly a cost-effective source of funds. Similar to our earnings profile, we fully expect this quarter to be the trough in cash flows for the year and anticipate a much stronger performance during the remainder of the year. As we continue to discuss, our focus on cash flows and working capital will remain a priority, working towards our goal of consistently generating annual free cash flow near our net income level. Executing on our strategy to efficiently deploy the balance sheet and return value to our shareholders will remain a priority.","As we previously discussed, our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1x to 2x. During the quarter, we continued to actively repurchase shares amounting to about $156 million. We expect to effectively complete last year's $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter, and we then plan to reinstate our policy of annually returning 40% to 50% of our 2-year average net income to our owners through dividends and stock buybacks. At quarter end, with our recently replenished share repurchase authorization, we had authority for about $687 million remaining under our current buyback program.","Turning to working capital. We saw some improvement in the 2013 first quarter compared to the 2012 first quarter with the reduction in DSO by about a day to 87 days. Inventory turns were essentially flat with the 2012 first quarter, and our past-due backlog decreased in total and as a percentage of backlog.","Again, seasonally, these only modest improvements are not surprising, and we still are very much focused on our working capital goal of mid-60s DSO and inventory turns of 4x to 4.5x. We believe these targets are achievable with our continued effort.","As I discussed last quarter, I'm confident that we are taking the necessary steps to achieve this level and we expect continued progress to occur in 2013.","Moving to our EPS guidance and outlook for the remainder of the year. We are reaffirming our 2013 earnings guidance of $9.60 to $10.60 per share. This guidance utilizes our reported earnings this quarter, considering the unforecasted items largely offset each other. We also continue to expect a mid-single-digit range of sales growth on a neutral FX basis, and believe we are off to a solid start with the improvement we realized in the 2013 first quarter.","Turning to our spending priorities. As I alluded to earlier, we expect to spend about $150 million in share repurchases during the second quarter. Importantly, we are committed to investing in our business to deliver profitable growth and solid organic returns and still expect 2013 CapEx to be in the $120 million to $130 million range to further increase our worldwide capabilities. We believe our capital allocation approach, combined with the expected growth from our existing businesses, as well as a potential for strategic bolt-ons, will provide Flowserve shareholders with solid returns over time.","Other uses of cash we expect this year include pension contributions and scheduled debt repayments. But even combined, this amount is modest in comparison to the other priorities.","Returning quickly to our earnings guidance. As I indicated in our last call, we continue to expect earnings to be second-half weighted. We saw it in the first quarter and continue to expect that our quarterly results will reflect traditional seasonality.","As you may have seen, we recently filed our proxy statement for the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Assuming shareholders vote to approve the request to increase our authorized share count, I would expect that at our next conference call, we will have implemented the planned 3-for-1 stock split with the per share metrics adjusted accordingly.","Lastly, I'd like to thank all of you again who attended our Analyst Day in New York City in March. For those of you who were unable to attend and have an interest, the presentation is still available on our website.","In the weeks ahead, we are planning a fairly active Investor Relations schedule. We'll be in New York for investor meetings. We have plans to host investors here as well in our offices, and we are committed to a number of conferences over the next few months. We very much value our time with the financial community and our shareholders and anticipate there will be several venues available to you in the weeks ahead.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jay.","John E. Roueche","Thank you, Mike. Dawn, we have now concluded this morning's prepared remarks. If you are ready, we would now like to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just on the commentary on the mix in second quarter. I'm just trying to square that up. The EPD had a pretty substantial shift towards aftermarket bookings in Q1 by about 900 bps, which generally, I'd assume, would be a positive for margin. But I'm trying to square that with your commentary on mix shift being negative to margin in Q2.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, the -- I mean, if you look, first of all, year-over-year in terms of the mix shift, that can be and it was a handful of projects that were there last year in Q1 that may not have been there. So I mean, don't read too much into that. Really, the theme around EPD and the overall business is the underlying run rate business has seen steady growth, including aftermarket.","Now to your question around the second quarter. If you look historically, Q2, and to a greater degree, Q4, tend to be when a lot of our projects go out the door, a lot of the OE. These are some of the larger, longer cycle. So while aftermarket remains somewhat steady, although you do see higher levels at the end of the year as many of our foreign customers try to get all that MRO aftermarket in before the end of the year. Because keep in mind, in Mexico, in certain parts of the year, they rebudget every year. So there is a little bit of seasonality to that market. But for the most part, you see that kind of run through steadily. What will change from quarter-to-quarter is going to be the number of projects that are shipped out. And historically, we've always seen that in Q4, a lot of projects go out the door. What that means is in Q1, there's fewer projects that goes. So it tends to shift back to more aftermarket mix and then tilt towards the OE side in the second quarter. That help?","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, it does. So we should expect Q3 this year, do you think, to be the highest margin quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","I'm sorry, what was your...","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Should we expect Q3 then, to be the highest margin quarter, kind of given what your backlog looks like and kind of timing of shipments then?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, Charlie, I don't want to start pegging margins quarter-to-quarter because literally, that can change as to when a shipment goes from 1 quarter to the next. That's really why it's tough to sit here and drill down margins quarter-by-quarter overall in our business. And really, it's better to look at rolling 3-, 4-quarter trends. But I think some of the themes around our margin, first of all, we were pleased with the way the margins came out in the first quarter this year. And I think the most important message we want to convey is, when you looked at operating margins over the last couple of years, a lot of it has been a cost leverage story. This time, you're starting to see the operational improvements. And that's what we're focused on in our business. I mean, you look at our revenue guidance for the year and you can see it's mid-single digit. So a lot of the -- as we drive the earnings this year, certainly, there's a top line component to it. But a lot of that is just driving improvement in our business, which we'll really be able to leverage in the outgoing years, as these projects start to come in, as we grow our business, as we start to capitalize on some of the markets, like India now that we have really direct access to. So think of it that way in terms of improving the business is what's driving the margin. You're seeing it in the gross margin profile as well.","So as you kind of look through the year, couple of things around margins is that the OE mix, how that comes back and forth, that will impact it. That's okay, right? It's still earnings overall in our business. The improving business, as we get additional traction on our operational excellence, we will start to realize the value continued over our -- as our backlog, our improving backlog over the course of the year comes through. That's what's going to drive more margins. We're going to focus on cost leverage as well. And then, in the out years, we're going to start capitalizing on what was your good revenue opportunities as well.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And just on the industrial business, it looks like the chemical end market for those guys was more positive than I would have thought. Where are you seeing the strength in chemical on the industrial pumps?","Mark A. Blinn","Tom?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, I mean, a lot of the chemical business, obviously, is taking place in the U.S. driven by the low-cost natural gas. And we're also seeing some good chemical business based on the Middle East product diversification and again, because of the low cost on natural gas prices.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right. One more and I'll get off. Can you just give what the actual share count was, ending share count at the quarter rather than just the average for the quarter?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, Mike?","Michael S. Taff","The actual share count at the end of the quarter was 47.9 million shares outstanding.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on the aftermarket business. Aside from refining, where else are you seeing deferred maintenance? And what's your internal expectation of when that gets released? And sticking with the aftermarket, if you could talk about your ability to also service other rotating equipment aside from your core offering?","Mark A. Blinn","Sure. I mean, that's -- going to the last one, that's of course, one of our strategies and why we like having the seal pump and auxiliary portfolio to go in and touch rotating equipment. And what I mean, by that is, if you're a standalone seal company, you're basically looking at the seal component in terms of repair. If you're a pump company, you're looking at basically the shaft, the rotors, the impellers in aspect to the pump. We have multiple opportunities to go in and touch that piece of equipment and offer a broad service offering. So that is definitely, certainly one of our strategies, is taking care of our equipment and going in and also taking care of other equipment as well.","When you look at some of the aftermarket trends currently, and Tom called out, we've seen this before where refining spreads merit just running them flat out. And I think what we also saw before during that period of time is you can't do that forever. So it's really going to be pent-up demand. Where I think demand may take longer to come back is going to be in some of the upgrade and repair work in Europe. And they are maintaining their equipment. We've been in that business for a period of time. But some of the ISG upgrade opportunities in Europe really depend more when the sentiment starts to improve there. But for the most part, we're pleased with the way we've been able to grow the business. I'll go back to -- if you look at the net incremental installed base around the world in any given year, our aftermarket growth is well above that.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And just second question on just -- you talked about selective bidding. And you spoke about that a few quarters ago as well. Could you maybe comment on the competitive environment you're seeing out there on some of the long cycle and maybe also short-cycle work and how pricing is trending? And do you expect any significant pricing benefit once some of these large projects begin to materialize and some of the excess capacity gets absorbed?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes, I mean, Hamzah, let me just take it back a couple of years. I mean, this, on the long cycle side, if you recall, this market turned down in 2009. And during that period of time, you saw a number of things occurred. Recently in the press, more around the Korean E&C firms, very aggressive in the Middle East in 2010, early 2011. That impacted the market. Some of the competitors, which I think are now more in strategic hands, impacted the market. But the fact is that our markets, our long-cycle and project markets declined in '09 and have not really firmed up to the levels that you saw in '06, '07, '08 yet. We see that on the horizon.","What has happened is, I think, people have focused more and rationalized their capacity. The competitors are in very good strategic hands. A lot of the impact to the Korean contractors has worked through the system. You're starting to see it in their P&Ls right now. And so there is the opportunity to be selective in the markets. And that's what we started doing last year. So that has kind of driven what I'd say is, what we talked about is stability and, I'd say, rational pricing. It's still competitive, particularly in the power industry, if you look across industries. But what happens going forward is the capacity is now positioned for the opportunities that are on the horizon, right? It's not endless capacity. And so as those opportunities start to come out, even in the power industry, what you'll see is pricing will start to increase overall. So a lot of it is going to be driven by what we see in the opportunities towards the back half of the year.","Again, I'll say, I -- we don't necessarily build our strategic models on the type of pricing environment we saw in '07 and '08, which you saw because of, really, the backlog and the cycle times carried us almost into 2011. But we really don't need that to drive to our commitments. We're going to get good leverage out of price. And what's very important to us right now is to have our operations positioned to be able to respond quickly and leverage, not only revenue, but any kind of price benefit we get in the revenue going forward.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. And just last question. Do you guys have any product gaps in your portfolio? Or is that all behind you? I know you had something in IPD a while back, but that's behind you. How should we think about that?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, we do. We've, I think, Hamzah, you and I have talked about the safety valve, but the time and market to develop it is difficult. So I think we have a pretty broad product portfolio. I think it's definitely linked and interconnected in terms of how we go to market. And I think that's certainly an advantage for our customers, our sales organization and really, our ability to leverage it.","Having said that, one of the areas of our, what I'd call operational excellence recently, has been to really get a clear line of sight of our R&D organization to continue to develop, not only on product gaps, product enhancements, but also technology advancements, monitoring and things in and around the product. So I -- do we have everything we want? No. And are we going to continue to pursue either technological advancements, additional capabilities to products, developing products? I mean, we have a lot of base technology, Hamzah, that we can adapt for different applications. And we think that's a real opportunity. So it goes back to the buy versus build. You've seen us buy some. We've actually built quite a bit. Most notable one we talked about was the ISO chemical pump, but there's certainly been other things. And then what we want to do is take the products that we have and adapt them to additional applications. The basic technology existed in Flowserve that we adapted for the thermal solar application. So we are not sitting still.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I was just wondering, a question for Tom Pajonas. If you could -- I know what your margin aspirations are for the next year or so. And I was wondering if we could maybe hear from you. You've been on the job now for about a year and kind of -- if you were to unbundle those margin aspirations by kind of maybe just look at the productivity side, which I assume is higher than the margin expansion that you're thinking because of some offsets. But I just kind of wondering where -- what you're thinking on what the company's ongoing productivity benefit should be and where that will come from?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, when we talked about the margin enhancement, we kind of talk about the propensity in the business. And we use that word quite often. I mean, if I take a look at the points of leverage, and they are points that we haven't yet cleared all of them. But first and foremost, I look at the on-time delivery. So the more throughput I can get through my factories, I can increase the gross margin on the business.","We take a look at the quality. So my first-pass yield, whether it be engineering or supply chain or manufacturing first-pass yield, is something that we're working on as a leverage point.","The next one that we're working on is sourcing. Not necessarily sourcing just low cost, but sourcing in order to improve the throughput and the cycle time through our facility, again, another overall leverage point. We recently have brought in a Vice President of Projects from the project management organization EPCs, in order to lever that point in terms of our project management capabilities, i.e. problem solving and making sure that we get through a problem quickly, change control process. Again, another leverage point. So there's, I would say, Scott, there's a lot of what would appear to be small incremental leverage points. But when you start working on these in a process and leverage these together, we're looking at some good propensity in the gross margin line.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, those sounded all like gross margin things. And at some point, do you expect to maybe quantify what the annual could be?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, I think what we have done, Scott, is -- Mike talked about that last year in terms of operating margins and our targets to improve them 150 to 250 basis points. And as we develop further and make progress, if we have any changes to that, we'll certainly let you know.","But I go back, there is a frame of reference. Look at the FCD business relative to its competition in its market. Look at its gross margins, operating margins, have been very steady. And we talked about this before. We think that the IPD business certainly has the underlying capabilities to get to those type of metrics. And then on the EPD side, it -- there is certainly an element of reduced cycle time and what I'd call operational excellence, aftermarket growth overall in that business, which has a high margin profile, and then to a lesser extent, to the question earlier, around the pricing environment that exists. What I want to say, Scott, is we've put out -- we've talked about this, the 150 to 250. We don't in any way want to suggest we're just going to stop there.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, never thought that. All right. So I want to maybe talk a little bit about the bookings. And I know that you were up against a bit of a comp, particularly what I would the stacked comp, the 2012 and 2011. But I just want to make sure that, that's kind of what it is. And I know in speaking with Mike and Jay last night, that there were some -- a couple of bookings, sort of mid-sized bookings in the first quarter of last year. But I just want to frame my question this way, is that we've had capital spending growth in the oil and gas and chemical markets around the world now for more than 2 years. And certainly, on the oil and gas side, you don't benefit from that until it starts to really move away from the wellhead. I get all that. What I'm wondering is that the declines in organic bookings the last couple of quarters, that it's nothing more than a comps issue. What I'm saying is, you have -- you feel very good about the pre-FEED and the FEED in a lot of project releases coming forward. I think, we're all an agreement on that. What I'm wondering is that the bookings have kind of got you here, that type of capital spending, that, that in fact is not weakening, that it's really just a comp issue?","Mark A. Blinn","No, no. It is more of a comp issue. I mean, I'll, I think, allude the, what you referred to. If you look at Q1 comps over the last 2 years, 2011, we had a significant booking for the Yanbu Export Refinery in that quarter. I think it approached $80 million, and we had some other ones. And again, those were those Middle East projects that were extremely competitive but certainly strategic to us. And that project actually is now what we call in our legacy backlog, for lack of a better term.","When you look at last year, the real big quarter that we had was the one we called out in Q3. But we did have a couple of them that were bid in '11 and booked in '12. One in Asia, one in Europe. And so -- and these projects can kind of come and go. This quarter, they were actually relatively small, which we would expect on the forefront of some of this FEED work that's coming out.","So my point is, the underlying market trend relative to the run rate business and the aftermarket has been steadily increasing. That doesn't vary a lot from 1 -- necessarily 1 year to next. It will basically reflect underlying trends overall in the business. We think -- the other thing is we've been able to capture more with our additional product offering. So a long way of saying, the underlying run rate business, we've seen good steady improvement, and I think that has to do with how we're executing into the markets and the underlying market. But -- and you and I talked about this in March, things do come and go within segments.","So for example, FCD had a very strong oil and gas quarter this quarter. And a lot of that is capitalizing on Valbart, but also because it had little presence in that. So it can move within segments. As you and I talked about, the power industry has certainly been competitive. I think that's going to be one where we're going to need to see capacity start to get chewed up. And -- but the oil and gas business has -- we've seen continued investment, a lot of it upstream. We'll start to see it move more downstream. There's different stories in different parts of the world. But we're still encouraged with, really, the industry. Does that help?","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's great. No, that all helps for sure. I just want to maybe ask this one last quick one. I asked this at the analyst meeting as well. You guys are still thinking that because of the shipments of the improved backlog margins, the aftermarket and what have you, and the timing of the project releases, you're still thinking sort of 40,000 feet, that 2013 is kind of more margin-driven earnings than '14, and '14 is more top line driven earnings than '13.","Mark A. Blinn","It may not. That was my comment earlier. That's actually very well put, Scott. What we talked about this year straight out is, our earnings growth is going to be a lot of what we call within the 4 walls, improvement in the business. We do have guidance that has revenue growth out there. But frankly, it's, on a constant currency basis, it's not to the level that you've seen over the last couple of years. So as you look at this year and the compares year-over-year, it's a lot about improving the operations and in the business, which is great because we have a lot of that within our control. And obviously, we get a benefit from share count as well.","To the flip side, obviously, we're going to have headwinds from tax and interest expense as you kind of walk through the P&L. But you're right, and so it's really a -- an improvement of the operations into also, to an extent, the share count, which we like because we feel that's within our control. But we do have confidence in our markets over the medium and long term, that we're going to get that revenue growth. I do expect there'll be continued operational improvements that go into next year as well. Because we're not going to just rest at improved levels. We think we have opportunities to really get this business at a very high performing level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Prendergast from BB&T Capital Markets.","Nicholas V. Prendergast - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I was wondering if we could kind of piggyback on some of these bookings questions. I was hoping perhaps you could give some additional commentary about the cadence of your bookings as we move through the quarter. And did you see it start slow and accelerate or maybe the opposite? Just some commentary along those lines would be really helpful.","Mark A. Blinn","Well, certainly, in Q1, January, there's a lot of people on vacation, coming off the holidays around the world for various and sundry reasons. So it does tend to start out slow. I mean, it's the same thing you see in the summer, particularly in Europe, in the Middle East when either there's a religious event or people are on holiday. So there is a somewhat of a cadence overall to the bookings. But our point, there wasn't anything notably different from any other prior periods that we've seen in terms of the cadence this quarter.","Nicholas V. Prendergast - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, understood. And I guess, as a follow-up, I guess, you call your run rate business. Presumably, that's kind of your small and medium, not your large project business. We saw a decent ramp sequentially in that Q1 over Q4. And you managed to do that without any major projects announcements. How do you see, I guess, this run rate business as we progress throughout the year? I mean, I guess what I'm really trying to say is, you seem pretty confident that bookings ramp in the second half of the year. Does that entirely hinge on large project announcements or do you need your run rate business to continue doing as well as it is or perhaps accelerate?","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, our focus when we talked about the latter half of the year is really related to large projects.","Nicholas V. Prendergast - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So does that -- I assume that just kind of greatly outweighs the run rate?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, it's not a matter of whether -- I mean, yes, that's probably a fair term. I mean, these things are notable and sizable. For example, let's go back to Q3 of last year. We had that $70 million booking in IPD. And you could see how that impacted their year-over-year comps. So these things are fairly lumpy and come through. And believe me, they can slip easy from June 30 to July 1. In the grand scheme of things, that has really no impact to the energy infrastructure world. It does to you because you won't see it. But that's kind of a way of thinking about it. And I can even tell you to the energy infrastructure world, if it goes from June to September, it's not that important.","Nicholas V. Prendergast - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Sure, sure, I understand. All right. And then, I guess, shifting gears to your share repurchase plans. It looks likes you're keeping the pace somewhere around $150 million or so in quarter 2 just like Q1. How do you see that playing out as we move beyond Q2 into your $750 million authorization?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, what we did is we committed to $1 billion program. And we -- when we commit to things, we want to execute them. So we're going to wrap that up here in the second quarter for the most part. And then when we talked about is we're going to go back to our previously announced policy, which was the 40% -- the 50% of trailing earnings. That's both share repurchase and dividend. So -- and we're not market timers. We just tend to go into the market. Sometimes we're limited to when we can go into the market. But for the most part, we just try to be as systematic as we can about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Hey, actually, just following up again on some of the previous questions. But again, from kind of the 40,000-foot view, just thinking about the balance between the mix that you've been talking now with OE and some of the backlog bleeding through, and the low priced backlog being gone, hopefully, by the end of this year. So just conceptually, I know you don't want to give exact guidance, and you won't. But when we're thinking about 2014, I mean, is that going to be a year where we should expect to see very challenged incremental margins because you are saying that you're going to get large bookings late in 2013? Presumably, that will be realized in '14. It should be balanced a bit by low-margin backlog being out of the picture and also, some of the operational items that you talked about. But is the mix profile just going to significantly outweigh these other components and we should expect the conversion is going to be less than normal?","Mark A. Blinn","You're right. I mean, we certainly don't want to give margin guidance going into 2014 at this point. But I'd -- let me see if I can parse through your question. As these orders come in for the large projects, keep in mind, sometimes they're in -- we use percentage of completion accounting. But the fact is, these projects take a while. So they don't all show up as OE mix shift in any one period. Having said that, and if you look back into 2007, '08 and to a certain degree, '09, you can see, although our aftermarket book of business is a lot bigger than it was then, you did see significant mix shift with some of these very large projects coming through. I think we got as high as almost 70%. And that will impact gross margins, all other things being equal.","But our commentary also is the -- in my prepared comments, we're continuing to see the improvement in our operations. So it's not a job that's complete. So we expect to see continued benefits. Some of these things take a couple of years, right? And so we're going to continue to see benefits in terms of our improved operations. But a lot of it drives on the gross margin side, continue to focus on our fixed cost leverage. So there's going to be a number of moving parts there. Just keep in mind, when these big orders come in, we don't take them in and ship them out in a subsequent period. They take a while. So their impacting in this mix shift, tends to be somewhat muted by basically the cycle time of that coming through. But they can, as they build up and time moves, they can start to drive mix shift in our business.","And let me remind you, they also drive earnings. So you're talking about -- so what's the good news around -- because everybody gets focused on mix shift. But what does that mean? Well, sure, we could see OE go up 300, 400, 500, 600 basis points. We've seen it move up more. But you don't necessarily see SG&A go up at that level, as well. So you get fixed cost leverage overall in the business. We get better absorption in our facilities. There's a lot of good things that come with these projects, not to mention the aftermarket component of what we call commissions bearers and then the annuity stream that we get after these things go, get commissioned and go into service. So I just don't want people to react to mix shift. Mix shift, for the right reasons, is a great thing for our company.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And following on, so the commentary you had about just absorption of capacity in the market. I'm just thinking more about -- and I fully appreciate that. But thinking about more near-term as, obviously, you're saying that you do have confidence on these larger projects will break free in the second half of the year. Obviously, you're not the only one that's pursuing these projects. Do you anticipate kind of in, early on, with the first grouping of projects has actually emerged, those are going to be more sensitive to price. So I'm sure you and your competitors are trying to leverage off these trends. Should we be concerned that pricing actually could take a dip down before they start to improve as capacity gets absorbed?","Mark A. Blinn","I mean, you -- a lot of our competitors have to have conversations with you around our margins as well, especially when you get to some of the more highly engineered. Keep in mind, when you get into some of these complex applications, the competitive landscape starts to narrow. So there's certainly an aspect to that. And we saw a real difficult pricing environment in '10 and 2011, and we saw, as we called, some stability there. Unless there's a fear, like you saw in 2009, that the bottom was going to fall out of the industry and that capacity was going to become significantly under-absorbed, typically, our business doesn't start dropping price out. Now sometimes, you'll have a competitor try to aggressively get a position in the market, a number of things that have occurred that can have a temporary impact. I'll go back to my comment earlier. We saw this. You saw it in the Middle East in '10 and '11 with the large EMCs. And ultimately, that will reflect itself in the financial results. So I mean, that's how I think we talked about being disciplined and I can tell you a lot of our competitors are very thoughtful. They're careful as to how they allocate their capacity as well. They like to win projects as much as we do and they're good competitors. But it's not like our industry has huge flex capacity and can ramp capacity up and down like you can in some of the more commodity industries where you can just have additional runs. I mean, a lot of our products have tremendous engineering content to them.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Tom, this one's for you. You called out the pipeline arena. We do know Lawrence brings you to the table on some of the larger scale oil sands, valve exposure there. Can you give us a sense what you guys are seeing, especially in the back half? And if you are on some of these larger pipelines for the long haul, that seem to be coming along here?","Thomas L. Pajonas","The pipeline business has been a good business for us in 2012. And we are continuing to see some good pipeline business going forward, both in the developed, as well as in the emerging markets. It's also good business in terms of the aftermarket business, as people will try to put more through the existing pipes, maybe even change the viscosity and materials of things like this. So I would say the pipeline activity has really come in, in 2012, and it's seeing good progress in a number of areas in 2013.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Would this be an area that you would consider some bolt-on acquisitions to expand your product line?","Mark A. Blinn","Sure. I mean, this -- it's really how we fit. When you think about our strategic approach to acquisitions, we look at market-to-market opportunities. And we think that infrastructure is going to continue, especially with all these fines in what you'd call the remote parts of the United States, be it North Dakota secondary recovery, complex recovery because typically, you have to get the resource to a centralized distribution location, which tends to be in Oklahoma, Gulf Coast region, wherever they're ultimately going to move it. And the piping industry basically helps supply meet demand. And we think that with the supply opportunities in the United States and the demand, certainly, domestic and potentially, international. I mean, they've talked about that, having terminals down the Gulf Coast region are going to lead to more energy infrastructure spend. And I don't think this necessarily going to be unique to the United States. I think we're just ahead of the curve.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And Mark or Tom, what's the timing of from when you receive an order to potentially when it's shipped on some of these larger pipeline projects? Just give us a sense, a ballpark. I mean, on the shale stuff, I could visualize that. But on the longer aspects and bigger ticketed pipelines, what's like the time line from order to shipment?","Thomas L. Pajonas","We probably could be talking somewhere around 18, maybe 20, 22 or 21 weeks, something like this. It depends on the size of the, obviously, the pump. Obviously, a little bit less in terms of the industrial products for that. But that's probably a good number to use.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the revenues. First, I think you basically reiterated the 4% to 6% growth before FX for this year. Just wondering what, at current rates, what the FX impacts would be on revenues for translation this year?","Mark A. Blinn","We saw, in the first quarter, it was about a 90 basis point impact, I think, in the currency. And I'm not sure what our -- I think our -- obviously, the average currency was a little below what we put out in our guidance. But that's the best number we have right now. I mean, Jamie, it's really tough to call these currencies because it seems when any government speaks, there tends to be a lot of volatility in the pairings of currency. You saw that certainly happen here in the United States right at the [indiscernible]. But as to the impact in the first quarter, it was about 90 bps.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then, I guess, just a follow-up with some of the questions on bookings and margins. So basically, the expectation we have now is bookings should likely pick up throughout '13, as based on the opportunities that are out there, and you'll continue to expand margins and hit the target that you've laid out through next year. I guess, Mark, it sounds like what you're saying is the industry's in a different point now where capacity is essentially less. So despite the competition on those large projects, where pricing would typically be more intense, that it's more rational and you don't see the industry providing any barrier to you hitting the targets that you've laid out with that setup.","Mark A. Blinn","No. No, I don't. I mean, in '09 and '10, the industry didn't know where the bottom was. And so you want to make sure you fill your factories. And the industry was certainly being impacted by what was going on in the Middle East. And the industry was fragmented, the same assets were in there, but participating at different levels for different reasons. If you look at our industry now, they see the same thing we do, is medium- to long-term prospects in the energy industry. And the last thing you want to do is fill up your capacity with poor quality work or things that don't make sense when the opportunity does arise. Because you can't just drop a project you don't want and put the one in there that you do.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right, okay. And then one last one on the capital allocation, the dividends and buybacks returning to 40% to 50% after 2Q. Just wondering how we should think about that? You'll obviously hit that number for '13 by 2Q. Should we think about the second half on a rolling 2-year basis? Just will you continue to buy back shares in the second half?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes. That's, I mean, that's the way to look at it. The billion-dollar program was just that. It was a program that was in addition to our underlying stated policy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups to previous questions. First, on one Hamzah asked earlier on, the deferred maintenance, particularly in refining. You said that you don't think that can go on forever. We've been talking about it for 2 or 3 quarters now. How much longer do think that could go on before they require that maintenance to be done?","Mark A. Blinn","I can just tell you what we -- I think we saw this back in 2007, and it ran about 3 quarters.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you think we're going to be getting pretty close to the end of that now?","Mark A. Blinn","Yes.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And, Mark, you've been talking about the ramp-up of the OE projects in the second half of 2013, also, for 2 or 3 quarters now. Is there a difference in your level of confidence in that, say now versus 2 quarters ago? Are you more confident that it's going to happen? Is there a little more doubt around it or any change in your degree of confidence on the ramp in the back half of the year?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, as you see these things kind of move through the process, of course, they give you increased confidence. As you see them on the drawing board for longer, you know there are expenses and costs and efforts related to them, which gives you more confidence as well. But we can't -- we saw this, again, back in 2009. I hate to go back to there, but we knew these projects were going to go online when the whole world thought they were going to go away. We know they'll come on, but they can move. I can tell you, originally, when we were sitting in 2011, we thought a lot of these projects were going to come on early part of this year, maybe as early as the latter part of last year. And we've seen some solid move. So they can move. But as you get closer, right, when you're 1 year, 1.5 year out, the movement is less critical. As you start moving through the pre-FEED, the FEED, the bid for the long-lead-time items and everything, the timing, the ability to really move it becomes much more challenging overall in the business.","And again, back in the really strong markets, we saw them move, basically, because they had to rebudget these projects because everything had gone up so much in cost. But as we get closer, we do get more confident, one, because we've seen more cost attached to those projects. We also know that there's a cadence building up to it. We get a sense that some of the longer-lead-time things have been ordered on the project. That gives you increased confidence.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'll think that I'll take that as a little increase in confidence. And can you just quantify where you are on the past-due backlog and what's left of the legacy low-priced backlog and when that's expected to clear?","Mark A. Blinn","Well, I mean, the legacy we saw, most of it go out last year. We have some this year, and that will move through the course of this year. It'll have less of an impact than it did last year.","In the past, too, we've seen that certainly improve. But frankly, we've seen some more of that be created. We are ramping it down. And -- but that underpins my comment earlier is, we are seeing, we are working on operational improvement. We're not complete. And I think there's some things we can get at fairly quickly that Tom's talked about. And there's things we're going to continue to work on for a long time.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just as a follow-up question, really, for Tom, if I may. On the points of leverage that you mentioned, were there any points of leverage in the quarter where you achieved greater than expectations? You're encouraged by the 34% margin, the gross margin? So can you provide a little bit more color in terms of where you get a bit more leverage and a little bit less leverage than you would have liked?","Thomas L. Pajonas","Yes, I'm not sure it would be by an absolute number. But I think we're pretty -- based on the programs we've got in place, we have a very solid, I would say, quality program where we're looking at all the different leverage points that contribute to cost of pro quality. So warranty, rework, scrap, liquidated damages, i.e. on-time delivery relative to those items, we're spending a lot of time on that effort, which really, is just the basic core execution of the business. So we're really encouraged by, I would say, the traction that we're seeing in that area.","And then I would say the second area related to project management is we're going through, we're training the entire organization on problem solving, to be able to -- when an issue does come up, to get that through the system as quickly as possible, which then gets into the working capital and issues and a number of other things that we have ongoing. So we're pretty excited about those 2 pieces, specifically. I mean, obviously, other things like sourcing, initiatives, supplier development. Mark mentioned we're getting a lot of traction in our research and technology process that we revamped and are treating that more like a project. So every research project is treated just like a contract project with a return on investment and a schedule and a budget and so on. So we're really driving those things. And there's not any one thing, but I would say it's an integrated process across several.","Mark A. Blinn","I think the things that probably had a more notable impact in the quarter versus the comp last year was probably just discipline on the front to a certain degree and some improved on the operations. But there's a lot still on the table.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for today's program. I will now turn the call back to Jay for closing remarks.","John E.
