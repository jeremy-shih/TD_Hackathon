Welcome to the Prudential Quarterly Earnings Call Fourth Quarter 2017. During today's conference all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Finkelstein. Please go ahead.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob and then we will answer your questions.","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures of our earnings press release, which can be found in our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","And with that I will hand it over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. 2017 was a strong year for Prudential. We exceeded our earnings objectives for the year and are showing solid momentum across our businesses. I will provide some higher level observations on results for the fourth quarter and full year, the underlying fundamental trends in our businesses, and capital deployment and I will then hand it over to Mark and Rob to go through the specifics.","Fourth quarter operating earnings, excluding market driven and discrete items of $2.58 per share exceeded the prior year of $2.43 per share. The increase reflects business growth and higher (2:17) incentive fees, partially offset by lower underwriting margins and an increase in expenses. Recall that the fourth quarter results typically include elevated expenses, which we estimate to be approximately $0.25 per share for the current quarter.","Turning to full year results, operating earnings, excluding market driven and discrete items were $11.31 a share for 2017, well above the prior year of $9.65 per share. This also exceeded the top end of the guidance range we established in December of 2016. Similarly, the operating return on equity of nearly 14% for the year was above our 12% to 13% near-term to intermediate-term objective. While full year results benefited from favorable markets and investment results as well as other items that can fluctuate, we are pleased with the core growth and underlying margins in our businesses overall.","I would also highlight that adjusted book value per share increased 12% over the prior year end. While this includes a benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts which Mark will discuss in more detail, adjusted book value per share increased a solid 8%, excluding this benefit.","So overall, it was a very good year on almost all measures. While our base case for 2018 does not assume that we will produce the same return on equity that we did in 2017, the underlying themes around the quality of our businesses and consistency in execution should enable us to continue to produce returns exceeding industry averages and generate significant free cash flow, while also enabling us to continue to invest in our businesses for future growth.","I will now touch on some of those themes in discussing the performance of our businesses. I'll start with our Retirement business, which continues to perform exceptionally well. Core growth remains robust with nearly $9 billion of positive net flows during 2017, which contributed to 11% year-over-year account value growth. Likewise, underwriting margins in the business continue to exceed our expectations, particularly in our flagship Pension Risk Transfer business. Our success in this business is a direct reflection of the differentiated capabilities that we deliver and we continue to see Retirement as a source of long-term growth going forward.","In Investment Management, we achieved another important milestone as 2017 marked the 15th consecutive year of positive net flows from institutional clients and 13th consecutive year from retail clients. Over the last five years, unaffiliated third-party assets under management have grown annually at above 10%, including 15% in 2017. We continue to benefit from our multimanager model, strong investment performance across strategies, and positive outcomes from our recent initiatives. And while there are many challenges facing active investment managers, which we're not immune to, we continue to generate strong growth in assets under management and stable overall fee rates, leading to favorable financial results and a positive outlook","We are also seeing strong performance out of our Individual Annuities business. Although industry-wide sales have been under pressure, we've taken thoughtful steps to manage the business more efficiently and effectively. And this has resulted in higher margins, increased amounts of free cash flow, and reduced capital volatility. Over the last two years we have generated deployable capital in excess of $3 billion from the Individual Annuities business, including over 1 billion in 2017.","In Group Insurance, we're pleased with the performance of the business following the pricing and underwriting actions we took several years ago. The benefits ratio for 2017 was at the low end of our targeted range with solid underwriting results in both Group Life and Disability. In Individual Life, while results in 2017 were below what we anticipated due to adverse mortality and actions taken as part of our annual review of assumptions, this is a well-underwritten business and we continue to actively manage the composition of sales as the environment evolves.","And turning to our International operations, we continue to deliver steady core growth and solid earnings and returns, including an ROE of 17% for 2017. We are particularly pleased at how our Japanese business adapted to price changes on Yen products in early 2017 through increased sales of foreign currency denominated products. Notably, U.S. dollar products grew 16% in 2017 and comprised over 60% of Japan's sales for the year.","Looking forward, we expect our differentiated distribution model to continue to deliver stable growth at attractive margins despite some notable headwinds that we and others face in Japan. And we continue to be optimistic that newer markets like Brazil will have a more meaningful impact on results over the next several years.","I will now turn to capital deployment. We returned about $635 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter. This brings our full year shareholder returns to $2.6 billion, about equally split between dividends and share repurchases. We generate considerable free cash flow from our businesses, which we now estimate to be about 65% of earnings over time. As a result of the higher earnings level along with the increased share of earnings that are deployable, we have increased the amount of capital we are returning to our shareholders. In that regard, we are pleased that yesterday our board authorized a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This follows a similar increase in our 2018 share repurchase authorization announced in December. We continue to put a high priority on capital generation and return to shareholders and we do so while continuing to invest in our businesses and maintaining a strong balance sheet.","To sum up, we're quite pleased with 2017 results. We exceeded our earnings objectives for the year and continue to show good growth and margin fundamentals across our businesses. We're also excited about the longer term investments we are making, including those that will enable us to connect with customers with greater agility, over time, accelerate our growth rate. The recent realignment of our domestic business organizational structure will help facilitate these initiatives. While items like the positive impact to earnings from the Tax Act will provide a near-term boost, our focus is and always has been on delivering long-term growth and shareholder value and we remain confident that the combination of our superior business mix and track record of innovation and execution will enable us to do just that.","So with that, I'd like to hand it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights.","I'll start on slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted $2.69 per share for the quarter compared to $2.46 a year ago. After adjusting for market driven and discrete items of $0.01 per share, EPS amounted to $2.68 for the quarter, up from $2.43 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses overall was solid in the quarter with results benefiting from higher fees in our Annuities and Investment Management businesses and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis, partially offset by higher expenses. In addition, other related revenues in our Investment Management business of $92 million in the quarter were $70 million higher than the year-ago quarter as a result of higher incentive fees and stronger strategic investing results. Together, these items had a net favorable impact of approximately $0.27 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago.","Current quarter results also reflect a net benefit from certain items that varied from our average expectations. This includes non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income, which were about $90 million above our average expectations in the quarter. This was offset by the impact of less favorable underwriting results relative to expectations in our Individual Life and Retirement businesses and other refinements that amounted to $45 million. The net effect of these items resulted in a benefit of about $0.07 per share. In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses for items such as technology and business development, advertising, annual policyholder communications and other variable costs were about $165 million or $0.25 per share above our quarterly average for the year, consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results.","On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $3.8 billion for the current quarter or $8.61 per share. GAAP net income in the current quarter was about $2.6 billion higher than our after-tax adjusted operating income and included a $2.9 billion or $6.64 per share estimated tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and about $600 million of pre-tax net realized investment losses.","Turning to slide 3, I'll address the financial impacts of the Tax Act. The current quarter tax benefit of $2.9 billion from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes two key components: a $3.4 billion benefit from the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and the adoption of a territorial tax system; and a one-time tax expense of about $500 million from the deemed repatriation of unremitted taxable earnings of foreign subsidiaries as part of the transition to the territorial tax system. In addition, the $2.9 billion net tax benefit increased GAAP book value per common share as of December 31, 2017 by $6.59. This compares to an increase in adjusted book value of $2.74 per common share. The difference relates to an adjustment for deferred taxes that were originally established through accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily related to the deferred tax impact of unrealized gains and losses.","Looking forward, we now expect the 2018 effective tax rate on adjusted operating income to be approximately 22% as compared to our 26% expectation provided in December in connection with our 2018 financial outlook. The reduction is primarily due to applying a lower tax rate to our U.S. business earnings.","Moving to slide 4. I'll cover the market driven and discrete items for the quarter, which had a relatively small impact on results. These items include a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the Annuity business, driven mainly by the performance of equities in customer accounts, partially offset by costs incurred in Corporate & Other related to a debt exchange transaction which we completed in December.","Moving on to slide 5, which shows the items affecting pre-tax net income that are not included in adjusted operating income. Our current quarter GAAP net income includes pre-tax net realized investment losses of $581 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to a net pre-tax gain of $26 million. Of note, the loss of $500 million from risk management activities was driven by currency hedges as the U.S. dollar weakened compared to certain other currencies and losses on other derivatives used in risk mitigation.","Product related embedded derivatives and associated hedging had a negative impact of $332 million, largely driven by the non-economic impact of applying tighter credit spreads in the calculation of our non-performance risk related to the Annuities living benefits. The $338 million gain from the general investment portfolio and related activities was driven by equity and fixed income security related gains in our International operations.","Slide 6 shows financial highlights for the year (15:46). Earnings per share for 2017 based on after-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $11.31 after adjusting for market driven and discrete items, which implies an ROE of 13.9%. The full year earnings per share increased by 17% from 2016, driven by strong underlying performance across our businesses and tailwinds from equity markets and non-coupon investment returns. Also, as I noted earlier, our adjusted book value per share as of December 31, 2017 of $88.28 includes a $2.74 benefit from the impact of the Tax Act.","(16:31) business results, I'll start on slide 7. Let me first highlight that effective this quarter our business segments are organized consistent with the new U.S. business structure we announced in July. The new organizational structure retains our existing segments, but realigns them under new divisions.","I will discuss the comparative results for each segment, excluding the market driven and discrete items I mentioned previously. Annuities earnings were $525 million for the quarter, up by $103 million from a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income, reflecting a 7% increase in our variable annuity average separate account values and lower risk management costs, driven by favorable markets and hedging results and the ongoing benefit from our second quarter update of actuarial assumptions. Partially offsetting this increase was a lower contribution from net investment spread results, primarily due to the impact of lower reinvestment yields. Returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were approximately $10 million above our average expectations in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter.","Annuities return on assets or ROA of 125 basis points is down modestly from last quarter's record level. As we mentioned during our financial outlook call, a portion of the elevated ROA compared to last year is sustainable, including the impact of the annual actuarial assumption updates, and therefore we expect to exceed our long-term ROA target of about 115 basis points in the short to medium term. However, over time, we expect higher risk management costs and lower average fee rates to cause our ROA to migrate to the long-term target level.","Slide 8 presents our Annuity sales. Total Annuity sales in the quarter of $1.6 billion are slightly below the year ago, but $300 million higher than last quarter. The sequential quarter increase was driven by higher HDI sales as a result of our re-pricing actions in October. Although account values of $165 billion set a new record driven by market appreciation, we continue to experience net outflows due to lower than historical sales levels and higher withdrawals.","Turning to slide 9. Individual Life earnings were $98 million for the quarter, compared to $138 million a year ago. The decrease primarily reflects unfavorable claims experience and the adverse ongoing impact of the second quarter 2017 annual review and update of actuarial assumptions and other refinements. The net contribution to current quarter results from claims experience inclusive of reinsurance, associated reserve updates, and amortization was approximately $25 million less favorable than our average expectations compared to approximately $15 million more favorable than our average expectations in the year-ago quarter. We experienced a higher-than-expected level of large claim activity in the current quarter. Partially offsetting this decrease was the absence of updates to other reserve balances and related items, which negatively impacted the year-ago quarter by $25 million, and this year, a greater contribution from net investment spread results. Earnings for the current quarter included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $5 million above our average expectations.","Turning to slide 10. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums of $183 million were consistent with the year-ago quarter. Lower Guaranteed Universal Life sales were offset by higher sales across the other products, reflecting our product diversification strategy and specific distribution and product actions we have taken, as well as an increase in large case Variable life placements in the quarter.","Turning to slide 11, Retirement earnings were $291 million for the quarter, compared to $298 million a year ago. The decrease reflects less favorable case experience and higher expenses, partially offset by a greater contribution from net investment spread results. Current quarter case experience was about $10 million less favorable than our average expectations, compared to about $10 million more favorable than average expectations a year ago. The greater contribution to net investment spread results included current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, which were about $50 million above our average expectations compared to returns about $30 million above expectations a year ago, partially offset by continued spread compression.","Turning to slide 12, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $17.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $8.9 billion a year ago. This increase was driven by gross sales of institutional investment products in the current quarter, which amounted to $10.3 billion, including roughly $4 billion of Longevity Reinsurance transactions, $3.3 billion of funded Pension Risk Transfer cases, and $3 billion of stable value wraps. Total Retirement account values were a record at $429.1 billion, up 11% from a year earlier. This increase includes the benefit for market appreciation, as well as about $8.9 billion of positive net flows over the past year split about evenly between Full Service and institutional investment products. I would highlight that the institutional net flows included about $6 billion of new funded Pension Risk Transfer cases which more than offset our runoff of the In-Force business.","Turning to slide 13, Group Insurance earnings were $22 million for the quarter, compared to $43 million a year ago. The decrease reflects higher expenses, including the impact of non-linear items such as premium taxes and less favorable Group Life underwriting results, partially offset by a higher contribution from net investment spread results. Included in the current quarter underwriting result was approximately $10 million of unfavorable reserve and premium refinements. In addition, the current quarter net investment spread results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, which were approximately $10 million above our average expectations in comparison to returns approximately $5 million above our average expectations in the year-ago quarter.","Turning to slide 14, Investment Management earnings were $306 million for the quarter, compared to $224 million a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by a $70 million greater contribution from Other Related Revenues as a result of higher incentive fees and stronger strategic investing results. The earnings contribution of Other Related Revenues is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuations and the timing of transactions and amounted to $92 million in the current quarter, about $60 million above the average of the trailing 12 quarters. In addition, higher asset management fees net of related expenses reflect a 7% increase in average assets under management, driven by fixed income net inflows and equity market appreciation. The Investment Management business reported $1.4 billion of net positive unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter excluding money market activity. Net retail inflows of $1.5 billion driven by Fixed Income strategies were slightly offset by institutional net outflows driven by equities. For the year, we produced $15.7 billion of positive unaffiliated third-party net flows, another strong year for our growing Investment Management business.","Moving to the International Insurance businesses and turning to slide 15, earnings for Our Life Planner business were $383 million for the quarter compared to $395 million a year ago. Excluding a $5 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings decreased by $7 million from a year ago. The decrease was driven by higher expenses and less favorable policy benefits experience, partially offset by continued business growth with constant dollar Insurance revenues up by 7% from a year ago. Claims experience in the current quarter was consistent with our average expectations and in the year-ago quarter was approximately $15 million more favorable than our average expectation. In addition, the current quarter contribution from net investment spread results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, approximately $15 million above our average expectation.","Turning to slide 16. Gibraltar Life earnings were $394 million for the quarter compared to $360 million a year ago. This increase primarily reflects more favorable policy benefits experience and continued business growth, driven by the increase in U.S. denominated product sales over the past year.","Turning to slide 17. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $644 million for the current quarter, down $69 million, or 10%, from a year ago. We've experienced similar trends in both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations where sales decreased by $37 million and $32 million respectively, compared to the year-ago quarter. This decrease primarily reflects lower sales in Japan following elevated sales levels in the first half of the year. Yen-based product sales in Japan decreased by $131 million compared to the prior year due to the elevated level of sales in the first half of this year which occurred in advance of rate increases that were driven by the lower standard discount rate which was effective in the second quarter. This was partially offset by an increase in U.S. dollar denominated sales in Japan of $66 million, driven by the continued attractiveness of U.S. dollar products in the current environment, which further benefited from the introduction of new U.S. dollar Whole Life products earlier this year. As a result, 78% of sales in Japan were U.S. dollar denominated in the quarter. Sales outside of Japan were consistent with the year-ago quarter, as growth in Brazil was offset by modest declines in other markets. On a full-year basis, 2017 sales \u2013 2017 total sales of $3 billion and Japan sales of $2.5 billion were consistent with the prior year; however, with a greater mix of U.S. dollar denominated sale.","Turning to slide 18. The Corporate & Other loss was $451 million for the current quarter compared to a $441 million loss a year ago. The increased loss was driven by higher expenses, including non-linear items which can fluctuate and lower investment income, net of interest costs. Partially offsetting this increase was higher income from our pension plan following our assumption updates at year-end last year. Higher expenses drove the sequential quarter increase in the loss. Of the company's $165 million overall excess of fourth quarter expenses in relation to the quarterly average for the year that I mentioned, about $70 million resides in Corporate & Other.","Before I hand it over to Rob, I'd like to cover one other topic that may be on your mind, and thus wanted to address it now. The topic relates to Guaranteed Group Annuities and MetLife's disclosure that it plans to strengthen reserves to address a pool of missing annuitants. We have read MetLife's disclosures, but we don't know the specifics of their situation. In terms of our Retirement business, we take fulfilling our obligations to our customers seriously. Under our policies and procedures, we use internal and external tools and resources to locate customers. We also have policies on the development of our reserve estimates. We are comfortable with our overall reserves and that we're complying with our policies and procedures and meeting our obligations to customers. Given the size and the age of our block of business, there are inevitably some customers we can't locate for a number of reasons, but that number is small. We regularly review, test and enhance the processes and tools we use to locate customers and, over time, we expect them to continue to evolve. This issue is certainly getting a lot of attention in the market, and ultimately we could see straight \u2013 see greater standardization of what may currently be divergent practices across the industry (29:56).","Now, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Now turning to slide 19. I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures. We view the RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance, or PICA and PALAC as well as the composite RBCs shown here to be important measures of our financial strength. Having said that, as we've highlighted previously, we manage our annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding total assets to a CTE 97 level with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time we may see some variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC over our target ratio. We expect that the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as part of the Tax Act will result in a reduction of statutory deferred tax assets and an increase in certain statutory reserves, which will adversely affect the statutory capital position of our domestic insurance companies for 2017. However, while statutory results are not yet filed, we expect that our Prudential Insurance, PALAC, and composite RBC ratios will each continue to be above our current 400% AA target as of year-end, including the estimated impacts from the Tax Act. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 893% and 935% respectfully as of September 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets and we estimate that they continue to be so as of the end of the year.","Looking at liquidity, leverage, and capital deployment highlights that are on slide 20, cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.4 billion at the end of the quarter which was consistent with last quarter. Cash inflows during the quarter supported approximately $635 million of shareholder distributions which were about evenly split between dividends of $321 million and share repurchases of $313 million, and also funded debt maturities and other business operations.","Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of year-end remained within our targets. And as John noted, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders during the year through dividends and share repurchases and announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday. I would also remind investors of two items we communicated in our guidance that we expect to have a positive impact on adjusted book value in the first quarter of 2018 of roughly $1 billion. We'll implement the new accounting standard that impacts the treatment of equity investments and which will result in a reclass of net unrealized gains of approximately $900 million from AOCI to retained earnings. In addition, we intend to eliminate the one-month reporting lag in our Gibraltar operations so that Gibraltar's first quarter results reflect January through March activity. This would not result in an extra month of Gibraltar earnings in our 2018 results, but instead would essentially result in an adjustment to opening equity.","Now, I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. We'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks, good morning. Following the impacts of tax reform and the varying impacts to both cash taxes and GAAP effective tax rates, do you still feel comfortable with the 65% free cash flow conversion guidance?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Ryan, it's Rob. Yeah, we're comfortable that, again, on average over time, the 65% ratio of free cash flow is something that the businesses will continue to produce. If we look at the impact of tax reform, we expect cash taxes to actually be lower over the course of the next few years, primarily from not incurring U.S. taxes on repatriations from Japan and the utilization of accelerated tax credits on our U.S. taxes. So we expect most of the near-term increase in after-tax AOI resulting from tax reform to actually translate into free cash flow, even including the amortization of the one-time toll tax that we mentioned of about $500 million. Longer term, there are more variables that come into play, but we generally expect reform to be neutral or a positive to future year's cash \u2013 cash flow. And so, we remained with our guidance around the 65% free cash flow ratio.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then a related question on the, I believe it was on the outlook call, you stated that you expected the PICA\/RBC ratio to remain above 400, even if the NAIC changes the denominator factors. Is that still the case as well?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yes, it is. So, what you saw is, two of the biggest pieces related to that came through as of year-end. So that was the reduction in the DTAs and the increasing of reserves, primarily around AAT reserves that get adjusted as a result of the lower taxes. So, those are both baked into the numbers that we'll produce as of year-end, and while we haven't published those yet, and therefore we don't want to be overly specific, we're comfortable that that number is going to come out ahead of our \u2013 or above our 400% target for AA as we're currently labeling that.","The remaining piece that's a potential would represent about half of the 100 basis point decline in RBC that we had given for the totality of the impact of tax reform. When and how that actually manifests itself is still unknown, but we've assumed that a recalibration of the metrics without any adjustments going from 35 down to 21 (36:16), the impact of that is (36:20) something where we would still be able to maintain our 400% RBC using our available cash \u2013 our available capital capacity. Some of that capital capacity exists within our on-balance sheet, off-balance sheet, and earnings that we obviously generate during the course of the year as well.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi, thank you. Sticking on the topic of taxes, as you look across your U.S. businesses, how do you see tax reform affecting competitive dynamics and pricing?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Erik, this is Steve. Let me address your question. And I'll just start by saying that, as you know, we regularly review our product pricing and update key assumptions as appropriate. And there are a number of factors that we consider as part of that, tax impact being just one of them. I think the most meaningful impact from the tax reform will likely not really be derived in regard to new product sales, but rather simply from applying lower tax rates for the results of our In-Force business. For products that do, where our at issue returns do benefit from the tax reform, I think it'd be reasonable to expect that some portion of the benefits realized from that will be competed away over time. However, we see this happening over time and at varying rates of speed in our varying businesses, depending on the competitive landscape in each of those businesses. And throughout this, our primary focus will continue to be ensuring that we price our products for sustainable profitable growth.","In terms of the lowering of tax rates and does that impact the value proposition that we offer to customers, we don't believe so. We believe that even at lower tax rates, our insurance solutions continue to offer a strong value proposition and help to meet our customers' financial needs.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you. And I guess post tax reform we've also seen a number of large corporates that have announced contributions to their pension plans. And when we combine that with rising interest rates and higher PBGCs, are you seeing an increase in interest in PRT transactions, particularly amongst jumbo plan sponsors?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yes, Erik, we do see a very, very healthy pipeline at the start of the year, and it's for the reasons that you mentioned. Ability to transact is bolstered by increasing funding levels and that's driven by both an uptick in rates and the contributions that you mentioned. A significant number of plan sponsors have made contributions in 2017 to their plans and they have until September to do so and to take advantage of the lower 2017 tax rates. So, ability to transact is very strong and propensity to transact continues to be bolstered by the factors that we've mentioned before on these calls, such as rising PBGC premiums, increasing awareness of the longevity risk, and that increasing awareness being reinforced by new mortality tables. So, all of those factors around both ability and propensity to transact really make for a healthy pipeline here at the early stages of the year.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Wanted to start with the VA business, in particular on the hedging program. Just given a lot of the volatility that we've seen just in the past week particularly related to volatility-related products, do you have any exposure to those products or can you talk about what you've just seen in your hedging program just recently?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure Suneet, it's Rob. So, first of all, big picture \u2013 this is a good story and it's consistent with the prior messaging that we've been giving around the increased stability and predictability around our Annuities business. So let me break it down into pieces. Let me talk first about the last part of your question which is the hedge performance during the course of the quarter. So, we include volatility in our hedging. We don't hedge the VICs directly, but we have options and other things and they \u2013 and so, volatility is expressed through that. Our actual breakage month-to-date for February was only around $45 million. Now I'll remind you, that's on a liability that's in excess of $9 billion. And so that's consistent with the kind of hedging efficiencies that \u2013 and effectiveness that we've been seeing in prior quarters and prior years. If you look back at the fourth quarter, the way in which we look at our effectiveness, we're at 90% or above in terms of our hedge effectiveness.","So, the second piece then in terms of volatility. So obviously there are multiple pieces of volatility that you want to think about. There is a direct increase in hedge costs when volatility increases within a period. And to the extent that volatility gives rise to breakage, you have that indirect cost as well. Now, those costs are subject to the fact that one, as I noted we hedge at 2 (41:45). Recall that we have our auto-rebalance feature and that allows us \u2013 as volatility is typically associated with declining markets, we're rebalancing out of equities and into fixed income. And so our exposure to that is declining as markets increase in volatility and decline.","In terms of the broader, then, impact of vol on our earnings, the long-term cost of our hedging is included in our AOI. That's the AP factor that we set upfront when we look at our fees and we anticipate how much of that is going to flow into AOI as opposed to what's needed in order to settle out the liability. The period costs, in any given period the plus or the minus, is part of how we define breakage in that period. So, if volatility goes up and the cost of our hedging goes up, that's going to be defined in our breakage. And then, to the extent that we have any inefficiencies, that will be in there as well. That gets amortized into our AOI via changes in our benefit ratios. And to-date, that's actually been a positive number and it's contributed modestly to the elevated ROAs that we've been reporting.","And so as part of our guidance, I'll remind you that what we did is we said that we were expecting that that mid to 125-ish ROA would migrate down over time as we took the opportunity of relatively high equity markets and high profitability coming out of the business to recalibrate how we go about hedging our annuities book, an increase in the use of derivatives and hedges as we did that. And so we undertook that and that was fully in place by the end of the fourth quarter. And therefore, we further benefited from the fact that we had, in addition to our product hedges, a capital hedge overlay on top of that against equity market volatility. And all of that's consistent with what we've been messaging in the last four quarters around, expect a slight decline in ROA and the exchange for that is going to be less volatility in our earnings and our cash flow, which we think is a good trade, particularly given the elevated levels of both markets and our profitability.","Final piece of that, equity markets: obviously if vol's up and equity markets are down, the \u2013 that \u2013 all things being considered, we rather equity markets were up: that enhances the profitability of not only the Annuities business but our other businesses as well. That \u2013 any equity market declines are ultimately reflected in our earnings through unlocking of the K factor (44:18) in our benefit ratios. But recall a couple things: One is, there's a mean reversion assumption in there and that mutes the impact of it. And because of the hedging that we do, both the product hedge and the capital hedge that I described before, we significantly offset the impact of a decline in equity markets. And that's what we've been talking about, again, over the last few quarters. We are using the higher level of earnings to reduce that volatility and then shore up our earnings and our cash flow or reduce the volatility around that. So, we do better a rising equity market, but we're well protected in downturns and expect a muted earnings impact from what we saw \u2013 the likes of what we saw in February from the combination of volatility and directions in markets.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. The other follow-up I had was related to the auto-rebalance. So, the trend has been, falling equity markets and rising interest rates. And as you pointed out, I think the algorithm would shift funds into fixed income option. What happens if we sustain this type of environment, i.e., equity markets continue to drop and interest rates rise? Doesn't that auto-rebalance end up working against account value growth at some point?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, to the extent the auto-rebalance leaves people within \u2013 more skewed toward bonds and equities, they stay in that position until a point at which the equity markets rise and auto-balance begins to work in the other direction. So if you have an environment where equity markets remain relatively flat, they'll be in a fixed income instruments. Obviously, the duration of that fixed income fund is sort of \u2013 it's sort of a mid-range duration. I remember it specifically, five years, six years, something like that. So as interest rates rise, as they're in that over time, they'll get higher yields out of that as the yield in the \u2013 on the assets in that fund increase. Now, if equity markets further decline, obviously they're going to be protected from that because we'll continue to auto-rebalance out of equities and into fixed income. And so, they'll eventually hit a floor where further equity market declines will be \u2013 they'll be fully insulated from those kind of movements. Steve, I don't know if you want to elaborate on that.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, I'll just add a couple of points, Rob. First of all, just remember that the fixed income vehicle is a corporate bond fund, and so spreads come into play as well. But also, just a more fundamental point that we've consistently emphasized. The auto-rebalancing program is not an account value optimizer. That's not what it's about. It's about the support of our risk profile over an extended period of time and making sure that we're able to responsibly offer the benefit that we do in our product design. So that's really the underlying and fundamental purpose that we very much discuss with our customers' about the auto-rebalancing program. It's not meant to optimize account values.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Morning. First question just on the Investment Management business and some of the incentive and transaction fees, or the strategic fees you mentioned. Can you discuss the timing of those and if you have any kind of visibility that they will remain elevated for some period here in 2018?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Alex, it's Steve. I'll address your question. First of all, incentive and performance fees often do have some seasonality. It's not unusual to see them emerge in the fourth quarter, if we've earned them. In terms of what happened this quarter, we saw those elevated incentive fees actually across multiple asset classes: we saw it in fixed income, both public and private; we saw it in real estate; and we saw it in our equity businesses as well. Over time, we have been drawing increasing flows to strategies that do carry incentive fees and that's particularly true in our fixed income business. So, it would not be unusual to see a growth in the strategies over time and possibly emergence of greater incentive fees in our earnings patterns over time.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And follow-up question on Individual Annuities. The surrenders and withdrawals kind of ticked up a bit more than in previous quarters. Is that a trend that you'd expect to escalate? Are there any things you're doing on the sales front relatedly to maybe offer products that don't require rebalancing or things like that that you'd expect to help sales and offset some of the outflow?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Alex, again, I'll address your questions. It is not at all surprising for us to see elevated lapses and withdrawals in this quarter. I'd mention a couple of things. First of all, just in terms of the market conditions, we expect to see elevated lapses in our \u2013 as interest rates rise. And interest rates rising is usually associated with alternative solutions becoming available that clients may go into. I would also recall that that correlation of rising interest rates is built into how we manage our actuarial assumptions in the business and our risk management in the business. So, that kind of dynamic relationship between rising interest rates and lapsation is really built into what we do. On a longer term basis, I'd also recall that as more and more of our In-Force business emerges from a surrender period, we would expect to see that.","In terms of new product design, we just last week launched a fixed-index annuity product. And so, we see that as offering a fuller suite of product designs to our distribution partners and their clients and we have other products in the course of this year that we expect to introduce into the marketplace.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the answers.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, Steve, another one for you just on the auto-rebalance Highest Daily value product. I just want to make sure I understand the dynamics that are happening with it and the way the product works, again. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is the vast majority of your portfolio has the Highest Daily feature. If equity markets decline over 10%, the auto-rebalance kicks in and I think fully moves into fixed income or largely moves into fixed income at down 20 (51:58). Is that the way the product works?","And just a related question, how do you \u2013 would you have to respond and start altering your hedge program with a pretty big asset reallocation? And what would that do to your ROA in the scenario that the market continues to weaken?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Tom, I'll address your question. The activation of the auto-rebalancing program is not based on overall certain level of market decline. Actually, auto-rebalancing would, under normal circumstances, kick in well before a 10% market decline. Again, to emphasize, the auto-rebalancing program is driven by our evaluation of the risk profile in each and every one of our HDI products and then the aggregation of that change in risk profile of all those individual contracts. That's what drives auto-rebalancing activity: change in risk profile of each and every contract. As to the asset reallocation topic, maybe I'd ask Rob to comment on that","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So, a couple things, Tom. First, just to put some numbers on Steve's point, if you \u2013 if we look at what happened in February, so the big movement on the 5th of February, we were down about 4%. It was a little over a $500 million transfer in the auto-rebalance out of equities into fixed income as a result of that movement. So, well before we hit the 10%. But again, put that in the context of a $9 billion overall liability and you sort of get some sense for how that works.","With respect to your return on asset \u2013 the implications on the returns on assets is sort of what I was going through before, Tom, is it actually \u2013 that in and of itself would not \u2013 the algorithm, the rebalancing in and of itself is not going to change the ROA that we're getting out of the business. Recall first that the fees are charged on the guaranteed value, and so, therefore to the extent that we're in fixed income or otherwise, or markets move down, our fees are not diminished by virtue of that. And then secondly, the fact that we actually have less hedging cost, just like if we had more hedging costs, we're going to look at that as being periodic and we have a longer-term view of what the hedging costs would be over the life of the contract, and absent changing that, those \u2013 that interim, in that particular case, lower hedging costs if we're more in fixed income than equities, is something that we're going to amortize in over the life of the contract. So, we'd have probably a modest positive impact in terms of less hedging costs than what we've built in, but not material in any way and not highly volatile either. And I'm sorry, was there another part to your question, Tom?","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","No, that was good, Rob. That did it on VA. And then just my follow-up is, just on the topic of long-term care, I know it's something that you all took a charge on several years back, I'm going to say maybe four years ago or five years ago. Just out of curiosity, do you still have, after that charge, just based on your experience to-date, is there still margin there? Is that something we should be watching out for from a development standpoint, 2018-2019? Can you comment a bit about what you're seeing on ongoing trend there?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so let me share a couple observations, Tom. First, let me start with the caveat that our book here is a relatively small book. So, we've got 215,000 policies, 6 billion in reserves, and you can kind of put that in the context of others in the industry that are much more significantly in this product. A couple other things I'd also mention just to sort of lay out the nature of our book. We're \u2013 it's a more recent vintage book, Tom, so that's when plan designs got more conservative. And about two-thirds of the book is Group as opposed to Individual. And, again, the plan designs were more conservative in the Group long-term care policies than they were in the Individual.","With respect to our assumptions, we look at those every year. So, yeah, we did the big assumption update in 2012 and had the GAAP loss recognition event. I think that's what you're referring to. But every year we continue to look at that. And the assumptions that we have in place for that book, we look at both with regard to our own experience and with regard to industry experience and we are in line, if not generally on the more conservative end of that industry experience that's available to us. Now, I'd throw a caveat in there, and that is that our book is relatively nascent as I mentioned, so it's got \u2013 a little over 1% of the book is actually in payout at this point in time. And I'd say the same thing of the industry, which is that the experience of people is still evolving and that we all have to watch for how that experience may change, what we've currently seen. So, while assumptions may reflect experience to-date, that's not to say that experience can't change as more and more of the book goes from the deferred status to active status. And then, so get to your very specific question, we have a cushion above our loss recognition that's in excess of $500 million, and so we feel pretty comfortable with that level of cushion with the realization that we'll constantly be updating our assumptions. And we'll look to do that in the second quarter of next year.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. The first one, just on the VA business. Your surrender has picked up significantly and I realize the book is aging, but they did pick up noticeably from the previous quarter. So, what drove that and what's your outlook for just withdraw rates in general in the VA business? And then secondly, just on international agent count. So, Gibraltar, the agent count I think was down a little bit sequentially. Japan Life plan are declined as well. Is that more seasonality or is it something else going on? And your outlook for that as well.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Jimmy, it's Steve. I'll answer the first part of your question. As I mentioned, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect to see withdrawals and lapses in the variable annuities business. Rising interest rates are usually associated with the emergence of alternative solutions, and thus it would be only natural to see increased lapsation in that for that reason in addition to the emergence from surrender charges, as you mentioned, as a longer term trend. And again, I just mentioned that we have thoroughly incorporated that correlation into our actuarial and risk management underpinnings for this business. The assumptions we make call for a dynamic relationship between direction of interest rates and lapsation.","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Jimmy, it's Charlie. Let me talk about both Life Planners and then, as you mentioned, Life Consultants. So, in Life Planners, in Japan they were up 3%, but to your point, you are correct. There is some seasonality with regard to Life Planners. So, recall that transfers to sales managers generally happen twice a year, in the second quarter and the fourth quarter, and we had a very \u2013 we had a high number of LPs transferred this quarter, resulting in an increase in sales managers year-over-year by 11%. Now, that's good because these new sales managers will contribute to future recruits and continued LP growth. But they do lower the current LP count. We also had a higher number of secondees that were transferred to the bank channel. So there are a lot of ins and outs, especially in the second and fourth quarter, but the long-term average for POJ and, frankly, for Life Planners in general is about 2% to 4%. So if you look over a five-year period for all of Prudential International Insurance, the LP growth rate in total has been about 2% or so. So, slow and steady growth of 2% over the long-term is what you should anticipate.","Now, with the Life Consultant count, that's a bit of a different story. So the Life Consultant count decreased by about 6% year-over-year, and this is due to the adherence of more stringent validation and recruiting processes that we put into effect and that we talked about last quarter. And that really has a double effect. The first is that there are more terminations from stringent validation requirements that are being enforced, but also with higher recruiting standards, you have less recruits. And it's tough to do this, because when you elect to do this, there's a bit of a J-curve of sorts. So while we were flat versus prior quarter, we're not yet at the bottom of the J-curve. And I think we said last quarter, it'll take really most of this year to get to the bottom. But we think we'll hit the bottom later this year, and it's exactly what we've done in several operations outside of Japan over the past eighteen months including Korea and Taiwan, going back to the basics and increasing the quality of the field.","Now a proof point to what we're doing is the fact that while LC count, the Life Consultant count decreased by 6%, sales only decreased by 4% in this market. And therefore, what you'd expect to see and what you're seeing especially at first is that as you take off essentially the bottom of the Life Consultants, if you will, the ones that aren't performing well, you'd expect to see sales go down less than the Life Planner count. And that's exactly what we saw. That won't happen every quarter, but we did expect to see it in the first quarter and that's what we saw.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Thank you.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Shannon, we have time for one more call \u2013 question.","Operator","And the final question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Thank you for taking my questions. A question on Investment Management. So, the fee rates has been pretty stable to slightly improving and part of it I believe is from the mix shift towards the fixed income. I guess at a high-level, like, how much better is your average fee rates for your inflows versus your average fee rates for your outflows?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Humphrey, it's Steve. I'll address your question. We've seen secular pressure on fees in the Investment Management industry overall. And actually, that's been not just in the active space, but also in the passive space. There's been considerable fee compression. In the face of that, we've been able to keep actually pretty stable fees overall in our book. Now \u2013 and to address your question, rather than speak about the fee rate on outflows versus fee rate on inflows, I'd point out, we have not been immune in all portions of our platform to fee compression. That's not where our stable fee rate comes from. We've experienced that fee compression in various parts of our platform, in particular, in retail portions. However, we have been able to draw flows into higher fee-yielding strategies in \u2013 particularly in fixed income, as you mentioned, and in other areas as well such as real estate. So given the multi-manager model and given our ability to draw flows into a variety of strategies, including ones that yield higher fees, we feel well positioned to compete even in this period of secular pressure on fees.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. And then just a follow-up question to Tom's earlier question on long-term care. So you mentioned there's 6 billion for reserves. Is that GAAP or Stat?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","That was Stat.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay, and then would the reserves be kind of similar to the split between the Group and the Individual side, one-third\/two-thirds, or how should we think about that?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So remember the size of the book is \u2013 yeah, if you look at the two-thirds versus one-third that would be probably a pretty good indicator. I don't have the number off the top of my head, Humphrey, but I think it's \u2013 we'll have someone follow up with you specifically, but I would think about it being roughly that order of magnitude, because they're both relatively nascent books.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay, got it.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential this morning are John Strangfeld, Chief Executive; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Rich Carbone, Chief Financial Officer; Ed Baird, Head of International Operations; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International -- Head of Domestic Operations; and Peter Sayre, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.","Before we get started, In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the fourth quarter of 2012, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, in managing our businesses, we use a non-GAAP measure we call Adjusted Operating Income to measure the performance of our Financial Services businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses, as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments, as well as results from divested businesses. Adjusted operating income also excludes recorded changes in asset values that are expected to ultimately accrue to contract holders and recorded changes in contract holder liabilities, resulting from changes in related asset values. Our earnings press release contains information about our definition of adjusted operating income. The comparable GAAP presentation and the reconciliation between the 2 for the quarter are set out in our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website.","John?","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Now that we've closed the books on 2012, I'll kick things off with some high-level comments on the year as a whole.","First, earnings. Earnings per share, based on adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses, were $6.27 compared to $5.83 a year ago. This is an increase of about 8%. If you remove the market-driven and discrete items in business integration costs we've disclosed each quarter, which Rich and Mark will review with you for the fourth quarter, the EPS increase will still be about 8%. This is because these items reduced pretax adjusted operating income by roughly $200 million in 2011 and again in 2012.","Second, financial strengths. In capital positions of our U.S. and Japanese insurance companies continue to meet the high standards, we believe AA, we've managed them to, as you will hear from Rich shortly.  We have capacity to remain strongly capitalized even in stressed environments. We've improved our ratio of capital debt to total capitalization, it is under 25% at year end, and the quality of our investment portfolio has never been better.","With this strong financial position, we're able to consider potential deals, but we will do so with great care and selectivity. We believe our acquisition of the Hartford's Individual Life business, which closed in January, offers attractive financial returns, strategic benefits, talent enhancements and manageable execution risk. We like our prospects with this, yet we know we need to prove it out.","We also remain in the market for opportunities to add outsized organic growth, particularly in the area of pension risk transfer. We closed our transactions with GM and Verizon in the fourth quarter, and we will consider additional transactions on a case-by-case basis. At the same time, we take a balanced approach to investing in businesses and returning capital to our shareholders. During 2012, we returned about $650 million of capital through our share repurchase program, and an additional $750 million through our common stock dividend. We intend to declare quarterly dividends starting with the first quarter of 2013.","Third, commercial momentum. We're a leader in the markets in which we've chosen to compete. Our retirement business achieved record account values last year, reflecting the major pension risk transfer transactions I mentioned, as well as continued strong sales of investment-only stable products. AUM has declined to a record high in Asset Management, as institutional and retail net flows over the past year amounted to $30 billion.","In annuities, the products we're offering reflect today's market environment. We believe they provide our clients an attractive value proposition and our shareholders, appropriate returns and risk. We believe the Hartford's Life acquisition will produce attractive returns, as well as enhanced distribution and excellent talent for our Individual Life business. And as for Group Insurance, we are confident we will resolve recent performance issues and we will fix this business, a business which remains a significant participant in these markets.","Finally, International Insurance continues to benefit from expanded distribution across multiple channels, and from successful integration of Star and Edison.","So to conclude, we turn the page on another year. We feel that we have a good head of steam as we begin 2013. We have high expectations for ourselves this year and we look forward to reviewing our progress with you as the quarters unfold.","With that, I will turn it over to Rich.","Richard J. Carbone","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night we reported common stock earnings per share of $1.69 for the fourth quarter. And that's based on adjusted operating income for the Financial Services business. This compares to $1.78 per share in the year-ago quarter, and that's also on a reported basis.","And as you -- we saw from your reports, there was a lot of activity during the quarter. Market driven and discrete items were as follows: In the Annuities business, market performance relative to our assumptions caused us to release a portion of our reserves for guaranteed minimum debt to income benefits and led to a favorable DAC unlocking. These items are partially offset by a write-down of capitalized software costs for a net benefit of $0.06 per share; in Retirement, the favorable legal settlement related to previous losses on client investments managed by a third party produced a benefit of $0.11 per share; in Asset Management, we recorded a gain on a sale of a previously impaired investment that was partially offset by a write-down of capitalized software cost and net benefit of $0.05 per share; in Individual Life, we incurred costs relating to the Hartford's Life acquisition that closed in January, resulting in a charge of $0.02 per share; in Group Insurance, we increased legal reserves, resulting in a charge of $0.03 per share; in International Insurance, Gibraltar Life absorbed integration cost of $0.01 per share relating to the Star\/Edison acquisition; in Corporate and Other results included costs of $0.08 per share charge reflecting a catch-up adjustment for accrued employee benefit liabilities, in addition, we recorded a $0.02 per share charge to write off bond issuance costs on high coupon debts we redeemed prior to maturity. In total, the items I just mentioned have a net favorable impact of about $0.06 per share on the fourth quarter results.","In the year-ago quarter, market driven and discrete items produced a net benefit of about $0.26 per share, mainly driven by favorable unlockings related to the 11% S&P 500 increase, and a gain on our sale of a stake in a Mexican private fund manager.","Taking these items out of both the current and the year-ago quarters, the EPS comparison would be $1.63 for the current quarter versus $1.52 for the year-ago quarter, an increase of about 7%. This improvement in earnings reflects organic business growth, cost synergies from the Star\/Edison acquisition and the initial contribution from the pension risk transfer business that came onboard in November and December. These contributions were partially offset by higher-than-normal level of expenses in several of our U.S. businesses during the current quarter. We estimate an expenses over baseline or run rate levels, including such items as fund, start-up costs and asset management and costs for process improvements across several businesses and a negative impact of about $0.14 per share on current quarter results. A favorable catch-up in our effective tax rate in the quarter mitigated about half of this impact. And Mark will discuss much more of the details of our businesses in a few minutes.","Moving to the GAAP results of the Financial Services business. We reported a net loss of $214 million or $0.48 per share for the fourth quarter. This compares to net income of $522 million or $1.08 per share a year ago. The GAAP net loss for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $1.7 billion, pretax. This compares to $598 million of pretax net realized investment losses in the year-ago quarter. The main driver of this $1.7 billion in net realized losses was $1.5 billion of losses from asset and liability value changes, driven by currency fluctuations. These currency-driven losses primarily represent changes in the value of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese companies, whose functional currency is the yen. During the quarter, the yen weakened in relation to the currencies of these products, causing us to record a loss in the income statement, since it will take more yen to pay off the liabilities. We consider this noneconomic because the liabilities are appropriately matched with investments in the currencies in which they will be settled. Said another way, the value in yen of these investments increased along with the liabilities. Loss in the income statement is offset by a gain in the OCI, a component of equity, but not through the income statement with the end result to GAAP equity is essentially unaffected, despite the volatility in reported net income.","The remaining $200 million of the $1.7 billion of realized losses includes net losses of $134 million from product related embedded derivatives and hedging activities and $59 million of impairments and real credit losses.","Book value per share on a GAAP basis amounted to $79.19 at year-end. This compares to $69.07 a year earlier. As of year-end, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturities were $2.1 billion, down from $4.3 billion a year ago. And we were in a net unrealized gain position of roughly $19 billion. Excluding AOCI, book value per share amounted to $57.86 at year-end. And this compares to $58.39 a year ago. The comparison of our book value on this basis is affected by the accounting geography mismatch from the asset and liability changes driven by currency fluctuations that I just mentioned earlier. This accounting mismatch reduced book value by approximately $2.40.","Now turning to our capital position. First, I'll focus on insurance companies. We are continuing to manage these companies to what we believe are double-edged standards. Prudential Insurance began the year with an RBC of 491. Our statutory results for 2012 are not final. We estimate that RBC for Prudential Insurance as of year end 2012 will be in excess of our 400% threshold, after paying a $600 million dividend to the holding company.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life each reported solvency margins comfortably above their targets, as of their most recent statutory reporting date, which was September 30, 2012. I'm confident that the end of this current fiscal year which ends March 31, 2013, our Japanese companies will continue to report strong solvency margins, relative to targets. Looking at the overall capital position of the Financial Services business, we calculate, as you know, we calculated our balance sheet capital capacity for the Financial Services business by comparing the statutory capital position and Prudential insurance to a full 100 RBC ratio threshold, and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries.","We began 2012 with on balance sheet capital capacity that we estimated is in the range of $4 -- $4 billion to $4.5 billion. During the year, we added about $3 billion of capital, essentially driven by earnings excluding GAAP charges that do not affect our capital capacity, most notably the FX measurement I just spoke about. And we deployed a total of about $2 billion to fund capital needs of our businesses, including asset adequacy testing reserves.","In addition, we returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders through our share repurchase program and our common stock dividend. This year's dividend of $1.60 represented a 10% increase from the 2011 annual dividend, and we would pay in quarterly dividends starting in the first quarter of 2013.","We also used a portion of this capital capacity to reduce our leverage. The net results of these activities brought on balance sheet capital capacity to roughly $3 billion as of year end, before funding the Hartford's life acquisition. Including about $1.5 billion to $2 billion that we estimate is readily deployable, a modest increase from our -- from the estimates that we have provided you back in November.","Turning to the cash position at the parent. At year-end, cash and short-term investments at the parent company, net of outstanding commercial paper, was in excess of $5 billion. We utilized a portion of this cash in January to fund the $615 million ceding commission to Hartford's Life -- for the Hartford's Life acquisition, I should say, and to repay about $1.2 billion of maturing debt. The remaining cash in excess of our targeted $1.2 billion of liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing debt and fund operating expenses.","And now Mark is going to review more of the details of our businesses.","Mark B. Grier","Thank you, John; and thank you, Rich. I'll start with our U.S. businesses. Our annuity business reported adjusted operating income of $304 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $373 million a year ago. The reserve true-ups, DAC unlocking that Rich mentioned, had a net favorable impact of $57 million on current quarter results. The benefit to current quarter results was mainly driven by market performance in relation to our assumptions, which reflect the lower assumed long-term rates of return that we implemented in connection with our annual actuarial review in the third quarter. The market performance we consider reflects both the fixed income and equity elements of the particular funds underlying our customer accounts. This benefit was partly offset by a $9 million charge for impairment of capitalized software costs.","Results for the year-ago quarter included a net benefit of $176 million from a favorable DAC unlocking and reserve true-ups, largely driven by strong equity markets in that quarter. Stripping out the unlockings and true-ups and the current quarter software impairment, annuity results were $256 million for the current quarter, compared to $197 million a year ago or a $59 million increase. This increase reflects higher fees driven by account value growth, with average separate account values for variable annuities up by $23 billion from a year ago. Higher expenses were a partial offset to a benefit from our growing base of fees. Current quarter results include costs of $17 million that we estimate to be in excess of a baseline level for our current business volume. This is for items including business process improvements in areas such as technology and back-office functions that are intended to give us a more efficient cost structure going forward. As Rich mentioned, these types of costs affect the current quarter results of several of our businesses.","Our gross variable annuity sales for the quarter were $3.8 billion compared to $4.4 billion a year ago and down substantially from $5.9 billion in the third quarter. The lower level of current quarter sales reflects actions we have taken to adapt our products to the current environment. In August, we launched HDI 2.0, an updated version of our product with an increase in writer fees, a higher minimum issue wage and lower payout rates than the earlier product. We also withdrew our x shares, or bonus product, over the summer. And in September, we suspended acceptance of subsequent premiums on generations of products offered before 2011.","We filed a prospective late last month for a further update of our variable annuity product, which we expect to roll out later this month. The new product, HDI 2.1, will limit the 5% roll-up period for protected withdrawal value to a maximum of 10 years, and reduce payout rates at various age bands, while retaining writer fees at 100 basis points for individual contracts, and 110 basis points for spousal contracts, and continuing our highest daily value proposition, backed by auto-rebalancing tailored to the risk profile of each individual contract. We believe the updated product will continue to be attractive to clients focused on retirement income security, while offering appropriate return prospects in the current interest rate environment and contributing to the improvement of our risk profile.","The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $225 million for the current quarter, compared to $100 million a year ago. Current quarter results include a benefit of $78 million from recovery under a settlement of losses we recorded in 2007, attributed to client funds managed by a third party. Excluding this recovery, results of the Retirement business are up by $7 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited by about $40 million from the greater contribution from net investment results from institutional investment products, largely representing the initial results from the 2 major pension risk transfer transactions that we closed in November and December. This contribution and higher fees driven by growth in account values were partly offset by a lower contribution from net investment results associated with our Full Service products reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment yields over the course of the past year, and the loss of spread income on bank deposits that we transferred to third parties in connection with our decision to restructure our savings and loan to a trust-only organization.","In addition, higher current quarter expenses affected the comparison of results to a year ago. Current quarter results include approximately $16 million of costs that we estimate to be in excess of a baseline level for the current business volume in Retirement, for items including business process improvements, as I mentioned earlier.","Total Retirement sales and deposits for the quarter were $43.1 billion, including $33.6 billion for the General Motors and Verizon pension risk transfer transactions. The General Motors and Verizon transactions added over 150,000 retirees to the base of more than 3.5 million individuals covered by our group annuities, and brought our total group annuity account values to more than $60 billion at year-end. These groundbreaking transactions improve the balance of risks in our businesses, enhance our return prospects by deploying capital in a business that we know well, and build our leadership potential in a market where we see great opportunity.","Excluding the General Motors and Verizon transactions, gross sales and deposits were $9.5 billion in the current quarter, compared to $14.7 billion a year ago. The decrease is mainly a result of lower current quarter standalone sales of stable value wrap products to planned sponsors and fund managers, which contributed $5.3 billion in the current quarter and $8.8 billion in the year-ago quarter to sales of our institutional investment products. These sales are mainly driven by large case business and tend to be lumpy from 1 quarter to another. In addition, sales for the year-ago quarter included $1.6 billion from 2 longevity reinsurance cases, another emerging area in the pension risk transfer market.","Full service retirement gross deposits and sales were $3.9 billion in the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. We continue to see limited activity in the mid- to large-case market, which is our major focus. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $139 million for the current quarter, compared to $256 million a year ago. Current quarter results include a $9 million charge for impairment of capitalized software costs, while results for the year-ago quarter benefited by $96 million from the sale of our stake in a private pension fund manager in Mexico. We have reclassified results from our international investments businesses including this sale to the Asset Management segment to reflect our alignment of the management of these businesses. Excluding these items, the Asset Management business produced adjusted operating income of $148 million for the current quarter, compared to $160 million a year ago. The contribution to results from what we call other related revenues, which encompasses incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, increased by $13 million from a year ago, as the $41 million benefit to current quarter results from the sale of a real estate related investment that Rich mentioned, was largely offset by less favorable results from co-investments and lower performance-based fees.","Stripping out the discrete items I mentioned, and results from activities that come under the heading of other related revenues, adjusted operating income from the Asset Management business was down $25 million from a year ago, as higher expenses in the current quarter more than offset the benefit of higher asset management fees driven by growth in assets under management.","Current quarter results include approximately $49 million of costs that we estimate to be in excess of a baseline level. With the largest single item being about $20 million for costs associated with the launch of a new closed-end mutual fund. The segment's assets under management stood at $827 billion as of year-end, up about $110 billion or 15% from a year earlier.","Adjusted operating income for our Individual Life Insurance business was $99 million for the current quarter, compared to $138 million a year ago. Current quarter results include a charge of $15 million relating to our acquisition of the Hartford's Individual Life business that we closed in early January, mainly representing transaction costs. Excluding this charge, results from Individual Life were down $24 million from a year ago. This decrease reflected higher expenses, including non-deferrable of costs associated with a substantially higher sales level in the current quarter. In addition, results for the year-ago quarter benefited by approximately $10 million from reduced amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other items driven by favorable separate account performance, relative to our assumptions, mainly due to the 11% increase in the S&P 500 in that quarter.","Individual Life Insurance sales based on annualized new business premiums amounted to $144 million for the current quarter, up from $75 million a year ago. The increase was driven by strong current quarter universal life sales through third-party distribution, and reflects our improved competitive position as some key competitors have recently raised rates or withdrawn products from the market, together with our expanding distributions through banks and wirehouses, as well as accelerated purchases of these products as we implemented price increases during the fourth quarter.","The Group Insurance business reported a loss of $12 million in the current quarter, compared to adjusted operating income of $42 million a year ago. Current quarter results include a charge of $20 million to increase legal reserves. Excluding this charge, Group Insurance results are down $34 million from a year ago. The decrease reflected less favorable group life underwriting results in comparison to a very strong contribution in the year-ago quarter, as well as higher expenses. Current quarter expenses include approximately $18 million of costs that we estimate to be in excess of a baseline level for items including business process improvements. Group Insurance results continue to reflect unfavorable performance from our Disability business. The actions we are taking to address this performance include enhancements of claims management, pricing discipline on new business and repricing of cases that are up for renewal. For example, from mid to large cases, which constitutes about 3\/4 of our Group Disability premiums in force, we repriced about 1\/3 of the business in the period from February 2012 through the January 1, 2013, renewal date per calendar year of business, with average rate increases in the low double digits.","Group Insurance sales for the quarter were $58 million compared to $69 million a year ago, with the entire decline driven by Group Disability. Most of our Group Insurance sales are recorded in the first quarter, based on the effective date of the business.","Turning now to our international businesses. Gibraltar Life's adjusted operating income was $315 million in the current quarter, compared to $202 million a year ago. With all major aspects of the Star\/Edison business integration now completed or nearing completion, Gibraltar's results for the current quarter absorbed $10 million of integration cost compared to $94 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding integration costs, Gibraltar's adjusted operating income was $325 million for the current quarter, compared to $296 million a year ago. Current quarter results reflect about $50 million of cost savings achieved thus far as a result of the business integration, compared to about $10 million of early saves that benefited the year-ago quarter. We remain well on track to achieve our targeted annual cost savings of about $250 million after the business integration is fully completed.","In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of our hedging program, contributed $16 million to the increase in earnings from a year ago. The benefit of continued business growth was more than offset in the comparison of results by a less favorable level of policy benefits, mainly reflecting mortality experience, better than our average expectations in the year-ago quarter, and higher expenses in the current quarter largely driven by items such as technology upgrades, which tend to be nonlinear.","Our Life Planner business reported adjusted operating income of $332 million for the current quarter, compared to $300 million a year ago. The increase came mainly from continued business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up by 8% from a year ago. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates contributed about $13 million to the increase in earnings from a year ago.","International Insurance sales, on a constant dollar basis, amounted to $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, compared to $829 million a year ago. Sales from Gibraltar life were $806 million in the current quarter, compared to $542 million a year ago. Current quarter sales include $429 million from our Single Premium yen-based whole life bank channel product, compared to $41 million a year ago. This sales surge, continuing from the third quarter, reflected actions by competitors earlier in the year which limited the alternatives available to bank customers with significant funds available for investment in life insurance products. In order to limit our concentration in this product, then maintain appropriate returns, we have implemented crediting reductions and reduced commission rates, effective January 1 of this year.","Along with taking actions to manage the mix of our bank channel sales, we have also broadened our distribution, commencing sales in December through SMBC, one of Japan's megabanks. With the addition of SMBC, we are now distributing through each of Japan's 4 largest banks, with our main focus on death protection products. Excluding the bank channel's Single Premium product, Gibraltar's current quarter sales were $377 million, compared to $501 million a year ago. The decrease reflected acceleration of sales into the first half of the year, as we anticipated, due to a tax law change in April that affected our cancer whole life product and crediting rate reductions that we implemented in the second quarter for our U.S. dollar retirement and whole life products.","Life planner sales were $283 million in the current quarter, compared to $287 million a year ago. Sales by life planners in Japan amounted to $192 million, down $10 million from a year ago. This reflected a decrease of $38 million in our sales of cancer whole life product and U.S. dollar products, reflecting the acceleration of sales into the earlier part of the year due to the tax law change and our crediting rate reductions. Life Planner sales outside of Japan were $91 million, up from $85 million a year ago.","Corporate and other operations reported a loss of $371 million for the current quarter, compared to a $285 million loss a year ago. As Rich mentioned, the current quarter loss includes a $54 million charge to increase our recorded liabilities for employee benefits based on completion of a review, and a $15 million charge to write off bond issuance costs for debt that we redeemed prior to maturity. Excluding these items, the Corporate and Other loss was $302 million in the current quarter, or $17 million greater than a year ago. The greater loss in the current quarter was driven by higher interest costs, mainly reflecting our deployment of capital debt in our businesses.","To sum up, I'd say we've made solid progress over the past year toward the achievement of our longer-term objectives. In the annuities business, we've adapted our products to the current environment, maintaining our compelling value proposition while improving our return prospects and our risk profile. In Retirement, we've built our leadership position in the pension risk transfer market with 2 major groundbreaking transactions totaling more than $30 billion in account values. In the Asset Management business, we've grown our base of fee producing assets under management with $30 billion of institutional and retail net flows over the past year. We've strengthened our Individual Life business with the Hartford Life acquisition, gaining strategic benefits in distribution and talent, as well as solid financial prospects. We've taken steps to improve our Group Insurance results, including a change in the management team, discontinuation of long-term care sales, product repricing and enhancement of claims management. And our International business continues to perform well, benefiting from the successful integration of the Star and Edison businesses and business growth across multiple channels.","Thank you for your interest in Prudential today, and I'll turn it back to John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thanks, Mark. Before we move on to your questions, I'd like to make a few final remarks on our results and our strategic progress. As we have discussed, despite what was admittedly a noisy quarter for us, you've heard numerous indicators of very sound fundamentals. And by many measures, we've had a strong year, both in terms of current year results and at future positioning. We've managed pricing discipline, expense and product initiatives and capital deployment to position us well going forward. Our view of earnings power and our potential to achieve and sustain a meaningfully differentiated return in our sector is reinforced by the actions that we took in 2012. The improvement in organic performance, the impact of substantial business flows, beneficial new deals and initiatives, coupled with the core strengths of our company give us confidence in the future. Realistically speaking, there will continue to be some noise. And going forward, as in the past, we will continue to ensure that our underlying performance is clear to you, as we report to discuss our results, which leads me to one other point. When we gave you our guidance for 2013 earnings and ROE last November, we had in mind the impact of FX remeasurement on retained earnings, as of September. We will not consider ourselves to have achieved our ROE goal to the extent that it was made possible by reductions in equity from currency remeasurement. We will make the apples-to-apples comparisons for you. And similarly, our compensation plans will also reflect this alignment. In other words, we won't be declaring victory based on the impact of things like the FX revaluation, rather, as we have said often, we will get there the right way or not there at all, and we believe that we are on a good track.","So with that, we'd like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess if we could just talk a little bit about the International business. And you outlined some of the higher expenses that affected earnings this quarter. Just hoping you could give a little bit more color on what these costs were, and what, if any, of these expenses are likely to continue. And then as we think about modeling this business, what type of seasonality should we expect in earnings in 2013?","Edward P. Baird","Yes. Erik, this is Ed Baird. There were, in this quarter, the kinds of seasonal factors, as well as normal fluctuations that, frankly, you're going to find in almost every quarter. How while some of these have a certain regularity to them, others do not. So, for example, on the IT, it was lumpier in this quarter, but the totality for the year of the IT expenses was still well within the budget. So I would just caution on taking the result of this quarter, or any 1 quarter, and trying to do a straight linear extrapolation from there. I think you'll find it more fruitful if you look at the totality of it for the year. And if you do that, I think you'll find something more reliable that's particularly true on the earnings, but it's even true if get over on to the sales side.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, within the businesses, are there seasonal trends in terms of whether it's investment income or dividend payments or other things that we should expect to recur?","Edward P. Baird","Yes. Just to drill down on that. If you think in simplistic terms, as the money coming in and the money going out, it's sort of 2 channels on each of them. On the money coming inside of it, there is certain seasonality or other causes of fluctuations. So for instance, on the premium, particularly these days, where there's more of a shift away from recurring premium to Single Premium or to advance pay, so that can start to cause, on a quarter-on-quarter, some fluctuation on the incoming premium. Secondly, as your question touches a point, you can get the same on investments beyond a normal shift that can take place naturally from quarter-to-quarter. You do get, for example, in the third quarter, you tend to get more dividends. So if you're doing a third to fourth quarter sequential comparison, you're going to see some downward pressure there, that is actually completely natural, and not indicative of any broader story. And the same's going to be true, on sort of 2 channels with the outflow, and you already raised one of them, one would be around expenses, you're going to see quarter-to-quarter, certain natural fluctuations that can be caused simply by scheduling. That's particularly true when you've got major projects going on, such as the Star\/Edison integration, with those kinds of expenses, are naturally going to have a certain lumpiness to them. And you can even get it in the mortality, with a book this big, quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see certain fluctuations in mortality, but I would observe that this quarter, as, frankly, with all the others we have seen during the year, it's well within standard deviation. And so, if you're comparing 1 quarter to a prior quarter, one could be at the high-end, one that's a lower end, but there is no underlying trend there that I would know or bring attention to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, just with the $100 million of expense that's above your baseline, should we read those as onetime in nature, impacting any fourth quarter results? Or will some of those expenditures continue through 2013?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure, Nigel, this is Charlie. I think the former is true. We did take about $100 million, as you said, above the baseline charges. But I think we wouldn't have lined those off if we didn't think they were onetimers. And to give you some examples of what they were, and Mark gave a couple, but one would be the final formation fees that we had for $19 million in the fourth quarter, the $33 million for the year. A second would be increased costs and Retirement. That should make the Full Service business more competitive, we're always looking to do that. And third are some technology and back-office expenses in annuities that will improve both expense management, and I think the product itself over time. So these are just 3 examples of the kinds of things that we think were nonrecurring, and that's why we lined them off.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, secondly is capital. Rich, you mentioned your capital estimates included what was necessary to satisfy the asset adequacy test. Is it possible to put some numbers around how much capital that absorbed and which business lines that related to? I'm presuming it's predominantly long-term care, but was it related to other business lines as well?","Edward P. Baird","It was predominantly long-term care, it was about $1 billion that we added.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess going back to some of Rich's earlier comments, and maybe just thinking out to '13 on capital generation. Obviously, there's a lot going on, you have 2 PVRT transactions that are large, good cash flow generated out of those; you have the Hartford integration, you have lower Star\/Edison costs. How should we think about capital generation in '13, vis-\u00e0-vis historically giving relationships of capital generation to operating earnings?","Edward P. Baird","We haven't quite fine-tuned that yet, but I think the 50% rule that we've been throwing out lately, that 50% of our cash flow is available to the holding company, and some of that's going to pay holding company expenses, but some of that is also going to emerge as excess capital during the year.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So 50% and then you pay Hold Co. costs and interest costs?","Edward P. Baird","Right.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. I guess I want to go back to be Single Premium yen-denominated whole life product. It was up sequentially, something like $100 million in production. I think the last quarter, Ed, you talked about it, the margins being in your target, but maybe at the lower end of that range. Just looking at the production levels, I guess, how do you feel about the margins on that product, kind of taking a deeper look at it? And where do you think the margins will go as you reprice and take the commissions down?","Edward P. Baird","Yes, Mark, this is Ed. The character of the bank channel is different than our other channels that are captive, in that it has the capacity to produce much more dramatic growth than you can get through a captive agency system. And that's why, as we described at our Tokyo Investor Day, our strategy there's a little bit different than in our core captive agency systems. The goal is the same in all of our channels, and that is profitable growth. And in the bank channel, that requires more careful and frequent monitoring, because of the capacity to have major sales in a relatively short period of time. Now each of our products contributes to the high ROE and to that balance between growth and profitability in a different way. But we're very careful with the bank to be at the conservative side, both with product design and the pricing. And again, we try and briefly recap some of the things we got into in detail in our Tokyo Day. What we do is both on the design of the product and in pricing, we're very conservative. So on pricing side, we endeavor to be at low end, if not frankly at the bottom, in terms of crediting rate and other aspects of the design. That, in turn, allows us to be equally conservative in our investment portfolio. And I'm sure you're aware that our portfolio, compared to others, is considerably more conservative, both in terms of its ALM matching in terms of not taking a currency bet, in terms of the matching on the currency. So right across the board, we're more careful there. So when we saw in this quarter the rise, what we did was we moved very quickly to ensure that we would bring down our position from a comparative and competitive perspective, so that going into this next quarter, you will see us positioned again towards the more conservative end. So it sounds like you're already aware that we did adjust downward both the implied crediting rate, the commission rate, we also put in just as a back stop, sort of an overall maximum as to how much we would distribute during any 1 quarter, in order to address the issue that Mark raised in his opening comments, which is just to make sure we don't have any concentration of risk in any particular tranche of business that's coming in during the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to touch base on a couple of items. The first is, Mark, could you provide us your updated views on Pru potentially being designated an non-bank SIFI?","Mark B. Grier","Yes, as you know, from our acknowledgments, we're in the process of being reviewed by the FSOC, ultimately leading up to the FSOC level right now at the staff level. And I would reinforce what we've said before, which is that we're engaged in a high-quality process that includes a lot of effort, a lot of work and a lot of engagement, and the opportunity for us to address issues that we think are important here has been ample. We don't believe, as you've heard us say before, that the quantitative evidence will lead to a conclusion that we're a SIFI, but we're not sure exactly what other considerations there might be in the process, so we're putting our best foot forward and working hard on where this may go. Just a reminder, before I move on to one other comment, there are other things in the arena of SIFI going on, the designation as a Global SIFI, for example, would also impact our relationship here as a domestic SIFI and with the Federal Reserve as a regulator, so that's also out there. And that process is continuing as well during the first half of this year. And at some point that you've heard me make before is that it's more important that we get this right than which label we put on it, so we're also actively engaged in discussions around solvency and capital standards and the process by which we might be assessed and measured by any group supervisor that may come out of either domestic SIFI or global SIFI or ComFrame or someplace else, as one of these other processes moves along looking at large companies like Prudential. So I don't have a specific update, and I'm not going to handicap the odds, but I would say that we're engaged in a high-quality process, and we also have the opportunity to provide our reports and our comments, and right now as well to work hard on the questions around solvency and capital standards.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Understood. And then related to that, there's, I believe, $250 million with share repurchase authorizations still existing through the first half of 2013. Prudential did not repurchase stock in the fourth quarter. Do you anticipate that Prudential will achieve that $250 million of buyback in the first half?","Richard J. Carbone","Yes. It's Rich.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm sorry? I didn't catch that.","Mark B. Grier","Yes. Rich Carbone answered that.","Richard J. Carbone","Yes. It's Rich. I'm sorry for the short comment.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to cover the Life Planner business in Japan. I understand that you've had some pretty good results there for the first 3 quarters of the year, but they did stall a little bit in the fourth quarter. And I did listen to the conversation about seasonality and some of the -- the fluctuations, the natural fluctuations in that business. But I'm just wondering if you could just give us a little bit more information on where some of the weaker spots, where, I mean, you still delivered growth in earnings, but it was -- you had double-digit growth in prior quarters, and this is was about 6%, as I calculated, on an adjusted basis.","Edward P. Baird","Yes, Joanne, I would go back to the earlier comment about being careful for the quarter. It has a lot to do with simply the timing. If you look at the year for the Life Planner model, you'll find that they had an extraordinarily strong year. So that both sales and earnings, up in strong double digits in the 20% range, and what's healthy about the sales, I would comment on, is the character of it. What I mean by that is, it's coming across evenly through all 3 sources of drivers. In other words, we're seeing both a growth in the headcount of about 4%, 3% to 4%; we're seeing growth in productivity; and we're also seeing growth in average premium, which is a brighter trend that we've highlighted in the past. That's also true in our Gibraltar business, and that's reflective of the fact that the retirement and gradually tapping into the higher income group of the aging population. So both the quality of the sales and the quality of earnings in POJ on an annual basis, I think you'll find to be extremely strong. I cannot find anything in the fourth quarter that's outside the normal range in which there might be embedded a story.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Okay. And just on the Gibraltar business, I know that it's probably a little bit premature to be talking about M&A at this juncture, but it seems that the Star and Edison integration has gone quite smoothly. You're realizing a lot of the synergies, the expense synergies already. I was wondering if you could just kind of give us an outline of what the M&A landscape looks like in Japan and the rest of the Asian region, if you have any interest in that?","Edward P. Baird","Sure. Let me start with a broad, sort of philosophical approach to the M&A. Our general preference is to acquire companies in countries that we're already in, such as the Star\/Edison acquisitions. We have a long, and I think, fairly stated successful track record in that type of acquisition. So we always look for those, Japan, Korea, those kinds of countries would be places that we would be open to for that. But in addition, we also consider the possibility of entering new markets that we would do, as Mark expressed earlier in his conversation, on a careful and selective basis. But a cautious expansion of the footprint is something that we would consider. And so, and geographically, they would be in the kind of regions you've referenced. The intrinsic growth rates that are possible in Southeast Asian and in Latin America are places that interest us. We're not really interested, in general, in the mature markets of Western Europe, where we don't have any meaningful presence unto which we could alter business. But getting back to the core part of your question of Japan, specifically. Yes, at the moment, our group is still quite actively engaged although successfully over the major hump, with the integrations of Star and Edison, we do keep an open mind, looking at a kind of companies there. It will be interesting to see, now that the new solvency margin rules are out, whether or not that puts a certain degree of pressure on some companies that, under the old measures, I had adequate solvency margins, but under these new, more stringent solvency measures, may not feel quite so comfortable. So we do continue to monitor that, having made a handful of acquisitions there over the last decade. We do have a certain degree of quiet confidence about our abilities there.","Operator","We'll continue on to the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about the 4 currency hedging program, and how it's running through earnings. And I think what we saw in the quarter was that the yen, kind of hedge rate of 85 on the dollar, was the reason that you saw kind of positive cash flows into the Japanese businesses. In the guidance for 2013, I think assumes the yen at 80. So that the first part of the question is, is that 80 kind of where you're hedged at for the yen for 2013?","Richard J. Carbone","It's Rich Carbone. Yes, we're hedged to the 80 for 2013.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then when -- how should we think about that going forward if the yen continues to weaken? When do you, kind of restrike those hedges, and how should we think about it, the yen stays at 95, or goes to 100, what would be a reasonable expectation of where that might have to float up to, thinking about 2014?","Richard J. Carbone","So let me just give you a little bit of background, right? Half of our earnings that come out of Japan are in dollars, U.S. dollars and Aussie dollars; and half of our earnings that come out of Japan are in yen. We hedge 100% of the next year's earnings, the yen earnings, completely. So 2013, fully hedged at 80, no impact of the declining yen, regardless of where it goes. 2014, we are 78% hedged as of today. 2015, we are 22% hedged for 2015. And as this year progresses, we begin to leg in to '14 and '15 and '16, so by the end of 2013, we'll be 100% hedged in, for '14.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And the 78% in '14 and the 22% at '15, that's at 80, right?","Richard J. Carbone","That is not at 80 because, remember, you're not hedging at spot rates, you're hedging at forward rates, and so you're averaging in the forward rate, and that's going to change, dependent upon the interest rate differential between the dollar, the interest rate differential between U.S. interest rates and Japanese interest rates, that's hard to predict, where we sit here today.","John Robert Strangfeld","And it's rolling 3 years forward, so it will not all have gone on at the same time. There's an ongoing program, so it won't match exactly the 80. As Rich said, it's a forward rates, not spot, and it's a rolling implementation.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So in my -- I guess, in layman's terms, though, it would be reasonable to expect that, that wherever your hedge, hedged, if the yen weakens materially, let's say it's goes to 100 or 105, you should be able to keep your hedging level below that because you're lagging into it over time?","Richard J. Carbone","That's correct. And we are using forwards rates, not spots, right? We're hedging at the forward, not the spot, which is lower than the spot. Well, having said that, just, it will run its course, at the end of the day. The hedge is rolled forward 3 years from the current year, so we'll be renewing hedges now further out into '14, for example, that are at rates that are not as attractive as 80.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","No, understood. I mean, I think this, simplistically, people worry about half the business coming from Japan and what the impact is, so I just wanted to clarify kind of the structure of the yen currency hedge, so that's all.","Richard J. Carbone","Yes, but half the business that's coming from Japan is in dollars, so...","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","No, I don't -- understood. Yes, I mean, I think that -- I mean, the dollar piece is the dollar piece, but the yen piece is what would move the translation, right, so...","Richard J. Carbone","Absolutely. Yes.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","This is a follow-up to Randy's question. So if half of your business in Japan is in U.S. dollars and Aussie dollars, what is the impact of demand for products denominated in those currencies, in a weakening yen environment?","Edward P. Baird","The dollar products have represented, for a while, somewhere between 30% and 40% of our sales. And if you look back over, oh, probably the last 5 years, what you'll see is that there isn't a strong correlation between the currency shift, to the extent that I could find any -- and this isn't much of a trend, it tends to be that when the yen is strengthening, they'll tend to go more to the dollar. And when it's not, maybe less to it. But I'd be careful about that, I don't want to overplay that because, again, we have been selling dollar denominated retirement income product as a lead product in Japan for about 7 years now, and I've not seen material fluctuations based on what has, over that period of time, obviously, been very substantial swings in the exchange rate.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","All right. And does the weakening yen impact the SMR for your Japan companies at all?","Richard J. Carbone","Let me think of where it would. No. I don't believe it does.","John Robert Strangfeld","No, it doesn't. We're protected on the local books.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Jeff Schuman of KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I understood Rich correctly, you gave us a picture of capital capacity at 12\/31, which I think was $3 billion on balance sheet, $1.5 billion to $2 billion readily deployable, but I think you said that was before Hartford. So can you help us pro forma that? I mean, we know you wrote the check for the ceding commission, but we don't really know, all in, what was the impact to capital capacity. So can you help us there, please?","Richard J. Carbone","I think the way you ought to think about that is that, we're going to write the check, the check's going to take down, for that moment in time, the check's going take down our capital capacity. We're going to rebuild that capital capacity by only buying back the 250 of shares during the year and -- during the first quarter, excuse me, the first half, sorry, the first half. And then -- I don't want to mislead you there. And then, the retained earnings billed, will restore our capital capacity at some point throughout the year.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So you're telling me that will rebuild, but I guess I'm -- are you going to help us understand what the pro forma view of 12\/31 is?","John Robert Strangfeld","No. I'm not going to give you a projection on total capacity, because there's a whole lot of stuff that's going happen between now and March, and now and June, and now with the rest of the year.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just kind of big picture, wondering if you could help us kind of reconcile the thinking a little bit. Whatever the all-in investment in the Hartford is, I mean, does leave you with some readily deployable capital, not as much as some other points in time. Mark's been very open in talking, again, about the regulatory overhangs. And yet, I was surprised that John opened up early on by talking pretty openly about considering possible transactions and pension risk transfer deals, and so forth. So it would seem like at a time, when you -- maybe you were going to have to conserve capacity a little bit, but can you help us there, please?","Mark B. Grier","Yes, this is Mark. We've been asked, over the last few years, a number of times, with respect to the regulatory issues, whether or not we should be hoarding more capital in anticipation of the possible imposition of a so-called SIFI buffer, or whether or not we should be throwing capital over board, so we don't have to get permission to deploy it, if we wind up in a different regulatory regime. And what we've said all along, with respect to that issue, is that we believe we're doing the right thing. We have a lot of discipline around the deployment of capital, and a lot of discipline around the levels of capital that we believe are appropriate for us and our businesses, given our risks. And so with respect to the regulatory issue, we continue to behave on the basis that we're soundly and well capitalized and soundly and well run with respect to risk and capital discipline. So on that one, in the context of the way in which you're asking the question, we would not currently be shading as one way or the other. And as I said, we've had advice that goes both directions, we would not be shading this one way or the other because we're doing what we believe is the right thing. And remember, as Rich said, we generate a lot of capital, we have capacity, both the on-balance sheet capacity and the ability of the company to generate capital are sufficient to allow us to contemplate either outsized organic transactions, as John referenced, to support the ordinary organic growth of our businesses, and also to consider the possibility of additional deals where they fit our requirements.","Operator","And with that, we will conclude our question-and-answer session.

Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to say we reported strong first quarter results and are off to a solid start for the year. Overall, for the first quarter of 2015, we produced an 8% increase in adjusted operating income per share, excluding market driven and discrete items. This, in turn, meant that we achieved an annualized return on equity in excess of 16% for the period. The core fundamentals across our businesses and diversification in our earnings are key strengths and have helped us mitigate certain market headwinds such as translating our Japanese yen based earnings at a less favorable currency rate and the impact of lower new money yields. We also benefited from stronger than expected investment returns on non-coupon investments and other positive factors in the first quarter. Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results, and capital position, but I would highlight a few particularly noteworthy items.","First, balancing the mix of our life insurance and longevity businesses benefited us in the quarter. As we have seen in prior first quarters, we experienced less favorable than average mortality in our Individual Life and Group Life businesses. However, this was largely offset by positive case experience in our Retirement business, mainly due to experience in our newer PRT business.","Our Asset Management business generated very strong third-party net flows in both the institutional and retail businesses. The strength of our platform and continuing strong investment performance has enabled us to capitalize on the recent money in motion dynamics that have impacted the money management industry.","In the Annuities business, we are seeing solid results from our product diversification strategy, with 36% of our new business this quarter representing sales of products entirely invested in fixed income strategies or that did not include living benefit guarantees. We also experienced a very good disability benefit ratio in our Group Insurance business, reflecting the continuing effects of our re-pricing actions and improvements to claims handling procedures. And while we can expect experience to vary from one quarter to another, we are pleased with the progress that the Group Insurance business has made.","The fundamentals of our Life Planner business remain solid. The business produced 5% constant currency earnings and sales growth over the prior year, driven in part by a 4% increase in our Life Planner count. In Japan, we had the highest Life Planner recruitment total in a decade, as we are benefiting from the steps we took in the first half of 2014 to promote more Life Planner growth.","And finally, Gibraltar produced 8% constant currency sales growth over the first quarter of 2014, driven by increases across each distribution channel. Furthermore, we're also pleased to see the stabilization we are seeing in our Life Consultant count. Overall, we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet that has supported our steady dividend and share repurchase program, and provides us with the capital flexibility to opportunistically pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities as they emerge. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in our businesses and infrastructure to support and enhance our effectiveness and the value we deliver to our stakeholders.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Thanks for joining us on the earnings call today. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover our capital and liquidity picture.","I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter shown on slide 2. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.79 for the first quarter based on after tax-adjusted operating income. Excuse me. This compares to EPS of $2.40 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up by 8% amounting to $2.65 compared to $2.46 a year ago.","Looking across our businesses, here are some highlights of this comparison, and I'll mention four favorable items. First, higher fees reflecting growth in account values in our annuities business and greater assets under management in our Asset Management business. Second, a greater contribution from Pension Risk Transfer business with case experience more favorable than our average expectations. Third, improved Group Insurance underwriting margins, driven by more favorable disability results. And fourth, in International Insurance, continued growth on a constant currency basis in our Life Planner operations. These benefits were partly offset by three things: one, lower contribution from net investment results with returns on non-coupon investments above our average expectations but below the exceptionally strong level of the year-ago quarter. Two, higher net expenses in several businesses. And three, less favorable currency exchange rates in International Insurance. I would also note the decreased corporate income tax rates in Japan including a recently enacted reduction drove a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter.","On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains, we reported net income of just over $2 billion for the current quarter, about $700 million above our after tax adjusted operating income reflecting mark-to-market on derivatives, hedging and general portfolio activities.","Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate re-measurement, amounted to $69.01 at the end of the first quarter, up $4.26 from year end. The increase for the quarter was mainly driven by our net income per share of $4.37, less our quarterly dividend of $0.58. The impact of equity coming over to the class A common stock from the restructuring of our former Closed Block business that we completed at the beginning of January amounting to $1.35 per share was partly offset by refinements in the cumulative impact of foreign currency exchange rate re-measurement as we move to the new reporting structure in Japan. The remaining re-measurement balance of $4.4 billion at March 31 will decrease over time as the non-yen assets in Japan, which were in an unrealized gain position at year end, are sold or mature.","Annualized ROE for the quarter, based on after tax adjusted operating income excluding market driven and discrete items and based on book value excluding AOCI and the impact of foreign currency re-measurement was 16.1%. This ROE reflects strong underlying business performance bolstered by a net benefit that we would estimate at about 130 basis points from net favorable variances in comparison to our average quarterly expectations in a number of areas. These include returns on non-coupon investments, Pension Risk Transfer case experience and Individual Life mortality, the seasonal revenue pattern in our International Insurance Life Planner business, and items that affected corporate and other results for the quarter. I'll discuss these items in more detail in reviewing our business results.","Turning to slide 3, we have only two market driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter with a net benefit to reported results of $0.14 per share. In the Annuities business, we adjusted DAC and released reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits to reflect market performance, including outperformance of our separate account funds, resulting in a benefit of $0.15 per share. And in Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to The Hartford Life acquisition. During the year-ago quarter, market driven and discrete items produced a net charge of $0.06 per share.","Moving to slide 4, on a GAAP basis, our net income of $2 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis, comprised of the items you see on this slide. Mark-to-market gains on derivatives, mainly related to management of asset and liability durations and largely driven by changes in the level of interest rates, had a positive impact of $565 million for the quarter. Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activity had a positive impact of $265 million as the application of credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability for Variable Annuity living benefits more than offset the impact of the decline in interest rates during the quarter.","General portfolio activities resulted in net pre-tax gains of $227 million. Foreign currency re-measurement resulted in a pre-tax gain of $25 million for the quarter, reflecting our mitigation of the income statement impact from this item as a result of the new reporting structure we implemented in Japan. And finally, impairments and credit losses on investments were $31 million for the quarter.","Moving to our business results and starting on slide 5, I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market driven and discrete items I mentioned earlier. Slide 5 highlights Individual Annuities. Annuities results were $423 million for the quarter, up $14 million from a year ago.","Slide 6 presents a view of our trend in earnings and return on assets. Most of our operating earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. The earnings increase of about 3% is essentially in line with the growth of average account values from a year ago. Return on assets, or ROA, in the Annuity business for the quarter was 107 basis points, equal to the year ago level and higher than the last few quarters. The expense level in the first quarter has historically been below the average rate for the year, contributing to the higher ROA.","Slide 7 covers our Annuities sales. Our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially unchanged from a year ago, but with a change in mix reflecting steps we've taken to diversify the risk exposures associated with our product guarantees, to support return prospects through changing market conditions and to more broadly meet the needs of the retirement market. A modest decline in sales of our highest daily income, or HDI, guaranteed lifetime income withdrawal product was largely offset by greater contributions from two other products: our Prudential Defined Income, or PDI, product, which directs a client's entire investment to a separate account fixed income portfolio that we manage and we also had increased sales of variable annuities without living benefit guarantees.","Slide 8 highlights the Retirement business. Earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $284 million for the current quarter compared to $364 million a year ago. The decrease was largely driven by a $95 million lower contribution from net investment results. While current quarter returns from non-coupon investments were about $15 million above our average expectations, results for the year-ago quarter benefited from exceptionally high returns in these asset classes, largely driven by performance from private equity funds, with a contribution that was about $80 million above average expectations. Fixed income returns were also lower in the current quarter. The lower contribution from net investment results along with higher expenses in the current quarter were partly offset by a greater contribution from case experience on Pension Risk Transfer business, which was about $45 million above our average quarterly expectations. We would estimate that about a third of this represents the impact of historical mortality patterns, which typically favor the first quarter for this business.","Turning to slide 9, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $7.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $10.3 billion a year ago. Full service gross deposits and sales, shown in the dark blue bars, were $6.3 billion for the quarter. This compares to $8.6 billion a year ago, which included a major case win of $2.6 billion. Standalone institutional gross sales were about $1 billion in the current quarter, down from $1.7 billion a year ago. Sales of stable value wrap products, which amounted to $1.4 billion a year ago, were insignificant in the current quarter. The decrease in sales of these products was partly offset by a Pension Risk Transfer case of about $660 million that funded in the current quarter. As we have commented in the past, sales of both full service and institutional Retirement products can fluctuate meaningfully on a quarterly basis. Institutional standalone net outflows for the quarter were $2.5 billion. Net outflows of about $1.3 billion of stable value wrap business and roughly $1 billion of ongoing attrition of our jumbo Pension Risk Transfer cases together with runoff of legacy business more than offset our new sales during the quarter.","Total Retirement account values amounted to $365 billion at the end of the quarter, up $37 billion or 11% from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $25 billion, largely driven by Pension Risk Transfer business and favorable market performance.","Slide 10 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $205 million for the current quarter compared to $193 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from Asset Management fees, the increase from a year ago was driven by a $15 million greater contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. This contribution, which amounted to $47 million for the current quarter, is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuations and the timing of transactions. Current quarter revenues for the Asset Management business were up 10% from a year ago, largely reflecting higher Asset Management fees driven by a 10% increase in unaffiliated third-party institutional and retail assets under management, which totaled $469 billion at the end of the quarter. Net inflows for the current quarter were very strong at $7.7 billion, about equally divided between institutional and retail business. The benefit of Asset Management revenue growth was largely offset by higher expenses, including roughly $15 million divided about equally between investments that we've made in the business to build teams and infrastructure to expand our product and distribution capabilities, and higher upfront commissions associated with the $4 billion of retail asset inflows in the quarter.","Slide 11 highlights our U.S. Individual Life business. Individual Life earnings were $125 million for the current quarter, compared to $133 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by less favorable claims experience in the current quarter. Contribution to current quarter results for mortality experience, including related amortization and reserve updates, was about $35 million less favorable than our average expectations. This compares to a mortality contribution about $25 million less favorable than our average expectations a year ago on the same basis. Historically, the first quarter has tended to reflect a lower contribution from mortality experience than in average for the year. Individual Life mortality has been more favorable than our average expectations for the preceding three quarters and for the full years 2014 and 2013. Lower expenses in the current quarter, including net recoveries of about $10 million from servicing legacy participating business, which we would consider to be unusually favorable, largely offset a lower contribution from investment results.","Slide 12 shows Individual Life sales. Based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $124 million for the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Variable life sales, shown in the green bars, increased by $9 million, reflecting feature enhancements we introduced in May and September of last year to broaden the appeal of our products. Term Insurance sales in the gray bars are up $7 million from a year ago, benefiting from pricing changes we made last August to enhance our competitive position where we see opportunities to offer attractive value propositions with appropriate expected returns. The increased sales of variable life and term were largely offset by lower universal life sales, which benefited a year ago from residual sales of legacy Hartford products.","Slide 13 highlights the Group Insurance business. Group Insurance earnings amounted to $30 million in the current quarter, compared to $6 million a year ago. The increase reflected a substantial improvement in Group Disability claims experience and lower expenses in the current quarter, partially offset by less favorable Group Life claims experience.","Slide 14 presents our earnings trend for Group Insurance and benefit ratios for Group Life and Group Disability. In Group Disability, favorable current quarter experience, driven by fewer new claims at a greater benefit from claims resolutions produced a 72.2% benefits ratio, the lowest in recent years. This compares to a ratio of over 100% a year ago, reflecting an adverse fluctuation in long-term disability claims. While we've taken steps to improve results, including pricing adjustments and enhancement to our claims management processes, we continue to expect that claims experience will vary from one quarter to another. The Group Life benefits ratio was slightly above our expected range and up from a year ago, reflecting a higher average new claim size, which more than offset a lower claim count.","Moving now to International Insurance, slide 15 highlights our Life Planner operations. Our Life Planner business reported earnings of $439 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Results benefited from continued business growth with insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, up 8% from a year ago on a constant dollar basis. The benefit to results from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses, driven by a range of items including technology costs and non-deferrable distribution costs.","Mortality experience was largely unchanged from the year-ago quarter, with a contribution to current quarter results about $15 million greater than our average expectations. Foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at \u00a591 in 2015 versus \u00a582 a year ago, had a negative impact of $17 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago.","Slide 16 shows the quarterly pattern of earnings for our Life Planner operations over the last six quarters. Looking at the trend, you can see the seasonality pattern that favors the first quarter, which results from a concentration of annual mode premium revenues. We would estimate that this benefited current quarter earnings by about $30 million in relation to a quarterly average.","Slide 17 highlights Gibraltar Life and other operations. Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $395 million for the current quarter compared to $418 million a year ago. The current quarter benefited from a greater contribution from net investment results than a year ago including about $40 million of returns that we would consider to be above our average expectations on non-coupon investments. The greater contribution to earnings from net investments results was largely offset by higher net expenses in the current quarter including technology costs and a benefit in the year-ago quarter from fixed asset sales. Mortality experience was also about $15 million below our average expectations in the current quarter. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $19 million in the comparison of results from a year ago.","Turning to slide 18, overall, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $780 million for the current quarter, up $47 million or 6% from a year ago. Slide 18 is a product view of our sales. The sales increase was driven by death protection products, shown in the dark blue bars, partly offset by lower sales of Retirement products in the light blue bars. Death protection products including term insurance and whole life represented about 60% of current quarter sales, largely consistent with the preceding quarter, but up from just over 50% a year ago. The change in mix reflected higher death protection sales across our distribution channels, both in Japan and other countries, and a commission rate change that elevated Retirement sales in Japan in the year-ago quarter.","Slide 19 breaks out Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $366 million in the current quarter, up $17 million or 5% from a year ago. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan were $245 million in the current quarter compared to $249 million a year ago. As shown in the light blue bars, sales of Retirement products decreased by $38 million to $73 million for the current quarter, reflecting elevated sales in the year-ago quarter driven by the change in commission rates that I mentioned. This decrease was largely offset by an increase of death protection product sales including term insurance shown in the dark blue bars. Sales outside of Japan in the green bars were up $21 million from a year ago, mainly driven by increases in Brazil and Korea.","Slide 20 shows Gibraltar Life sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $414 million in the current quarter, up $30 million or 8% from a year ago with increases in each of the three distribution channels. Life Consultant sales, shown in the dark blue bars, increased by $4 million or 2% from a year ago, as higher productivity measured by policies sold per agent per month more than offset a decrease of about 160 or 2% in Life Consultant count. The count has largely stabilized over the past few quarters and the decline reflects our continuing active management of the sales force, including minimum production requirements together with selectivity and recruiting. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $171 million for the current quarter, up $21 million or 14% from a year ago. The increase was driven mainly by greater sales of recurring premium whole life insurance. These products are particularly attractive to clients focused on the increased inheritance tax in Japan since their structure enables use of annual gift tax exemptions to efficiently transfer estate wealth. Sales through independent agents, shown in the gray bars, amounted to $68 million in the current quarter. The $5 million increase from a year ago was driven by greater sales of fixed annuity and death protection products.","Slide 21 shows the results of corporate and other operations. Corporate and other operations reported a loss of $253 million for the current quarter compared to a $342 million loss a year ago. The reduction in the loss reflects lower net expenses and a greater contribution from investment income in the current quarter. While expenses in corporate and other are inherently variable, the current quarter level is below our recent average partly due to a benefit of roughly $20 million from fixed asset sales. The contribution from investment income in the current quarter includes about $30 million of returns on assets that were previously associated with our former Closed Block business and initially transferred to corporate and other when we completed the restructuring of that business at the beginning of this year. We would expect the vast majority of these assets to be utilized or deployed in the relative near term.","And now, I'll hand it over to Rob.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to give you an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility. Starting on slide 22, we continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we managed to a 400% RBC ratio. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 498%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio as of the end of the first quarter is well above our 400% target.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 909% and 898% as of their December 31, 2014, which is their most recent reporting date. These are comfortably above our 600% to 700% targets. Our Japanese companies will soon report solvency margins as of their March 31, 2015 fiscal year-end. And while calculations are not yet final, we expect that we will continue to be in a strong position relative to our targets.","Looking at our overall capital position on slide 23, we calculate our on balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% target RBC ratio, and then add capital capacity held in our other operations including in Japan and of the parent company. As of year-end, we estimated our available on balance sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion of gross capital capacity, less $2 billion to pay down debt in order to arrive at our long-term targeted financial leverage ratio of 25%. During the first quarter, our estimated gross on balance sheet capital capacity increased from about $4 billion to over $4.5 billion. On a net business, after earmarking roughly $2 billion for debt paydowns to arrive at our targeted 25% financial leverage ratio, capital capacity at the end of the first quarter increased to over $2.5 billion. The increase in our net capital capacity during the quarter was the result of capital generated by our businesses and the benefit of about $500 million after tax from our Japan capital hedge, including about $300 million from cash settlements and $200 million from hedges that were locked in. These contributors to our capital capacity more than offset a modest net negative decline from interest rates in the quarter. And about $500 million of shareholder distributions, including $250 million of share repurchases and our quarterly dividend of $0.58 per share. The fair value of the Japan capital hedge, after subtracting the first quarter settlements and lock-ins would be about $2 billion as of the end of the quarter.","Turning to the cash position at the parent company, cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $3.7 billion as of the end of the first quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes.","Now, I'll turn it back over to John.","John R. Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. Now, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And our first question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, I had a couple of questions on your international business. Gibraltar, your sales were up a lot and I think in the bank channel, you've had success selling more than the paid premium products. So we've seen some other companies back out of the bank channel. So what type of returns are you getting on bank channel sales in the current interest rate environment? And then secondly, on the Life Planner count, it was up 2% sequentially this quarter. So is something changing in the business or was this an aberration this quarter, because that seems stronger than it's been in the recent past?","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Sure, let me take those in order, Jimmy. And let me start by making some overall comment about sort of the rate environment and how we approach pricing, and then I'll get into the bank channel and then I'll answer your second question. But my first comment is an important one, and that is we have expected profitability targets for each of our products, and margins may vary or hurdle rates may vary on specific products, but every product has to stand on its own merit. So we don't have loss leader products in any sense. As a result, we continue to examine our product lineup and its profitability, adjusting pricing when necessary to reflect lower rate levels, and we also reduce commissions or discontinue sales of certain products that can't meet profit expectations. As an example, Gibraltar Life stopped selling a six-year single premium endowment product effective at the end of this quarter just because we thought we should eliminate it from the product lineup.","So in terms of an overall framework with which we think about profitability, we really have three different aspects to it. You can think of three circles, and we talked about this before. But first, you have the customer need and you have to provide products to fulfill those needs. Secondly, you have product profitability and each product, again, has to stand on its own relative to the hurdle rate we've established for it. And third, you have business mix, which is how much of any given product do we want to sell relative to return and to risk. So, if we think about that relative to the bank strategy, what I would say is that we have a very differentiated strategy relative to others. When we first acquired Star\/Edison, there were over 100 banks in total, but consistent with what we've done in the independent agency channel or even with the number of life consultants we have, we reduced the number of relationships focusing on quality product and service and focusing on fit with our partners. We now have about 60 partners that currently offer our products and we sold through over 90% of them this past quarter.","So, three points of differentiation that affect the profitability of our product within the bank segment. First is that we provide exceptional service to our banking partners. We cover the banks with over 200 (35:36) that come from Life Planners and this will get to the other comment in a minute about Life Planners. And so we don't necessarily have to have the lowest price. We have to have a reasonable price on our product, but we don't have to have the lowest price because we're not spread-sheeted, we're thought of in a different way and that is the relationship we have with the banks and the service we provide to them. That leads to the second point, which is our focus on death protection. So, the majority of our sales include mortality and expense margins. In other words, 70% of our first quarter sales had an M&E component to it.","Additionally, we have a higher proportion of recurring premium insurance products, as opposed to just having savings products. So, two-thirds of the recurring premium insurance products are 10 Pay and longer, they're just not three Pay accelerated to a single premium. But in terms of single premium, the single premium annuity life products we do sell through the channel are re-priced twice a month, taking into account current interest rates, and most have MVA features. So we feel very good about the differentiated strategy we employ, the mix of products we sell, and the resultant profitability of the business. So that hopefully answers your first question.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Now, in terms of the second question, in terms of LP count and why it was up so much, you may recall that last year we said that we had a very high number of Life Planners that moved over to become sales managers and they transferred over in April of 2014. That has led directly to higher recruiting. Now, it takes a while for those sales managers to get up to speed, to train, to start looking for recruiting, but what we said back then in the second quarter call was that we would expect to see a larger number of LPs come on board at the end of the year or the beginning of this year. So there's really a couple of things happening. There is much higher recruiting that's taking place as a result of the higher number of sales managers, but there's also fewer terminations given the amount of business that we're doing.","Now, in terms of the overall LP count, what we can say is that if you look over a five-year period, you really see a lower growth rate than this quarter. So if you were to average out the LP count in Japan, it's really over five years been sort of 1% to 2%. We've had some quarters that are flat, maybe some that are a little negative if we've transferred a lot of LPs over to SMs, but in general \u2013 and then some that have been higher as a result of that. But in general, it's sort of 1% to 2%. If you look at the Life Planner business as a whole within PII, you'll see that the Life Planner growth over five years has been sort of 2% to 3% because you have a higher growth rate in places like Brazil and perhaps some others. But that's generally what you expect. So this is higher than we'd normally expect, but you'd expect some aberration quarter-to-quarter depending upon the dynamics of how many people we've transferred and what's going on.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then lastly, if I could ask about your tax rate overall, I think you'd spoken about 27%-ish or so previously, but the tax rate was 25.6% this quarter. So what drove that and what's your expectation for the year?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jimmy, it's Rob Falzon. The primary driver to the difference between the tax rate we gave at guidance, which was actually just a little under 27%, and the number that you're seeing in our first quarter results was the decreases in taxes in Japan. We blend that it into our overall tax rate as a result of the earnings that we keep there versus repatriating, we wind up with the delta that you've seen and that number, the 25.6%, is the number that we think is sustainable for the year.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions on capital. First, you commented that declining interest rates were only a slight negative to available capital. Does that imply that the recent backswing in rates that we've seen thus far this quarter will only be a slight positive? And then on the Japan capital hedge, what should we expect with regards to further gains over the remainder of the year, assuming no major changes in exchange rates from here?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nigel, it's Rob again. So, let me first use this as an opportunity on the interest rate question to talk a little bit more broadly on how we connect risks with the management of capital. And we've hit on this theme at both Investor Day and Financial Strength Symposium, but it's probably good to set the context.","First, our businesses and the capital that supports those businesses are sensitive to the markets. Our construct is a capital protection framework that we've spoken about before, and that's what we use to manage the sensitivity. We think about risks as being a spectrum between tail events and less severe scenarios, which we think about as being in the, quote, body of the distribution of volatility. Our objective is to take off the table risks that are associated with tail events. For less extreme market conditions, things that are in the body of the distribution, we hedge the vast majority of those risks, particularly in the equity and the interest rate worlds, and we think about those risks across our business units as they're netted at the enterprise level. In John's opening remarks, he observed that our longevity and mortality experiences in our different businesses largely offset each other and with respect to interest rates, we have a similar phenomenon in that our annuities are exposed to declining rates. But other parts of our businesses actually have exposure to rising rates, particularly a spike in interest rates. We calibrate our hedging in order to accept some level of volatility in our excess capital capacity. It's necessary because as we've described earlier and particularly on the fourth quarter call, the nature of these risks are non-linear. They change as markets move and the available hedging instruments that we have sometimes don't track these movements well.","Additionally, the risks vary between businesses. In any given period, the economics may get offset but the accounting doesn't always reflect this. And to the extent that we have capital being generated in one business and capital needed in another that is not always fungible in a particular period, we have to wait for future periods in order to monetize those offsets. We're constantly recalibrating our hedging to address the tail risks as markets move and as our capital capacity and leverage change. We have multiple tools for doing this to ensure that we remain within our risk tolerances. And probably the one last thing I want to add on this is that in the normal of course of our business, we generate a substantial amount of excess capital from our businesses annually. It's why we've increased our guidance around free cash flow up to about 60% of AOI. If you look in the course of 2014 and this quarter, over 40% of our normalized operating income has been returned or distributed in the form of dividends and share repurchases while reducing our debt by over $2 billion and funding our PRT and M&A pipeline.","So with that as a way of sort of context, let me talk specifically about the interest rate sensitivity in the quarter and comparing that to the first quarter and your question about what may happen when interest rates come up. First vis-\u00e0-vis last quarter, the level of rate movement is about half what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. And recall that the sensitivity we had then was driven in large part by AAT and within AAT there was a large component that was driven by model refinements, not interest rate movements in and of themselves.","With respect to Pruco Re specifically, it had less of an impact this quarter and that's because as rates continue to decline, the option portion of our hedging becomes more meaningful. We become less sensitive to rate movements as rates decline. So the converse of that is that as rates climb back up, we actually recapture some of that movement in rate. So it is not symmetric, it's actually somewhat asymmetric in terms of the trade-off between capital and the movement in interest rates. The offset to what happens in Pruco Re is in other businesses. There, as I noted before, many of which have some long sensitivity to interest rates and so the net capital capacity impact between what happens in the Annuity business and Pruco Re and what happens in our other business that are manifested in PICA and other entities is actually relatively modest. And we look to monetize in order to be able to offset those things as we're able to get dividends out of our subsidiaries.","So, in the case of PICA, by way of example, we filed for a $2 billion dividend and we received regulatory approval for that dividend and expect that to come up in the course of the second quarter. And that will help us to then monetize the positive variance we had from interest rate movements or offset the negative variance that we had within Pruco Re.","I think your last question was on FX and the equity hedge. We had about a $0.5 billion this quarter that \u2013 of increased capacity from that. About $300 million of that was what was normally coming in the form of settlements during the period. And then there was about $200 million that resulted from an acceleration of our \u2013 of locking in the settlements. I would note that the capital capacity would have increased even if we hadn't done this acceleration that was more of a tactical initiative. And the value of the hedges that we currently have in place, net of the $500 million that we've counted to our capital capacity this quarter, is still around $2 billion. On a pre-tax basis, you'll see around 10% or so of that still available to be monetized this year. And there's about 20% that's scheduled to be monetized next year. That's all assuming that exchange rates don't change from where they are today.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thank you. Rob, just wanted to follow up on a couple of your comments on capital and kind of your willingness to accept some volatility there. I guess, first, how do you think about that volatility ahead of being subject to a potential balance sheet stress test from the Fed? And do you think that they would view kind of volatility the same way? And secondly, with the $2.5 billion of deployable excess capital, do you view that as all truly deployable or does some of it need to be retained as a buffer in case markets move against you in the short-term?","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Erik, this is Mark. Let me start off with a comment on capital standards. As you know, we don't yet have capital standards. We're constructively engaged in the process of developing capital standards with the Federal Reserve domestically, but also as part of a number of moving parts on the international arena. And I think it's early to speculate on the context of stress test and short-term volatility without the underpinning of the genuine view of capital. And as you know, the way we've talked about it and the points I made, for example, about margins and reserves on Investor Day, we take a longer term view of the loss absorption capacity of the company, which is, in many respects, a totally separate point from short-term accounting volatility.","And so I'd be thinking about the fact that loss absorption capacity and quarterly accounting volatility are very different points. The real constructive approach to solvency and stress testing will focus on loss absorption capacity and the assets that we have available to meet all of our obligations. However, they're categorized as line items on the GAAP financials. And I'll ask Rob if he wants to add anything to that and then let him take the second.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I would merely observe that we do look at tail events and we try to take that risk off the table, as I indicated. So while we don't have a construct in place to the extent that that's stress testing, as we anticipate, we'll be looking at severe scenarios. That's the risk that we try to address through our capital protection framework that we don't tolerate and don't want to see that variability come in on a quarter to quarter basis. With regard to the variability quarter to quarter, yeah, there'll be some noise in our capital capacity as a result of interest rate movements. We'd expect as interest rates move back up that that will add to our capital capacity in the way that it is moderately trimmed on capital capacity in this quarter as we described.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, that's helpful. And then, just one quick question on PRT. Can you give us a sense of how quickly the earnings in capital run off on the funded deals? And how much capital will be freed from prior deals in 2015?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses","Erik, this is Steve. I'll comment on the asset front. Generally speaking in PRT, on the funded side, we experience about $700 million in runoff on a quarterly basis and on the longevity side, about $400 million.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I don't have a specific forecast on what that would do to our capital capacity. Obviously, what happens is as those are running off the reserves in the pad that we have in those reserves burns off as well and then, we'll establish some level of increase in our capital capacity.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Rob, just to start out, just a follow-up on the interest rate sensitivity to capital comments you made. Would that also be true if you look at through, say, year-end 2015 that your sensitivity would be less to a further decline in rates all else equal relative to the way it played out last year?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I assume, Tom, you're referring to the impact of AAT, and I'd sort of make two observations. The first is that...","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Well, sorry, Rob, AAT and VA sensitivity, we'll call it.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Okay. So the VA sensitivity, as I described, further declines in interest rates \u2013 that volatility is substantially muted to further declines in interest rates because of the impact of the \u2013 of options in our hedging strategy. And so, it is likely that what you'll see, as you look forward, is if interest rates were to move down further, you would see that the declines there would be more muted and would continue to be substantially offset by the gains that we would have in other parts of the enterprise. And we try to calibrate it just that way.","With outside of Pruco Re, with respect to the broader impact of AAT, I would reiterate what I said before, which is a substantial portion of our AAT increased during the course of last year was a result of model refinements. The actual impact resulting from interest rates was a smaller component of that. And as we look forward, we would expect, therefore, that the impact from AAT would not be particularly draconian, but that'll be a function of actually where interest rates wind up at year end. I think as you know, there's a \u2013 the way that formula works, there's a flooring mechanism, which is calibrated off the five-year and so as rates continue to decline, the impact from AAT actually gets moderated as those rates go down.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Okay, thanks. And of the remaining $2 billion Japan capital hedge, should we think about all of that over time being monetizeable and into the excess capital bucket? Or is there some portion of that that we should be thinking about that you'd need to hold against the risk in the Japanese business whether that's because you have a contingency plan that if the yen were to strengthen, again, you would need to use it or otherwise.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that $2 billion \u2013 the fair value of that will fluctuate as the currency exchange rate fluctuates, Tom. So to the extent that there's appreciation of the yen, the $2 billion would be a lesser number on a go-forward basis. Putting that aside, which is that it will reflect where exchange rates are, it reflects where they are today. On an absolute basis, whatever that number is, it is completely available as capital to us and does not otherwise need to be held back for any reserves.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got you. And last question. The comments made about the Closed Block, the $2.6 billion of assets that are currently in corporate and other would be utilized or deployed over the near term, is that to reduce debt or commercial paper? Can you just clarify what that's going to be used for?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So that $2.6 billion will be redeployed out of corporate and other, and hence why we've called out the gain in corporate other associated with it. The way in which it gets deployed was contemplated in the guidance that we established at the beginning of the year. And so, there's a range of things that we could do with that that vary between debt reduction and M&A and distributions to shareholders. So without getting \u2013 being particularly specific about that, what I would note is how we deploy that will influence where we thought in the range of guidance we might come out and the expectation is that that would be happening in a \u2013 that we would get it out of corporate and other on a relatively rapid basis, meaning in the next quarter or two.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Rob, that's all factored into the excess capital guidance that you've given out? Or is this somehow in addition?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that is factored in the \u2013 the capital capacity that exists is factored in and that is part of the $2 billion dividend that we'll be getting out of PICA that was approved by our regulators.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everybody. And maybe shifting gears a little bit from the capital side, I was curious to hear your thoughts and comments about the DOL proposal. I think one of your peers recently mentioned that VA sales to qualified plans could fall by up to 15% or 20% for the industry as a whole. So want to hear your thoughts on that and where you see Pru fall in respect to that number.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses","Yaron, this is Steve Pelletier. Let me address your question and I'll address it more broadly and then touch upon a few particular areas, including the Annuities business. First off, just let me say right up-front that we certainly support a regulatory framework that helps ensure client confidence in the advice, the services and the solutions they receive. We're reviewing the proposed regulation and we will be participating in the industry commentary. As it stands today, as it's written today, the proposed regulation would certainly have some industry-wide impacts of increased compliance costs for starters. At the same time, though, we think that our business mix and the strength of our franchises position us pretty well for adapting to any changes that are brought about by this regulation. Let me give examples of that in three areas of potential impact that are being widely discussed. First, IRA rollovers. As it stands today, the regulation could make that process more complicated. But the IRA rollovers that we do directly with clients are a modest portion of our overall business mix. And if these regulations do result in a higher retention of assets and DC plans, that would be a positive offset that we'd have in our Retirement business.","Second, speaking of Retirement, let me talk for a minute about DC record keeping. Our business in that space has a couple of key risk mitigants in regard to the proposed regulation. Virtually, all of our business is done with companies who have over 100 participants in their plan, and that's not by accident. That's due to our mid-market focus in this business. And that segment, as you know, is relatively less affected by the proposals. Also, we've always approached this business with an open architecture philosophy as it regards the investment platform. We certainly have participation of proprietary offerings on our platform, because we have high-quality proprietary offerings, but we don't rely on those offerings being predominant in the platform.","The third area of potential impact would be something that we'd experience jointly with our distribution partners in the Annuities business, as you asked about. We have very strong distribution relationships and we have top tier positions in every major distribution channel in the business. We offer a range of products and solutions, and as John and Mark both mentioned in their opening comments, that diversified product range is really gaining traction in the business. And those solutions all come with a range of compensation options for the advisor, ranging from commission-based to fee-based. I think we will need to do some work with our distribution partners to ensure continued availability of solutions to clients, but we do feel that all the factors I just mentioned give us the basis for doing that work with our partners to achieve the very important goal of ensuring that their clients have continued access to high-quality retirement income options, very much including the guaranteed lifetime income that is really distinctive to the annuities industry and that we'll be able to make these offerings available on terms that work for everybody, including, of course, the Prudential shareholder.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So a follow-up on that. As you're selling more of the non-living benefit guaranteed product, do you think that would come under greater pressure with this proposal? And also could you maybe give us some quantification as to what percentage of your VA business is qualified versus \u2013 is in qualified plans versus non-qualified or what percentage is from a fee commission \u2013 fee business versus a commission business?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses","About two-thirds of our business, Yaron, is done with qualified money, that's consistent with industry averages. And if you're talking about the compensation breakdown, about a third is done on a purely commission based \u2013 sorry, about two-thirds is done on purely commission-based business and the remainder is done with a mix of commission-based and fee-based.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then thoughts on living benefits or...","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses","I think the living benefit strategy and looking to diversify our product range is a strategy that we would continue to maintain over time. I don't think that particular element would be specifically impacted by the regulatory change. Like I say, what we need to do is work with our distribution partners to ensure that we can make the adjustments necessary to provide continued availability of the full range of product sets to their clients.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you for the comments.","Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President, Head-Investor Relations","Thank you. Cynthia, I think we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And that will be from the line of Steve Schwartz with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Just a quick couple. Mark, you talked about the adverse mortality in life, the $35 million. And it wasn't clear to me, are you referencing that $35 million relative to a quarterly average, or were you referencing that $35 million relative to what would normally be adverse seasonality in the first quarter?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Steve, it's actually Rob. That quantification is against an average for the year, so it is not adjusted for seasonality.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Rob, would you happen to know if it were, what the effect would be?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I don't.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Something to get from Mark. And then just one more. Going back to the question of VA and the effective interest rates, I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying here. At lower rates, okay, the sensitivity is lower such that if rates were to go lower from here, it wouldn't be that big of a deal, and there are other areas in the business that would benefit, that would make up the difference?","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","They would directionally offset. They aren't perfectly hedged but you'll see derivative marks going the other way from the specific impact of interest rates on the VA living benefit hedge. Now, keep in mind there are a lot of moving parts in that VA living benefit hedge. So you can't always look at that and make a linear connection to interest rates either. But I think the answer to your question is there are directional offsets in other parts of the company, as Rob referenced, that mitigate the impact of interest rates directly on the VA living benefit.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So to follow up from that, that would be at this level but it didn't really when you move down from 2.6% to 2.19% or wherever we were.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Are you talking about the fourth quarter movement?","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Yeah, I'm trying to compare the two.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Yeah. So as I mentioned, what happens is as rates get lower and we remove the tail risk associated with continued lower interest rates, the hedging strategy that we have kicks in such that we have a significantly more muted effect at current levels than we would have at levels that would have been mid 2% range.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But even in the fourth quarter, I don't have this number right in front of me, but there were gains on duration management derivatives of several hundred million dollars that went the other way from the move you're talking about. So, the answer is, yes, there was some of that in the fourth quarter. There were less other things that mitigated the overall impact, but there was a meaningful, meaning several hundred million dollars, going the other way in other derivative marks. And you can find it if you go back and look, or call Mark, we'll tell you the answer. I don't remember the exact number.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I will do that. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen, today's teleconference will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. today until midnight, May 14.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Prudential Financial Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you, Karen, and thank you to all of you for joining our earnings call. But first, in our 11th year as a public company, participants on today's call include: John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Rich Carbone, CFO; Ed Baird, Head of International Operations; Charlie Lowrey, Head of Domestic Operations; and Peter Sayre, Principal Accounting Officer. I'll read a quick commercial message and then we'll get started.","In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the fourth quarter of 2011, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, in managing our businesses, we use a non-GAAP measure we call adjusted operating income to measure the performance of our Financial Services businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses as adjusted and related charges and adjustments, as well as results from divested businesses. Adjusted operating income also excludes recorded changes in asset values that are expected to ultimately accrue to contract holders and recorded changes in contract holder liabilities resulting from changes in related asset values.","Our earnings press release contains information about our definition of adjusted operating income. The comparable GAAP presentation and the reconciliation between the 2 for the quarter and year ended December 31 are set out in our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website.","John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Now that we've closed the books on 2011, I will kick things off with some high-level comments on the year as a whole. ","First, earnings. Earnings per share, based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses, were $6.41 compared to $6.17 a year ago. This modest improvement in EPS does not reflect our progress during the year. If you remove the market-driven and discrete items we've disclosed each quarter, which Rich and Mark will review with you for the fourth quarter, the EPS increase would be 22%.","Second, capital. Our capital position remains exceedingly strong. We are well positioned to pursue business opportunities, and we have capacity to remain strongly capitalized even in stressed environments. As for capital management, we will continue to seek acquisitions where we can realize attractive returns and are comfortable with the execution risk such as our acquisition of Star and Edison. At the same time, we take a balanced approach to investing in businesses and returning capital to shareholders. During the second half, we returned about $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and increased dividend. We did this while maintaining a solid balance sheet and growing book value.","Third, commercial momentum. We are a leader in the markets we've chosen to compete in, and you can see strong commercial momentum reflected in our business drivers. Solid sales and flows drove underlying growth in our U.S. businesses, with headlines in Retirement and Asset Management. Prudential Retirement\u2019s gross deposits and sales reached a record high of $44 billion, driven by strong sales in the Institutional stable value wrap market and including groundbreaking defined benefit risk transfer sales. Account values in Annuity and Retirement registered significant gains from a year earlier, and AUM and Asset Management exceeded the $600 billion mark for the first time. ","As you know, we strengthened our International business with the Star and Edison acquisitions last February. Business integration is well on track, with the successful completion of the merger of Star and Edison into Gibraltar on January 1 being a major event. We remain confident that we will achieve planned expense savings on schedule.","In International Insurance, we're benefiting from expanding distribution and continued growth in the Life Insurance Protection and Retirement markets. Among our milestones in 2011 was more than $3 billion of annualized new business premiums, including the initial contribution from Star and Edison and a growing contribution from the bank channel in Japan.","So to conclude, Prudential had a very good year, driven by the quality of our individual businesses, by the mix of those businesses, by our financial strength and, we believe, by the talent of our people. Our solid results enhance our confidence that we will achieve our ROE aspiration of 13% to 14% for 2013. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Rich.","Richard J. Carbone","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported common stock earnings per share of $1.97 for the fourth quarter based on adjusted operating income for the Financial Services business. Now this compares to the $1.76 per share in the year ago quarter. We have a short but not insignificant list of market-driven and discrete items affecting current quarter results. ","In the Annuities business, the equity market increase in the quarter caused us to release a portion of our reserves to guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and led to a favorable DAC unlocking, resulting in a benefit totaling $0.28 per share. In Individual Life, the equity market increase in the quarter drove a reduction in net amortization of DAC and related items for a benefit of $0.03 per share. In the International Insurance, Gibraltar Life and other operations benefited by $0.15 per share from the sale of our stake in a pension fund manager in Mexico. This benefit was largely offset by the integration cost of $0.13 relating to the Star\/Edison acquisition. In total, the items I just mentioned had a net favorable impact of about $0.33 per share on the fourth quarter results. ","The year-ago quarter benefited about $0.32 per share from unlockings and reserve releases mainly from the 10% increase in the S&P 500 in that quarter and from the gain on the partial sale of the indirect investment in the China Pacific Life group. Taking these items out of both the current and the year-ago quarters would produce an EPS increase of about $0.14 per share, driven largely by organic business growth and the contribution of Star\/Edison earnings x the onetime charges, of course.","Moving on to the GAAP results of our Financial Services business. We reported net income of $606 million or $1.26 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $2.13 or $0.45 per share a year ago. GAAP net income for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pretax realized investment losses of $568 million. This compares to $906 million of pretax realized investment losses in the year-ago quarter. ","The $568 million of current quarter losses includes net losses of $367 million, primarily from product-related hedging activities. Impairments and credit losses amounted to $142 million. And losses from asset and liability value changes, driven mainly by currency fluctuations, amounted to $95 million. These losses were partially offset by net gains from general portfolio activities, mainly sales.","Book value per share on a GAAP basis amounted to $75.04 at year end, and this compares to $63.11 a year earlier.","As of year end, gross unrealized losses on the general account fixed maturities were $4.3 billion. This compares to $3.1 billion a year ago, with nearly all of the increases taking place in the third quarter and mainly resulting from foreign currency movements. And we ended the year in a net unrealized gain position of $10.5 billion. ","Book value per share, excluding unrealized investment gains and losses and pension and postretirement benefits, stood at $66.63 at year end, up $7.15 from a year ago and, of course, that is after giving effect to our common stock dividend of $1.45 per share, a 26% increase from the 2010 dividend. ","Now our capital position. First, I'll focus on the insurance companies. We are continuing to manage these companies to capital levels, consistent with what we believe are AA standards. Prudential Insurance began last year with an RBC ratio of 533%. During the year, Prudential Insurance paid dividends totaling $1.6 billion to the holding company, Prudential Financial, Inc., essentially moving excess capital to the parent company and thereby enhancing our financial flexibility. While statutory results of 2011 are not yet final, we estimate that RBC for Prudential Insurance as of year end 2011 will be in the 500% range. ","Our Japanese insurance companies recently reported their solvency margins as of September 30, 2011, using both the historical calculation method and a new method that becomes effective this year. These companies were comfortably above their targets under both methods. Effective January 1, we successfully merged the Star and Edison companies into Gibraltar Life. We are confident that at the end of their current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2012, our Japanese companies will continue to report strong solvency margins relative to their targets. ","Next, looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services business. And as you know, we calculate our balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position in Prudential Insurance to a full 100% RBC ratio and then add capital capacity held at both the parent and other subsidiaries. We began 2011 with on-balance sheet capital capacity that we estimated was in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. After adjusting for Star -- and that was after adjusting for the Star\/Edison acquisition and the sale of Global Commodities. During 2011, we added about $3.5 billion of capital and used about $2 billion of that to fund the capital needs of our businesses. We returned about $1.7 billion to shareholders through our share repurchase program and our common stock dividend. The remaining authorization under the share repurchase program, which extends through 2012, is $500 million. The net result of these activities left our on-balance sheet capital capacity essentially unchanged from where we began 2011, about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. And this is consistent with the estimate we provided you in November. So really, nothing has changed of our -- on our capital capacity, that is. Of our $4 billion to $4.5 billion in capital capacity, we estimate that about half is readily deployable. ","Now turning to the cash position at the holding company, the parent company. Cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to roughly $3 billion at year end. We continue to target maintaining at least a $1 billion liquidity cushion at the parent. The excess of our capital position over this target is available to repay maturing debt, fund the operating needs of our subsidiaries and to be redeployed over time, including for share repurchases. ","Now I'll turn over to Mark to review the business results for the quarter.","Mark B. Grier","Thank you, Rich. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening, whichever is appropriate. ","I'll start with our U.S. businesses. Our Annuity business reported adjusted operating income of $391 million for the fourth quarter compared to $345 million a year ago. The reserve true-ups and DAC unlocking that Rich mentioned had a net favorable impact of $180 million on current quarter results. This includes a benefit of $121 million from the release of a portion of our reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and a further benefit of $59 million from reduced amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, in both cases, reflecting favorable market performance.","Results for the year-ago quarter included a net benefit of $146 million from a favorable DAC unlocking and reserve true-ups, largely driven by the 10% increase in the S&P 500 that quarter. Stripping out the unlockings and true-ups, Annuity results were $211 million for the current quarter compared to $199 million a year ago or an increase of $12 million. This increase represents the net effect of growth in our fees at a very solid pace, partly offset by a higher level of base DAC amortization and by higher expenses and interest charges in the current quarter. Policy charges and fee income in the quarter increased by $57 million or 14% from a year ago, reflecting an increase of $10 billion in average variable annuity separate account values, driven by $13 billion in net sales over the past year. However, we've accelerated our base level of DAC amortization in the current quarter, following our negative unlocking in the third quarter. In addition, current quarter expenses were higher than a year ago, partly as a result of business development costs. And interest expense was also higher, reflecting the financing of commissions and other costs of writing new business.","Our gross variable annuity sales for the quarter amounted to $4.4 billion, in line with the second and third quarters. This compares to $6.1 billion a year ago when new business was bolstered by sales in advance of the repricing of our annuity products in early 2011. ","Our relative position within the top few variable annuity writers from one quarter to another reflects the constant dynamic of changes in the marketplace, including actions by competitors to revamp their products, which led in some instances to sale surges due to product introductions or in anticipation of future retrenchments or repricings. Our highest daily protected value feature, coupled with auto-rebalancing tailored to each customer's account, clearly distinguishes our product and has a proven track record of more than 5 years with clients and their advisors. We strongly believe that our consistent approach to product design and our demonstrated commitment to the advisor sold variable annuity business provide us with a solid competitive advantage in the market that is very much driven by third-party gatekeepers and distributors. And that the various ways of product design changes and market entries, exits and reentries by various providers serve to distinguish us and strengthen our position with our distribution partners.","The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $142 million for the current quarter compared to $147 million a year ago. The decrease reflected a lower contribution from investment results, mainly driven by non-coupon asset classes. The weaker investment results in the current quarter were partly offset by higher fees, reflecting an account value growth in institutional investment products and by lower expenses.","Total Retirement gross deposits and sales reached a record high $14.7 billion for the quarter, up 33% from a year ago. The increase was driven by sales of stable value wrap products sold to plan sponsors on a standalone basis, which amounted to $8.8 billion in the quarter, up from $6 billion a year ago. ","Standalone Institutional sales also included 2 longevity reinsurance cases totaling $1.6 billion in the emerging defined benefit risk transfer market, where we are developing innovative solutions to help plan sponsors and benefit providers manage the risks of defined benefit pension plans. These DBRT sales follow our initial pension risk transfer sales earlier in the year, which included a pension plan buy-in of a specifically designed Annuity product, the first of its kind in the U.S. market. While this market is still developing, we see this as a long-term opportunity where we will be among just a few companies that can offer effective solutions to deal with defined benefit pension plan risks.","Full Service Retirement gross deposits and sales were $3.9 billion in the current quarter compared to $4.1 billion a year ago. We are continuing to see slow case turnover in the mid- to large-case market, which is our primary focus. Lapses of 2 large cases, primarily recordkeeping services cases with relatively limited fees, contributed to net outflows for our Full Service business of about $2 billion in the quarter. Overall, net additions for the Retirement business were $6.7 billion for the quarter compared to $4.5 billion a year ago. Account values stood at a record high $229.5 billion at the end of the quarter, up 12% from a year ago.","The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $155 million for the current quarter compared to $132 million a year ago for a 17% increase in earnings. The improvement in results came mainly from higher Asset Management fees, driven by growth in Assets Under Management. The segment Assets Under Management reached $619 billion as of year end, up about $80 billion or 15% from a year earlier. The increase in AUM reflected positive net flows in each of the past 4 quarters, cumulative market appreciation and the addition of about $15 billion, primarily U.S. dollar general account assets, from the Star and Edison acquisitions last February. The increase in earnings for the quarter also reflected a $7 million greater contribution from performance-based fees driven by institutional fixed income and real estate funds we manage.","Adjusted operating income for our Individual Life Insurance business was $146 million for the current quarter compared to $131 million a year ago. Lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other items reflecting favorable separate account performance in relation to our assumptions benefited the current quarter by about $20 million and contributed about $10 million to the increase in results from the year-ago quarter which also benefited from market performance.","In addition, current quarter results benefited from a greater contribution from underwriting results, driven by growth in our books of universal life and term insurance, reflecting an increase of $24 billion or 5% in insurance in force for those products over the past year.","Mortality was favorable in relation to our average expectations for both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter and had a modest positive impact in the comparison of quarterly results. Sales based on annualized new business premiums amounted to $75 million for the current quarter, up from $67 million a year ago. The increase was driven by third-party sales and reflects our improved relative competitive position in the universal life market.","The Group Insurance business reported adjusted operating income of $55 million in the current quarter compared to $69 million a year ago. Higher current quarter expenses, a lower contribution from investment results and less favorable group disability underwriting results each contributed to the earnings decline. More favorable group life underwriting results reflecting business growth and improved claims experience was a partial offset. Group Insurance sales for the quarter were $86 million, including $49 million for group life. This compares to a total of $109 million a year ago. More than 3\/4 of our group life sales in the current quarter and about 2\/3 for the full year were voluntary business, representing coverage purchased by employees or association members rather than employer-paid insurance.","Turning now to our International businesses. Gibraltar Life's adjusted operating income was $356 million in the current quarter compared to $260 million a year ago. As Rich mentioned, Gibraltar's results for the current quarter include income of $96 million from the sale of our stake in Afore XXI, a pension fund manager in Mexico. Going the other way, Gibraltar's results for the quarter absorbed $94 million of integration costs for the Star and Edison acquisitions. We continue to expect about $500 million of integration costs over a 5-year period, including roughly $200 million in 2012 to achieve targeted annual cost savings of about $200 million after the business integration is completed. Our completion of the merger of the Star and Edison legal entities into Gibraltar effective January 1 of this year was a major milestone. And the migration of the acquired investment portfolio to a more favorable risk profile is substantially complete. The business integration, including product transitioning, merging of field offices and migration of the Star and Edison sales forces to Prudential training and productivity standards is on track.","Gibraltar's results for the year-ago quarter included income of $66 million from the partial sale of our indirect investment in China Pacific Group. Excluding the Afore and China Pacific gains and the Star and Edison integration costs, Gibraltar's adjusted operating income was up $160 million from a year ago. This increase includes a $128 million contribution to current quarter results from the operations of the acquired Star and Edison businesses.","True-ups and refinements have resulted in some noise in our results for Star and Edison, both in the current quarter and the earlier quarters of the year. So I would think of the average contribution for the first 3 full quarters, just over $100 million per quarter, as more indicative of the initial operating results before realization of most of the expense synergies we are targeting.","The remainder of the increase in Gibraltar's results from a year ago, or $32 million, came mainly from business growth, driven by protection products. Sales from Gibraltar Life based on annualized new business premiums in constant dollars were $519 million in the current quarter. This represents an increase of $266 million from a year ago, including $218 million from Star and Edison distribution and $48 million of organic growth, which would be a 19% increase on a same-store basis.","The Star and Edison sales include about $140 million from Life Advisors and about $75 million from independent agents, including about $20 million from a products that we have discontinued as part of the integration of the product portfolio.","The Star and Edison agents are migrating to sales of Gibraltar products, and their strong production in the current quarter, up more than 20% from the average of the second and third quarters, reflects the popularity of our U.S. dollar Retirement product with their client.","Our organic growth and sales for the quarter was largely driven by the bank channel, where we are continuing to broaden our reach. The distribution agreement we signed a few months ago with Mizuho, Japan's third largest bank, expanded our distribution to include 2 of the country's 3 largest banks, and we began to write business through Mizuho in the third quarter -- I mean, the fourth quarter.","Our Life Planner business reported adjusted operating income of $336 million for the current quarter compared to $328 million a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up 6% from a year ago. However, the benefit from continued growth was partly offset in the quarterly comparison by less favorable mortality versus a year ago, when the mortality contribution was stronger than our average expectations.","Sales from our Life Planner operations based on annualized new business premiums and constant dollars were $280 million in the current quarter, up from $269 million a year ago. We are continuing to benefit from strong demand for Retirement income products both in Japan and our other Asian markets.","Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $281 million for the current quarter compared to $239 million loss a year ago. The increased loss in the current quarter reflects a higher level of capital debt, including the impact of debt financing for part of the purchase price of Star and Edison, as well as higher expenses, including some nonlinear items such as corporate advertising and employee benefits.","To wrap up, I would say that the fourth quarter was a strong conclusion to a very good year for us. Thank you for your interest in Prudential. Now we look forward to hearing your questions. ","Before we take the first question, 2 quick housekeeping matters. The share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion that Rich mentioned extends through the end of June 2012, not through the end of the year. And separately, the expected expense savings associated with Star and Edison ultimately are expected to amount to $250 million, not $200 million.","Now for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mr. Suneet Kamath, Sanford Bernstein.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My first question is on the pace of share buybacks. Obviously, lower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, it certainly came as a surprise to me, perhaps others as well. So just want to get a sense of kind of what governed that decision in terms of your thinking about third quarter and then ultimately what happened in the fourth quarter.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, this is Mark. I guess I'd start the answer by saying don't try to read something into it that isn't there. We take a fairly long view of capital deployment, and we were uncharacteristically opportunistic in the third quarter. And almost by definition, if you speed up a little bit sometimes, you're going to slow down a little bit some other time, and it's nothing more than that. We're on track with respect to implementing our capital deployment plans, balance sheet is very strong, liquidity is very strong. And so I would encourage you to take a longer view than just a quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. This is not a trading environment for us. Again, we were opportunistic in the third quarter, but we're on track with respect to our longer-term objectives and comfortable with the trajectory.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And I guess my second question on capital is if I go back to the investor slide that you put out, I think it was in December, you talked about the required capital increasing by about $2 billion in the 2011 year. Given kind of where we sit today, Annuities are slowing down at least relative to the first quarter. And then you have these institutional investment products, and I guess I'm not quite sure what the capital requirements on those are and how they compare to Annuities. And then you have this longevity risk transfer business that you're adding. Kind of when you think about the business mix shifts that are occurring in terms of new business, any changes to the kind of $2 billion number in terms of incremental capital that you needed last year as you think about this year?","Richard J. Carbone","You hit on all the right points. It's going to depend on the business, but all of that capital, one way or another, is going to be deployed at rates that are going to support our 13% to 14% ROE goal. Whether they're used in buybacks or they're used in business, they're going to support that goal for 2013.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Understood. I guess maybe just to track it a little bit, if we compare Annuities to Institutional investment products, obviously, the requirements for Annuities have gone up over time. How do those 2 businesses compare in terms of their capital needs?","Richard J. Carbone","Well, there are 2 different metrics of which their capital needs are driven, right? Annuities capital needs are driven by -- mostly by the deferred acquisition costs that we pay upfront and in the other products, they're driven a lot by longevity and credit risk. So I'm loath to give you a rule of thumb that's going to reconcile pi to Avogadro's number.","Mark B. Grier","Suneet, the capital requirements on the investment-only stable value products are pretty small. Annuities are more capital-intensive, and that's the directional answer. But as Rich points out, it does depend on some of the specifics of the products. But Annuities would be more capital-intensive than investment-only stable value.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So perhaps favorable mix shift.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, favorable mix shift, if Annuities slow down and investment-only stable value speeds up, yes. The wildcard is the defined benefit risk transfer.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And how would those compare to Annuities?","Mark B. Grier","Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to say maybe it's sort of in the middle. But that's one where we could do quite a lot of business if the market really does get going. So the wildcard there that I'm referencing is more the potential volume in a market that's just developing.","Richard J. Carbone","Yes, I'd say that was a push. But once again, I want to make the point that the ROEs in these products are supporting that 13% to 14% return.","Operator","Nigel Dally, Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Another question on capital. So to move the ROE towards your 2013 target, you're obviously going to need to redeploy a substantial amount of the $4 billion to $4.5 billion of excess capital. In addition to buybacks, you mentioned potential acquisition opportunities in your comments. Should we imply from that, that the pipeline of potential targets is beginning to improve? And also, can you provide a pecking order of what products or geographies are of greatest interest to you? Then -- perhaps if we start then I\u2019ll follow up.","John Robert Strangfeld","Okay. So, Nigel, if I don't cover it, you tell me. So this is John. So a couple thoughts about this. First, vis-\u00e0-vis the ROE targets. The way we think about achieving the aspiration, as Rich described, as I've mentioned in my prepared comments, there are 3 primary things that are going to get us there. One is the successful integration of Star\/Edison, and you\u2019ve heard the progress we're making on that front. The second is the continuing growth of our high returning businesses, and you're seeing strong fundamentals in those businesses. And the third is also successful deployment of our excess capital, both that which we have and that which we create over time. When we think in terms of M&A, I have to sort of step back versus -- let's just talk about opportunity sets first and then go to M&A, at the risk of giving you a longer response than what you're looking for. But I think it's more representative of how we think about this, which is that -- clearly, in our mind, organic is cheaper and it's a less intrusive way to develop the business. And at times like this, the combination of a strong brand, strong capital and unquestioned commitment that aligns a business in which we're in have been very advantageous, and you see that showing up in our fundamentals. And that's the first sort of priority we have in terms of growing our business over time. And it's not just a theory; it's reality and you can see it. And that's where our business leadership is focused. And in some cases, it manifests itself in new products as well or new distribution channels and in new business areas as Mark mentioned with defined benefit risk transfer and the progress there. So we're feeling very, very good about it. Now insofar as M&A, there's not a different story here. There's a number of franchises [indiscernible], and the outcomes and the timelines of those things are uncertain. Whether we wind up simply competing with them or whether we wind up buying with them is going to be a product of a whole lot of considerations and market dynamics. We're obviously a good counterparty. We've proven that as an example with AIG and other things we've done in the past, but we really can't predict the likelihood of this. It is important to say that we don't think our prospects are M&A dependent. That's that key thing in the sense that M&A is an opportunistic overlay to what we think is a very healthy organic strategy and trajectory. And then finally, as to your comment about, well, what would be more interesting to us? I think I'd just basically say it's very consistent with what we said before, Retirement and Protection, U.S. and abroad. What you see, we tend to commonly find of interest is broadening our activities in areas where we already have a footprint, Japan being the most classic example of that. Obviously, we all can have some interest in broadening the footprint itself. But more commonly, what you see us doing is going more deeply within the markets in which we're already in. So that would be how I would characterize the overall picture, defining it for the big opportunity set, the perception about organic being the primary focus and thrust, the perception that we've got new product development and other things that we think have great promise and then M&A will be an opportunistic overlay in the manner that I described. So that's the -- that's how I respond to your question.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, very helpful. Second question was just on group disability. Clearly, somewhat challenging backdrop there. Can you discuss what you've done with pricing in that business and how quickly that potentially could flow through to improve the overall results?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure, Nigel. It's Charlie. Obviously, disability, we had a challenging quarter this quarter. And I think that really reflects the continuing effects of the economy. And I think in terms of pricing, when we -- most of our cases are large cases, which means that they're experiential. And since we've had relatively poor experience, we are able to increase the pricing. So we're doing that and we've been doing that since probably halfway through last year. Most of our cases are 2 years or less. So we're beginning to work our way through the pipeline, so to speak.","Operator","Mark Finkelstein, Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Actually, just a follow-up to the prior question. Can you give us some benchmark as to what are the average rate increases that you're guiding on the cases that you are renewing?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Yes, it's -- I don't mean to dodge the question, but they really are experiential. And so you get some that are in the low single digits, you get some that are in the double digits. It really depends on the experience. But I think it's fair to say that we are -- we're looking at it extremely closely, and we are getting price increases as we go forward.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then maybe just one follow-up as well on capital. You have $500 million left in the authorization. On the last call, Mark characterized it as a fluid evolving process that you look at continually. But last year, you spent about what you generated, call it $1.5 billion. What is it -- what do you need to see? Or what is it that has to happen to really start dipping into that what you characterize as readily deployable capital, which you characterized as half of that $4 billion to $4.5 billion?","Richard J. Carbone","There's another ingredient to that mix, right? And that's the absolute leverage ratio. And we've got this targeted 25% debt to capital ratio. It's important for us, it's important for our rating. That is one ingredient in there that we're always mindful of. And other than that, as capital becomes available at the holding company, we'll reevaluate our buybacks and we'll reevaluate our dividends.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, Mark, we have a plan for the way in which capital emerges and the way in which it's deployed in the businesses, and we'll be looking at a range of variables, including financial ratios that Rich mentioned. But we're pretty comfortable with where we are and the deployment track and the business track to realize the objective that we've set out there. Keep in mind though that when we set an objective of 13% to 14%, we didn't qualify it by saying it's easy. That reflects what we believe is the earnings power of the company, supported by an appropriate capital structure. And we've got to manage to realize that earnings power, and we have to deploy the capital. And Rich emphasized earlier that everything we do is focused on ensuring that we're accretive to that capital outcome. And so the context of this is that we do have a vision of earnings power and capital that we'll realize our objective and we're going to manage to it.","Richard J. Carbone","Our capital plans are hard wired into that 13% to 14% return.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. One just very quick follow-up to that is, if I go back, call it 3, 4, 5 years, you used to give sensitivities to S&P movements kind of in a  range of, say, 30 to 50 RBC points for every 100-point move in the S&P. Again, I know it's totally changed right now, and so those old metrics are no longer that useful. But is there anything that we can point to, to just think about how S&P moves drive capital?","Eric Durant","Hey Mark, it's Eric. Maybe my memory is failing me, but that is not something that we've done in the past. And we're not going to start that today.","Operator","Chris Giovanni, Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if you could talk some about sort of the current status today as a savings and loan company. I believe you're working with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston which I think your overseer here on the supervisory side to deregister. As a savings and loan, I wanted to kind of walk through this process and sort of what you deem is the benefits to the extent that you get deregistered.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, this is Mark. I'll start and maybe I'll ask Charlie to make a comment on the business if he wants to. I\u2019d use a little bit broader framework than just deregister. We're in the process of managing the thrift in a way that will remove us from automatic coverage by the Volcker rules. And the issue with respect to the impact of the Volcker rules is concentrated for us in the Asset Management Business where we do sponsor funds and co-invest and the level of activity and market expectations in that arena for us are both inconsistent with compliance with the Volcker rules. So we're looking at the options that we have. You indicated working with regulators. We are working with regulators to assess our options. And we anticipate that over the next few months, we will manage the thrift to a situation where we won't be automatically subject to the Volcker rules. I don't know if Charlie wants to add something to the Asset Management business piece of it, but the objective here is related to our business models and asset management and our ability to execute what is a very, very successful business for us.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Yes. No, I think that covers it well.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just second question in terms of the VA business. I guess your largest competitors made a commitment here to dial back noticeably in the market and I wanted to see if here early in 1Q, if you're seeing sales levels pick up as they look to retrench or how you're seeing the VA marketplace today, and similar along those lines, how you're viewing your current product.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Okay. I can't really talk about the first quarter, but what I can do is just talk about the consistency of our sales. I mean, we really look for sustainable profitable growth. And if you look what we did at the beginning of last year, we reduced the benefits and increased the pricing with the acknowledgment that interest rates were probably going to be low and stay low for quite a period of time. That allowed us to have a consistency of product with a sustainable profitability over the long term. And that's what really we look for. So the last 3 quarters have been -- including the fourth quarter, have had a sustainable and fairly level rate of sales. And so we feel comfortable with that level, and we'll look to see what happens this year. But we feel comfortable with what happened last year and where we are in terms of product.","Operator","Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a few questions. The first, on your Japan business, your sale in the bank channel obviously grew at a strong pace versus the previous year but declined sequentially in the fourth quarter. So I just wanted to get an idea on if you think you've saturated the market there or do you think there's opportunity for further growth. And then on the Retirement business, in the Full Service Retirement side, you\u2019ve had negative flows for the last several quarters. And your views on that business have gotten more negative as -- over the past couple of years. So I just wanted to see what you see -- what your outlook is for the Full Service Retirement. And then lastly, on the Institutional Retirement side, if you can just talk about the pipeline. Obviously, this quarter, you had a couple of pretty large longevity risk transactions. But just -- where do you see the pipeline and what type of pricing do you have -- are you seeing in that business given that a lot of competitors have actually dropped out?","John Robert Strangfeld","We'll start with Japan and Ed.","Edward P. Baird","Jimmy, it's Ed Baird. The fourth quarter bank channel sales were -- as you pointed out, they were actually up 32%, which is a meaningful increase over the comparison quarter. But if you compare it to the preceding quarter, not as strong, and I think that might be the first time that, that's happened in several years because this channel, of course, has grown at an extraordinary rate. I don't attribute any meaningful significance to that other than the fact that the third quarter was up around 70%. So the fact that the fourth quarter wasn't able to exceed that by going up only 32% is not a point of concern. One of the big banks was a little lower than they had been in the prior quarter, but we continue to add banks and we continue to deepen our penetration with them. So I think as the long term trend here continues to be quite positive with any third-party distribution, you're going to see a characteristic fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. But I think if you look at this on any rolling quarter basis, this has an extraordinary amount of momentum in it.","John Robert Strangfeld","Charlie?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Okay. Let me answer -- you had 2 questions. I'll answer the one about Full Service outflows first. The backdrop here is that we are in the mid to large end of the market. And there that we're still seeing what we saw before, which is low plan formation, not a lot of RFPs out there, and that's affecting plan sales. We're also seeing, as we talked about before, further unbundling in the marketplace and fee disclosures, all of that affects, I think, over time the profitability of the business. So we look at the business and we still like the business, but we're going to exhibit, I think, a fair amount of price discipline in what we choose to take or what we let lapse. And you've seen some of that this quarter. So I think that begins to explain at least some of the outflows that we see. And we're comfortable with the business we're writing, and we're comfortable with the business we're letting lapse. The other side of the business though, as you talk about the IIP business as we call it and the investment-only stable value, we're still very pleased with. We think there is a dearth of this kind of product in the marketplace, pricing is holding up very well. And we continue to see a fair amount of opportunity in this side of the business. So we'll continue to focus on both sides. But in terms of near-term opportunity, I think the IOSB business is -- has a lot of growth potential left.","John Robert Strangfeld","Jimmy, was your question about investment-only stable value or about defined benefit risk transfer?","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, just on the defined benefit risk transfer because you had a couple of large cases, I think, in the U.K. market in the fourth quarter.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Yes, sorry. I missed that. In terms of defined benefit risk transfer, I'll take the U.K. and then the U.S. In the U.K., we did do some interesting deals, and they were reinsurance deals on the longevity side. We see that as a market that will continue. The U.K. is, I think, well ahead of the U.S. and has been for years in terms of pension risk transfer and especially longevity risk. And we are participating in that and see a fair amount of opportunity. In the U.S., I think as I just said, the market is a little further behind. We do think this will be a business going forward, but it's challenging obviously given the low interest rates now and the underfunding of the pension plans. But it's a business that we have built up significant capabilities in and think that there will be, over the long term, some significant opportunities going forward.","Operator","Jay Gelb, Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had 2 issues I'd like to cover. The first is on Star\/Edison. For those expense savings, should we expect all those to fall to the bottom line or will there be any offsets in investments or otherwise? And the second issue would be for Mark, if you can update us on the nonbank SIFI classification. There\u2019s a one -- we might expect to -- for that to be implemented and steps Prudential will take ahead of that.","Edward P. Baird","Jay, this is Ed Baird. Let me just refresh some of the numbers that were given because we're completely consistent and on track with the numbers originally outlined a year ago when we announced this deal. And that is that the expenses are onetime expenses which will accumulate to a total of around $500 million, and that the savings which will be ongoing will accumulate to about $250 million. So the difference is clearly in terms of the onetime versus the sustainable earnings. And that will drop, as you said, to the bottom line, and we're very well on pace with that. By the end of this year, we're going to be probably in the $170 million range or so, meaning 2012 towards the $250 million target. And on the expenses, we're going to probably be as much as 75% or 80%.","Richard J. Carbone","And Jay, any top line, I thought you might have inferred there that you were thinking about the top line erosion. Any top line erosion was tested with shock lapse in the deal economics, and they're all contemplated in the returns that we've provided to you in the past. So we've contemplated the savings and loss in revenues and the onetime costs. They're all in the ROEs and they're all in our future projections. No surprises.","Mark B. Grier","And this is Mark on the second question about systemically important financial institutions. Process-wise, there's not a lot of concrete things to point to. There certainly is constructive thinking going on around the question of which kind of institutions might be systemically significant and how to think about those companies. But it's not really clear yet where this will go. Remember that there's a process that would involve the nomination of a company for consideration by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and then a discussion with the company and an opportunity to talk about what it looks like and what that might mean and then questions going forward about exactly how any particular company might be regulated with respect to the metrics and the calibration of those metrics as a nonbank SIFI in the case of Prudential. We continue to engage with respect to discussions on the financial dynamics of insurance companies, particularly in contrast to banks, and we continue to engage on understanding products and risk. One of the sensitivities that I've talked about repeatedly is the need to understand statutory reserving practices because we have capital spread all over the place up and down our liability side because of the way we recognize our sobasic [ph] liabilities. And we continue to get opportunities to engage on that front. So Federal Reserve did put out a paper that contemplated the treatment of nonbank SIFIs. And in the paper, the statement was that they would be looked at the same way banks are looked at. But it really, I believe, was an opportunity to engage and a chance for the nonbank SIFI world in general, the insurance world and then Prudential more specifically to comment on the impact of that and how we would think about it. The specific question about how effective that might be and understanding unintended consequences are all important there. So we have the opportunity over the next couple of months to engage seriously on the issue that we've always thought was most important, which is how we would be looked at if we were a nonbank SIFI, and we'll be prepared to make a constructive comment on that framework and on the issues that we're thinking about in terms of possibly regulated as a SIFI. So the headline is a bit of uncertainty still process-wise and even with respect to whether or not we would be designated systemically important and the opportunity right now to engage on substantive issues around what it might mean if we were.","Operator","John Nadel, Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple quick ones. I realize acquisitions are all unique in terms of the financial metrics. But just generally speaking, I'm interested in how you would characterize your capacity to execute a deal with no external financing. Should we focus more on the $2 billion of what Rich referred to as readily deployable? Or could we focus on something closer to the $4 billion to $4.5 billion of total capital capacity?","Richard J. Carbone","It depends on where the acquisition is, right? So acquisitions made out as a holding company, you need to focus on the $2 billion to $2.3 billion. Acquisitions that can be done partially inside those regulated entities with that other capital capacity, we could absorb that capital capacity with some -- with that excess RBC.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, interesting. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on your commentary, Rich, on the debt to capital or leverage ratio. I thought the 25% ratio was frankly far less critical, particularly given the DAC accounting changes that are getting implemented as of January 1. And I thought the rating agencies were focused much more on interest coverage where you guys seem to be in excellent shape. So you're telling us to focus on 25% target. I just would look for some clarification on that.","Richard J. Carbone","Sure. That 25.3 is before the DAC adjustment. When we reduce the equity, the 25.3, I'm not going to get it this perfect, 26.4 maybe, it goes up to 26.4 after the reduction and the denominator. Now -- but there's also -- Eric is giving me a thumbs up, maybe it's 27. I just didn't remember. Is it 27, Eric?","Eric Durant","Yes.","Richard J. Carbone","I'm sorry. So it's 27. And, okay, so we'll get a little hiatus on bringing that back down by the ratings agencies we are expecting, but eventually, that's got to work back down to 2. But you make a great point. Cash flow coverage is important, but the -- when the ratio breaks through the 25, that also has a ripple effect on the cash flow coverage. Now we still have cash flow coverages under our measures that meet our standards, but there is strain on them when you push in 25 -- over 25. And that, coupled with the 27 optic, even though it's an optic, needs to be moderated.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So I guess the takeaway and my takeaway, it seems to be that you get a relatively short-term period of time where the rating agencies don't respond to a higher than 25, but they expect you still nonetheless despite the accounting change to bring it back down over time?","Richard J. Carbone","That's correct. Can I just add one -- let me just add one point to that. In an acquisition, where there is cash flow provided by the earnings of that acquisition to cover the fixed charge coverage that you rightfully brought up, that would bump up above the 25 dependent upon the cash flow coming with the acquisition.","Mark B. Grier","And it's one of the things to think about. Asset quality is very strong, liquidity is very strong, earnings power has a lot of momentum. So it's one thing to think about, and I think Rich explained it well.","Operator","Due to timing constraints, our last question will come from Joanne Smith, Scotiabank.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","I have a couple questions. The first is just as a follow-up to the discussion about nonbank SIFIs. It just seems to me that there's a lot more going on than just nonbank SIFIs. It seems like every time Geithner has a press conference, he talks about all financial institutions being more regulated over time. And I was just wondering if you could talk about that a little bit more in a broader context. And then second, just on the universal life, I know that you're not concentrating heavily on Individual Life Insurance products anymore. But given the fact that there were such strong sales in the quarter, I hear a lot, everybody has heard a lot about a lot of people increasing prices because of low interest rates. And I'm wondering if you have already done that, and so now you are kind of even with those that are just now raising prices. I'm just wondering what the competitive dynamics are with respect to that and rising prices.","John Robert Strangfeld","Let's start with the second question first. Charlie?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure. It's actually a great story, and that is, you have the story exactly right. In 2009, we raised prices twice, in May and November, both in term and our universal life and watched in 2010 our sales plummet as a result of that. But we wanted to retain the profitability of the product as we saw going into these markets. The reason why universal life has come back in terms of sales is that our competitors have begun to raise prices up to match ours. So that when you look at our product and you spreadsheet our product, as the financial advisors do, we have gone from third quartile to second quartile in terms of pricing and therefore, we have been able to sell more product. But we have -- again, it's a consistent story. We have been consistent with sort of our anticipation of pricing and our aggressive repricing of product for the markets. And both in Annuities and here and universal life, you've seen our competitors kind of come up to match us.","Mark B. Grier","And just quickly on your other question about more regulation in general. Beyond the comments that our own Secretary of the Treasury has made, there's a broader international view that some companies fell through the cracks in a sense as a result of inadequate group supervision. And I think SIFI or not, there will be an emerging group or holding company regulatory environment that we will have to deal with, whether it comes from the franchise of our state regulators extended or from a federal entity here in the U.S. or possibly even something that may emerge from the discussions about international regulation. So I think that's a fact of life that will be a reality for us over the next few years, whether we're a SIFI or not. And, again, the most important concern that we have is that we have a regulatory regime that is sensitive to what our business models look like and what our financial dynamics are and ensure that we play on a level playing field but also balance risk and capital to make sure that the public policy needs to have stability and financial services are also met. So I would say it's something we expect, we think about, we work on and it will be part of life for us, however, it emerges in terms of group or holding company supervision, but I don't think we\u2019ll be the end of the world. We will manage through with our own financial targets probably more aggressive than the regulatory targets anyway.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Mark, do you think that it just automatically means more capital requirements for the industry? And do you think that, that could possibly go beyond, say, a 375%, 400% RBC ratio as being the new standard?","Mark B. Grier","I don't think so. I wouldn't make that kind of an abstract absolute statement. I think it means there will be careful consideration of the dynamics of the balance sheet and the stress test, which I think will ultimately be the cornerstone of the whole capital management regime. But I think it's going to be carefully considered in the context of what's really there and how it moves. So no, I don't think it's an automatic add-on to the current benchmarks.","Operator","Thank you.

Thank you for joining us. While our underlying fundamentals in Q1 remained strong, we were buffeted by market headwinds and our first quarter results trailed our expectations. This quarter's operating earnings per share of $2.26, which excludes market-driven and discrete items, is below the $2.65 we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity for the quarter was a little over 12%, or modestly below the 13% to 14% that we target across the cycle. This, of course, will fluctuate on a quarterly basis.","At an overall level we produced solid core results. However, the adverse impact of weaker non-coupon investment results, lower average equity markets and foreign currency headwinds drove the year-over-year decline from the particularly favorable results of a year ago.","Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results and financial measures, I will provide some higher level observations on our businesses and discuss other matters affecting our operations.","Our International business had a solid quarter, despite the market challenges I mentioned. We continue to see strong underwriting margins and good core growth at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Interest rates in Japan are clearly a challenge and we have made and will continue to make the necessary product and pricing changes to maintain strong returns. I would highlight that our overall constant dollar sales growth of 12% was driven by U.S. dollar products in Japan where we have seen an increase in demand.","We also completed the acquisition of an indirect ownership interest in AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement administrator. We're excited about the prospects of this business as we expand our International footprint and expect Habitat to produce steady growth and generate stable earnings and cash flows. It's taken a while to come to fruition, but we believe this investment and relationship is a very good fit for us.","Our domestic businesses showed some mixed results, also largely reflecting market factors. At a high level, individual annuities continued to show solid margins, though sales levels have shown some pressure. And this reflects our pricing discipline as well as lower variable annuity sales industry wide.","Retirement earnings benefited from another quarter of solid case experience in our pension risk transfer business, which helped mitigate the impact of non-coupon investment returns coming in lower than our average expectation. Let me add, that although we did not close any PRT deals in the quarter, we continue to see solid activity in the market. And as we've discussed on previous calls, the timing and distribution of PRT transactions can be lumpy.","Asset management earnings were impacted by lower average equity assets under management and lighter earnings from other related revenues, particularly compared with recent trends. We also experienced weakness in third party unaffiliated net flows, which showed net outflows of about $3 billion for the quarter. To put this in context, however, this follows very strong net flows in 2015 of $22 billion and our pipeline for new mandates is robust. We remain optimistic on our asset management business and continue to invest in capabilities and distribution. But we're also not immune to some of the industry trends that have impacted active equity management strategies.","Life insurance earnings were impacted by adverse underwriting results as compared to our average expectations, which is not unusual for us to see in the first quarter. This quarter, we experienced both a greater than typical volume of claims as well as a higher level of claims with larger face values. Over time, we've had significant favorable mortality, including since we acquired Hartford's Life business in 2013, which by the way has proven to be a very good fit. But mortality can vary on a quarterly basis. We continue to show solid sales results which has benefited from product and distribution actions, while maintaining underwriting discipline.","And finally, our group insurance business continues to show the benefits to earnings of our multi-year underwriting efforts. We also saw an increase in sales levels following several years of weakness, as we benefited from several large case wins in the quarter.","Let me also briefly address a few other topics of interest. In April, we recaptured the variable annuity living benefit riders that were managed in a captive insurer, and now house all of our product risks together in our statutory insurance entities. This is a very important initiative that will meaningfully reduce the volatility in our business and increase transparency, while not having adverse consequences on our capital flexibility. We will provide more details on this initiative with our second quarter results.","The decision in favor of MetLife and their challenge to the FSOC designation as systemically important, is a significant development with respect to group supervision and capital standards. We will determine an appropriate path for Prudential, as this issue develops, considering other aspects of group's regulation as well. With respect to FSOC designation, we have options as we go through our annual redesignation process.","The fiduciary standard rule issued by the Department of Labor addressed some of the concerns expressed by the industry participants regarding the proposed rule and includes several positive changes. We continue to evaluate the new regulation and potential impacts on our business, which also needs to include consideration of how our distribution partners will respond. The final rule gives us a path forward to implement certain changes to our processes and businesses including in individual annuities, retirement, asset management and our in-house distribution arm, Prudential Advisors. And while there will be challenges with the new rule, we have a history of adapting to change and will continue to support our customers with innovative solutions to meet their retirement needs.","In terms of capital deployment, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, and funded approximately $530 million for our Chilean investment, all while maintaining strong capital flexibility.","So to sum it up, while this quarter's results were a little light than we would normally expect, due mainly to market factors, the fundamentals in our business remain sound and we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet and capital position that enables us to return substantial amounts of capital to shareholders while continuing to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights. And I'll start on slide two. After tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.18 per share for the quarter compared to $2.79 a year ago. After adjusting for market driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.39 from a year ago. While underlying business performance was solid, the decrease reflected a less favorable macro environment and negative fluctuations in some inherently variable items.","Non-coupon investment returns were about $90 million, below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago, when we called out a contribution about $60 million above expectations. Earnings from asset-based fees in our U.S. businesses were about $50 million below the year ago level, largely reflecting the 5% decline in equity market averages. And the contribution from other related revenues in our asset management business, which is largely driven by changes in market values and timing of transactions, was $25 million below the year ago quarter. We estimate that these three items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago.","Now moving on to slide three. Returns on non-coupon investments fluctuate over a cycle by their nature. As we mentioned in our earnings guidance call in December, our long term expected returns on these investments are 6% to 7%, with our expectation for 2016 slightly below the long term average. In our case, included in non-coupon or alternative investments, are private equities, hedge funds, real estate, and a $3.6 billion public equity portfolio held mainly in Japan, which includes stocks, mutual funds and J-REITs. These assets totaled about $8.8 billion as of March 31.","While these investments diversify our exposure and are a good fit with some of our longer term liabilities, especially in retirement, the pattern of returns introduces some variability into our results. We've called out significant variances from our average expectations, which provided a fairly strong tailwind in 2013 and 2014. However, returns are below the long term expected average in the current quarter. We would estimate that current quarter variances in comparison to our long term average expectations from returns on non-coupon investments, mortality in individual life and International insurance, pension risk transfer case experience, together with the benefit of favorable revenue seasonality in our International Life Planner business had a net negative impact on earnings per share of about $0.10. After adjusting for market driven and discrete items, our EPS of $2.26 for the quarter implies an annualized ROE of 12%.","On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.3 billion for the current quarter. This compares to just over $2 billion a year ago, which included substantial mark-to-market gains from derivatives and hedging activities.","Turning to slide four, for the current quarter, market driven and discrete items consist only of our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the annuities business driven mainly by performance of equities in our customers' accounts, which resulted in a net charge of $0.08 per share.","Now, moving to slide five, our GAAP net income of $1.3 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $338 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pre-tax gains of $44 million. Of note, product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $282 million in the quarter, driven by the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits, which increased due to the decline of interest rates in the quarter. The gain from other risk management derivatives also came mainly from the decline in interest rates. Impairments and credit losses of $106 million included $85 million from the energy sector, primarily on bonds.","Moving to our business results and starting on slide six, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. Annuities earnings were $381 million for the quarter, down by $42 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a similar decline in average account values, which was largely driven by equity market levels. Higher expenses and lower non-coupon investment returns, which were modestly below our average expectations, also contributed to the earnings decline and to the decrease in return on assets or ROA, which has fluctuated in the low 100 basis point range.","Slide seven presents our annuity sales. Our sales mix continues to reflect our product diversification strategy, which we enhanced in April of last year with an agreement to reinsure about half of the living benefit guarantees on new business related to our highest daily or HD product. This agreement extends through this year. We've also grown sales of our fixed income based PDI product with some recent small adjustments to enhance product attractiveness. As a result, only about one-third of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees.","Turning to slide eight, retirement earnings were $219 million for the quarter, down by $65 million from a year ago. The decrease included a $36 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $40 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $15 million above average expectations a year ago. The decrease in non-coupon returns was partly offset by the impact of growth of the investment base over the past year. The contribution from case experience was about $20 million below the year ago quarter, but roughly $20 million above our average quarterly expectation. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower fees in our full service business and higher expenses.","The sequential quarter in earnings and retirement mainly reflects lower expenses compared to the elevated level of the fourth quarter and a greater contribution from case experience than in the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide nine, total retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.7 billion for the current quarter, compared to $7.3 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were about $2 billion for the quarter, largely driven by stable value wrap products, compared to sales of roughly $1 billion a year ago, which included about $660 million for a funded PRT case. Full service sales were roughly in line with a year ago.","Total retirement account value amounted to $372 billion at the end of the quarter, up by about $7 billion from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $5 billion from our full service business and about $2 billion from our institutional standalone business.","Turning to slide ten, Asset Management earnings were $165 million for the quarter compared to $205 million a year ago. While most of the segments' results come from asset management fees, the decrease from a year ago was mainly driven by a $25 million lower contribution from other related revenues, reflecting strong strategic investing results and incentive fees in the year ago quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower asset management fees, driven by a 12% decline in average equity assets under management, which reflected both outflows and negative market impact. Higher fees from management of fixed income assets with a 5% increase in average assets under management, partly offset the equity driven decline.","After $22 billion of net positive third party flows in 2015, we experienced outflows of $3 billion in the current quarter, nearly all driven by equity strategies. As John indicated, we are seeing the impact of industry trends including movement to passive strategies as well as some client rebalancing.","Turning now to slide 11. Individual life earnings were $120 million for the quarter compared to $125 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by higher expenses including costs supporting business growth. The net contribution from claims experience was essentially unchanged from a year ago, but about $35 million below our average expectations. Historically, the first quarter has tended to reflect the lower contribution from mortality than the average for the year. The contribution for net investment results was essentially unchanged from a year ago. Lower returns on non-coupon investments, which were about $10 million below our average expectations, were offset by the benefits from a larger investment base.","Turning to slide 12, individual life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $21 million or 17% from a year ago. Guaranteed universal life sales contributed about half of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands, where we repriced last year to bring our rates more in line with the market. We continually monitor expected returns and competitor actions, and in February, we implemented modest price increases. The remainder of the increase in sales came mainly from Variable Life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy.","Moving now to slide 13, group insurance earnings were $26 million for the quarter compared to $30 million a year ago. A lower contribution from investment results with non-coupon returns, about $10 million below our average expectations, together with higher expenses more than offset more favorable underwriting results driven by Group Life. The current quarter total benefits ratio was more favorable than a year ago and within our targeted range of 87% to 91%.","Turning to slide 14, Group Insurance sales based on annualized new business premiums were $311 million for the quarter, nearly double the level of a year ago. Most sales occur in the first quarter based on calendar year inception. Following the substantial completion of underwriting and repricing actions we've taken over the last few years, we did see an increase in sales of both Group Life and Group Disability, including more larger cases.","Moving now to International Insurance, and turning to slide 15, earnings of our Life Planner business were $410 million for the quarter compared to $439 million a year ago. Excluding a $30 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by less favorable mortality experience, higher expenses, including non-linear items such as legal and business development costs and a lower contribution from investment results, including non-coupon investment returns, about $5 million below our average expectations.","Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially consistent with our average expectations, but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $30 million in relation to a quarterly average.","Turning to slide 16, Gibraltar Life earnings were $369 million for the quarter compared to $395 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $28 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Looking at some key components, the benefits to earnings from business growth, including the initial contribution of our investment in AFP habitat in Chile and more favorable mortality experience in the current quarter, were offset by a lower contribution from investment results of about $40 million. Business growth drove an increase in earnings of about $20 million with about half from Chile, including above average returns on the co-investment in the managed funds otherwise known as the encaje.","The contribution to earnings from mortality experience, which was about $5 million more favorable than our average expectations, exceeded the year ago quarter by about $15 million. Net investment results included returns on non-coupon investments, about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter, compared to about $40 million above expectations a year ago. This $60 million variance was partly offset by benefits to spread results including higher prepayment income and growth in the base of invested assets.","Turning to slide 17, international insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $781 million for the current quarter, up by $86 million or 12% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and by Gibraltar's bank channel and life consultants. About 45% of our current quarter sales in Japan were U.S. dollar products compared to roughly one-third of sales a year ago. Life Planner sales in Japan were up by 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent count, together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. Gibraltar sales were also up by 15% from a year ago.","Sales from the bank channel increased by 27%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product and by death protection products. Life consultant sales increased by 10%, benefiting from a recently introduced U.S. dollar whole life product that has been popular among clients seeking maximum death protection in early contract years.","Turning to slide 18, the corporate and other loss was $312 million for the current quarter compared to a $253 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are: lower investment income, reflecting a benefit in the year ago quarter from returns on assets from our closed block restructuring that were subsequently deployed in our businesses; and higher expenses, including items such as legal costs, which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year end.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mark. I'm going to give an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest starting on slide 19.","As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 484%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio as of the end of the first quarter is well above our 400% target. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 877% and 929%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, December 31, 2015. We expect these ratios to be above our targets as of their fiscal year end on March 31.","Looking at liquidity, leverage, and capital deployment highlights on slide 20. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The decline of about $1 billion from year end was driven primarily by our shareholder distributions, debt reduction and acquisition funding. The excess over our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of March 31 remained within our targets.","During the first quarter, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders, including $375 million of share repurchases under the $1.5 billion authorization for the year. And in March, we funded the purchase of our stake in AFP Habitat in Chile, with a purchase price of about $530 million. As John noted, we maintained our capital capacity at a level not meaningfully different than what we reported at year-end.","Let me provide an update on a few other noteworthy items. The fair value of our yen equity hedge was about $760 million at the end of the quarter, compared to $1.7 billion at year-end. The decline in fair value is, as expected, in response to the 7% strengthening of the yen in relation to the U.S. dollar during the quarter and corresponds to an increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent of yen earnings in Japan over time. Expected cash flows from the yen hedge in 2016 reflect scheduled settlements that are essentially unaffected by the change in fair value. While the fair value of our equity hedge declined sequentially, it continued to operate as designed to protect the value of our businesses and the overall return profile against currency moves in our largest overseas operation.","On our energy holdings, our net unrealized loss on the energy sector fixed maturities, excluding the closed block, at the end of the quarter, was about $200 million, essentially unchanged from year-end. 83% of fixed maturities were investment grade.","To update you on the variable annuity recapture, on April 1, we recaptured the living benefit risks from our captive reinsurer, moving the rider risks into our statutory insurance companies to be managed together with the base contracts. This marks a major milestone in our initiative, which is on track for completion over the course of the year.","Now, I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And we'd like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will go directly to the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to start with a question on Japan, and I was hoping you could provide some more color on the sales growth this quarter. And for POJ, talk about what's driving the increase in productivity and whether you think sales can continue outpacing Life Planner growth.","Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP","Sure. So In terms of sales, on the Life Planner side, and then if you want, I can do Gibraltar, but sales were up about 15%. And that's half, as indicated before, due to the Life Planner growth of about 6% and then some due to the productivity. But the Life Planner growth has really come from the sales manager growth, which is really up 7%. And we talked about that for about the past year, where we've increased the number of sales managers. And that has a lag effect but then goes to the increase in Life Planners.","So, the real answer is it really is the \u2013 both the productivity and the number of Life Planners that has led to the growth. And there's a little increase in premium, but not really that much. It's mainly the Life Planner growth and the solid growth there.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And are you seeing more competition in non-yen denominated products given the drop in JGB yields?","Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP","We're seeing some increase in competition, but we have such a range of non-yen products \u2013 and it's retirement income, it's whole life, it's fixed annuities \u2013 that we enjoyed a great deal of increase in the sales of the past quarter were in non-yen products. So, there may be more competition, but we're still seeing significant growth in that area.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then, John, if I could just ask one more. I was just hoping that you could expand on your comment that you have options to challenge your SIFI designation or pursue a SIFI off ramp. I was just wondering if you could comment on what are the different mechanisms available to you?","John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think Mark is best to speak to that. Mark?","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Yeah. First, with respect to the notion of an off ramp, that's a pretty vague concept that hasn't really been operationalized yet. So I wouldn't be thinking in terms of the options that we might have to reconfigure the company in a way at this point that would make an off ramp a clear option. The reference is primarily to the ongoing designation process, which does involve an annual redesignation, and in the context of the way the annual redesignation works, we retain the ability or the option if we choose to, following a redesignation decision to contest that decision and to contest that decision in court. So, the principal option that's referenced there is the process that we go through every year in redesignation and the fact that options remain open to us as we're redesignated.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. So you do have a legal option to challenge a redesignation.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Yes.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, first on the recapture of the VA captive, are you able to discuss what you expect the capital impact of that to be if there is one?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jimmy, we expect to be able to cover it more holistically in our second quarter call. I can offer some comments on where we are.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We remain on schedule to recapture VA captive, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. We're doing that in phases \u2013 the entire project \u2013 through 2016. Recall that the first step of that was actually accomplished last quarter when we got the regulatory approval for our statutory framework. And then the second step is what we've mentioned, which is as of April 1, we've done the actual recapture of the Living Benefit rider from the captive back into the ceding companies.","We have some remaining steps in front of us. They're around ALM strategy, around some of our hedging strategies, implementation of those, and then operationalizing and reporting around those as well. I think the important takeaways are that one, we're \u2013 this is part of a broader strategy we have around a priority of reducing volatility in our reported results \u2013 and ensuring that the very strong fundamentals that we have in our businesses are being mapped to and visible in our reported financial results. And I think in the first quarter, you've seen some of the benefits of that in terms of the reduced volatility that we had in our capital numbers in the quarter.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I'm assuming you're not assuming a huge impact. Obviously, you can't give me precise numbers on your capital, otherwise there would have been either a comment on that or maybe a slowdown in buybacks or something else, right?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, again, Jimmy, it's a multiphase. And so, simply upon recapture doesn't mean that there's instantaneously the pro forma effect of what we ultimately hope to accomplish with regard to the recapture initiative as opposed to the physical recapture itself. And I think what we've said is, we can accomplish all of this and we're confident in doing so, that there will be no adverse impact to our overall financial resources; and in fact, we expect increased financial flexibility as a result of the completion of the initiative.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one for Charlie on Japan. How has the depressed JGB yield environment there caused you to change your strategy for the Japanese business if it has, and the type of products that you're avoiding versus the ones that you're pushing more proactively.","Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP","Well, I think it is affected us obviously over time. We've been dealing with low rates for a long period of time. They're obviously lower now than they were before. But we have, I think, proactively either eliminated products or lowered crediting rates or commissions, and we've been doing that for some period of time. In the last earnings call, I think I articulated that we stopped selling any single premium life or retirement products in the third party channels. And we've reduced crediting rates in some of the \u2013 in our other captive channels. So, we will continue to monitor this very closely.","The other way it has affected us, I think, is that we have sold more U.S. dollar products, and we've done that for a couple of reasons. One, as you said, rates are much lower in Japan, so on a relative basis, they're better in the U.S. But also, the appreciation of the yen has led people to think, gosh, with yen I can buy more dollars and therefore U.S. dollar products are more attractive. And with a wide range of suites \u2013 the suite of a wide range of products that we have in the U.S. \u2013 I think our product offering is quite attractive.","So we have, if you will, taken advantage of the lower rates by virtue of the products that we offer, and we'll continue to very proactively manage our product mix in order to protect margin.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the yen denominated business that's on your books, is that earning your targeted returns? Or is it a little bit of a drag versus what you had assumed previously?","Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP","Well, I think the amount we have on our books is returning what we want. The \u2013 obviously, we're not immune to negative interest rates, and there's some impact on our margins on the new products we sell. But again, we're looking at those products and we're lowering crediting rates and commissions and, in fact, eliminating some products that don't meet our hurdle rates.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Well, and this is Mark. Just remember how much of the profitability in Japan is driven by mortality margins and expense margins, not investment returns.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line Suneet Kamath with UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Rob, I was hoping you could, as you've done in the past, maybe walk us through the capital capacity walk. I think we ended the year at roughly $4 billion. I think you're saying you're kind of still there, but obviously there's kind of pluses and minuses. So, can you help us fill in the bridge between the two?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Suneet. So, as we've mentioned in the past, our businesses generate a significant amount of capital and there was no change from that in the first quarter. I think we provided sort of rules of thumb that are helpful around that. And that's the fact that about 60% of our operating earnings translated to free cash flow. So, you can think about that. While it varies in any given quarter, you can think about that as being a capital generating capacity in the form of free cash flow. And as I said, that's sort of representative of what we would see over a longer term, but also in the first quarter.","There were significant capital deployment actions during the course of the quarter. So, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we had about $0.7 billion of shareholder distributions. That was in the form of both share repurchases \u2013 and that's an elevated level. Recall that we increased our buyback program by about $0.5 billion at the end of last year for this year. We increased it from a $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And it was also in dividends. And recall, that we also increased that dividend rate by in excess of 20% last year.","So, those were the distributions. We funded about $0.5 billion from our Chilean acquisition. Now, that we had already earmarked from our capital capacity that we articulated at the end of the year, because it was an imminent transaction. So when you think about apples to apples, the Chilean acquisition was already taken out of the capacity number. And so, the remaining variable was the fact that we reduced our debt by about $0.25 billion. It was maturing and we paid that off.","So, thinking about sort of going from year-end to the end of this quarter, that you generated internal capital capacity that was sufficient to fund our shareholder distributions. The M&A activity and strategic investments were taken care of in our prior allocation of capital. And you have left the debt reduction, which would be sort of maybe a placeholder for the order of magnitude of change in our total capital capacity from year-end to where we are now.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, on the yen hedge, I had thought on prior calls we had talked about some cash payments moving from Japan to the holding company, as sort of an additional source of flexibility. But now it seems like you're indicating that there's not a significant change in the timing of those cash flows. So, I'm just curious why, given the significant strengthening we've seen in the yen, why wouldn't we expect at some point to see maybe cash flowing from the holding company to the Japanese entities?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good question. So let me bring that up a level and, if I can, respond to that more holistically. So, first, the hedge is doing exactly what it was designed to do. As and if the yen has depreciated, that has yielded proceeds to us. We've been able to take those proceeds and redeploy them, either in the form of share repurchases or in the form of investments in order to restore the ROE that otherwise would have been lost by virtue of the depreciation in the yen.","To your point, as the yen appreciates, you get things that could go the other direction. So, hedge settlements would go instead of from the Japanese companies to the holding company, they would go the other way. However, the point is that ROE is protected in either direction. And we've actually experienced this in the past. The higher yen earnings contribute to sustaining our targeted enterprise ROE because what happens is, over time, our yen earnings are higher. It creates greater dividend capacity, and that translates ultimately into greater U.S. dollar dividends coming back to us.","So, when we actually think about that yen hedge, it creates capital capacity when there's a depreciating yen. When there's an appreciating yen, what happens is we have something that I would consider to be more of a liquidity issue. Which is we temporarily have to fund the mark on those going down to the Japanese companies, but that ultimately works its way back to us in the form of higher earnings and greater dividends coming back to the holding company.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","But in terms of that lag, you're not expecting a big liquidity draw on holding company resources until you wait for those higher earnings from Japan to send cash back. I mean, there's a timing issue, but you're not expecting a big change in terms of that holding company liquidity, right?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That would be correct. So, two thoughts on that. First, with regard to this year particularly, as I alluded to in my introductory remarks, we actually have locked in our settlements for this year. So, we have about $0.5 billion for the entire year of pre-tax gains that are locked in for the year and in fact will be coming our way, regardless of what happens to the yen rate during the course of this year. That's one.","Two, the settlements beyond this year are actually staged out over long periods of times. And that is \u2013 and actually with the intent of trying to match up dividend paying capacity against settlements that we might otherwise have against those hedges. So, we're actually very conscious of that and ensuring that it doesn't create a short-term liquidity dislocation.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, Rob.","Operator","And we'll now go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I have a follow up question for Mark on the FSOC potential to legally contest. In terms of your legal right, are you \u2013 if you were to contest the redesignation, does that legally only apply to the specific redesignation process or does it allow you to essentially legally contest the entire designation to begin with?","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","No, it's the whole designation. I mean, technically that redesignation is a renewal of the original designation. So, we're talking about the same thing.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then quick one, do you have anything you can provide in terms of earnings expectations for the Habitat deal now that it's closed?","Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP","Um, I think what we have said is that the \u2013 we closed on March 1 and that the \u2013 we're very pleased with what we have so far in terms of earnings. Now, one month does not an acquisition make. And those earnings are in part coming from the stable cash flow and the dividends that come up. And part of it is from the encaje. And obviously, with the encaje having invested March 1, that was a good time to invest, given the quarter. So, we're pleased with the first quarter. It meets our original assumptions and return expectations and we'll see how it goes from here.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And this is Rob. The only thing I'd add to Charlie's comments is that, I think, as we've communicated, when we made this investment, this investment was accretive to what we viewed to be our hurdle rate ROE. So, when you sort of think about the returns that we expect to get on this, you can look at what we've paid for it, think about the ROEs that we expect to generate; that would give you an indication of what would be a sustainable level of ongoing earnings coming out of that investment.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next we have a question from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I know the PRT business is lumpy, but can you give us any more color on what you saw there in the first quarter and maybe if anything's changed due to market dislocation year to date?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sean, this is Steve. I'll address your question and thanks for it. We don't see any fundamental changes in PRT market dynamics. We think that the propensity to transact is still very strong. When it comes to interest rates, a big impact on propensity to transact is not just what rates are today, but what is a plan sponsor's expectations about rates in the future. And we see increasingly, a reduced expectation that rising rates will address the liability. So, we still see healthy propensity to transact.","Obviously, market conditions have, in some cases, impacted funding levels, but we've also seen, especially in the large case market that we specialize in, we've seen plan sponsors undertake steps to protect those funding levels through various types of hedging instruments. Not with us, but in their investment activities.","So, like I say, we still see healthy pipeline. I will mention that since the close of the quarter, we have announced a longevity deal in the UK with Legal & General of less than $500 million. So as I said, we still see healthy pipeline. And when you consider the increasing awareness of the longevity risk, when you consider the rising PBGC premiums, we still see lots of inclination for plan sponsors to pursue this solution.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And if I could just ask one about the non-coupon investment income, other liability driven investors are rethinking their allocations to the hedge funds, given some of the performance issues and the volatility they introduce. I'm just wondering if you can give us some color on what your outlook in the medium term for hedge fund allocation is?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So Sean, of our $8.8 billion alternatives portfolio, hedge funds are a little over $1 billion of that, so about $1.1 billion. So, a little bit more than 10% of the portfolio in hedge funds, so not an overweight allocation to that. Within that portfolio, we've got some 40 different funds. They're diversified by strategy, by asset class, geography, their sources of the alpha that they generate and the level of hedging that they undertake to do.","We're actually quite pleased with the portfolio. We would look at the first quarter results as being something that would be kind of an outside of a couple standard deviations of expectation, that normally within a body of distribution around what would be volatility in the market, we would actually expect our hedge funds to mute volatility as contrasted to what you saw across the entire industry, including in our portfolio in the first quarter. So, we think we have a very carefully designed portfolio that we're actually quite pleased with, and we remain committed to retaining that as a portion of our alternatives portfolio.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Eric Berg with RBC. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. I have a question about the \u2013 just one question today \u2013 about the growing number of market participants, and this was referenced earlier, who are selling dollar denominated investments, both annuities and life insurance in Japan. It just strikes me as curious, and I guess this is more of a question of a cultural rather than a financial nature, but what is it about Japan and Japanese nationals that lead to the interest in these products exposing the customers to FX risk? I presume that in the typical transaction the customer is not hedging the customer's foreign exchange risk. It's exposed therefore to the possibility that down the road, either when the customer retires or the customer dies, the family will receive less money than the customer thought because of a weakening of the yen, the customer's family receives or customer in retirement receives dollar investments. What's your sense of why the customers are willing to take this FX risk? I guess I'd wrap up the question by saying I can't imagine if we sold yen denominated life insurance in the United States, it would be nearly as successful as your dollar denominated products there.","Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP","Well, I think the last comment you made is absolutely correct. I think the issue with Japanese consumers is one of having lived with a low interest rate environment for a long, long period of time and looking at the interest rate differential with the U.S. And yes, you are right. They do take the FX risks. But over time, what they believe and what their experience frankly has been, is that the FX risk is not as great as the interest rate differential and therefore they're willing to do that. You've seen it with the U.S. dollar product and you've seen it with the Aussie dollar product. And they're very savvy, because they'll go back and forth from time to time.","Now, most of the product we sell, as Mark suggested, is life insurance based, it's protection based. So they buy it for different reasons. It's not savings products, per se. But they do look at the interest rate differential and then make decisions accordingly, and they have for a long period of time because they've been living in an environment where those differentials in interest rates between Japan and then the U.S. and Australia have been there for a long period of time.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very clear. Thank you. Oh, you're going to say something else? Go ahead. I'm sorry.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Eric, also keep in mind that retail investors in Japan don't take a lot of other risks. They're very conservative in saving in the mattress as opposed to buying stocks for example. So this is one place where they just may choose to take risk instead of other places.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, good morning everybody. First, a question on the alternatives. Mark, I think you said that your expected return on your non-coupon investment portfolio is 6% to 7%. Is that pre-tax or after tax?","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Pre-tax.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Pre-tax.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That strikes me as awfully low compared at least to how other companies talk about the expected returns on their alternative investment portfolios. I was hoping maybe you could touch on that; maybe it's mix or something like that? Maybe it's Japanese equities? I don't know.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Steven, it's Rob. I'd say a couple things in response to that. One is, those are our actuarial expected returns as opposed to what our portfolio managers would expect. I would think our portfolio managers would concur with you. They're expectation is actually to produce a higher return, but when we build in our returns for budgeting and forecasting purposes and for purposes of communicating to you, we think about a level of conservatism in that. And those are the numbers that we express. That would be one.","Two, yes, if you look at the overall composition of our portfolio, you would say that it's got a conservative tilt to it. As I mentioned before, with respect to the hedge funds, our expectation with the hedge funds is to mute volatility as opposed to produce outsized returns. And then, similarly with respect to what we've got in our private equity allocation, which is about a quarter of the total alternatives budget, we look at that as \u2013 we don't take what you would consider to be sort of venture capital risk in our private equity \u2013 but rather more traditional private equity which would be further in in the risk spectrum.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, and thanks for that. And then moving on to asset management. I was interested, of the $166 billion, I think it was, of AUM that you have in equities, could you discuss maybe the split between what may be considered beta products as opposed to alpha products?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","Steven, this is Steve Pelletier. I'll address your question. I would say that if you look at our equity business overall, it is a business of active management. I would characterize it in two buckets. First, is our quantitative management. That's an area that we've been building out significantly over the past several years and we look to continue to do so. The other bucket is our fundamental equity management business, in particular, U.S. large cap growth. But increasingly, over the past couple of years we've been seeking to diversify that fundamental equity management business, also including areas such as International and global. So, we don't look to intend to get straight into the passive space. We think that's a space very well spoken for. But...","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Steve?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yes.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","If I can interrupt because I may have put the question wrong. I guess what I really wanted to know is how much of that business do you think is at risk of moving to a beta strategy?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","Well, we have seen the pressure, especially on actively managed equities. And like I say, we don't intend to address that challenge by going head-on into pure passive products, but we look to diversify our active management capabilities, both on the quantitative side and on the fundamental side.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","And we're investing in the business to achieve that.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks guys.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll now go to Randy Binner with FBR Capital. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, thanks. I guess I'm going to ask the DoL question that hasn't come up yet. And so, we've had calls with some other folks this morning and the basic concept that I think we're all trying to get to is, if you are primarily a manufacturer of variable annuities, which is the case, and you look forward to when you're going to be selling these Vas post-implementation of the DoL rule, that would be under the best interest contract. And so, it's kind of a two-part question. One, do you think that the distributor rather than the manufacturer would be the one who is a party to the legal risk of the best interest contract? And if that is the case, can you characterize your conversations with your distribution thus far and kind of how constructive they are so far on being able to sell VAs under the BIC?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","Randy, it's Steve again. I'll address your question. I'm not going to get into an apportionment of legal liability. I'm sure you understand that. But I would say that \u2013 I would point out that manufacturers will have a responsibility to perform certain processes and provide certain information to distributors so that they can fulfill their obligations under the contract. And we are making the necessary preparations to do exactly that.","I think if I could, just to address some other questions that I know have come up on other calls regarding the DoL, just to make some broader comments. The final rule does contain some meaningful improvements. We still think it creates significant challenges and changes in the industry as a whole. It can increase compliance costs, although I would say that that's not an overly consequential matter for a company of our size. And it can also contain, as you were pointing out, increased exposure to legal claims.","As such, we think it's more important than ever to really avoid those unintended consequences that we spoke about last summer on Investor Day, and insure continued access to education, advice, and product solutions. That's the position we've taken consistently and we'll continue to do so.","If you look at our three businesses most impacted on Prudential Advisors \u2013 and here I'm more talking about the differences between the original regulation and the final one \u2013 if you look at Prudential Advisors, the final rule did make the process for obtaining the required contract under the BIC exemption less onerous than it originally was. And it also permits us to deal on a negative consent basis with clients who had accounts established prior to the beginning of 2018. So that's helpful.","Final rule, also clarified how proprietary products can be sold to IRA owners, providing we address some significant new requirements. Again, that's useful. So, for Prudential Advisors, compliance and business processes will change, and we'll be ready for those changes. And we fully expect that unit to continue to play an important role in our distribution strategy.","For annuities, and you touched upon this in your question, Randy, the DoL did attempt to clarify the circumstances under which higher compensation for the sale of more complex products requiring more upfront time by the advisor is permissible, so long as that compensation is reasonable. And what that means will play out over time. The final rule did not include an exemption that would have favored lower cost products, such as index funds over higher cost, higher value products. And so, while these changes could help mitigate adverse impact on the VA sales, we do want to emphasize, we think it's really still premature to offer any predictions as to what that impact will be. That's going to play out over multiple years through the lens of advisor behavior and firm behavior. So we'll see what that proves out to be.","For Prudential Retirement, the third business I'd mention, the final regulation does contain meaningfully clearer delineation between investment advice and investment education, and we think that delineation will allow us to continue to offer our asset allocation services to DC plans. It's come up on other calls about the sales exception for plans with 100 and more participants. In the original rule that was changed to a $50 million or above in assets exemption or threshold. The bulk of our business focuses in the larger case market and we expect the vast preponderance of our business to continue to qualify for either exemption threshold.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Thank you. That was really comprehensive. I just wanted to clarify though, as the manufacturer, while you have a lot of responsibilities as you laid out, it's not \u2013 you are not the signatory, if you will, to the BIC? That's still \u2013 that rests with \u2013 the distribution is the financial institution?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They're the signatory to the BIC, but as I say, manufacturers will be expected to do certain things and provide types of information to support the distributor in fulfilling those obligations.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Thank you very much.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Christie, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes we do. We'll go to the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just one follow-up question related to the other related revenue in asset management. I understand that line item could be \u2013 could fluctuate from time to time. And my \u2013 at least my understanding is \u2013 in the first quarter, at least one of your peers talked about there's a slowdown in commercial mortgage loan origination activities and that hurt their similar type of fee revenue for the quarter. Do you see something similar in this quarter? And if so, how is the second quarter to date kind of trending in terms of commercial mortgage loan activities?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","Humphrey, this is Steve again. That really wasn't a factor in our ORR results, our other related revenue results. The year-on-year decline that Mark cited in his review was really driven by performance and incentive fees, which were impacted by market turbulence and by strategic investing, which was also impacted by market turbulence.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. And then, in terms of kind of thinking on a normalized basis, again, I understand you don't provide explicit guidance for this line of items. But, what would be more of a trendable or more sustainable level that \u2013 at least for modeling purposes?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.","Humphrey, I would just describe the recent trend and the recent quarterly trend in this category has been about $30 million.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay.

Please go ahead.","Darin Arita","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.

We will report our third quarter results on Monday, November 4, and host the conference call on Tuesday, November 5 at 11:00 AM.","With that, I will hand it over to Charlie.","Charlie Lowrey","Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we outlined in our Investor Day in early June, we are accelerating our strategy to bring greater financial opportunity to more customers and to enhance the value we provide to our investors. Across each of our businesses, we are energized by our purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. As expectations of our customers rapidly evolve, it\u2019s imperative that we\u2019ll move quickly and with urgency to achieve our purpose.","Despite what we would characterize as a mixed quarter, we remained confident about the financial goals we shared with you during our Investor Day. At that time, we increased our return on equity goal to a range of 12% to 14% from the prior range of 12% to 13%. We also articulated how we can achieve a high-single digit earnings per share growth rate over the intermediate term with potential for a low-double digit growth rate over the longer term.","The strength of our distinct business model and ability to execute our strategy gives us confidence that we will achieve our financial results. Our U.S. Financial Wellness businesses, PGIM and our International business offers unique scale and growth opportunities that cannot be easily replicated. In the near-term however, we expect several factors to impact our level of earnings.","First, as we discussed on Investor Day, there will be implementation costs from accelerating our strategy. Second, the significant decline in long-term interest rates over the past six months obviously affects our spread income and reinvestment rates of our general account. Third, this quarter\u2019s assumption update in Individual Life reduced future earnings. And fourth, we expect lower earnings in Gibraltar.","Now we have ways to mitigate some of these effects. We believe the actions to accelerate our strategy will lead to $500 million of margin improvement, which we expect to realize a run rate level of $50 million by the end of this year. In addition, we can adjust our pricing, streamline distribution and optimize our in-force book, all of which we are seriously pursuing.","As we said during our last call and on Investor Day, we\u2019re also very focused on connecting our track record of operating fundamentals with commensurate financial outcomes. Quite frankly, part of this is on us to produce better financial results and we get it, but part of this relates to better aligning external expectations with our internal forecasts. And part of this call is focused on trying to do that.","As a result, we enhanced our disclosures this quarter to help give you better visibility on our expected results and Ken will cover this in more detail. We also continue to explore ways to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings, which as you know, has been and remains an ongoing effort.","Turning back to the second quarter financial results, we generated return on equity of 12.9%, which is in line with our 12% to 14% goal. We grew up adjusted book value per share by 5% from a year ago to a record level of $97.15.","We also maintained a rock solid balance sheet. This provided the foundation for us to return $911 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our quarterly dividend of $1 per share represents a 4% yield on our adjusted book value. Our holding company\u2019s highly liquid assets stood at $4.9 billion at the top end of our target range of $3 billion to $5 billion.","Turning to Slide 3, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.14, up from $3.1 a year ago. Our sales in that flows varied by business and were mixed in this quarter, but we continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities.","During the quarter, PGIM had net outflows driven by a large client withdrawal, which was unfortunate, but frankly inevitable from time to time when you were the 10th largest asset manager in the world. Also Gibraltar had lower sales as we focused on recurring premium product and profitability over the total sales amount, which is consistent with the way in which we run this business.","On the positive side, our Retirement business achieved record account levels of $478 billion and net flows of $15 billion, driven primarily by a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. And our Individual Annuities and Individual Life sales were up 29% and 27%, respectively. Our Individual Annuities business continue to generate consistent quarterly dividends to the parent company, but more than $1.1 billion produced over the past 12 months. Finally our Life Planner headcount in our International business reached an all-time high.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob to touch on strategic highlights from the quarter.","Rob Falzon","Thanks, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide more color on how we were growing our three differentiated businesses, U.S. Financial Wellness, PGIM and International. As shown on the Slide 4, U.S. Financial Wellness represents our Workplace and Individual Solutions businesses that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. A broad set of integrated capabilities including advice, retirement, investments and insurance solutions, continue to help people with their Financial Wellness needs.","Our Financial Wellness proposition is resonating with Workplace customers, particularly from higher sales. And it is resonating with the employees of those customers, driving higher participation rates in the employer benefit programs and increased engagement with our advice platform. We believe the success has the potential to increase the intermediate term earnings growth rate of our underlying U.S. businesses into the mid- to high-single digits.","There are three drivers of this earnings growth and Financial Wellness. First, we expect increased operating margins across our Workplace and Individual Solutions businesses. This will result from the comprehensive at scale solutions that our businesses provide and the investments that we\u2019re making to enable our broad capabilities, while enhancing the customer experience. The current quarter, we incurred about $20 million of implementation costs to support programs that will accelerate our Financial Wellness strategy. We believe these actions along with the other programs over the next three years will lead to $500 million of margin improvement by 2020.","Second, we expect increased revenues in our Workplace Solutions businesses due to the competitiveness of our Financial Wellness platform and increased utilization of the existing employer offered benefits by our clients and employees. Since the end of the first quarter of this year, the number of people who have activated our digital Financial Wellness platform has increased from $8.1 million to $8.6 million as of June 30. This platform provides a digital venue to address a variety of needs including education on financial wellness topics, assessment of financial health and tools that enable people to take action and improve their financial outcomes.","In addition, our prudential pathways program has been adopted by 650 of our workplace clients. In this program, employees of our workplace customers participate in financial seminars, delivered by Prudential\u2019s financial advisors and designed to help educate people so they can improve their financial outcomes.","And third, we expect increased revenues in our individual solutions business, due to our ability to provide additional solutions to the employees of our workplace customers and to other retail customers. One way, we deliver these solutions is to LINK by Prudential, which is our highly interactive personalized online resource, enables people to create a path toward achieving their financial goals. Began to deploy LINK on our workplace platform last quarter, and we have already made it available to roughly 1.3 million people up from 200,000 at the end of March. Our goal is to double this to 2.5 million people by year end. Ultimately, we believe our solutions to change the way people approach their financial health, produce better results for employers and significantly expand our addressable market, thereby enhancing our long-term growth potential.","Turning to Slide 5. PGIM, our asset management business has $1.3 trillion of assets under management. It is a top 10 global asset manager, ranking as the fifth largest investor in fixed income and the third largest investor in the alternative investments area, with significant real estate and private platforms. PGIM is the investment engine of Prudential and benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. Financial Wellness and International Insurance businesses.","PGIM\u2019s asset origination capability and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage to our businesses, helping those businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers, both retail and institutional. And our businesses, in churn provide a differentiated source of growth for PGIM through affiliated AUM flows, that complement its successful third-party track record.","Consistent with our historical earnings growth, we expect PGIM to generate mid-to-high single digit earnings growth through a market cycle. This is driven by revenue growth from our proven ability to capture industry flows and market share in the areas where we already have leading capabilities while expanding our margins. Our strong investment performance and expertise across our broad range of asset classes has allowed us to attract flows into higher returns \u2013higher return strategies such as emerging markets and alternatives.","This focus on higher yielding strategies and asset classes has resulted in our ability to maintain a 22 basis point overall asset management fee yield. 90% or more of the assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last five and 10 year periods. And this investment performance has driven 16 consecutive years of positive third-party institutional debt flows, which we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll continue to despite the $5 billion third-party net outflows that we experienced in the current quarter.","These institutional outflows were mainly driven by a single fixed income client withdrawal of $5 billion. We serve many of the world\u2019s largest pension funds and other institutional investors. And as a result, we\u2019ll experience large idiosyncratic inflows and outflows from time-to-time. Our third-party net retail inflows were $1 billion driven by fixed income flows, partially offset by equity outflows. We\u2019re encouraged by our pipeline of mandates in our ability to continue to grow PGIM via the investments we\u2019ve been making to expand our global distribution. The growth opportunities we see in markets such as alternatives, U.S. defined contribution in retail and international and the investments we\u2019re making in technology.","Now turning to Slide 6. Our International business includes our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution, as well as other expanding businesses in high growth markets like Brazil. We anticipate being able to grow earnings in our international business at a mid-single-digit rate over the intermediate term driven by sustainable revenue growth and stable margins while continuing to produce ROEs in the mid-teens.","Life Planner sales which are about half of the total international sales in the current quarter, increased by 5% compared to the year ago quarter. This was driven by higher U.S. dollar sales in Japan and continued growth in our Brazil operations. Sales for Gibraltar which represents the other half of international were 26% lower than a year ago. This reflects lower single pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant channel, as we continue to focus on recurring pay protection products.","In addition, the recent decline in U.S. interest rates resulted in lower credit and grades which also affected sales. Additionally, sales were affected by continued to competitive conditions in the bank channel and lower production in our independent agency channel. We expect these channels to be more volatile sources of growth measured in the short-term viewed as competitive market pricing dynamics. We\u2019ll continue to innovate new products and consider pricing actions or focusing on maintaining our target level of profitability to improve sales over time, particularly in our life consultant channel.","In summary, our differentiated businesses, awful strategies and quality execution continue to serve our customers well and will generate profitable and attractive returns consistent with the intermediate term expectations that we articulated during our recent Investor Day.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken.","Ken Tanji","Thanks, Rob. I will begin on Slide 7, with some enhanced disclosures that we\u2019ve added this quarter to provide more insights about our earnings for the upcoming third quarter and beyond relative to our current second quarter earnings. First we begin with our second quarter of pretax adjusted operating income, which was $1.7 billion and resulted in earnings per shares of $3.14. Then when we adjust for these items, we get a baseline of $3 per share for the third quarter, before including the impact of future share purchases, business growth and market impacts.","Now there are three categories to consider. First, the second quarter included a net unfavorable impact of $49 million from this year\u2019s annual actuarial review, which will not occur in the third quarter. Second, we assume variable investment income. We\u2019ll return to a normalized level, which is worth $90 million. And third, there are other considerations we expect will lower results by 30 million in the third quarter.","Gibraltar earnings are expected to be $15 million lower due to lower sales and lower interest rates, and corporate and other is expected to have $15 million of higher expenses. Well, we have provided these items to consider, there may be inevitably be other factors that affect third quarter earnings per share. Also, as Rob mentioned, we incurred about $20 million of an implementation costs to accelerate our financial wellness strategy in the current quarter. We hope this slide provides enhanced visibility for future EPS considerations Also on Slide 18, we have provided information regarding seasonal item by business. One item to note is the end of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement in the first quarter of 2020, which has recently been approximately $15 million per quarter.","Turning to Slide 8. I\u2019ll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $911 million to shareholders during the current quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchases authorization for the remainder of the year is $1 billion as of June 30, and over the last five years we\u2019ve increased our dividend per share by 16% per year on average.","As Charlie noted, our quarterly dividend of $1 represents a 4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. We\u2019re also pleased that Moody\u2019s recently acknowledged our financial strength with our credit upgrades. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter, consistent with the first quarter of 2019, and at the top end of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We look to continue to invest in our businesses to grow assessed acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders.","Turning to Slide 9, and in summary, we are focused on accelerating our strategy and remain confident in our planned initiatives for growth. We have generated an ROE that is within our goal of 12% to 14% along with a record high adjusted book value per share. We continue to generate strong cash flows that support consistent growth in dividends and other distributions to shareholders, and we maintain a robust capital and liquidity position with financial flexibility.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thanks and good morning. So looking at Slide 7, you baseline the earnings at $3, would annualize to $12. That\u2019s a quite significant reduction from the $12.75 midpoint guidance you provided at the outlook call. Now, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted a number of factors behind that, but hoping you can go run through each of those in some more detail.","Ken Tanji","Yes, sure. This is Ken. So we don\u2019t want to update guidance, but what I thought I could do is highlight a few items to consider that we\u2019re not in our guidance that we gave last December. Now, first, as we\u2019ve articulated the Financial Wellness implementation costs, we announced that at Investor Day that\u2019s going to trim EPS in the second half of the year. We also updated this quarter, our mortality assumptions in Individual Life and that will have an ongoing impact into the second quarter.","And then interest rates that we assumed in our guidance where \u2013 now where we\u2019ll find ourselves, we\u2019re about over 100 basis points below that. Now that is partially offset by equity markets that are higher, but those to net to a negative. So if you added all of those together, that\u2019s worth about $0.50 relative to our guidance for the second half of the year.","Nigel Dally","Okay. And just \u2013 also I think, it looked like Gibraltar earnings are going to be somewhat softer than expected. Just the details behind that one too.","Ken Tanji","Yes. And that\u2019s also captured in the interest rate comment that I made. Maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott for a little bit more background on that.","Scott Sleyster","Yes. So in terms of Gibraltar earnings, we\u2019re impacted by several factors, some of which will persist through year-end. Net of the favorable assumptions in Gibraltar earnings were down about $35 million year-over-year. And the key contributors to this decline were really driven by two factors; underwriting which was still favorable to our pricing assumptions was less favorable than last year, and that represents about a third of that. And then the balance of the decline was largely driven by higher expenses related to certain technology and end of life system spends, process improvements in automation and investments that we\u2019re making to support future growth.","At Investor Day, I noted that PII is starting to leverage some of the capabilities that have been deployed in the U.S. as part of the customer office and Financial Wellness initiatives, and additionally given increased scrutiny on suitability and sales compliance. We\u2019re also investing in process and systems that support our distribution including those that ensure appropriate oversight. So we\u2019re accelerating some of these efforts and we expect this level of spend to persist through year-end and into early 2020.","I think looking forward to the balance of the year, as Ken noted, the recent decline in rates and lower sales will also weigh on Gibraltar\u2019s year-end results. Meanwhile, the total Japan operations continue to generate strong cash flow to PFI, we distributed $1.1 billion in the second quarter alone.","Nigel Dally","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, so you guys updated, expanded your ROE range at your Investor Day, which obviously was pretty close to the end of the quarter, and now you reset your current forward earnings expectations for a couple of your main businesses. And so I guess, does this pushback, in your mind, you\u2019re hitting kind of the topper end, top end of that ROE target that you just relate to The Street?","Charlie Lowrey","Yes. So, our ROE objective is 12% to 14%, and that is a range and for the first half of the year we\u2019re at 12.9%. When we sent that objective, we did assume rates at the time would continue to increase consistent with the forward curve. We\u2019ve given sensitivities that show the impact of rates, which is gradual over time. And so as we think about that, if rates were persist, you would see \u2013 that have some impact into our ROE, but our initiatives that we have to expand margins and to accelerate our strategy, we think will keep us within our 12% to 14% ROE objective in the intermediate term.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of the Financial Wellness plan, you guys \u2013 the initiatives there, you guys called out some expenses in the quarter. When you guys laid that out at the Investor Day, you told us what the expenses were and then also the saves, obviously, takes a little longer for the saves to start rolling into the numbers. Can you just give us a sense of when we should start seeing some of the saves coming to the numbers, and then also in terms of sequentially how much higher those expenses could be as we think about them building up from the second to the third quarter?","Rob Falzon","Elyse, it\u2019s Rob. Our view on the initiatives that we\u2019re undertaking with respect to Financial Wellness and both the costs and benefits for that are still consistent with what we outlined on Investor Day. We think through the year we\u2019ll have about $135 million in expenses, $20 million of which you saw in the current quarter. And then we would expect that those expenses will generate about $50 million of run rate earnings by the end of the year. You\u2019ll see those fully in 2020 given that they sort of build into a run rate through the course of the year.","The initiatives are all in flight, but are back ended in the context of sort of when we\u2019ll be incurring costs on a quarter to quarter basis, so less than the second quarter, comparable to slightly more kind of a level in the third quarter that\u2019s included in the slide that Ken walked you through in terms of expectations for costs related to corporate and other in the third quarter, and then the net more elevated level in the fourth quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And one last quick question for corporate. In the past, you guys have guided to higher expenses in the fourth quarter. I know Slide 7 was setting the base for the third quarter, but are you still expecting that in this year Q4 corporate expenses would be higher than what we see during \u2013 the average of the first three quarters?","Charlie Lowrey","Yes. That\u2019s been the pattern of our expenses and we would expect that to continue this fourth quarter and we\u2019ll give you a little bit more specific guidance around that at the end of the third quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, good morning. You mentioned that you still believe you can generate the high-single digit intermediate term EPS growth. Is that \u2013 does that contemplate some of the step down function in the near-term earnings power or is that \u2013 or should we think about that more as the growth rate off of the lower near-term EPS base?","Rob Falzon","Ryan, it\u2019s Rob. The change in expectations with regard to this year vis-\u00e0-vis the guides we provided you, it\u2019s not material in the context of what we would expect in terms of that intermediate term growth rate. So I don\u2019t think we would view that as being a material input into our ability to achieve that more elevated level of growth.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. And then as you mentioned, potential in-force actions as one of the possible offsets, can you expand some on \u2013 in terms of what you might be contemplating there?","Steve Pelletier","Ryan, it\u2019s Steve, I\u2019ll take that part of your question. In Individual Life, we\u2019re looking at three main drivers in an effort to improve returns in that business over the next few years. What you mentioned is one of them, I\u2019d just \u2013 first I\u2019d mentioned though, that we continue to generate strong sales of the business.","The new business that we\u2019ve been writing over the last few years, I should point out has been priced using much more current assumptions that are very different from the assumptions used to price the legacy products that have generated some of the recent charges we\u2019ve taken. We remain quite disciplined in our pricing. And our new sales have a very well diversified mix and we think these newer sales will help significantly and profitably growing the business over the next several years.","Second part of the plan is exploring different options for optimizing our in-force management as you referenced that largely refers, Ryan, to exploring a wider range of reinsurance options. And third, we continue to be focused on the cost effectiveness of the Individual Life business platform. That certainly includes ongoing and continuing efforts to enhance the cost effectiveness of the businesses operating platform, but we\u2019re also exploring some innovative new ways of delivering our life insurance products to the marketplace in a cost effective way. All of this is intended to improve returns in a business that remains an important part of our overall business mix. It serves an important need in the marketplace and is a critical part of our Financial Wellness value proposition.","Ryan Krueger","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. First question I wanted to ask you is on Japan. Can you provide a little perspective on what\u2019s going in that market more broadly? Gibraltar, I know you highlighted the weaker sales levels on the FX products, POJ looks like they held up better. Are you seeing significant increase in competitive pressures from the domestics? And also I think I heard a mention of some regulatory scrutiny, is that on the FX product, and maybe some elaboration there? Thanks.","Scott Sleyster","Hi, Tom, this is Scott. Let me start. I think I gave you a pretty good rundown on Gibraltar, let me start with POJ and then come back to your \u2013 more details in your question. So, in the case of POJ, our in-force block continues to grow and the in-force block was actually up almost 5% year-over-year. And additionally, our Life Planner account in Japan was also up about 5%, I think a little more than 5% year-over-year. And you may recall that\u2019s comfortably ahead of the 2% \u2013 2% to 3% Life Planner overall growth that we noted on Investor Day.","So I would say the fundamentals of the POJ business remain quite strong and sort of most of the challenges that we\u2019re facing have been on the Gibraltar side. I talked a little bit about the spends on accelerating some of the customer office and Financial Wellness. I also alluded to just enhancing the overall collection of data and automation that we have in light of the \u2013 I would say really global, not really restricted to Japan, focused on sales suitability. So we\u2019re trying to get that in place and probably accelerating that. In the case of Gibraltar sales, I think that\u2019s really where the market dynamics have been, more challenging for us.","As you know, particularly in our third-party distribution channels, we try to be very focused and disciplined about the products that we sell and meeting our return hurdles. And with that in mind, we are experiencing sales declines. We try to focus on recurring premium death protection products. We find those to be much more persistent. And so in the long run, we view those as is really the most attractive products for us to sell, but we also think they\u2019re the most beneficial to our customers. So therefore we\u2019re focusing less on single premium products, which tend to be more variable and subject to more pricing, I\u2019d say, other market factors like interest rates.","The good news is that our recurring premium sales have in fact increased nicely within the Life Consultant channel. However, this is being more than offset with lower sales on single-pay U.S. dollar annuities that are impacted both by competition and by the change in rates. I\u2019d say the other notable decline in sales was in the Bank channel, which primarily relates to trying to maintain the pricing discipline that I commented on earlier.","And then lastly, we experienced a smaller decline related to the tax law change in the independent agency channel. And as you know, those new regs are out, but there\u2019s a big backlog on developing new products at the FSA. I guess the point I would make there and on that is that despite these challenges, Gibraltar\u2019s in-force block actually grew 2% year-over-year, which again goes back to reflecting the high persistency of the recurring premium products that we sell there.","Tom Gallagher","That\u2019s helpful, Scott. Just as a quick follow-up on Japan, POJ or Life Planner in total does have very good persistency as well. It\u2019s still about 90, but that\u2019s actually been declining and it\u2019s declined 90 basis points sequentially. Is there anything going on, on persistency in that part of the business?","Scott Sleyster","I don\u2019t really think so. That was a really \u2013 that was a very small change. And if you look at it over \u2013 in the way we tend to is look it over longitudinally, over a long period of time, it still remains quite stable. So I don\u2019t think we see anything at this point that we view as significant. We of course watch it every quarter.","Charlie Lowrey","And Tom, this is Charlie, let me just give a little sort of a history of the Bank channel, because it\u2019s important to understand how we think about the Bank channel and that is the marginal sales aspect of it. So in a Bank channel sales can get away from you pretty quickly and we watched that like a hawk. And so what we\u2019re really focused on, as Scott said, is the profitability of the business and the type of product that we sell and that the sales volume will vary as a function of that. So there is more competition, especially on the end based side. And that\u2019s hurt our U.S. dollar sales and recurring premium sales.","But in our minds, what we\u2019re doing is protecting the level of profitability and the type of sale we have and letting sales volume vary as a result of that. And that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve approached the bank channel in the past. And it\u2019s completely consistent with the way we\u2019re doing it now.","Tom Gallagher","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. On the assumption review, are there going to be any impacts on your statutory results either in terms of stat earnings or year-end cash flow testing from these changes?","Charlie Lowrey","Yes. For life, the stat assumptions are prescribed so there wouldn\u2019t be a stat impact for the life to update. And then there would be \u2013 and then the favorable impact on the retirement update would be \u2013 would flow through to stat. So that\u2019s the extent of it.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then on the life assumption review, I mean, we\u2019ve been tracking this, I would say every year, it seems like over the past, call it four years, you\u2019ve had maybe $900 million or so of these assumption changes, just in the life business alone. So maybe some color on why is it this business that\u2019s getting so much of this impact and are you confident that kind of have this behind us now in terms of the current assumptions?","Steve Pelletier","Suneet, this is Steve. Let me make some kind of overall comments and then I\u2019d invite Ken to expand further. You\u2019re right about our experience over the past few years in the Individual Life business in the annual reviews. And most of that experience has been around adjustments on the mortality front including this year\u2019s. As a reminder though, if you extend the look back over the past six or seven years, our mortality experience has been largely aligned with our expectations over that period.","In addition, when you look at it from a Prudential total company standpoint, as we\u2019ve seen, the negative mortality experience in Individual Life, that\u2019s been offset to a quite meaningful degree with positive longevity experience in our retirement business, very much as designed and intended. With that said though, as I mentioned earlier, the ongoing impacts of the assumption updates that we\u2019ve taken cumulatively over the past few years have brought us to a place where we want to bolster and improve the current levels of return in the business. And the three point plan that I mentioned earlier is really how we think about that going forward over the next few years.","Ken Tanji","Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add is just a reminder that\u2019s some of the updates that we took a few years ago were related to systems conversions and going through that process and that part is behind us. And then also in terms of assumptions and evaluating the experience where it\u2019s credible, we call it like we see it and we stay current with that. So that\u2019s our philosophy with assumptions.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Andrew Kligerman","Thank you. Just trying to digest the response to Suneet\u2019s question, just simply because it\u2019s happened so many times in the last four years, but I think Ken just said, you call it like you see it. But Steve, you mentioned that you\u2019re exploring different options for the in-force management, including reinsurance. So if you\u2019re doing that and the reinsurer is taking a look at your block, why wouldn\u2019t we expect another charge to come, as they may be uncomfortable with the block?","Steve Pelletier","As I mentioned Andrew, we\u2019re looking at a range of reinsurance options, we already have, of course, an active reinsurance program. And that\u2019s been one where our dealings with the reinsurers have been quite productive, even over the past few years. As we\u2019ve had some of these updates and we will continue to explore different options including, as I mentioned an expanded range of them. So it\u2019s part of the picture, but not by any means the totality of\u2026","Andrew Kligerman","Could that conceivably end up in another charge?","Charlie Lowrey","Yes. We don\u2019t want to go into specifics in the theoretical. So \u2013 but reinsurance can also be used to narrow volatility as we reinsure more business and trim some of the larger case exposure. So there\u2019s a number of various way that we can think about the benefits associated with reinsurance and we\u2019re looking at that.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it.","Rob Falzon","It\u2019s rob, the only thing I\u2019d add on is to repeat as to what Ken said is, the intent of the assumption update was to bring current valuation of the liability to our best estimate of what mortality experience we\u2019re actually seeing in the underlying block. And so we would not expect a third-party to look at that and they\u2019d come to some different conclusion than we did.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And then just in the earlier questions, I think your response was that there\u2019s some backlog with the FSA and some regulatory considerations. Could you elaborate on that?","Ken Tanji","That was simply related to the change in the tax law that occurred in February and then was reiterated in July. So carriers like Prudential are designing some new products, but you have to file those products and go through the Q. So it\u2019s kind of the usual thing. But since it was related to a single action by the FSA there\u2019s just a Q.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And then just with the recent activity at the Japan Post, they had some misspelling, any higher degrees of scrutiny occurring with the regulators?","Charlie Lowrey","I guess what \u2013 I would say one, we\u2019re not really, we don\u2019t distribute through Japan Post on the one hand. But to the broader question, I think it was about two years ago, the, the FSA shifted to more of a principle based to kind of a framework kind of moving to global standards. And as they do that, I think they\u2019re rolling out their exam process and focusing more. And I think people are \u2013 as they go through that process, they\u2019re saying, gee, I want to make some modifications or change this or get in line. So I think that\u2019s really, it\u2019s a fairly \u2013 I would say a fairly orderly an expected process, but it is in fact the process that\u2019s underway. It\u2019s already a couple of years out. And my guess is it has a couple more years to go before it\u2019s fully rolled out.","Andrew Kligerman","Thanks much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question related to Gibraltar\u2019s earnings headwind. I think in Ken\u2019s remarks, you talked about roughly 15 million lower earnings power from lower sales and also high investments. Like on, I just want to see if that is kind of your expectation for the foreseeable future. As you mentioned, the headwinds would be kind of through 2020?","Ken Tanji","I guess, what I would say was, we\u2019re trying to, just based off some of the things are going on, and the benefits from putting some of these things in place, we\u2019re trying to get that done more quickly. So I don\u2019t think, I\u2019d say on the expense side you\u2019d expect a lot of that to run through all of 2020. But I guess, I would say I expect this over the next three to four quarters, not the next two.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. And then in terms of county, the lower sales and expense impacts, how should we think about that? Because I recall from your Japan Investor Day that you highlighted for both your POJ and Gibraltar business with sales doesn\u2019t really affect your in-force earnings. So I tell a little surprised to see earnings drop as a result of lower sales. So just wondering if is just more of expenses as opposed to sales?","Ken Tanji","Well, I think I gave you a proportion that it was a skewed a little heavier to expenses. But when you\u2019re looking at multiyear sales, we\u2019ve come down and it appears that we\u2019re bottoming out at these new levels. And by the way, we are taking actions whether it be in products or incentives, in some new designs to help offset. So we\u2019re not, if you will, standing still while we\u2019re experiencing that. But the cumulative effect of the sales levels being off, where they are and kind of plateauing at this level is also part of the equation.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. And then shifting gears to Retirement. Looking at the earnings run rate and outlook seems to be a little bit weaker than where it has been granted low interest rate definitely was the pressure, but I was just wondering if there\u2019s any other things that may have affected the earnings outlook for retirement in general.","Steve Pelletier","Humphrey, Its Steve, I\u2019ll address that part of your questions. The impact on retirement run rate earning is largely in the net interest income area. Part of it is what you just spoke about some spread compression as a result of the current rate environment. But another aspect of it is that at the end of last year, we released a significant amount of the AAT reserves in the Retirement business and transfer the assets backing them back to the parent company. And that also contributes to lower investment income for the business in 2019.","Humphrey Lee","So in terms, I guess, when you mentioned, the kind of the impact of the AAT reserve releases on the investment income, like how should we think about that?","Charlie Lowrey","Yes. So when we updated our assumptions in our Retirement business for AAT that led to a release of those reserves, but also if you recall, we last year we did strengthen our long term care reserves. And so that led to essentially a net \u2013 no net impact overall for the company. So although you\u2019ll see lower earnings in the retirement segment related to that, those reserves went to long term care, which is not included in NOI.","Humphrey Lee","Got It. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of John Nadel with UBS. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hey, thank you. Good morning. I have a couple of quick ones. Rob, it sounded like, with your commentary about PGIM, and an expectation that institutional net flows, we\u2019ll continue this string on an annual basis to positive. I assume that\u2019s within eye towards your pipeline for the back half of the year. Can you just maybe expand on that?","Steve Pelletier","John, this is Steve. I\u2019ll address that part of your question. Yes. I think the circumstances around this particular outflow this quarter were mentioned by Charlie. I just mentioned a little bit more about it. It really was a matter of a client looking to consolidate the number of managers they work with. We\u2019re quite familiar with that dynamic. We have very frequently been the beneficiary of it. This was one particular time when the dynamic worked against us. But we still have a great deal of confidence in the ability of the business to continue to demonstrate strong fundamentals and strong net flows continuing the 16 years string on the institutional front.","I would say that\u2019s born out of a number of things. Number one, we do see an attractive near term pipeline in the marketplace. And we like our prospects for competing for that opportunity set given strong investment performance, deep expertise across a range of asset classes and investment strategies, and investments that we\u2019ve made in our distribution platform. All of those things taken together have been the contributors and the drivers of solid net flows and we expect they\u2019ll continue to be.","John Nadel","Thank you. And then maybe for Ken or Rob, looking at Slide 18 of the deck, I wanted to make sure that I understand how to interpret this, because I think the seasonal portion of this is tremendously helpful and thank you for that. I\u2019m looking at the column that provides the baseline range. And I just want to understand the width of the range by segments. Are we to take that to mean that the \u2013 driven by seasonal and other factors in some quarters, the earnings can be at the low end of the range and then some, the high end of that range? Is that the way to interpret that?","Steve Pelletier","Let me maybe explain what that is. This is really just factual. So it is just \u2013 if you look at the last four quarters and you adjust for assumption updates, market experience updates, variable investment incomes, the things that are noted in the footnotes. That\u2019s the actual range that has occurred over the last four quarters.","John Nadel","Into to the last four. Got it.","Steve Pelletier","Just, there to give you a sense of what the highs and the lows have been.","John Nadel","Got you. Okay. So this isn\u2019t sort of a guide thing \u2013 this is just actual, it doesn\u2019t include any growth expectations?","Charlie Lowrey","No assumptions. It\u2019s just the facts of the last four quarters.","John Nadel","Got you. Perfect. And then our last one is I wanted to try to differentiate between run rate and actual dollar contribution thinking about the wellness initiative. You\u2019ve talked about a $50 million run rate contribution to earnings by the end of this year, but my sense is that the actual dollar contribution of earning in 2019 will be negligible. And first, I wanted to make sure I understand that correctly. And then second, if we fast forward and think about 2020, how should we differentiate between run rate and actual contribution?","Rob Falzon","John, its Rob, let me try to address that. With regard to 2019 specifically recall that the expenses are largely backend weighted as well, and so\u2026","John Nadel","Yes, I\u2019m separating the expense item.","Rob Falzon","Yes. So the idea is in 2019, we\u2019ll incur those expenses and get to that run rate, level of savings. But by the time we\u2019ve incurred all those expenses, but because it happened so late in the year, to your point, there will be a relatively modest contribution in 2019 from an earning standpoint simply because both the expenses and the earnings are going to be concentrated in the latter part of the year. As you get into 2020 and beyond, what you see then is, from a pure earning standpoint, you\u2019ll see a combination of the benefit of the run rate from the prior year and then some portion of the building run rate during the course of that year contributing into the current year.","What we intend to do is, and we\u2019ll begin at the end of this year, we\u2019ll provide better visibility into both the sources of the expenses so you understand what initiatives they\u2019re linked to. And then importantly, how much and where we should expect to see the earnings of benefits associated with those initiatives. Right now it\u2019s just not material enough to provide that kind of detail. As we get further into this year, when we have more materiality, we\u2019ll provide that kind of insight and I think that will provide you a better basis then for being able to assess not just the run rate impact but how much of that run rate would be in the current year as opposed to for the succeeding year.","John Nadel","That\u2019s helpful. If I can squeeze one more follow-up on that. So if you achieve $500 million, what\u2019s the calendar year where we should see the full contribution of that $500 million?","Ken Tanji","That would be \u2013 we would achieve that by the end of 2022, and so you would see in 2023 the full year benefit of that.","John Nadel","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Hi. I just wanted to touch on individual annuities. I guess the ROA seems to continue to trend down there, and I know the long-term ROA target was a bit lower than where you have been running but I guess equity margins been strong. A little of bit of a surprise to me, that we\u2019d see that kind of accelerating down to the long-term ROA trend as it has with that the economic backdrop? Appreciating the rates had gone down too, but can you help us think through that? Should we just assume we\u2019re at that long-term ROA now? Any color it would be appreciated.","Ken Tanji","Yes, sure. It\u2019s Ken. So first, our ROA evidences the high profitability of our variable annuity business and the strong ROE. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we expected the ROA would trend down over time as our business persists and moves into lower fee tiers, but also as a result of our strategy to diversify our product mix.","Now, it should also probably useful to know that our earnings are less sensitive to markets than our account values and that\u2019s due to our hedging program. And so in the second quarter you saw, as you mentioned, the combination of two things; equity markets rising and interest rates falling and both those lead to increases in account values. And so it was really a denominator that led to the trimming of the ROA. And the point is here is our hedging program makes our earnings more stable than our account values.","Alex Scott","Got it. Okay. And then maybe a follow-up, just thinking more high level, you guys up to the high end of the ROE guide for the intermediate term that the outlook, has anything changed since that time or \u2013 just thinking through how much lower the earnings power is today from what I had thought at the time you were making those comments? It seems a bit more aspirational sitting here today than it did at that time. So can you help me think through, is there anything other than the Financial Wellness program I should be thinking about that would get you closer to the midpoint of that intermediate range?","Rob Falzon","So Alex, it\u2019s Rob. I think Ken did a good job of walking through sort of the impacts of \u2013 just sort of think about the guidance that we gave and then the change in that guidance being reflected in sort of a handful of items that we\u2019ve articulated. When we think about what we\u2019ve articulated on Investor Day, I think what\u2019s important to understand is that when we\u2019re at Investor Day what we\u2019re talking about direction and we\u2019re talking about strategy, and then the associated financial outcomes that result from that direction and strategy. And as we think about those, we measure those in years, not in quarters. Obviously, in guidance and in calls like this, we talk about sort of the more near term results.","On Investor Day, I think what I can reflect on is, first, Charlie had in his remarks indicated that we \u2013 that march towards, what we continue to believe is an achievable level of higher earnings and higher ROE would be non-linear. And I think you\u2019re seeing some of that non-linearity in the current quarter. Ken talked about both the potential for the life assumption update he told \u2013 I think you mentioned that we were taking a hard look at those assumptions during the Investor Day.","And then also we\u2019ve provided then and previously market sensitivity. So none of that I would consider to be particularly new information. And Scott, even when he talked about the international business, as you mentioned earlier, spoke to the fact that we would be adopting many of the initiatives that we have begun in the U.S. into Japan and we would expect to be making similar type investments there.","So I think that per Charlie\u2019s opening remarks that we remain very confident in the messages that we delivered on Investor Day, regarding both the intermediate and long-term prospects for our businesses. And nothing that\u2019s occurred in the current period, it causes us to feel any differently about what we messaged on Investor Day.","Alex Scott","Got it. Thanks for the responses.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the mortality topic. And I was curious, is the deterioration related to any specific vintages or types of policies, are you really reflecting a broader trend?","Steve Pelletier","Eric, it\u2019s Steve. I\u2019ll address your question. Main point is that the updates really related to longer dated vintages, earlier vintages in our book of business. In regard to looking at specific product categories that the onetime impact is largely experienced in the universal life block. The ongoing impact is primarily in universal life, but with some impact in other parts of the business as well, including term.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then you\u2019re having not quite a complete offsetting adjustment, but obviously the retirement business is benefiting on the longevity side, but you have differences in business mix there. So what is it? I guess it\u2019s driving the positive adjustment on that side of the business?","Steve Pelletier","Yes. The way we look at that, Eric, is that when we perform our annual review of assumptions and other refinements, the nature of the updates we make just as you\u2019re commenting, they vary from business to business and will naturally lead to differences in the extent and magnitude of onetime impacts versus ongoing impacts. The nature of the updates we made in our retirement business led us to record the more meaningful onetime adjustment that we mentioned and expected benefit payments. And while there were some ongoing benefits from our review when the retirement business, they\u2019re not of the same magnitude of the negative ongoing impact that we see in Individual Life, so that\u2019s why we emphasize that point about Individual Life.","Erik Bass","Got it. And just to be \u2013 make sure we have it correct, what would you size that ongoing impact for Individual Life? And is it something that should persist into perpetuity?","Charlie Lowrey","Yes, it\u2019s about $25 million a quarter. And it would be recurring for the foreseeable future.","Erik Bass","Got it.","Charlie Lowrey","But I want to mention, the things that Steve has in mind and the business has in mind too, to help offset some of that that we talked about earlier.","Erik Bass","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And due to the elapsed time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Charlie Lowrey for any closing comments.","Charlie Lowrey","Thanks. I\u2019d like to summarize our thinking and the actions we\u2019re taking because we\u2019ve talked about a lot of different things on this call and I\u2019ll divide into a couple of categories; one is the clarity of earnings; and two are some of the operational actions that we\u2019ve highlighted.","So in terms of clarity of earnings, we are in the process of simplifying our earnings and clarifying the visibility of our drivers and financial outcomes. And we\u2019re taking efforts to help you understand our earnings trend and has taken some material steps this quarter to do so, and we will continue to do so.","In terms of actual operations, we positioned 2019 and our guidance in 2019 in terms of a year of transition, and making investments that would enable us to grow in subsequent years and we\u2019re taking actions accordingly. So we talked about the investment in future work, which should produce $500 million of margin improvement over the next three years. Now, there are costs associated with that, as Rob indicated, and these initiatives are beginning to come through this year. And so these costs are upfront, which means there\u2019s a lag in terms of payback. So that\u2019s the first point.","The second is we aren\u2019t happy with the performance of our life business. And consistent with Steve comments, we are seeking to increase the performance of the business as well as looking at ways to optimize the in-force book.","And finally there have been higher expenses in certain businesses like Scott called out with Gibraltar. And as we think about changing the way in which operate, we have to spend money on new ways of becoming more efficient, investing in technology and platforms, et cetera. And some of these costs will be ongoing. It\u2019s really a cost of doing business in the current environment and others will be transitory, a surge and then levering \u2013 leveling off and Gibraltar falls into the latter category with higher expenses tapering off during the first half of probably next year.","Now all this is to say that not everything can be solved overnight, nor will the results coming from the solutions be linear. But we do have a real sense of urgency as you would expect us to have and that we spoke about on Investor Day. And what I can assure you is that we firmly believe that many of these initiatives and challenges actually provide extraordinary opportunities over time, which is why we have high conviction around the ROE and EPS targets that we stated on Investor Day.","Now on a personal note and speaking for the entire management team, we don\u2019t like disappointing our investors or other constituencies. On the contrary, we\u2019d like to excel. And while I can\u2019t make any statements as to what the next quarter or quarters will provide, what I can absolutely assure you of is that we\u2019re working on executing our plan, with the intended results of changing the trend line in the right direction.","We look forward to keeping you updated on our performance and the tangible progress that we make as we strive to develop better financial outcomes for our customers and just as importantly sustainable results for our shareholders.","Thank you all for taking the time to join us today.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive TeleConference service. You may now disconnect."],"17441":["Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  8, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Eric Durant","John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Member of Executive Committee","Mark B.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call to review second quarter results. We realize we were relatively late to report this quarter. We hope the wait was worthwhile.","In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the second quarter of 2013, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, this presentation may include references to adjusted operating income, which are earnings per share, or EPS, or return on equity, or ROE, which are determined based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services businesses that excludes certain items. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, and the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operation.","For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income and the comparable GAAP measure, please see our earnings press release on our website. Additional information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website. Who writes this stuff anyway.","Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld; CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of Domestic Businesses; Ed Baird, Head of International Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Peter Sayre, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We'll begin with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob. We'll be referring to slides that you can get on our website, again, at www.investor.prudential.com. After the presentations, we'll have -- answer your questions.","John?","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The central message today is that we had another strong quarter, and we're tracking well to achieve our goals for 2013. While we clearly benefited from some tailwinds, including strong investment results, the main driver of our improving results is business fundamentals, and each of our divisions is contributing. Mark and Rob will review the quarter in greater detail in a few minutes, but here are a few highlights.","Our Retirement business had record earnings, largely on the strength of the 2 large pension risk transfer deals we completed late last year. We invested for many years to develop our capabilities in pension risk transfer, and it's pleasing to see initial tangible benefit from the commitment we made.","Individual Life Insurance also had a strong quarter, reflecting a solid contribution from The Hartford Life block we acquired early this year. Integration is on plan, and both integration and expenses and cost savings are tracking with our expectations. The expanded distribution in the wirehouse and bank channels and the high-quality staff that this deal bring us are exceeding our expectations.","Results in International Insurance continue to reflect solid organic growth, as well as increasing expense synergies from our acquisition of Star and Edison. To be sure, challenges remain. It's clear to us that we will continue to focus on building a company that achieves and sustains superior financial performance, especially as measured by return on equity, over time and through challenging environments.","We believe our goal of superior performance is supported by a strong foundation that we can build upon. First, our portfolio of businesses is balanced and diverse. We believe our set of businesses should produce superior returns over time because of the markets they serve, along with the high value-added products at the core of our value proposition.","Second, our businesses are well led and are leaders in their markets as competitive measures, such as sales, flows and persistency, as well as overall performance, will attest.","Third, capital management is a part of our value proposition. We strive for a disciplined balance of capital deployment between a normal course organic growth, growth through innovative new products or applications, such as pension risk transfer, M&A and return to our shareholders.","And finally, while it's hard to demonstrate except through results, we strongly believe that superior talent and the culture in which they work is and will continue to be the biggest driver of our long-term performance.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier","Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, depending on where you are. Thanks for joining us today. I'll take you through our results for the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon.","I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter using Slide 2. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.30 for the second quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $1.38 a year ago. After adjusting for market driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 31%, amounting to $2.24 compared to $1.71.","This increase is largely the result of underlying organic growth in our U.S. businesses, reflecting positive net flows and market appreciation over the past year; the contribution from the pension risk transfer business we put on the books late last year; the performance in the second quarter bolstered by strong investment results and case experience; and more favorable claims experience in Individual Life, together with the contribution of the business we acquired from The Hartford in January; and continued growth of our International Insurance business, which also benefited from strong investment results in the current quarter.","On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $524 million for the current quarter. This reflects the accounting impact of foreign currency remeasurement of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese insurance companies, as well as negative mark-to-market on derivatives we used in duration management, driven by rising interest rates.","Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, amounted to $54.18 at the end of the second quarter, down $3.68 from year end on a reported basis. This compares and is affected significantly by the geography mismatch from asset and liability changes, driven by foreign currency fluctuations where the impact on non-yen liabilities runs through the income statement, while the offsetting gains on the assets are included in AOCI rather than net income. If you adjust the numbers to remove the impact of this mismatch, book value would be $60.14, up $1.90 per share since year end after the payment of 2 quarterly dividends totaling $0.80 per share.","As we've told you, we won't consider ourselves to have achieved our ROE goal based on printing a result that is influenced by reducing the denominator due to foreign currency remeasurement. On this appropriately adjusted basis, our reported annualized ROE for the second quarter would be 15.5%.","Slide 3 presents a short list of market driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter. In the Annuities business, rising interest rates, which enhance expected returns on the fixed income portion of account values and reduced the cost of our guaranteed benefits, were the main driver for the release of a portion of our reserve for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and a favorable DAC unlocking.","These updates produced a benefit totaling $0.10 per share. Charges for integration costs in the quarter totaled $0.02 per share. And within corporate and other results, we recorded a charge of $0.02 per share to write off bond issuance costs on high coupon debt that we redeemed prior to maturity. In total, the items I mentioned had a net favorable impact of $0.06 per share on current quarter results.","Slide 4 shows 2 views of our ROE trend. Blue bars are as reported based on adjusted operating income and equity, excluding AOCI. This view reflects the variability in results from market driven and discrete items, as well as the impact on ROE in the first 2 quarters of this year from reduction of the denominator by foreign currency remeasurement.","In the green bars, we've removed the impact of market driven and discrete items and removed the impact of foreign currency remeasurement that affects our book value through net income to provide a trend that more faithfully reflects our business results. On this basis, annualized ROE was just under 15% for the first half of this year compared to about 11% a year ago.","While there is some tailwind in our ROE from strong current quarter investment results in our Retirement and International Insurance businesses, as I mentioned, to some seasonality that favors the first half in International Insurance, we believe that we are well on track to achieve our goals for the year.","Moving to Slide 5. On a GAAP basis, the net loss of $524 million for the Financial Services businesses in the second quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $2.2 billion pretax, comprised of the items you see here: foreign currency remeasurement losses primarily represents changes in the value of non-yen liabilities relating to products denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies on the books of our Japanese company, whose functional currency is the yen.","The weakening of the yen that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter, causing us to record a loss in the income statement because it would take more yen to pay off these liabilities. We consider this noneconomic because the liabilities are matched with assets in the currencies in which they will be settled. This income statement loss results from the accounting geography mismatch that I have mentioned.","The current quarter pretax loss also includes $953 million from net negative mark-to-market on derivatives, mainly related to our investment duration management programs, largely driven by rising interest rates.","Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activities had a net negative impact of $124 million in the quarter. Impairments and credit losses on investments were benign in this quarter. The positive contribution you see for other items of $441 million essentially represents net gains from general portfolio activities, driven largely by currency-related gains on sales of non-yen denominated bonds in our Japanese insurance operations.","Moving to our business results and Slide 6. I'll start with our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses. Reported results are shown on Slide 6, along with the adjustments I would make for market driven and discrete items to get a view of underlying performance relative to a year ago.","Slide 7 highlights the Annuity business. After adjusting for reserve true-ups and unlockings, which were mainly driven by rising interest rates in the current quarter and decline in the equity markets a year ago, annuity results were $325 million for the quarter, an increase of $94 million from a year ago.","Slide 8 relates baseline earnings to account values. Stripping out the impact of unlockings and other one-off items we've disclosed, as we've done here in the green bars, the trend of earnings for the Annuities business reflects our account value growth. Account values amounted to $141 billion at the end of the quarter, up 14% from a year ago.","The increase was driven by market appreciation, together with $8 million of net flows over the past year, and produced a 19% increase in policy charges and fees. Results in the Annuity business also benefited from a reduced drag from distribution and other costs, which rose less rapidly than revenues.","As Slide 9 shows, our gross Annuity sales for the quarter were $2.5 billion, down from $5.4 billion a year ago. The lower level of current quarter sales reflects actions we've taken to adapt our products to the current environment. As we discussed in our Investor Day in June, we've responded to market changes by pulling a number of levers to maintain appropriate return prospects and improve our risk profile.","In February of this year, we introduced our current living benefit feature called HDI 2.1. The biggest changes in HDI 2.1 brought down some of the value of the guarantee by adjusting payout rates at various age bands. For example, to get a 5% annual income payout, the client must be aged 70 when payouts commence as compared to age 65 in the previous version of the product.","We also eliminated the guaranteed doubling of the protected withdrawal value after 12 years. While leaving the rider fees unchanged at 100 basis points for individual contracts and 110 basis points for spousal contracts, we also reduced the commission rates that we pay in February to maintain an appropriate balance between the value proposition to customers and compensation to our distribution partners.","We implemented the commission change in a transparent manner, working with our broker-dealer partners, and we've maintained strong distribution relationships. Over the past year, we've also withdrawn our X shares, or bonus product, and suspended acceptance of subsequent premiums on generations of products offered before 2011.","Additionally, in late July, we implemented a cap on subsequent purchase payments on the HDI products we offered prior to last August. We believe that our product continues to offer a solid value proposition in an attractive market, and we regard our sales level as an outcome rather than a target.","Slide 10 highlights the Retirement business. Retirement business reported record-high adjusted operating income of $279 million for the current quarter. This compares to $147 million a year ago, or $156 million if I add back $9 million of costs we incurred then to convert our bank to a trust-only status. Headlines of the improvement in earnings are greater contributions from net investment results and case experience by group annuity and similar contracts. Each case driven largely by the 2 major pension risk transfer transactions we closed late last year.","Current quarter results benefited by $95 million from a greater contribution from net investment results. This includes about $35 million of returns that we would consider above our average expectations on non-coupon asset classes. In addition, case experience was $28 million more favorable than the current quarter. About half of this increase came from a true-up of reserves, resulting in reserve releases as we moved the administration of a block -- of the pension risk transfer business to our own platform. Benefit from higher fees, driven by account value growth, was essentially offset by higher expenses as we continue to invest in this business.","Slide 11 shows Retirement sales and account values. The top graph on Slide 11 shows the total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.1 billion for the quarter compared to $12.8 billion a year ago. Stand-alone institutional gross sales amounted to $4.4 billion in the current quarter compared to $8.5 billion a year ago.","Current quarter sales included $3.5 billion of stable value wrap products sold to plan sponsors, while the year-ago quarter included $8 billion of those sales, reflecting the exit of a major provider of these products from the market and reflecting several large case wins.","Full service gross deposits and sales were $3.7 billion for the quarter, down from $4.4 billion a year ago, which included a major case win of about $850 million. Net flows remained in the positive column with strong retention of existing cases. We believe that our ongoing investment in client service capabilities is contributing to our persistency and will enhance our field of plan sponsors as we maintain pricing discipline in the highly competitive mid to large case market, which is our major focus.","Referring now to the account values graph on Slide 11. Total retirement net flows for the current quarter amounted to $2 billion, and account values surpassed the $300 billion milestone, amounting to $301.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $57 billion from a year ago and including about $33 billion from the pension risk transfer transactions late last year.","Next, Slide 12 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $168 million for the current quarter. This compares to $127 million a year ago after adjusting for an impairment charge for an increase of $41 million. The increase came essentially from higher asset management fees, driven by growth in assets under management, net of expenses. The segment's assets under management amounted to $826 billion at the end of the quarter, up by 10% from a year ago.","On Slide 13, you see the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses, showing the adjustment for The Hartford integration costs.","Slide 14 highlights the Individual Life business. After adjusting for integration costs, Individual Life reported earnings of $152 million for the current quarter, up $91 million from a year ago. The in-force block of business we acquired from The Hartford contributed about $42 million this quarter. The business integration is well on track, and our results reflect initial realization of cost synergies in line with our expectations.","The remainder of the increase in the Individual Life earnings reflect the improved mortality experience in our Prudential business, which was about $20 million more favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter. This contrasts a mortality experience about $50 million less favorable than average expectations a year ago. The year-ago quarter was our most adverse variance from expected levels since late 2003.","The benefit from improved mortality on the Prudential business was partly offset by higher distribution costs in the current quarter, reflecting the expansion of our third-party distribution system with The Hartford acquisition, as well as higher sales in the current quarter.","Shown on Slide 15, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums amounted to $184 million for the current quarter, including $58 million from the third-party distribution partners that came to us with The Hartford acquisition. This compares to total sales of $91 million a year ago. The current quarter sales increase was mainly driven by our universal life products and reflects our strong competitive position as some key competitors have recently raised rates or withdrawn products.","In addition, The Hartford strength in banks and wirehouses has significantly enhanced our distribution through financial institutions, which amounted to $60 million in the current quarter, up by about $40 million from a year ago. Guaranteed universal life products accounted for just over half of our current quarter sales. We've taken actions to limit concentration in these products and to maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases, most recently in May and July of this year.","In addition, in May, we implemented a cap on the amount of premium that a client can invest when purchasing a contract. Because of the time span of the application and underwriting process, typically 60 to 90 days, we would expect these actions to have an increasing impact on our reported sales going forward.","Turning to the next slide, highlighting Group Insurance. Group Insurance business reported adjusted operating income of $22 million in the current quarter compared to $33 million a year ago. The decrease reflected less favorable group underwriting results, which more than offset improved claims experience in Group Disability.","Slide 17 presents earnings and benefit ratio trends in our group business. Fluctuations in claims experience and expenses, as well as seasonality, have affected the pattern of Group Insurance results. Group Life accounts for more than 80% of our Group Insurance premiums. And its results tend to be seasonally weakest in the first quarter due to a higher concentration of claims. While the second quarter claims ratio was within an expected band, results were off from a relatively strong year-ago quarter.","In Group Disability, we are more than 1 year into what we expect to be a 3-year process of bringing down the benefits -- of bringing the benefits ratio down to an acceptable range. We've repriced or allowed to lapse about 1\/3 of the book. In addition, we've enhanced our claims management capabilities. We are beginning to see some progress with increased claims terminations in the current quarter, contributing to the improvement of more than 4 percentage points in the benefits ratio from a year ago.","I will move now to the International Insurance division, starting with Slide 18. Slide 18 shows the results of our International Insurance business adjusting for integration costs.","Slide 19 highlights the Life Planner business. The Life Planner business reported adjusted operating income of $368 million for the quarter. This compares to $374 million a year ago. Higher expenses and less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter more than offset the contributions of continued business growth and more favorable foreign currency translation. Higher expense level reflected factors, including current quarter technology costs in Japan, which are largely related to product development, guaranteed fund recovery in the year-ago quarter and higher employee benefit costs in our Korean operation.","Current quarter mortality experience was about $10 million less favorable than average expectations compared to experience essentially in line with expectations a year ago. The contribution of business growth in comparing the year-ago quarter was dampened somewhat by the benefit last year from accelerated purchases of our cancer whole life product in anticipation of a tax law change in Japan and strong sales of our U.S. dollar retirement income and whole life products in advance of price increases.","Foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 80 this year versus JPY 85 last year, contributed a benefit of $13 million to earnings in comparison to a year ago.","Turning to Slide 20, highlighting Gibraltar Life. After adjusting for integration costs, Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $488 million for the current quarter, up $146 million from a year ago. The current quarter benefited from a contribution from investment results about $80 million greater than a year ago. About half of this increase came from non-coupon investments reflecting strong performance in Japanese real estate and equities. About $25 million of the increase in Gibraltar's earnings come from gains on an elevated level of surrenders of non-yen products, driven by currency exchange rates, partly offset by a less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter.","Current quarter results also reflected about $55 million of cost savings achieved thus far from the Star\/Edison business integration compared to about $40 million in the year-ago quarter. The remainder of the increase came from continued business growth and an $11 million benefit in the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates.","Slide 21 shows total International Insurance sales. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $850 million for the current quarter, compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. Market developments, along with re-pricings and other actions we've taken, have produced some volatility in the quarterly pattern of sales results.","Seasonality has an impact on our sales trend as well, with a benefit in the first half of the year from accelerated sales efforts toward the end of the fiscal year in Japan on March 31, which benefits first quarter results for our Life Planner business and benefits second quarter results for Gibraltar. As most of our business in Japan is traditional insurance products, where the pattern of profits is tied to premiums, this also tends to make first half earnings seasonally stronger than the second half in both Prudential of Japan and in Gibraltar.","In the first and second quarters of last year, we experienced sales surges in Japan from our cancer whole life product in anticipation of a tax law change, and we experienced accelerated purchases of our U.S. dollar retirement income and whole life products in advance of price increases we implemented, as I mentioned.","Gibraltar sales of yen-based single premium whole life products in the bank channel also began to accelerate in the second quarter of last year as competitors limited sales of products that were popular in that market, with the greatest volume of sales taking place in the third and fourth quarters of 2012.","In order to limit our concentration in this product and maintain appropriate returns, we implemented crediting rate reductions and reduced commissions effective January 1 of this year, and we will be discontinuing sales in September.","Excluding the products I just mentioned, you can see a sales increase in the red portion of the bars of $132 million for the current quarter compared to a year ago. Looking back over 2 years to the second quarter of 2011, the comparison of the same baseline of products shows an average annual increase of 8%.","Slides 22 and 23 break down sales by business and product.","Slide 22 presents Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $285 million in the current quarter compared to $402 million a year ago. Sales of cancer whole life and the U.S. dollar products I just mentioned were $47 million in the current quarter, or $130 million below the year-ago level. The decline in sales of these products more than offset a $24 million increase in sales of other products by our Life Planners in Japan. Sales outside of Japan were down $11 million from a year ago, mainly reflecting lower sales in Korea.","Taking a look at the red portions of the bars for the first and second quarters of each year, which exclude the sales volatility from cancer whole life and the repriced U.S. dollar products, you can see the seasonality-driven decline from the first quarter to the second quarter in each of the last 3 years, as we would expect.","Slide 23 presents Gibraltar Life sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $565 million in the current quarter compared to $769 million a year ago. Sales of cancer whole life and U.S. dollar whole life and retirement income products were down by $275 million from a year ago, reflecting the tax law and pricing changes that I have discussed.","Current quarter sales include $64 million from the yen-based single premium product in the bank channel, down $48 million from a year ago. Sales of other products in Gibraltar's portfolio totaled $389 million, up $119 million from a year ago, with the increase driven largely by life insurance protection products, including yen-based recurring premium, whole life and term insurance.","Slide 24 shows the results for corporate and other. After adjusting for the write-off of bond issue costs in the current quarter, corporate and other loss was $331 million, in line with the average of the past 4 quarters but up $106 million from a year ago. The increased loss came from higher expenses and greater net interest costs, which reflect our pre-funding of several refinancings.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon","Thanks, Mark. I'd like to give you an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility and they're summarized beginning on page -- on Slide 25.","First, focusing on our insurance companies. We continue to manage these companies to levels consistent with what we believe are AA standards. Prudential Insurance, we managed to a 400% RBC ratio, which we believe gives us some cushion against our AA objective. We began the year with a 456% RBC ratio. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio remains above our 400% target at Prudential Insurance after giving effects to The Hartford transactions and other activities in the first half of the year.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported solid solvency margin ratios of 749% and 896%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year end. These reported solid key margins are strong in relation to our targets.","Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses, as summarized on Slide 25. We calculate our on balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries. As of year end, we estimated that our on balance sheet capital capacity was roughly $3 billion before the funding of Hartford Life acquisition, which closed in early January. We also estimated that about $1.5 billion to $2 billion of this amount was readily deployable.","During the first half of this year, we funded The Hartford acquisition, paid 2 quarterly common stock dividends of $0.40 each for a total of about $400 million and repurchased $250 million of our common stock, totaling roughly $1.3 billion of capital redeployment and returns of capital. The net of these uses of capital and the capital generated by our businesses in excess of their organic growth needs left us with available on balance sheet capital capacity of about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at June 30, including about $1 billion that we would consider readily deployable.","Our $250 million of share repurchases, which we executed during the second quarter, brought our total repurchases under the authorization that ended on June 30 of this year to $400 million, as we had projected. As you know, we announced a new $1 billion repurchase authorization in June, which extends through June 30 of next year.","Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $4 billion as of the end of the second quarter. This reflects our [indiscernible] during the quarter of approximately $450 million of senior debt with an average coupon of about 6% and $920 million of 9% junior subordinated notes. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing debt, fund operating needs or redeploy over time.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Okay. Thank you, Mark and Rob. And that concludes our prepared comments, and we'd like to open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","First question on Gibraltar. You mentioned a few factors that benefit earnings this quarter. But even if I normalize for the good alternative performance, the surrender fees, as well as seasonality, the results still seem quite strong. Are there any other factors we should think about going forward, maybe expense timing or anything like that, that could affect Gibraltar going forward? Or if I adjust for those things, is that a good run rate to think about?","John Robert Strangfeld","I thank you fairly point out that a lot of things went in the right direction for Gibraltar this quarter. You're right. On the investment side, it was higher than we would normally expect, certainly not all of it, but a portion of it was higher than I think you would want to assume is going to continue going forward. There is a certain seasonality factor as a result of the annual premium mode. Let me explain that. On annual premiums, we book the earnings consistent with the time in which we booked the premium. On POJ, that's in the first quarter. But in Gibraltar, because they lag by a quarter, that shows up primarily in the second quarter. And then in the third side, there -- actually, on the benefit side was a little better than normal not so much because of mortality, but because there were surrenders that took place primarily around the Aussie dollar, which netted against the mortality produced a little better benefit ratio than would be normally assumed. So if you put the 3 together, you're right, you need to discount to some degree. But even after you've done that, there is a very strong performance result there, one being the factor that Mark highlighted, which is that consistent with the original plan. The costs have come down steadily. We've now expensed about 80% of the $400 million ballpark that we had originally estimated for the expenses, and that's come down nicely. And similarly, we're getting increased gains on the expense savings. So the combination of those 2 produced about a $50 million swing over the quarter. And as Mark pointed out, those are stable in contrast to the one-timers that you just covered. So net-net, very strong but I wouldn't book the whole thing on a going-forward basis.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","If I take into consideration all the factors that you mentioned, it still seems like the earnings were running above $400 million. Is that a fair assessment?","John Robert Strangfeld","I'm not sure I'd want to stick a number on it. I would more or less stick with what I just said in terms of how you might want to adjust it.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","And then I have one on non-bank SIFI. It seems like there's been some increased discussion lately, including some comments from Ben Bernanke, that language in the Collins Amendment may limit the Feds ability to tailor capital rules to insurance companies and away from a bank methodology. So I'd just appreciate any thoughts or perspective you might have on that issue.","Mark B. Grier","This is Mark. I guess the main thought is that, that's an issue that's out there. It's something that does come up when we talk about the consideration of what we consider to be appropriate capital and solvency regimes for an insurance company. And at this point, I would say it's just something that we have to work through.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I know there's a proposed bill out there to modify that. Do you see that gaining -- have you seen that gaining any traction?","Mark B. Grier","Well, there are -- yes, there is legislation out there, and there also are different opinions about the specific legal interpretation. The more general issue is a reluctance to reopen Dodd-Frank at all, and that's kind of the hurdle that we'd have to get over to start looking at changes. And I would have to say the outlook for that is highly uncertain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to follow-up on Ryan's question question on non-bank SIFI. So I guess since the last time we spoke, you were designated, you have decided to contest. So I was just wondering if you can kind of take us through the process of what actually happens as you contest the designation. You had given us in the past, I think, some color around stage 1, stage 2, stage 3. So what actually happens in this contestation process?","Mark B. Grier","Well, I guess, the short answer is that I can't give you a lot more color around the process. We are in the works. Timing-wise, probably somewhere around 2 months from late July, we will have a final determination. As you mentioned, we have been working on our concerns about the preliminary designation, but I can't add a lot more than that in terms of discussion of the process. I would reiterate that we don't believe that we satisfy the quantitative criteria to be a SIFI, as is contemplated in Dodd-Frank, and we continue to make that case.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. I get that. I mean, I guess I'm trying to figure out if there's a difference between this process and the whole process going through Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3. Clearly, in those stages, you presented your arguments and the FSOC decided to make its own decision. So I'm trying to figure out what's different about this next process that we go through?","Mark B. Grier","Well, again, without getting into a lot of detail, we did have a specific preliminary designation to discuss in the context of the last stage of the process, so that would have been different. But otherwise, I would add again, we've had high-quality discussions around the nature of our business models and the issues that both we and the council think are important.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just moving to the capital position. If I go back to -- not the beginning of the year but maybe the first quarter call, I think you talked about $1.5 billion of sort of redeployable capital. I think in the quarter, you did the $250 million of buyback, the roughly $200 million of dividend, some capital debt reduction. So that probably adds up to something like $575 million. And then you said that the redeployable right now is $1 billion. So I'm just trying to figure out, what was the actual capital generation in the quarter? Because if I just kind of run the math, it doesn't seem like it was a very sizable number.","Robert Michael Falzon","Suneet, it's Rob. First, the math that you did, I think, all adds up. As we looked at the overall capital capacity on balance sheet, I would characterize it as not having changed materially. What change there was, was more of a timing issue than an absolute issue. What did change is the composition of that capital and the way that you articulated it. We used our redeployable capital to pay dividends, buyback stock and delever, and that brought the redeployable component down. With regard to the overall pie, the total capacity remain relatively unchanged as a result of earnings coming in, funding our business growth and then the items that you just mentioned.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So the strain, I guess, is what -- is the piece that I'm missing in here, the strain from business growth?","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes. If you look at our-- start with our earnings adjusted for things like NPR and FX remeasurement, which are noneconomic, you took out those items and you took out financing, the growth of our business, you would find that, that leaves us with a total capacity that's relatively unchanged.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last one on this topic. If I think about the total capital capacity, I guess, the $2.5 billion to $3 billion and I back out the redeployable, I'd get $1.5 billion to $2 billion of excess capital capacity that's not redeployable. And I just like to get a sense of what that is because I thought some of that stuff was going to get chewed up by the PRT deals, as well as The Hartford Life deal. But it seems like that number is still pretty sizable in terms of excess capital capacity that cannot be redeployed. So any detail on that would be helpful.","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes, so couple of thoughts on that. First, recognize that, that's a number that cycles through during the course of the year. So we do, as you noted, and have used the non-monetizable capital and can absorb risk for writing new business. So we can also absorb risk if things go bump in the night. So while it's non-monetizable, it doesn't mean it's not usable. It means that there are different ways in which it can get applied. And what happens in any given year is that things like DTAs burn off and then get added as a result of activities during the course of the year. So when we define non-monetizable, what we mean by that is that in the course of the next 12 months, that's the portion of our capital capacity that exists down in operating subsidiaries that we don't see coming up to the holding company in a way that it would allow us to immediately redeploy it. And so that's an ongoing process during the course of any given year. We'll be taking capital out of the subsidiaries, but they'll be building capital back up again. And as a result of that, the non-monetizable piece, there'll be a component of it. I don't think you'll ever see it go away, although it's reduced over time as a result of writing new business and doing things like pension risk transfer.","Mark B. Grier","Suneet, it's Mark. Maybe just to emphasize one point that Rob made. The amount of DTA that is eligible, that counts as an asset for statutory purposes, will roll over. So as some of that is monetized more, we'll meet the test and be accepted as an admitted asset. So there's a little dynamic there that the first part of what you said is right, it does get chewed up. But the second part is, it gets replaced.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So there's a lot going on in the world today. But a couple of the factors seem to be pretty favorable for potentially driving further activity in the pension markets. Higher rates should all by itself be helping to reduce pension funding gaps and obviously strong markets should be helping on the asset side. I just wonder if you can help us understand, based on your dialogue with potential customers, how much has the macro environment's improving changed the potential outlook, I'm assuming for the better, for that activity?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","John, it's Charlie. I think it's fair to say we are continuing to have very robust conversations with many different companies. And your observation is, in fact, correct, that as interest rates go up, that obviously helps with the valuation of their liabilities. It can help with closing the funding gap, which is a good thing. Another dynamic that's occurring as well, which is that as interest rates go up, they will hit certain tripwires in that they will invest more in bonds, which then creates a portfolio which is better for pension risk transfer. So I think the environment looks promising. And as we've said, it's a very lumpy business. These transactions will occur when they occur, and that's dependent upon a whole a variety of things, including board approvals and funding rates and all sorts of things. We're having a great many conversations right now with different companies, and we'll see what happens.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Would you -- Charlie, not to put you on the spot, but I'll try. Whether it's true or just an industry comment, I'm just wondering if you'd put odds on a relatively large transaction getting done before the end of this year? I'm not asking you to comment on whether PRU would be a winner or not, but odds better than 50-50 that a large deal would get done or something different.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Well, I'll talk for a moment without answering the question, how's that? And that is that I think these deals have long lead times, and we are in a variety of conversations. But there are long lead times, and I can't comment about the rest of the industry. But they're lumpy, and they'll occur when they occur.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. I thought I'd try. Then a quick one for either Mark or Rob. You guys have been doing a lot on the balance sheet related to your debt and preferreds and hybrids and junior subordinated, a lot of activity there. I know some of the rating agencies view some of these forms of financing slightly differently from debt to capital, how much equity credit they get, et cetera. If you look at the more onerous of those agencies, where do you stand currently from a debt-to-capital perspective and does it imply any capacity?","Robert Michael Falzon","It's Rob. So the way we look at it internally is consistent with what we think of the lower -- the major rate rating agencies. Moody's gives us only a 25% equity credit from the hybrids. We get full equity credit for the hybrids from Standard & Poor's by way of contrast on the other extreme. So when we report our financial ratio to you, it is only giving ourselves the benefit of that 25% allocation to equity, and that's the 24.7% financial ratio that we published for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, I had a question on Slide 21. I just want to better understand what the message and the takeaway is from this, which shows the international sales trend. So the red bar on the bottom shows that clearly, there's a nice upward trajectory of sales of other products, which I guess would be your traditional products that you sold historically. Should I be thinking about the other bars, the U.S. dollar whole life, the cancer whole life and the yen-based bank being the more asset-intensive products that are now going to continue to diminish? Is that a fair characterization or a way to think about those?","John Robert Strangfeld","Yes. Let me answer your question a little bit differently than the way you posed it, if you don't mind, Tom. What we're trying to communicate here are a couple of things. First, before you even get into the colors of the bar, if you just look at the size of the bar, the first point we're trying to make is that what happened in the second quarter of '12 was unprecedented. And so the drop that we're looking at here is driven by 2 things that happened during that quarter, which will not likely recur. So it had to do with specifically the Japan businesses. So during that quarter, we saw a 40% increase in Gibraltar sales and an 80% increase in POJ sales. So we knew that, that was not a new stable platform of plateau from which we could further build, particularly because we understood why it happened. It was driven, as Mark pointed out in his opening comments, by the tax law changes on the cancer whole life product and on the interest rate changes on the dollar-denominated retirement and other dollar products. And you're right, those products are related more to capital market activity and tax treatment than to the more traditional Death Protection. So when those changes took place, it was a spike which will not reoccur. But the other reason for showing as many quarters is to give you the opportunity to observe, that if you completely ignore that quarter and you look at this quarter compared to the quarter and the prior year, i.e. 2011, you'll see double-digit growth. And the reason for that is because there continues to be, underneath these 2 specific changes, very steady organic growth. And that's a continuation of what has been going on for a long time. In fact, coming into this quarter, we had 15 quarters of consecutive year-over-year increases in sales. So it was inevitable that there would come a break, and I think it was predictable that it would come in this quarter because of that spike that occurred. So I don't think there's much more of a message that we're trying to give here than that. It really was limited to that quarter. I don't think you'll see that kind of volatility again unless there is some external or internal change comparable to what happened at that time.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. But would you say those other -- those 3 products on the top bars, would you expect those to continue to diminish or -- I just want to get a better sense for where...","John Robert Strangfeld","No, I don't think they will continue to diminish, John (sic) [Tom]. The reason I say it is it had more -- it will diminish depending on what you use as your baseline. Will it will diminish relative to what it was in the second quarter of '12? Yes, maybe. But will it diminish relative to what it was in the quarters other than that? Not necessarily.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then is it fair to say though -- because then just based on these bars, you took a bit of a step back in terms of your traditional products in 2012 probably because you were emphasizing all these other products. And now that seems to have recovered. How would you describe the competitive landscape for your traditional Death Protection products now? Is it -- based on the sales this quarter, it would appear to be a lot better. But can you shed some light on that?","John Robert Strangfeld","Sure. Yes, you make 2 key points there, John. One is you're absolutely right, the more traditional Death Protection products dropped relatively speaking during that second quarter of '12 when more of the platform was consumed by the focus on the tax driven and interest rate driven activity. But now that, that has returned more to normal, you're right, these products have now returned to their more historical organic growth rates. Your second point regarding competition, because our primary focus is through our captive agency distribution and because the product focus is primarily on Death Protection and needs-based analysis, we tend to be less sensitive to the movement of competitors. That's less true, of course, on the bank channel, which we've discussed previously. But that constitutes less, particularly in this quarter of our productivity. So in general, I would not say that there's been any major movement on the competition that's affecting us in spite of changes you have seen in prices, driven by the changes in the standard reserving rate, which has brought about a broader dispersion of prices. But that's not materially affecting our performance because of our focus on Death Protection and our distribution focus, primarily in proprietary distribution.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Just as we look at Slide 25 at your solvency margin ratio, interest rates have risen since March 31. I was wondering if you could describe what the impact to your SMR will be and maybe some characteristics of your investment portfolio and how you characterize or classify your investments.","John Robert Strangfeld","Sure. You're exactly right. The second part of your question having to do with the composition of the portfolio is what influences the sensitivity on the SMR, so let me talk you through that. We have, as I believe most of you are aware, an extremely conservative portfolio, far more so than most of the Japan companies, either domestic or foreign-owned. As a result, we have the luxury of being able to define the vast majority, about 70% of our general account portfolio as either hold to maturity or hold for reserve. Consequently, that does not need to be mark-to-market. Only about 20% of our portfolio is assets for sale, which is a lot less than I think you'll find in most companies. Furthermore, what we have inside that category tends to be, a, currency matched; and, b, short-term duration. So those 3 facts, number one, a small part of our portfolio; number two, currency matched; and number three, short duration, means that we're relatively insensitive to movement here in terms of the SMR. And then, of course, I'd just take the opportunity to remind you that, as Mark pointed out, our SMRs are very high compared to really what's expected, I think, of a AA company or what's going on with the competition. So we're in a position that even if there is a relative diminution of it, it will still leave us in a very strong position.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on Gibraltar. How much longer do you expect the elevated level of policy surrenders to continue?","John Robert Strangfeld","That's a good question. One, we have been watching ourselves because this is relatively unprecedented. It's linked primarily to the exchange rate, and it's focused mostly on the Aussie dollar. That exchange rate peaked in April. And when we've looked at the monthly numbers, it would suggested that as the yen have strengthened versus of the Aussie dollar, the surrender rate has dropped accordingly. That's what we can observe that you cannot from a quarterly number when we look at the monthly numbers, which leads me to believe that if it stays at the current level on the exchange rate, that you'll see a surrender rate that's below what we witnessed in the second quarter. But again, going forward, the primary point is it will be linked to and largely driven by the exchange rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to go back to the kind of normalized earnings. If you look at maybe 209, 210 [ph] for the quarter, given all of the moving parts that we saw, what would you believe to be the sustainable factors during the quarter that increased the run rate of this kind of normalized earnings figure? Is it just the large pension risk transfer transactions, The Hartford Life acquisition and the benefits of integration at Star and Edison? Or is it more that I might be missing there?","John Robert Strangfeld","Joanne, this is John. Let me offer a couple of observations about that. What you're really seeing here is the cumulative effect of the building blocks that we've been talking about really for the last 3 years. So whether that's the strong organic performance of our existing business, which you can see manifested in the fundamentals, or whether it's the outsized organic that you mentioned, like pension risk transfers, or whether it's the M&A, in the case of Star\/Edison, which has really come to fruition, or Hartford, which is in its early but encouraging phases, and you couple that with active capital management and expense management, as well and the quality and continuity of leadership, all those things are contributing to this. So it's these same elements that gave us confidence 3 years ago to aspire to a 13% to 14% ROE, are the things that are coming to fruition today and are manifested in our results.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Okay. Then when I look at kind of the normalized ROE, John, I would say you're kind of at or above the target level for 2013. How should we think about that? I mean, you're obviously not going to give us an update on your targets. But do you think that the 14% to 14.5% or I think, x everything out, you came up with 14.9%, is that something that's sustainable? I mean, there's a lot of obviously favorable market tailwinds that are helping some of these numbers, but just kind of your view on that.","John Robert Strangfeld","Okay. A couple of observations on that as well. We believe we're on a good track towards the 2 aspects of our goal: one is achieving that range; and the second is doing it in a way that's sustainable over time. As you point out, well, firstly, 2 quarters does not a year make. And then secondly, there are certain elements in the first half, while they're very real, they tend to fluctuate. And the things that fluctuate at the moment are generally fluctuating in a positive direction, like the example of the investment income piece that you -- that was mentioned earlier. So when we're talking about achieving and sustaining a 13% to 14% ROE, we're truly talking about long term and without a reliance upon those fluctuating elements to drive us into that space. And I think that's the extent of what we'd say. We're not going to offer anymore specificity around guidance, around ROE, et cetera, et cetera, because that's not something we would normally do during the course of the year. But I think that's the way we would think about it in terms of both achieving, getting into that zip code and doing it in a way that's sustainable over time and through different phases and different markets.","Operator","And we have time for one final question, that will be from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just have a couple of big picture questions, I guess, in terms of how you're thinking about the U.S. business. And clearly, you've been raising prices in Annuities, Individual Life and group, so sales trends have been moderating. In Retirement, you've seen steady growth, but it's lumpy. So I guess, first question is, should we think of the near-term strategy as primarily being focused on maintaining and boosting margins and generating capital as opposed to growth? And then secondly, where do you see the attractive growth opportunities in the market currently?","John Robert Strangfeld","Sure. I guess, I'd answer the first part of that question by saying, I don't think that increasing margins or maintaining an appropriate level of profitability is mutually exclusive from growth. So if you look at our businesses, I think we are concentrating on making sure that we create shareholder value by selling product with an appropriate risk-adjusted return. And that hopefully will fall to the bottom line and that will create AOI growth over time. So it might not be necessarily top line growth, but it certainly can be bottom line growth. And I think you see that in a number of the businesses. And in terms of growth, as we've said, just in general, as we said in Investor Day, we think there are a whole series of macro trends in the U.S. that play right into our strengths as an insurance company, as an asset management company, as a retirement company. And you look at the -- whether it's the 10,000 baby boomers that are retiring a day or the need for lifetime income, these are all trends that we have products for or are working on that really fall into or play into our strengths over time. So we're very excited about the macro trends in the industry. But the one thing we are absolutely focused on is the profitability of the products we have, and that sales -- as Eric and Mark and others have said, sales are going to be really result of maintaining a price discipline in all our product lines going forward.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just, I guess, one follow-up. I mean, as sales levels come down, I would expect kind of the drag from new business on capital would be decreased a little bit. Does that have a material impact on the amount of capital you generate in the business?","Robert Michael Falzon","Erik, it's Rob Falzon. Yes, I would say that, obviously, we have to consume capital in order to finance business growth, as we've talked about, to the extent -- and I don't mean to imply that sales are coming down, that was your hypothesis coming into it, but to the extent that sales moderate relative to an installed book, it becomes less capital intensive for us in order to finance that growth.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Any comments on kind of order of magnitude or just do you look at that as more of a general rule?","Robert Michael Falzon","I would look at that as a general rule. I think we've provided you in the past benchmarks for the amount of capital that comes out of our operating subsidiaries on average over a very long period of time and works its up way to the holding company. I think, on average, that's probably a good rule of thumb to sustain.","John Robert Strangfeld","Just remember that it does vary a lot by product.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. today until midnight, August 15.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Finkelstein. Please go ahead.","Mark Finkelstein","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.","We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions.","In order help you understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the third quarter of 2014, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, this presentation may include references to adjusted operating or to earnings per share, or EPS; or return on equity, or ROE, which are determined based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services businesses that excludes certain items. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, and the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the comparable GAAP measure, please see our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website.","John, I'll hand it over to you.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Prudential reported another good quarter, and we are on track to meet or exceed our financial goals for the year. Mark and Rob will walk you through the specifics impacting our drivers, results and capital position. I will focus my comments on overall highlights and themes. The key message is we are pleased with where we are as a company and with our strategic initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and sustain returns above industry averages. Excluding the impact of market-driven and discrete items, our year-to-date adjusted operating income per share is 12% higher than a year ago. Results have benefited from favorable investment results and better-than-expected underwriting margins in our insurance businesses. While these are clear tailwinds, the underlying fundamentals of our businesses are performing well, and I will highlight just a few for the quarter. Our Annuities business continues to show good core margins and returns. Mark will walk through the results of our annual actuarial assumption update, but we remain confident in the products we're selling, the risk profile of the business and the returns we're achieving.","In Asset Management, our third-party assets under management have increased 11% over the prior year, with total net flows over the last 4 quarters of $12 billion. While we saw modest net outflows this quarter, this, after 22 consecutive quarters of positive net flows, importantly, our overall investment performance remained strong.","Individual Life earnings reflect strong mortality performance in the quarter. And while this will vary, we have shown variable mortality experience relative to expectations in 8 of the last 9 quarters.","Our International business reported solid results. Our Life Planner count grew sequentially about 2% and delivered solid year-over-year sales growth in each key market.","At Gibraltar, we are seeing the benefits of the actions we have taken to improve the productivity of Life Consultant. Sales through this channel were essentially unchanged from the prior year despite a 7% decline in our Life Consultant count.","Now I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the Retirement business, and specifically, pension risk transfer or, as we call, PRT. Since June 30, we have completed or announced 5 transactions that could be considered larger deals by market standards. This includes 2 funded pension buyouts, where we were taking on about $4.5 billion in pension liabilities and 3 longevity reinsurance transactions where we're assuming the longevity risk on approximately $31 billion in pension liabilities. While we have been in the pension buyout business for decades, our success in winning larger PRT deals is directly attributable to the investment we began to make in 2006 when we first identified the opportunity at the larger end of the market. At that time, we built a dedicated team and supplemented this team with resources across Prudential. As many of you know, it took 6 years until we successfully executed the 2 largest pension buyout transactions ever in 2012, the GM and Verizon contracts. Our ability to evaluate, structure and close these complex transactions in a timely way and to seamlessly onboard over 150,000 retirees has given us proven market credibility, which helps us succeed on subsequent transactions, like the 5 we announced since June. And importantly, our process of evaluating these transactions, which involves many layers of oversight, have remained consistent and disciplined.","To sum up, we're excited about the success we have had shown in this business, and we like the risk and return profiles of the transactions we've announced. And we view pension risk transfer as a source of future growth given our track record, our reputation for successfully executing large and complex deals and the long-term growth characteristics of the market.","On another matter, we're also excited with the recently announced memorandum of understanding to partner with ILC that will lead to Prudential indirectly acquiring 34% to 40% of AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement services provider. We view this as an attractive use of capital to participate in the growing Chilean pension market and build on our Latin American businesses, while doing so with an equal partner that has a strong track record and a terrific reputation in the local market.","With that, I'll hand it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier","Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I'll take you through our results for the quarter. And then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter.","[Technical Difficulty]","Mark B. Grier","Hello. I'm back. Our system somehow went on mute by itself. I'll start over. I'll take you through the results for the quarter. And then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. And I apologize for the interruption. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter shown on Slide 2. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.20 for the third quarter based on after tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $2.89 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter and the benefit of the current quarter results from a favorable catch-up in our effective tax rate, EPS was up 5%, amounting to $2.46 this quarter compared to $2.34 a year ago. Looking across our businesses, here are the main drivers of this comparison. We benefited from higher fees reflecting growth and account values in our Annuities business and the contribution of recent longevity reinsurance transactions and retirement. Our Asset Management business benefited from strong performance-based fees in the current quarter. Our Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses benefited from more favorable claims experience. And in our International Insurance business, higher expenses, including technology costs in the current quarter, coupled with less favorable foreign currency exchange rates, more than offset the benefit of continued business growth in the year-over-year comparison.","On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $465 million for the current quarter. This reflects a non-AOI charge to increase our embedded derivative liability for annuity living benefits, largely driven by our annual actuarial review and reflects the loss from foreign currency remeasurement driven by weakening of the Japanese yen. The foreign currency remeasurement that affects our net income is an accounting presentation mismatch, and it does not reflect the economics of our currency-matched assets and liabilities in Japan. We hold currency-matched assets to support the non-yen liabilities of our Japanese insurance companies, and the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the liabilities runs through the income statement, while the offsetting impact on the assets is included in accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of this FX remeasurement mismatch, amounted to $64.89 at the end of the third quarter, up $4.90 from last year end, after payment of 3 quarterly dividends totaling $1.59 per share. Growth in book value plus dividends paid exceeded 10%.","We also evaluate our ROE performance after adjusting for the FX remeasurement mismatch, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. After removing this benefit, along with the impact on results from market-driven and discrete items, our annualized ROE for the first 9 months of the year would be about 16%. This reflects solid underlying performance across our businesses with tailwinds from strong non-coupon investment results and mortality more favorable on our average expectations in Individual Life and International Insurance.","Slide 3 presents the AOI impact of our assumption updates. This years' annual review of actuarial assumptions had a net unfavorable impact of $186 million on pretax adjusted operating income or $0.26 per share. The most significant items are $107 million charge in Group Insurance to strengthen long-term disability reserves, including an update of our estimate for the benefit of Social Security claims offsets, and a $63 million charge in Individual Life to adjust the amortization and reserves giving effect to refinements in our approach to estimating gross profits and guaranteed benefit costs.","Turning to Slide 4. The remainder of this quarter's list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results is short. In the Annuities business, performance of our separate account funds in the current quarter was less favorable than our expectations, and we strengthened our reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and adjusted DAC, resulting in a net charge of $0.07 per share. And in Individual Life, we absorbed integration cost of about $0.01 per share related to the Hartford Life acquisition. In total, the items I just mentioned, including the impact of the annual actuarial reserve, had a net unfavorable impact of $0.34 per share on third quarter results.","In addition, a favorable catch-up in our effective tax rate contributed $0.08 per share to our results for the current quarter, mitigating a portion of the impact of the market-driven and discrete items. This catch-up reflects a downward change in our estimate of the full year effective rate applicable to our pretax adjusted operating income.","During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net benefit of $0.55 per share, mainly driven by favorable DAC and reserve updates in the annuity business, reflecting the annual review of actuarial assumptions and strong performance of our separate account funds in the quarter.","Moving to Slide 5. On a GAAP basis, our net income of $465 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $1.1 billion, comprised of the items you see here. The $970 million loss from product-related embedded derivatives and hedging included a $631 million charge from the annual actuarial review for variable annuities, largely driven by updated lapse assumptions. While our experience on living benefit guarantees is still limited, enhanced analytics, combined with industry data, has enabled us to refine our approach in predicting customer behavior. The key refinements include making expected lapses on products with living benefit guarantees sensitive to the level of interest rates. These changes caused us to lower our expected level of lapses for most of our contracts in-force. The charge reflects GAAP guidelines for valuing embedded derivatives, including a risk-neutral framework for estimating growth and account values over decades. We believe that this accounting paradigm overstates the true liability, and the result would be different under conventional insurance accounting.","The remainder of the $970 million loss from product-embedded derivatives and hedging reflected mark-to-market on our GAAP liability for variable annuity living benefits, including the impact of changes in interest rates during the quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement, driven by a weakening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which we issue products in Japan, resulted in a pretax loss of $576 million for the current quarter. Impairments and credit losses on investments were $37 million for the quarter.","Going the other way, mark-to-market on derivatives, mainly related to management of currency exposures and asset liability durations, resulted in a $328 million pretax gain, and general portfolio activities, mainly in our International Insurance operations, resulted in net pretax gains of $123 million.","Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. This slide shows our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses. This is a view of the results of these businesses showing the adjustments we made for actuarial reviews, market unlockings and experienced true-ups to get a view of underlying performance relative to a year ago.","Slide 7 highlights Individual Annuities. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, annuities results were $403 million for the quarter, an increase of $33 million from a year ago.","Turning to Slide 8. Most of our operating earnings in the annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. Measured point to point, account values at the end of the third quarter increased by 6% from a year ago, driven by market appreciation over the past year. However, the increase in average daily account values for the quarter outstripped the point-to-point increase, producing a 10% increase in policy charges and fees. The benefit of higher fees, net of associated expenses, was partly offset by a lower contribution from investment results, resulting in a 9% increase in earnings from the year-ago quarter.","Slide 9 shows the trend in annuity sales. Our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.6 billion, up by roughly $200 million from a year ago. Net sales were $392 million. We've adapted our variable annuity product line to diversify the risk exposures associated with our product guarantees and to enhance our ability to maintain appropriate pricing and return expectations under changing market conditions. As you see on this slide, our Prudential-defined income, or PDI product, has become a significant contributor to our sales mix. Sales of PDI, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $459 million or about 20% of overall sales for the current quarter, roughly consistent with the contribution over the past few quarters and about double the relative contribution of a year ago. PDI directs a client's entire investment to a separate account, fixed-income portfolio that we manage. And PDI provides a guaranteed lifetime income amount, which is determined by applying an income payout percentage, which is based on the client's age at time of purchase to the premium paid. The payout percentage grows at a contractual roll-up rate until lifetime withdrawals begin. The design of PDI allows us to change both the income payout rate and the roll-up rate for new business, enabling us to keep pricing in sync with changes in market conditions, including interest rates. Since PDI allows us to reprice more rapidly than other lifetime income guarantee products in the marketplace, its competitive position changes as we maintain appropriate target in returns, and our sales are an outcome of that process.","Sales of our highest daily suite, or HDI products, shown in the dark blue bars, accounted for $1.8 billion of our current quarter sales, down slightly from the year-ago quarter. Similar to PDI, our current generation product, HDI 3.0, also allows us to change key pricing elements, including the roll-up rate for protected withdrawal value that determines the base for lifetime income and the withdrawal percentages for various age band as often as monthly for new business.","The remainder of our current quarter sales, about $300 million, represents annuities without living benefit guarantees. This includes early sales of our recently introduced Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuity product, which does not offer these guarantees and unbundles guaranteed minimum death benefits as an optional add-on. We see a market opportunity in serving clients who are focused on tax-deferred asset growth potential and are in the initial stages of introducing this product to our distribution partners.","Slide 10 highlights the Retirement business. After stripping out the impact of refinements reflecting our annual actuarial reviews, earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $269 million for the current quarter, an increase of $28 million from a year ago. The increase was largely driven by a $21 million greater contribution from net investment results. Investment income for the current quarter includes about $35 million of returns that we would consider to be above-average expectation on non-coupon asset classes. The remainder of the increase in earnings came mainly from higher fees, including the contribution from the longevity reinsurance transactions that closed in July, partly offset by higher expenses.","Turning to Slide 11. Total retirement gross deposits and sales for the current quarter were $36.2 billion, including $29 billion for the 2 significant longevity reinsurance transactions that we closed in July, covering about 212,000 retirees in total. Unlike funded pension risk transfer transactions like GM and Verizon, where we took on both asset risk and longevity risk, in these transactions we assumed only the risk of participant longevity and the cash flows take the form of monthly fees and net settlements, rather than a significant transfer of assets to us on day 1. Since we haven't taken on significant asset risk, the capital charges per dollar of notional amount are substantially lower than they would be in a funded transaction. We are now separately reporting the balances for longevity reinsurance, investment-only stable value wraps and group annuities, including funded pension risk transfer cases in our financial supplement. This provides additional transparency given their different economics in relation to notional amount. Excluding the longevity reinsurance transaction, stand-alone institutional gross sales were roughly $2 billion in the current quarter compared to $5 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales include $660 million from stable value wrap products, while the year-ago quarter included $4.1 billion of those sales. With about $70 billion of this fee-based business on the books, as of September 30, we face concentration limits with a number of counter-parties, and competition has increased in the market for these products with a greater number of wrap providers. Full Service gross deposits and sales, shown in the dark blue bars, were $5.2 billion for the quarter compared to $5.5 billion a year ago. The timing of attractive large case opportunities in the full service market leads to a variable sales pattern from one quarter to another. During the current quarter, we closed 3 cases of over $100 million each, totaling about $800 million, while the year-ago quarter included a major case win for $1.3 billion.","Total Retirement account values amounted to $356 billion at the end of the third quarter, up by $44 billion from a year ago.","Slide 12 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $200 million for the current quarter compared to $173 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from Asset Management fees, the increase from the year-ago quarter included a $21 million greater contribution from what we call the other related revenues, which includes incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. This was driven by strong performance-based incentive fees in the quarter. The contribution from other related revenues, which amounted to $36 million for the current quarter, is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuation and the timing of transactions. The benefits of results of continued growth in Asset Management fees was largely offset by higher expenses in the current quarter. The segment's assets under management amounted to $918 billion at the end of the third quarter, including $544 billion managed for institutional and retail clients. Third-party AUM increased by 11% from a year ago, driven by market appreciation along with about $12 billion of net flows over the past year. Net institutional outflows of $1.4 billion in the current quarter were driven by equities and included some client rebalancing of portfolios to reduce the weighting of some domestic equity product classes. These outflows were largely offset by net retail inflows of $1.2 billion.","Slide 13 shows the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses, showing the adjustments for refinements and updates reflecting our actual reviews and showing the Hartford integration costs in Individual Life.","Slide 14 highlights Individual Life. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, Individual Life earnings were $168 million for the current quarter compared to $145 million a year ago. The $23 million increase was driven by a greater contribution from mortality experience. Claims experience was favorable both in the current quarter and the year-ago quarter. The contribution to current quarter results from mortality experience, together with recurring reserve updates, was about $40 million more favorable than our average expectations.","Slide 15 shows Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $97 million for the current quarter. This compares to sales of $165 million a year ago. The $68 million decrease was mainly driven by a $61 million decline in sales of guaranteed universal life insurance products, shown in the dark blue bars. This decline is directionally consistent with the recent trend we've seen across companies and distributors. The latest available data for the first half of the year shows a 40% decline in industry sales of guaranteed universal life from a year earlier. Our sales decrease also reflects actions we've taken to limit concentration in these products and maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases and actions taken by some competitors to enter the market or make their products relatively more attractive.","Term insurance sales, in the light blue bars, were down $5 million from a year ago, reflecting price reductions by several competitors. In August, we implemented pricing changes on several of our guaranteed universal life and term insurance products, enhancing our competitive position where we see opportunities to offer attractive value propositions with appropriate expected returns. Since the underwriting and issue process typically takes up to 90 days from the time of a policy application, these repricings did not have a significant impact on our current quarter sales.","Slide 16 highlights the Group Insurance business. After adjusting for reserve refinements reflecting our actuarial reviews, Group Insurance earnings amounted to $34 million in the current quarter compared to $23 million a year ago. The $11 million increase was driven by more favorable claims experience in Disability, partly offset by less favorable claims experience in Group Life.","Slide 17 presents benefit ratios for Group Life and Group Disability. In Group Disability favorable current quarter claims experience, including development of existing cases and fewer new cases, drove an improvement of about 11 percentage points in the benefits ratio compared to the year-ago quarter, after removing the impact of the reserve refinements, as shown in the dark blue bars. While we've taken steps to improve results, experience will vary from one quarter to another and improvements won't be linear.","On a similar adjusted basis, the Group Life benefits ratio was less favorable than a year ago, reflecting higher average claims size in the current quarter.","Moving on to International Insurance, on Slide 18. This slide shows the results of our International Insurance business, adjusting for the refinements reflecting our actuarial reviews and the Star and Edison integration costs and Gibraltar Life a year ago.","Slide 19 highlights our Life Planner operations. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our Life Planner business reported earnings of $397 million for the quarter, down $8 million from a year ago. Higher expenses in the current quarter, including technology and distribution costs, more than offset the benefits of continued business growth and more favorable claims experience. Mortality was favorable in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, and we estimate that the contribution to current quarter results was about $20 million more favorable than our average expectations.","In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 82 this year versus JPY 80 last year, had a negative impact of $4 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago. We have completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings for 2015, and our hedging rate for next year will be JPY 91 per U.S. dollar.","Slide 20 highlights Gibraltar Life and other operations. After adjusting for the items I mentioned, Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $446 million for the current quarter, down $24 million from a year ago. Policy benefits experience, including mortality and gains on surrenders, was less favorable in the current quarter than a year ago. And current quarter results reflected a higher level of expenses than the year-ago quarter, largely driven by technology costs. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $10 million on the comparison of results to a year ago.","Turning to Slide 21. International Insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $743 million for the current quarter, an increase of $35 million or 5% from a year ago. Slide 21 is a product view of our sales. Our sales pattern has been affected by actions we've taken, including changes in our product lineup. In addition, the seasonal sales trend favors the first quarter for our Japanese Life Planner business and favors the second quarter for Gibraltar Life. Our yen-based single-premium bank channel product, shown in the brown bars, which we discontinued late last year after cumulative sales of more than $1 billion, contributed $49 million to sales at Gibraltar Life in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the discontinued product, International Insurance sales increased by $84 million from a year ago. Sales of annuities, substantially all of which are fixed annuities denominated in Australian and U.S. dollars, contributed $51 million of the increase, as you can see in the gold bars. These products, which have been popular among Gibraltar's customers, are repriced every 2 weeks for new business to stay in sync with current interest rates and account value adjustments apply, in the event of surrender, to reflect interest rate changes after the sale. The remainder of the sales increase came from $25 million greater sales of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life and retirement income products and $8 million of growth in sales for other products such as term insurance.","Slide 22 breaks out Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $298 million in the current quarter, up $40 million or 16% from a year ago. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan were $192 million in the current quarter, up $15 million from a year ago. As shown in the gold bars, sales of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life and retirement income products increased by $10 million to $47 million for the current quarter. The remainder of the increase came from other products, shown in the dark blue bars, including term insurance.","Sales outside of Japan, in the light blue bars, were up by $25 million from a year ago, mainly driven by increases in Korea and Brazil.","Slide 23 shows Gibraltar Life sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $445 million in the current quarter compared to $450 million a year ago. Sales by Life Consultants, in the dark blue bars, amounted to $196 million for the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Productivity of our Life Consultants, measured by policy sold per agent per month, has essentially returned to the level we achieved prior to our acquisition of Star and Edison. This reflects the results of our implementation of minimum production requirements and other quality standards for the sales force that came to us with the acquisition. This increased productivity entirely offset a decline in the number of Life Consultants of about 700 or 7% over the past year. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gold bars, amounted to $177 million for the current quarter, down by $23 million from a year ago. This decrease reflects the $49 million of sales of the discontinued single-premium product in the year-ago quarter that I mentioned earlier, partly offset by a $26 million increase in sales of other products, including fixed annuities and recurring premium whole life. Sales through independent agents, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $72 million in the current quarter, up by $17 million from a year ago. The increase was driven mainly by greater sales of fixed annuities and Death Protection products.","Slide 24 shows the results of Corporate and Other operations. After adjusting for a charge in the current quarter to strengthen our reserves for obligations to pre-demutualization policyholders, Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $320 million for the current quarter compared to a $312 million loss a year ago. The increase in the loss reflects higher net expenses in the current quarter, including the impact of a lower pension credit.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon.","Robert Michael Falzon","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to give you an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility starting with Slide 25. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. At the end of last year, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 456%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $13.9 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio continues to be well above our 400% target after giving effect to results for the first 9 months of the year.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 835% and 967%, respectively, as of June 30. These reported solvency margins are also well above our targets.","Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses on Slide 26. We calculate our balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance","[Technical Difficulty]","Robert Michael Falzon","This is Rob Falzon. I'm going to continue on. We apologize for having a modest problem with our system. I think where I left off before it cut off, we were turning to Slide 26 after having covered the solvency margins for our Japan businesses. So looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses, on Slide 26, we calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries. At the end of last year, we estimated that our on-balance sheet capital capacity was about $3.5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we considered readily deployable.","During the first 9 months of this year, we returned about $1.5 billion to shareholders. These returns came in the form of 3 quarterly common stock dividends of $0.53 each per share in each quarter, for a total of about $740 million and the repurchase of $750 million of our common stock. This includes $250 million of repurchases during the third quarter under the $1 billion June board authorization, which extends through June 30 of next year.","Net of these returns of capital, our available on-balance sheet capital capacity was about $5 billion, before funding of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile, which we expect to close in the first half of 2015, with the purchase price of $530 million to $620 million. We will consider about $1.5 billion of our capital capacity to be readily deployable.","Turning to the cash position at the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to $4 billion as of the end of the third quarter. This reflects senior debt issuances of $600 million during the quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to redeploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And we'd like to now open it up for questions.","Operator","And you're ready for questions?","John Robert Strangfeld","Yes, we are.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","With the annuities and the change in lapse assumptions, some other companies are also talking about utilization as being an offset. Interested whether you've recalibrated your utilization assumptions there as well.","Robert Michael Falzon","Nigel, it's Rob Falzon. We actually looked at all of the assumptions that went into that calculation, so utilization, efficiency, et cetera, were included in that. The primary driver, however, to the assumption update was lapse and the lapse sensitivity to interest rates.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Then a second question on Asset Management. If we exclude out the other related revenues, seems like the core ROE came down pretty meaningfully this quarter. Seemed like it was on meaningfully higher expenses, so just hoping to get some additional color as to what's happening there.","Stephen P. Pelletier","Nigel, this is Steve. Our growth in fees was commensurate with the growth in assets, but we did have growth in expenses, as you note. Some of that was onetime in nature, but the remainder of it reflected our continued investment in the long-term growth of the business.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question I had is just on the Group Disability reserve charge of around $100 million. You -- Mark, you had referenced Social Security offsets. Can you give a little more color for what's going on there? Are they getting harder to come by now? Is something changed with the Social Security offsets?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Tom, this is Steve. I'll address your question. This does not reflect a change in the external environment, external to ourselves, regarding this. We have refined our methodology about assessing the probability that a certain segment of our claimants will receive Social Security disability, and the reserve strengthening that we did this quarter reflects that refund.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So -- but you haven't seen any change in behavior, nor amount of Social Security offsets. It's more assessing future probabilities going lower, I assume?","Stephen P. Pelletier","That's correct. It's a refinement in our own methodologies around that.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then related to the VA charge, was there a statutory earnings impact? And I believe last year, when you did this, there was a statutory earnings impact, but there wasn't a capital impact. Can you comment on those 2 issues?","Robert Michael Falzon","Tom, it's Rob Falzon. So yes, recall that from a statutory standpoint, we used a modified GAAP accounting that defines our hedge targets. So yes, there was a statutory impact. Yes, it also had a capital consequence associated with it. However, the numbers that we've quoted you with regard to our total capital capacity and readily deployable, factor that in and so they're after the effects of the capital impact.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so, Rob, would that have included -- so would that have been resources that were available within PRU global funding? Or how was that funded?","Robert Michael Falzon","The -- we have resources across the firm, so it was a combination of capacity that we had within the annuities -- legal entity businesses to absorb that, in addition to funding that we've provided from other parts of the organization.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one, if I could sneak it in. The Retirement business, I guess, the results had been quite strong in the first part of the year, got a little bit weaker this quarter, and I believe it was underwriting-related. Is 10% to 15% quarterly swings in earnings volatility due to underwriting something we should expect going forward? Or was there something unusual about this quarter?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Tom, it's Steve. I'll address your question. I wouldn't draw long-term expectations around this quarter. Our first and second quarter case experience was very, very strong relative to our assumptions and expectations. Our third quarter experience was also positive relative to our expectations, but not to the same extent as we saw in the first and second quarter, and that's really about the extent of it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was hoping you could discuss competition for the jumbo PRT deals and current pricing in the market, in particular, given Motorola's comments about paying no premium. It would just be helpful to get your perspective on if and how the economics have changed and why you're comfortable that these blocks are -- will generate attractive returns.","Stephen P. Pelletier","Erik, it's Steve. I'll address your question. First of all, just to emphasize a point John made in his opening remarks, and that is that we're very pleased with the returns on the business we've written this year. Those returns are thoroughly consistent with our corporate return objectives. Second, the statements that you're referencing about par or above par or at par, those comments are all in relation to a plan sponsor's GAAP valuation of its pension liability. From one plan sponsor to another, those valuations can be impacted by a whole range of factors, including, in particular, whether a given plan sponsor is using old or new mortality tables in its valuation of the liability. Frankly, that's all pretty much irrelevant to us. We use a consistent and very disciplined methodology with multiple layers of oversight in order to arrive at our customized view, from the ground up, of the economic risks that we're taking on in a given transaction. That view is based on information that ranges far beyond the Society of Actuaries mortality tables. It includes industry data, it includes our own extensive experience in managing mortality risk, and it includes the -- especially in the large case market, the extensive census data that a plan sponsor supplies us on their retirees. So we're very, very confident in the approach that we take in that regard. Finally, I'd make some remarks regarding the different role that price plays in different segments of the market, and this reflects certainly our own competitive experience, but also the input that we've consistently received from plan sponsors and their advisors. In the large case market, price certainly matters, and there's a need to be competitive on pricing. In particular, pricing serves as a factor in winnowing down the competitive universe from the initial list to a very short list of finalists. We find that pricing, among those finalists, is typically within a very narrow band and that the plan sponsor's choice are based on assessment of certain critical factors that John mentioned in his opening comments. The ability of an insurer to execute large and complex transactions and to bring them to a successful and timely close and the ability to on-board literally tens of thousands of retirees in a seamless way that provides them a quality client experience. We have an established track record in this regard, and that gives plan sponsors a lot of confidence. The small market, and here I'm talking about a few hundred million and below, is very different. It is a market in which the business process really is that of a price-based option. And so when we back up and look at our experience, we're writing relatively more than our fair share of business in the large case market where these capabilities and our ability to differentiate ourselves comes into play in the eyes of plan sponsors, and we're writing, if you will, less than our fair share of business in the segment of the market that tends to be all about price.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And how should we think about interest risk related to these transactions? And you're doing retiree blocks, so are you able to pretty tightly match the assets and liabilities?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Yes, that's a real good point, Erik. The -- very often, the point about retirees is, obviously, seen as a mitigator as it relates to longevity risk, but it's also a significant mitigator in relation to interest rate risk. These are people who are already drawing their payments. The payment schedule is set. There's no more optionality or behavioral risk in these cash flows, and we're able to match them very closely.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And how much risk is there if rates move between when a transaction is announced and when it's closed?","Stephen P. Pelletier","We have contractual provisions to adjust closing pricing for rate movements between announcement and closing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I've a question about the assumption review and especially around the Individual Life insurance business, how you change the long-term path for investment yields there in your current view versus your former view. And I guess, specifically, does that have any influence on your view of the return potential for the Hartford Life block?","Robert Michael Falzon","John, it's Rob Falzon. So we actually only made a relatively modest change to our long-term view of interest rates. So prior to the current quarter, using the 10-year as a benchmark, we had set that at 4.65%. We brought that down to 4.5%, and then a corresponding adjustment to the rest of the yield curve. The only other adjustment that was made is the method through which we migrate to that long-term reversion rate was modified, where we use the forward curve now for a 2-year period and then linearly move out of the long-term assumption for the remaining 8 years. That in and of itself is a relatively modest change and would not otherwise alter the view that we would have with respect to the economics on the Hartford transaction or, in any material way, our other blocks.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Terrific. And then just a question on G&A overall, general and administrative expenses overall for the company. I think you mentioned in a couple of occasion -- a couple of segments that expense levels were a little bit elevated in the current quarter. Is there any reason we should expect that -- in those couple of instances, Life Planner, a few other places, should we trend from this level? Or is some of that IT spending and other spending one-off?","Robert Michael Falzon","So John, in the -- we have not called out to the -- to you or to anyone, any normalization of the expenses that we had in the current quarter with respect to any of the businesses on an overall basis. So I think that's the best way that I can answer that question.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just on the Chilean partnership. When you fund that sometime in the first half of 2015, where do you expect that funding will come from? Will it come from the parent? Or will it come from one of the international operating subsidiaries? And should we expect that, that funding -- we should reduce the expectation for buybacks by a like amount, like you did when you did Hartford?","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes. So the overall level of funding for this, recall that the transaction will be somewhere around $600 million. So it's a relatively modest-sized transaction, and it will be closing during the course of the first half of next year. We have adequate, readily deployable capital, as we've articulated. In order to complete that acquisition, and absent any other events, funding for this would not alter any existing capital redeployment plans that we would have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the first question just related to the previous one on, given the Chilean deal, but also more importantly, the number of pension closeout and longevity transactions you've announced recently. Should we assume that you would be less proactive on share buybacks going forward than you have been because you're using a lot of capital in those deals? And then, secondly, you've spoken about this a couple of times in your prepared remarks. But on the pension closeout deal, you won a disproportionate share of the deals that have been done in the large case market. So just wondering, what's allowing you to win these deals other than the price? And how, like what -- maybe if you could just give us a little bit more detail on what type of returns that you're earning on these and like you've said consistent with your long-term objectives, wondering if you could just talk a little bit more specific on the type of returns you're assuming and what you're earning on the deals that you've done over the past couple of years?","Robert Michael Falzon","Jimmy, it's Rob. I'll handle the first part of your question, and I'm going to turn it over to Steve for the second part of your question. I think it almost repeat what I said just prior to your question. We would -- both in terms of when we got the authorization for our stock buyback program back in June for the $1 billion and then with respect to how we're thinking about Habitat, all of that considered our expectations with regard to our ability to fund our continuing business, including our PRT business. And neither of those events, either our success with PRT or the Habitat acquisition, would cause us to otherwise think about altering the existing capital redeployment plans that we have. And then second part, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen P. Pelletier","Jimmy, this is Steve. I won't characterize our returns on the transactions beyond what I said, which is that, like you said, we like the returns on the business we've written. Those -- they're in line with our corporate return expectations. In regard to capabilities, I'd mention the comments that John made at the outset, which is these are capabilities we've been investing in since 2006 in terms of the dedicated team. Also, we have a proven methodology for taking the resources of that dedicated team and connecting them to our resources across the company that are involved in successful and timely execution of these deals. That would include our asset liability management, our investment management, our actuarial and our legal area as well, in our ability to execute documentation in a ready fashion. That is a path of certainty that we can offer plan sponsors from the very outset of these transactions. We're able to give them a calendar for how they should expect matters to progress along this path, and that is a calendar that we have consistently followed through on in the different transactions we've done, and that creates, like I say, kind of a virtuous cycle about plan sponsor confidence in our ability to execute on these transactions.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I can understand you're not disclosing specifics on a certain deal, but I think one thing that might be helpful in the future is given that you've done a number of these now, that at least give us some idea on what actual returns have been because, whether it's right or wrong, given how many of these deals have been announced and what proportion of those you've earned, you've ended up getting -- there's a concern out there that may be Prudential's being aggressive on pricing. But that's for something for you to evaluate in the future.","Mark B. Grier","Jimmy, it's Mark. Let me add 2 elements of color on this. One point is that the deals to date have outperformed our assumptions and expectations on both liabilities and assets. But secondly, I said early on in questions about these deals, particularly after we had just done GM and Verizon, that if these were done in a stand-alone company, you would want to buy that company, and I would stand by that comment. I believe that on a risk return basis, appropriately considering the entire deal and capitalization, these attractive are opportunities for us.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, just on the Institutional Asset Management business. Your flows have been consistently positive for a number of years. This quarter, it was a negative. So just if you can give us a little bit of color and whether it's more of an aberration or is there something that's changed in terms of your performance or anything else that drove the results this quarter?","Stephen P. Pelletier","No, Jimmy. This is Steve. I'd call it more of an aberration. It was driven by some rebalancing activities by equity clients and also the planned unwinding of an Asian real estate fund. When -- obviously, flows can be lumpy, and it's, of course, it's unfortunate to see a streak ending, but when we look at our investment performance, that continues to give us great confidence in our ability to garner flows in this business going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I just have a couple of follow-ups. One is just on what Jimmy was asking about return expectations with the various pension closeout activities. Can you remind us of what your corporate return expectations are versus your cost of capital to maybe help triangulate the return question?","Robert Michael Falzon","Randy, it's Rob Falzon. We have a stated target objective of 13% to 14%, and we think that, that provides a handsome premium over our cost of capital.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I think in the past when you've kind of identified businesses that are above or below that target to kind of average to the return, where would pension fall on that continuum, where Japan would be lower and then some of the annuity activities will be higher?","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes, Randy, we don't...","John Robert Strangfeld","Japan's higher.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Say again?","John Robert Strangfeld","Japan's a lot higher.","Robert Michael Falzon","The actual returns that we post on our Japan business are actually with all -- well the risk would merit a lower hurdle rate. The actual returns against that have actually been well above what you would benchmark as a hurdle rate for that business. Having said that, Randy, we actually don't provide any visibility toward individual hurdle rates for any of our segment businesses. We just articulate that in the context of the overall company objectives because our mix of business and the capital that we deploy in it will change over time.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on the group charge and just kind of following up on the Social Security piece of that. I guess, a couple. One is do you have any sense that Prudential's book would have more Social Security reimbursement exposure than a normal book? And then on that charge, was it mostly due to the Social Security recoverability issue? Or was there another major piece of the charge in the group area?","Stephen P. Pelletier","There's nothing -- Randy, this is Steve. There's nothing about our business that is materially different about the Social Security matter. As I said, this is a refinement of our own methodologies. The second part of your question was in regard to...","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Well I'm just trying to reconcile, I think intuitively, you're having good current year development or activity, as you stated. But -- so then I'm trying to reconcile that with this kind of -- these refinements, and so Social Security has come out as a piece of which it makes sense. Is there another big piece, and kind of how big of a piece of the charge was the Social Security item?","Stephen P. Pelletier","We made an across-the-board update of our actuarial assumptions, and there were a variety of impacts, but the Social Security offset matter was the biggest piece.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I actually have just one question today. You've emphasized that the pension risk transfer business on one hand and the longevity reinsurance business on the other are really quite different from each other in terms of capital requirements, the profits that come out, the funding, one is funded, the other is not. Do you prefer one business over the other? Is one business a better business than the other?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Eric, this is Steve. We view -- well, first of all, we view this as a business, and we see longevity reinsurance and funded pension risk transfer business as different parts of that business. We view these as actually highly, highly complementary to each other. They are complementary to each other in terms of the capabilities that we were speaking about earlier. The insights we garner from one part of the business can help inform our risk management and our pricing in another part of the business. And we also see them as highly complementary from a financial result standpoint. Pension risk transfer business, funded pension risk transfer business, our earnings tend to decay gradually over time as the book runs off. Longevity reinsurance, the earnings profile actually escalates over time as our actuarial certainty about outcomes progresses as time elapses. So I'd say both from a strategic and from a financial standpoint, they're highly complementary.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I could just ask one quick follow-up. Is there any reason, as an industrial company or another old-line industrial company or another plan sponsor, I realize you have newer companies with defined benefits plans, so lets' just talk about a plan sponsor in general. As a plan sponsor thinks about sort of getting out of the pension business or reducing its exposure to pension, what sort of considerations would prompt it to choose one approach over the other?","Mark B. Grier","Meaning funded versus longevity swap?","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, please.","Stephen P. Pelletier","I think, Eric, we find that at least to date, in the U.S. market, the funded business has been the primary of choice. Whereas in the U.K., and also starting to extend into other markets like Canada and the Netherlands, we see the longevity reinsurance market as being, at this stage, much more highly developed and that's the way a lot of companies choose to go. But that could emerge in the U.S. market as well. But right now, we see the differentiation as largely a geographical one.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the Social Security issue first, and I just want to make sure I understand this. From the initial comments, it sounded to me like it was one part of the business that was affected by the Social Security refinement. Is that accurate?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Yes. It's our Group Insurance Disability business.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","No, no, no. I meant like one cohort or one type of risk or something like that? Or it was just more general?","Stephen P. Pelletier","No. We refined our methodologies in how we assess the likelihood of claimants to receive Social Security disability, especially around our segmentation of claimants.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, that's what I meant, the segmentation of claimants. So that's somehow -- but it wasn't necessarily one or the other. That's what I was trying to get to. What that means -- what does that mean, segmentation of claimants?","Stephen P. Pelletier","That means we refined the extent to which -- how we vary our assessment of probability from one segment to the next. A much more granular approach.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, that's what I want to get to, okay. And then if we could stick on the actuarial stuff. With regards to the change in lapse assumptions on the variable annuities, what was it about interest rates? I mean, I would think that lower interest rates, older people, obviously, they've got nowhere to go. They would stick with their policies, but that's not what you're talking about here, is it?","Stephen P. Pelletier","No, Steven, this is Steve again. We changed our approach quite significantly this year to a much more sophisticated approach towards lapsation. Previously, our approach had been fundamentally based on \"In-the-Moneyness\" of the guarantee, and that's kind of an industry standard approach. Now we're focusing on the ability of a policyholder to replicate the income stream from our guarantee through other sources, other sources that might be available in the marketplace. As such, that makes this approach much more sense -- so that makes our lapse assumptions under this approach much more sensitive to interest rate movements.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 2 p.m. today until midnight November 13.

We hope that you will be able to join us.","And with that, let's turn to slide 2 and I will hand it over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the momentum of our business in the first half of the year. We continue to bring financial opportunity to more and more customers around the world in new, exciting and compelling ways. I will expand on our U.S. financial wellness initiative in a few moments.","We generated an attractive operating return on equity and double-digit growth in both adjusted earnings per share and adjusted book value per share. And with our strong capital position, we returned approximately $760 million to shareholders; as well, significantly strengthened our Long-Term Care reserves. We expect to continue a robust level of capital return and to utilize the remaining $750 million of our share repurchase authorization by the end of the year.","Turning to slide 3, I will provide some additional financial highlights on the second quarter. We produced an annualized operating return on equity of 13.5%, which was above our near to intermediate-term objective of 12% to 13%. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.01 grew significantly from the prior year. This increase was driven by growth in the business, tax reform, and assumption updates. Adjusting for notable items, earnings per share grew 16%. Our current quarter net income was also affected primarily by the significant strengthening of our Long-Term Care reserves, as I noted earlier. Rob Falzon will discuss this in more detail.","Our adjusted book value per share of $92.60 is up 14% over the prior year. This increase reflects the earnings we generated as well as the impact of tax reform and accounting changes at the start of 2018. Partially offsetting these items were the payment of $3.30 per share of common stock dividends and about $1.4 billion of share repurchases over the past year.","With respect to our business segments, here are some highlights from the quarter. PGIM, which is our investment management business, continued to produce positive net flows with $7.3 billion in the quarter. Our Retirement business had record account values of $433 billion, including net flows of $2.8 billion driven by pension risk transfer and full service sales. The third quarter has started well, with our recently announced pension risk transfer transaction with Raytheon totaling close to $1 billion. Our Individual Annuities business produced sales of $2.1 billion, which were 37% higher than the prior year and up 20% sequentially. And in International, we continued to produce steady in-force growth.","Now, turning to slide 4, I'm extremely excited about our potential to accelerate earnings growth as we continue to unlock value through our unique business model. Not only does our model allow us to manage risk and deploy capital in a way that is attractive to shareholders, our model and business mix also allows us to design and deliver integrated solutions at scale to bring financial security more into reach for a growing base of customers. By combining our competencies across disciplines, we generate outcomes that other companies simply cannot replicate.","There are three key points I'd like to make regarding our financial wellness initiative in the United States. First, we have built up significant experience since launching this initiative three years ago and have continued to innovate. Second, we believe our integrated holistic solutions, which are available in person or online, provide meaningful differentiation in the market. And third, our value proposition is resonating with employers and individuals and this is resulting in commercial success.","We view financial wellness as a way to help people drive behaviors that allow them to effectively manage their day-to-day finances, achieve their most important financial goals and protect themselves against key risks. As a reminder, we launched financial wellness with the introduction of Prudential Pathways and, in this program, our Prudential advisors provide education for employees of our workplace clients. Should these employees want more information and solutions for their needs, they can follow up with our advisors. Customers can also receive education and solutions in digital form, since the launch of our digital financial wellness platform. Employers also find significant value in this digital platform as they can better understand the financial wellness of their overall employee population.","We have critical ingredients to deliver integrated solutions that address the holistic financial needs of individuals, and these include our own financial advisors, workplace access to over 20 million people via our Retirement and Group insurance businesses, income and protection solutions via our Individual Annuities and Individual Life businesses, and Investment Management solutions via (7:30) PGIM. All of this is built on our own technology platform.","This integration creates value in several ways. First, institutional customers only need to work with one party. Second, we can enhance customer experiences and solutions, and these experiences are personalized with solutions tailored to each person's needs. We have the flexibility to adapt and refine the experiences and solutions by having all of the capabilities I previously mentioned. And this is further enabled by our digital and data analytics expertise. And third, having all the parts of the value chain will allow us to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders.","Our solutions that I'm describing are resonating. Since launching financial wellness, over 350 employers representing more than 4 million employees have signed up for Prudential Pathways. When people attend the education seminars, many schedule follow-up meetings with our financial advisors. And the types of employers that have signed up represent a broad spectrum and include several well-known brands from amongst the largest and fastest growing companies in the country. Also, approximately 200 employers are using our digital financial wellness platform.","We're very excited about how our business has come together to make a meaningful difference in the financial health for people. And innovations like Prudential Pathways and our digital financial wellness platform don't happen without an inclusive, empowering culture that promotes internal partnerships. We've witnessed the power of bringing together different perspectives, experiences, and technical expertise to gain deeper insights, develop new offerings, and enter new markets. Our own pension risk transfer business was born from this type of a entrepreneurial culture and partnering capability, and financial wellness is another great example. I continue to believe that Prudential's culture is a competitive advantage and I'm excited to see how our talented people continue to push the company into new areas for growth, areas that are consistent with our mission and our purpose.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide an update on how our businesses are executing on key priorities. Mark?","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. Thank you, John. I'll be going through comments on each of our businesses in a few minutes, but let me start off by reminding you that we've often talked about ourselves as a very good story around developing thoughtful strategies, executing well, building good business fundamentals, and realizing attractive financial results. And, in fact, we often start our earnings calls by talking about the attractive business fundamentals reflected in sales and flows, for example, that we're experiencing in our businesses","So, under that umbrella of the themes, strategy, execution, fundamentals, and results, I'm going to make a few comments on each of our businesses. I won't be going through that whole equation for everything we do everywhere, but there are things that are worth highlighting in the context of each of our businesses.","Before I get into a business-by-business discussion, though, let me mention a few common themes that run across our businesses, and these are themes that are not necessarily so visible. These are things that are in the heart of our execution processes that are making differences to us in our markets and with our clients.","The first common theme, and it's part of a lot of what John talked about, is the notion of enhancing our value propositions. And the practical consequence of that is that we are able to compete on a basis other than just price because of the attraction of the value proposition that we've put in front of our clients. Importantly, this is not a theoretical aspiration for us. We're seeing real results in the marketplace, reflecting differentiation and reflecting the attraction of a value proposition that goes beyond price competition.","The second common theme that runs across our businesses relates to what we're doing to impact the front end, our customer-facing activities. And almost everywhere, we're doing things that are changing our client experiences, folding into the notion of enhanced value propositions and, again, having concrete results with respect to either individual or institutional businesses.","And then finally, technology runs across so many of the things that we're doing that it's worth highlighting the idea of digital, mobile, and data in a number of aspects of our businesses. John mentioned how important technology is to the financial wellness proposition, but technology runs through a lot of the things that we're doing in the context of that front-end impact and also in the context of the enhanced value proposition. So, big deal there. And each of these impacting what we do in the markets every day are things that are driving the attractive business fundamentals that you're seeing.","I want to now comment on the individual businesses. I'm going to start with slide 5. This one is titled PGIM. And again, I'm not going to go through the whole equation for everything everywhere, but I want to make some points that tie things together around our themes. But with respect to PGIM, our headline for a while has been net flows. Every year, we've counted one more year of consecutive positive flows, up now to 15 years of consecutive positive net flows in our Institutional business, 13 consecutive years of positive net flows in our Retail businesses.","But the story isn't just arithmetic. These net flows tie specifically to the key priorities that are mentioned on the right-hand side of this slide. I guess, if there's a leading indicator of future flows, it's the first bullet under key priorities, which is investment performance. And you see metrics there that provide extremely attractive messages and signals about the prospects for future flows in this business. As our performance ages, we'll see three-year records becoming five-year records and five-year records becoming 10-year records, and you see very attractive performance relative to benchmark. And that has been one of the anchors over time, driving our flows in the Institutional and Retail Investment businesses.","Then, you see some strategy bullets, and we've talked about these: leveraging scale; realizing the benefits of operating leverage, especially as we've highlighted in public fixed income; but also, expanding our global footprint. We are getting mandates from around the world. We are receiving recognition as an asset manager in publications in Europe, for example, and in publications in Asia, for example. So, the global footprint story really is working. I think the PGIM brand has been very helpful to us in that regard; and then, diversification with respect to products and capabilities. And so, we've talked about strategy initiatives and I've highlighted PGIM over and over as a great story over the past five or six years that relates strategy execution and results. And so, those flows do tie back to exactly the things that are listed under priorities to grow.","I'd comment finally that, in the lower right-hand side of this, our overall fee rate is holding up very well in PGIM. And we've talked about the mix changes that are helping to offset some of the dynamics of product changes within Asset Management, and those mix changes continue to serve us well.","Turning to the next slide, that's on Retirement. The big story here, I think, is probably across-the-board flows. You see on the bottom Institutional Investment product flows and Full Service net flows in Institutional Investment products. We did about $1 billion of PRT deals in the second quarter. John mentioned a big deal that's been done since then. And we did about $2.4 billion in two jumbo longevity swaps during the quarter. So, we continue to see robust business flows on the Institutional side. On the Full Service side, in the first half of the year, we had $16 billion in sales and deposits, and that resulted in a $3 billion net positive Full Service flow for the first half of the year.","On the point I made earlier about differentiated value proposition, I would highlight the first bullet under key priorities to grow, which is the potential impact on our Retirement businesses, especially Full Service, of things that we're doing in financial wellness and how important that can be as part of our value proposition to clients. And as I said, it's not just a theoretical aspiration; it's happening. We see business coming in because of what we can do in the wellness arena.","Turning to the next slide, Group Insurance, I guess the highlight here is to tie, again, back to the idea that our value proposition is resonating. We're closing, as John's slide mentioned, marquee business, not just on the basis of price, but on the basis of the wellness proposition and other dimensions of service. Under key priorities here, we mention financial wellness, again, but the third bullet also mentions improve organizational and process efficiencies. And we're doing things there that are impacting our customer experience and impacting our value propositions. And these things are paying off. So, the way in which we're approaching customers goes beyond the inclusion of the wellness initiative in our overall package to some specific aspects of how we deal with and how we treat clients; how we service customers, both at the individual level as beneficiaries, for example, but also at the Institutional level as Group Insurance clients.","Turning to the next slide, Individual Annuities, I want to highlight three things. On the bottom left, you see that sales are growing. And what I'd say \u2013 what I would say about sales is that they're growing, they're well diversified, and we're selling at prices that are achieving or exceeding our target returns. So, it's a good solid attractive sales picture, reflecting efforts we've made in the product arena, but also reflecting our pricing discipline with respect to meeting profit targets.","Second thing I want to highlight is on the bottom right, and that is the flow of dividends from our Annuity business to PFI. We have promised you, as we restructured and talked about the potential in this business, that we would generate healthy cash flows from our Variable Annuity business to the parent and we are realizing that, as you see in that slide.","And then, finally, the third bullet under key priorities to grow reflects part of what Variable Annuities can do to be part of the integrated solutions that John mentioned that we're delivering across businesses, particularly with respect to secure retirement income in the workplace as it relates to Individual Annuities. We've launched a product called Guaranteed Income for Tomorrow. The short phrase for that is GIFT, and this is a specific extension of secure retirement income products into the workplace market in a way that we feel is very attractive and is an important complement to what we're doing overall in financial wellness.","Let me turn, now, to Individual Life in the next slide. And I want to talk about two things here. One is the broad sales picture, which we would describe as very solid, but then this is an area where we're doing things that are impacting value proposition and impact on our client interfaces that are extremely important. We've added a capability that we call PruFast Track, which is an end-to-end solution that can bind policies in as quickly as 48 hours. This compares to a traditional issue process that may take several weeks. This process eliminates the need for health examinations. And this capability is unique in the marketplace coming from Prudential in several dimensions. One is we're selling our own products and our binding. We offer a broad array of products, including Term, Variable Universal Life, Fixed Universal Life, and Indexed Universal Life. We sell face amounts up to $1 million for age ranges between 18 and 60. We anticipate fully rolling this out in our third-party channels by the end of August, and we're optimistic that processes like this, which make life easier for people to do business with an insurance company, can have a significant positive impact on sales. The analogy generally is the whole digital world, where things are just easier, and we're making things easier in our Individual Life business.","Let me turn, now, to International, and there are two slides. And I want to highlight common themes, and then a couple of specifics on each. There are three drivers of our International story at this point, and they're probably familiar. One is the importance of dollar products overall, but particularly in Japan. Our ability to sell dollar products, because of the quality of our sales forces, has allowed us to maintain strong sales results and strong profitability even in an environment in which some of the local currency products, again, especially referring to yen, have been challenged in terms of both attractiveness in the marketplace as well as profitability. So, headline number 1 is the importance of dollar products, and you see graphs of sales mix by currency on both of the pieces of the International picture.","Second key bullet, the management of our Life Planner and Life Consultant forces. This includes growth. It includes quality. And I just reference quality in talking about dollar sales. And it also includes productivity, all of which are strong and improving for us and terrific assets in terms of the way we do business.","And then, finally, a new one for us to talk about in International, which is digital, mobile and data analytics initiatives. And I would describe this as something below the level of total International, thoughtful market-by-market, tailored to the circumstances in our individual markets, but a package of initiatives that we'll be talking more and more about as we mature, both in terms of our front-end initiatives and in our back office and other capabilities.","So just quickly on Life Planners, we've been through a couple of experiences, which we've talked about, where we've had a blip in sales manager growth followed by better results in terms of Life Planner growth. And we're kind of nearing one those blips right now. We have appointed a lot of sales managers and we're anticipating that there will be some reflection of that sales manager growth in Life Planner hiring over the next couple of years. It doesn't happen the next day, but there's a strong basic dynamic around the second bullet under priorities, which is Grow Life Planners. And that important dynamic relates to appointing sales managers. And then, I mention sales mix by currency just to highlight that on the bottom of that slide on the right.","And then, turning to Gibraltar Life, two comments here. One is the currency results and, again, how important U.S. dollar products are and tying that back to the quality of our sales force and what they can do in the market that many others can't do. But I also want to highlight the multi-channel approach that's reflected in Gibraltar's results. Looking at the sales mix on the left, where you see Distribution, we have Life Consultants. We also have Independent Agents; and, we also have the Bank channel. And so, we continue to optimize across those channels with respect to both product design and, ultimately, volume and price. So good attractive results there.","So that's it. As I said, I've highlighted some pieces under the strategy execution fundamentals and results equation. Good stories everywhere for us and some things that may not have been so visible that we're happy to be able to talk about.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to pick it up beginning on slide 12 by highlighting the notable items which have impacted the current quarter adjusted operating results. We have combined what we previously called market driven and discrete items with trend considerations into a single list of notable items. These items consist of the impact on results from our annual reviews, including assumption updates and other refinements, the quarterly updated estimate of Individual Annuities profitability driven by market performance, and the impact attributable to variances from our expectations for selected variable revenues and expenses. We highlight these items because their contribution to current quarter results may not be indicative of future performance.","This year's Actuarial review included economic and insurance assumption updates and other refinements and resulted in a net unfavorable pre-tax adjusted operating income impact of $160 million on our ongoing businesses. We expect no meaningful change to our run rate earnings across our businesses from these updates and refinements. Current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $10 million below our long-term expectations. In addition, the current quarter underwriting experience was approximately $85 million better than our average expectations, including favorable pension risk transfer case experience in Retirement.","And finally, our Group Insurance business incurred elevated expenses in the current quarter, including the costs to terminate a third-party underwriting service provider contract. These services will be performed internally, which should reduce future underwriting costs. In total, these notable items reduced earnings by $102 million, or $0.19 per share. Excluding these notable items, earnings per share would be $3.20, up 16% from the year-ago quarter.","Turning now to slide 13, I'll spend a few minutes discussing our Long-Term Care business. We entered the Long-Term Care business in the 1990s and actually issued our first individual Long-Term Care product in 1999. In 2012, we discontinued all sales of Long-Term Care products, classified this business as a divested business, and strengthened reserves by $700 million. We currently have approximately 211,000 policies in-force, with about 2% of these policies currently generating claims. We have been actively managing our Long-Term Care block by enhancing our claims management programs, optimizing our cost structure and successfully pursuing rate increases. Our experience of applying for and receiving approvals for rate increases is consistent with the assumptions in our reserves. Included in our reserves is $1 billion of combined future rate increases and benefit reductions in lieu of rate increases which have not yet been approved.","During the quarter, we strengthened our GAAP reserves by $1.5 million as a result of updating our Actuarial assumptions. We removed our morbidity improvement assumption of 1% reduction in claims cost per year over a 20-year period, which increased our best estimate reserve by $1.4 billion. In addition, there were a number of other changes to our assumptions, the net effect of which was largely offset by the margin in our reserves that existed prior to the update. These changes align our assumptions with experience and industry data.","Although, we removed our morbidity improvement assumption, we retained our mortality improvement assumption. If we also removed this latter assumption, our best estimate reserve would have been reduced by about $850 million. While strengthening our reserves, we continue to maintain a strong capital position and do not anticipate any change to our capital deployment plans, including the level of dividends and stock repurchases.","For additional detail, we have included the key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in these assumptions in the appendix of this slide deck. We've also included in the appendix, additional details about the block. Here are a few of the highlights from that data. Our average attained age is 65 years old, which is relatively young and, therefore, likely to provide more time to collect premiums. About two-thirds of our book is group issued, which tends to have lower benefits than individual policies. And, as a result, less than 10% of our total policies have lifetime benefits, and less than 30% contain compound inflation features.","Now turning to slide 14, I will provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures. Our cash and highly liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.7 billion at the end of the quarter. The sequential quarter decline of about $400 million was driven primarily by our redemption of high coupon junior subordinated note, partially offset by cash inflows which were in excess of shareholder distributions during the quarter.","Shareholder distributions included dividends of $382 million and share repurchases of $375 million. The share repurchase authorization for the remainder of the year was $750 million as of June 30.","Our domestic and international regulatory capital ratios are above our AA financial strength targeted levels and our financial leverage and total leverage ratios remain within our targets as of the end of the second quarter. In addition, we do not expect material impacts to capital from the proposed Variable Annuity statutory framework changes adopted by the NAIC Variable Annuities Issues Working Group last week.","So, in summary, we are executing on our strategies and generating strong returns in growth in our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted book value per share while maintaining a robust capital position.","Now, I'll turn it to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. First we'll go to the line of John Nadel of UBS. Your line is open.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. So, this has been a long day and there's a lot going on. I guess the first question I have is, when I think about the morbidity improvement and the removal of that assumption from your Long-Term Care reserves, was that something that was an internally-motivated decision? Or was there any external influence on that decision, whether from regulatory bodies or rating agencies or any other constituents?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","John, it's Rob. That decision was entirely an internally-motivated decision. It was done with the benefit of consulting with industry experts and others in the industry from which we were able to glean insights as to trends that were occurring within the industry, but was not done in reaction to any regulatory stimulus.","Sort of, if I expand on that a little bit, perhaps, and perhaps a little redundant with what I might have said in my opening remarks, but we discontinued the business back in 2012 and we took a $700 million strengthening of our reserves at that point in time. As I mentioned, we incorporated our reserve estimates for the morbidity improvement, which means people living healthier, which reduced our required reserves, as well as mortality improvement, which meant that people living longer, which conversely increases our reserves.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Yes.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Given the lack of the statistically significant experience in our book at that point in time, we relied on guidance from consultants, academic research, and industry practice. Since then, neither our experience, which has now, has sort of more statistical significance associated with it, or any of that consultation or survey with industry has indicated that there's been any morbidity improvement trend. So, at the same time, we're seeing the mortality improvements in this business and in other businesses.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Yes.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, based on that, we elected to \u2013 based on looking at that data and that industry experience, we elected to remove the morbidity improvement assumption, and that gave rise to that $1.4 billion charge while maintaining the mortality improvement assumption. And as I indicated in my remarks, that's about an $850 million addition to reserves \u2013 or attribution to reserves as a part of our assumption update process. Recognizing that that's a more conservative approach that others in the industry have taken, but it's consistent with our updated view of best estimate.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. And that's really helpful. I really appreciate that. And then, just second, or following up on that, does that change apply to both the Individual and the Group Long-Term Care block? Did you have that assumption in both places? And if so, can you give us an estimate on how to allocate that piece of it?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, yes, the assumption was \u2013 pertain to both blocks of business, Group and Individual, in the old assumption and in the update. So, it's been removed by both.","The impact on either of those blocks in any given assumption, actually, is going to be variable, so there's not a consistent rule of thumb that you can use. With regard to this particular assumption, John, roughly what I would say is about 60% of it would have been driven from the Individual block and about 40% of it from the Group block.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up on an actual business question. Within Investment Management, or PGIM, results really stepped up in terms of the pre-tax operating income contribution. Looks like that was \u2013 I mean, revenues were sort of in line. You continue to grow very nicely. It looked like the biggest part of it \u2013 the biggest driver of the jump was the reduction in expense or spending. Is that sustainable? And if so, sort of what's driving that? Is it just sort of the runoff of some of the investment spending you've been making?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","John, this is Steve. I'll address your question. There's going to be some variability in relation to timing of expenses. For example, on a sequential quarter, our first quarter expenses would ordinarily be elevated by how we account for our long-term incentive compensation in the Asset Management business. And you're not seeing that show up in the same way in the second quarter. Also, as you note, looking at a longer-term time trend, some of the investments that we've been making in the business are reaching maturity and are yielding very, very significant benefits.","But I would say that the main drivers, looking at a year timeframe or a multi-year timeframe in the Asset Management business and the growth in earnings there, have been continuing to attract very strong and robust flows, attracting those flows into areas where we already have existing strategies; so, therefore, we're able to onboard the flows in a very effective way and expand our margins and our ability that we've spoken about before, which we think is pretty distinctive in the industry, to maintain a stable average fee structure across the entire book of business at about 22 basis points. So, all of those factors, together, we see as really being the underpinning of positive earnings flow \u2013 positive earnings trends in PGIM.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Hey, Rob, first just to follow-up to John's question, the \u2013 removing the morbidity improvement assumption with only 2% of your book now on claim, I mean, do you really have enough experience in terms of your own data to make that \u2013 to see that you're not seeing the emergence of morbidity improvement, or did you have to rely pretty heavily for that assumption change on the third-party consulting advice as well? Or was it a mix? Or \u2013 any help on that would be appreciated.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so Tom, I would say it was a balance between the two. I would say when we initially took this, we had very little experience. We've now got five, six years' worth of experience that statistically you would call significant. As we look at that data, there's noise. And it clearly \u2013 as you would think given it still is a relatively shorter measurement period and, as we indicated, the number of claims that we have is relatively small to the overall book and to the population of claimants that are across the industry.","So, we complemented that with looking externally and talking with consultants that we know have insights into what's happening across the industry to confirm that what we're seeing isn't any different than what others are experiencing across the industry. And based on what we got from those conversations and looking at our own book, felt that there was no discernible trend toward morbidity change. And so, our best estimate, therefore, recognizing that it could go either way, so something that you're trying to get as a mid-point is that there is no morbidity improvement occurring in our book or across the industry that would cause us to think that our book would ultimately behave in a different way than it has been.","And let me \u2013 if you don't mind, let me just sort of add on just some sort of further thoughts on that. I think that this was, as we noted, it was somewhat unusual vis-a-vis peers in the industry. We recognize that. But \u2013 and while the charge associated with it, at $1.4 billion, is in excess, I think, of what Street expectations might have been as we were beginning to look at this \u2013 but, I would emphasize that we have a very strong capital position and it is largely unaffected by our across-the-board second quarter assumption updates. We continue to have the flexibility to finance our growth, including investments in our new business initiatives, while redeploying capital, including as I mentioned in my opening remarks, to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, completely consistent with our existing plans. And all of that, incidentally, includes absorbing fully the impact of the Tax Act while maintaining our targeted AA solvency ratios, currently still at a 400% FICO ratio and remaining within our targets for liquidity and leverage as well.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Thanks for that. And then, just a question about the trends you're seeing in the Long-Term Care block. I know, in 2017, there was sort of this spike in incurred claims up around 50%. Has that trend continued into 2018? Was that also part of the upsizing of the charge here or has that calmed down in terms of the actual trend?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, let me try taking a stab at that this way, Tom. When we did our assumptions, our assumptions now reflect our full historical experience through 2017. And based on that, our actual to expected is running at 100% over that period of time. And as we look at our 2018 experience as it's emerging, it is entirely consistent with those revised set of assumptions. And so, you sort of think about that as an average over that period of time, and 2018 being reflective of what that average is, recognizing that in any given period, be it quarter or year, you can get noise as we've expressed we saw during 2017.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Thanks. And then, just one other quick one. Did you \u2013 the statutory charge you took, the $600 million...","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Did that \u2013 was that just on claim reserves or did you adjust active life reserves at all?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","There was a \u2013 well, the \u2013 no, that was the ALR. That was the active life reserve adjustment, Tom. So, the $600 million, there was small adjustments in GAAP and stat for the Disabled Life, the claims. The driver in both statutory and in GAAP was on our active life reserve. The $600 million was significantly less than the GAAP reserve because we had more margins in our reserves on a statutory basis relative to GAAP. But the same set of assumptions are used in the adjustments that we made in GAAP and stat, with the only difference being that stat \u2013 that you can see in the total reserves, they're slightly larger as a result of the pads that you have in stat relative to our GAAP results.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the morbidity improvement, that you've removed the 1% assumption. But could that go the other way? In other words, if claims costs go up by 1% over 20 years, would that essentially, based on your sensitivities, require another $1.4 billion of reserves?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, let me try, Suneet, to answer that question this way. We removed the morbidity improvement assumption, as you indicated. We did provide to you sensitivities with regard to claims costs. And so, if you think about the potential variability in our claims costs, we said a reasonable sort of stressed kind of sensitivity around that, we put in there at plus or minus 5%. So, if our assumptions are that morbidity improvement \u2013 not only is there not morbidity improvement, but that we experienced some level of morbidity deterioration, if there was a 5% deterioration \u2013 not a 5% per year for forever, but a 5% holistic deterioration in that, that would be about a $500 million adjustment to our reserves, recognizing over the fullness of time with health innovation, et cetera, there might be an upward bias to that; but, if it were to be downward, that would be the order of magnitude to that. And we've provided similar assumptions to the \u2013 across the rest of what we believe to be the primary drivers to the reserves that we hold for this business.","And I think I would characterize what we've done and the sensitivities being provided there, Suneet in the following way. One, it is comprehensive. And so, we've looked holistically at all the assumptions underlying our business and tried to reflect in those assumptions the experience that we've been seeing and what we can glean from what's happening across the industry. The \u2013 our desire was to put this issue to bed in the eyes of investors and to allow investors to focus on the strong fundamental and growth that we have in our operating businesses.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then, just on the same Slide 21, if we look at the $1 billion of future rate increases assumed in your reserves, so is that the same number for GAAP and stat? And separately, what was the prior assumption? In other words, what did you have built in before you did your second quarter of 2018 reserve review in terms of benefit from future reaction?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, first part of your question, yes, the same assumption being used in both GAAP and statutory reserves, as I'd indicated before. Second question, let me try approaching that a little differently, Suneet, to see if I can actually get at what I think you want to understand with respect to that $1 billion. Think about that as being in three tranches. The first is \u2013 about 10% of that we've already filed before.","First, actually, let me also start with \u2013 put that in the context of we've actually already received about $0.9 billion worth of rate increases on this block over time from the point at which we impaired it back in 2012. So, hopefully that adds some perspective in terms of balancing this $1 billion against almost $1 billion that we've already achieved to date. And the assumptions driving this \u2013 the $1 billion that we have in there, are consistent with our experience in the first rounds of price increases that we sought and, incidentally, are subject to very robust underwriting in order to quantify that number to begin with.","And so, going back to sort of thinking about those in buckets, 10% that's already been filed. About 30% of that actually represents instances where we've already had filings with the states where we've implemented a price increase, but where the \u2013 where we have agreed to come back to the state and do it in multiple steps as opposed to do it in a single rate increase. So, we implemented a rate increase, but we've agreed to come back and seek approval for a further rate increase in order to make it a more palatable outcome for consumers at the end of the day.","And then, the remaining 60% would be new filings. And within those new filings, I would \u2013 that would represent both some of our legacy adverse experience that we've had as well as the new adverse experience that we updated as a result of this update. And think about that as being roughly evenly split between where we expect to get price increases and where we expect to actually \u2013 to come out in the form of benefit reductions in lieu of price increases.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, just lastly on the same topic, the assumption to get rid of the morbidity improvement, I mean, it seems like that's what your third-party actuarial consultants are recommending as a best practice, right? And I'm assuming \u2013 just trying to think through where the ranges of these assumptions are across different companies.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Well, to be very clear, Suneet, we did not engage any consultants in the evaluation and the process that we went through. We consulted with outside parties, but there's no consultant that recommended to us this as a best estimate. Obviously, our accountants, who have actuarial expertise, have weighed in on this and they have confirmed that they believe that our approach to this is a reasonable approach to take with regard to establishing a best estimate.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. So, my question is around just the cash flows. And, Rob, I think you mentioned that you absorbed \u2013 you were able to absorb a good amount here and still had the ability to kind of maintain the capital deployment plans. So, could you talk about what is driving \u2013 what are the parts of the business that are driving better free cash flow? And as we kind of think out to next year and beyond, I mean, is there upside as maybe you have some of these things that have been a drag fall away and kind of have continued acceleration in cash in some of the businesses, like Variable Annuities and maybe others?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, Alex, yeah, a couple of thoughts on that. First, as I mentioned before, we start from a position of having a very robust capital structure that's able to absorb a lot of the changes that are going through in the industry. So, you have the 2Q assumption updates that we've been through. You have the impact of the tax law change. You'll also have certain regulatory changes occurring that are occurring at the NAIC that are, I think, net chewing away at the RBC ratios of companies. And despite all of that, where we are at the end of the day is, pro forma for all of it, including sort of the full-year anticipated impacts of the Tax Act, we're able to maintain above our currently targeted RBC ratio of 400%. So, we start out in a very strong position.","We also have the benefit of continuing to generate strong cash flow and capital. And so, in the course of the second quarter, just by way of example, while the statutory charge for our Long-Term Care business was \u2013 the increase and the strengthening of reserves in our Long-Term Care business was about $600 million. In other parts of RBC calculation, we actually generated incremental capital that almost entirely offset that reserve strengthening. And we see that dynamic.","And so, if you look at sort of the fullness of this year and even what we've experienced to-date this year, what you're going to find is we have diversified businesses each of which provide robust cash flow and diversified sources of cash flow. So, in the current year, while we're strengthening PICA's reserves in order to respond to the impact from the tax law changes, we are getting from our International business significant free cash flow. We are getting from our PGIM business a very high free cash-flow ratio relevant to the strong earnings that we're generating from that. And as we've highlighted in the deck through the bar charts that we provided, our Annuities business at the current levels of sales is throwing off a significantly high level of free cash flow. And so, we're able to continue to generate free cash flow through the portfolio of businesses that we have and absorb the variety of reserve-strengthening initiatives that we and the industry are facing during the course of this year.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe just to follow-up on the 12% to 13% ROE. How should I think about that near to intermediate-term ROE just in light of maybe the move up in interest rates and sort of the environment? I mean, are we at a point where maybe you could sort of revert back to the 13% to 14% that you guys have targeted historically? Or sort of where do we need to get in terms of rates to achieve that?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Well, I think about it this way. I think, first, as you've seen in our results and observe in the market, interest rates have been rising and that's been beneficial to us and to others in the industry. If you look at what I'll call our adjusted portfolio yields, so adjusting it for taking out the impact of alternatives and for where we've invested in Treasuries as we've waited to take the premiums and reinvest them into Corporates, in the first quarter, our portfolio yield was about 4.3%. If you look at our new money rates in the first quarter, it was about 4.25%. So, we're at the point in time, now, where we're investing is crossing over to our portfolio rate, whereas in the past you would have seen a very large gap between those two numbers.","And so, I think the interest rate environment is rapidly ceasing to be a drag and will be pivoting over toward being actually a positive to earnings growth on a go-forward basis. Now, it took a compounding of several years for it to drag us down from 13% to 14% to our intermediate range of 12% to 13%, and we'll need to see some compounded period of being in that better interest rate environment before you'd expect, on a sustainable basis, our ROE to be in a 13% to 14% range. I would note that if you look at our ROE this quarter, on the sort of \u2013 adjusted for the notable items that we've called out, it's 13.5%. So, while we provided guidance of 12% to 13%, the reality is, in this current environment with the robust performance we're getting out of our businesses, we are actually exceeding that range that we've provided.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","And next, we have the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. On the annuity ROA, it's been 121 basis points for the last two quarters. How much more near-term downside do you expect from the additional hedging actions, or are we mostly complete with that at this point?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Ryan, this is Steve. Maybe I'll jump in and Rob can add on. If you look at Annuities ROA on a year-over-year basis, there was a decline. I'd attribute that to three factors, consistent with what we've spoken about before: first, lower non-coupon earnings driving lower spread results; second, the aging of the book of business and fee compression that gradually results from that; and finally, amortization of hedging costs, as you mentioned. The first of those three factors varies from quarter to quarter. The second and the third, I would say \u2013 there are, obviously, real impacts, but they emerge very, very gradually over time, over an extended time period. So, if you're talking about near-term ROAs, I would say there's sustainability of our ROAs for the near term at our current level. Rob?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","The only thing I'd add to that \u2013 and, Ryan, this may be obvious by virtue of how you asked the question, but just to make sure that it's very clear is that our expected hedging costs are entirely in AOI today. And so, that's built into our AOI. We include the cost of hedging in that.","Secondly, that when we have variances against that expected hedging, so what we call hedge breakage, that works its way into our benefit ratios and, therefore, also is amortized into our AOI. So, full cost of hedging is reflected in AOI over time. And that hedge experience has been generally on the positive side, but call it around neutral. And what you're seeing as a result of that is still a robust level of ROA, as Steve just walked through.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then, the Corporate segment, I know, is volatile, but it's been pretty favorable for a couple of quarters. Has anything changed there or should we expect it to revert back to a higher loss over time?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, our guidance for that, Ryan, has been that \u2013 think about it as being \u2013 and what we said in the past is an average of $350 million a quarter, subject to seasonality. So, obviously, we get the fourth quarter seasonality that we've walked through a number of times in the past.","If you look at the actual average of the last four quarters, it's been slightly below that. So, it averages out around $340 million. And in the first and second quarters driving that because they've been below our run-rate expectations. Each of those quarters benefited by somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million of lower than expected compensation costs, both long-term and deferred, that are associated with market experience including, incidentally, our own stock price performance. The remainder of the variance came from lower net expenses across sort of a whole variety of activities.","So, I think, while that experience \u2013 we can \u2013 it can be sustained, we don't believe that that experience would change our view going forward of what the run rate and seasonality would be. So, we've benefited from it, but not to the point where we would take a different view toward what we've stated in the past with regard to sort of the going forward run rate of the business (57:35).","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, thank you. I guess, following up on Alex's question, if we look at the dividends paid from PALAC year-to-date, it's been about 70% to 75% of AOI. So is this a reasonable way to think about the sustainable cash generation of the Annuities business, and how sensitive is this to the level of sales volumes?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, I would say that the Annuities business is a positive contributor to our overall targeted free cash flow. So, think about our free cash flow, as we've articulated, as being around 65% of our earnings. And at current levels of sales we would expect the Annuities business actually to be reasonably materially in excess of that; and, we believe that that's a sustainable level.","The volatility \u2013 we don't believe that it's particularly volatile on a go forward basis, either. The changes that would occur there would be, as Steve has expressed before, things that would be reflected over a fairly long period of time. We're very well capitalized within that business, and so changes in market conditions and\/or other drivers to the reserves would not alter the level of distributions from free cash flow that we anticipate and are currently getting from the business.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you. And then, yesterday, Fidelity got a fair amount of press coverage for eliminating fees on certain of its index products. Do you see this having implications for pricing in the Asset Management or Defined Contribution retirement businesses more broadly?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Erik, it's Steve. I'll address your question. For some time, we've been very acutely aware of the fact that the most rapid fee compression in the Asset Management business has really been taking place over multiple years within the passive space. And you saw the press coverage yesterday referring to yesterday's move as the race to zero and this being the logical conclusion of it. It's a race that we're not participating in.","Several years ago, we made the strategic decision that we were going to \u2013 that we were not going to compete in the passive space. But even back then, it was a space well-spoken for by a handful of competitors. And instead, we would focus on the long-standing value proposition of our Investment Management business, which is alpha generation, alpha that our clients can use alongside the index exposure that they can draw from passive managers on a cost-effective basis; but, really focusing on our ability to generate alpha through active management.","And the result of that decision, over multiple years, has been that passive assets represent less than 2% of total AUM and well under 1% of total fees. Our fees are based on our generation of alpha, based on the foundation of strong investment performance and strong distribution capabilities, generating attractive flows at stable fee levels, that 22 basis points I mentioned, which has been stable for us now over an extended period of time. And we expect it to remain so.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you. Appreciate the comments.","Operator","At this point, I'll be happy to turn it back to John Strangfeld for any closing remarks","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you very much.

Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning. Welcome to Prudential's expanded third quarter call, covering the third quarter results and our financial outlook for 2013. Slides supporting the financial outlook presentation are available at our Investor Relations website, www.investor.prudential.com.","Representing Prudential today are the usual suspects, John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Rich Carbone, Chief Financial Officer; Charlie Lowrey, Head of Domestic Businesses; Ed Baird, Head of International Businesses; and Peter Sayre, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.","In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the third quarter of 2012, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, in managing our businesses, we use a non-GAAP measurement we call adjusted operating income to measure the performance of our Financial Services businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses as adjusted and related charges and adjustments, as well as results from divested businesses. Adjusted operating income also excludes recorded changes in asset values that are expected to ultimately accrue to contract holders and recorded changes in contract holder liabilities, resulting from changes in related asset values.","Our earnings press release contains information about our definition of adjusted operating income. The comparable GAAP presentation and the reconciliation between the 2 for the quarter are set out in our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website. John?","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Prudential. I'll be reasonably brief to leave more time for Rich and Mark's expanded comments, as well as for your questions. So let me begin.","In the third quarter of last year, EPS, based on operating income, increased for the third quarter of this year 82%, reflecting -- compared to last year, which is a reflection of weak equity market performance last year and favorable equity markets this year. Excluding the effect of market-driven and discrete items, such as DAC unlockings, from the results of each period, earnings per share increased by 17% from $1.49 in the third quarter of 2011 to $1.75 in the third quarter of 2012. On the same basis, our annualized return on equity for the third quarter reached 11.8%.","Core earnings for each of our businesses improved in the last year. In short, our underlying operating performance for this quarter was very solid. We've expanded our call today to give you our outlook for 2013 earnings and ROE. I don't want to front-run much of what Rich and Mark will be telling you, but I will provide a few comments to provide context for their remarks.","Last week, we completed our pension buyout transfer with General Motors. Prudential has received approximately $25 billion in premium from General Motors for the purchase of a group annuity contract, and we have assumed responsibility for approximately 110,000 salaried GM retirees. We're certainly proud to have completed this unprecedented pension transfer agreement with GM. And since we last met, Prudential announced a second large pension transfer agreement, this time, with Verizon. This transaction, which is expected to close next month, covers the transfer of approximately $7.5 billion of pension obligations to Prudential. These transactions speak to our capabilities, our culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, as well as our -- to our financial strength.","On Investor Day last May, we spoke of opportunities for outsized organic growth, that is growth over and above business growth in a normal course. These pension risk transfers transactions exemplify what we had in mind. They represent innovation and scale. They also nicely complement our organic growth in M&A.","Speaking of M&A, late in September, we reached an agreement with the Hartford to acquire its Individual Life business through a reinsurance transaction. We view this acquisition as similar to outsized organic growth because we are accelerating growth that would have taken years to achieve organically. Our financial evaluation of this investment was driven by the value of the in-force block and expense synergies. That said, we believe the acquisition will lead to significant additional financial benefits in terms of new business.","First, we're gaining distribution strength in the bank and wirehouse channels. Second, we're gaining increased scale. Third, we're adding talented people, who make our company stronger, most notably, in product development and sales.","Now we all know that success is not in the announcement but in making it work and proving it out. But as we've shown in the past, most recently with Star\/Edison, we're pretty good at that. As these large transactions demonstrate, capital deployment remains an integral part of managing Prudential to achieve our financial goals, and we recognize the importance of balancing investments in our business with cash dividends and share repurchases to ensure appropriate capital structure and attractive returns. The Hartford transaction is scheduled to close early next year. And as I mentioned, GM pension transfer closed on November 1 and the Verizon pension transfer is expected to close next month.","Now we also declared a cash dividend yesterday of $1.60 per share, a 10% increase from last year, as well as our intention to pay quarterly dividend starting next year. And finally, we repurchased $150 million in common stock last quarter. In combination, these actions will deploy capital between July 2012 and June 2013 as well in excess of the $3 billion we have told you we expected to deploy in that period.","Our strong capital position, liquidity and sound asset quality continue to serve us well. We view them as supportive of our ability to achieve our return on equity objectives. And as Rich will show you in a few minutes, we continue to believe we have a strong prospect of achieving an ROE next year within the range of our stated ROE objective for 2013, which we first announced 3 years ago, of 13% to 14%.","And frankly, for us, it's not just obsession with a mathematical number. To us, the achievement of this is a manifestation and validation of the uniqueness of our business mix, the quality of the businesses that make up that mix and the talent of our people. We take this goal very seriously, and we are intensely focused on both making it happen and making it sustainable. And yet, I'll hasten to add that we'll get there in the right way or we won't get there at all.","With that, I'll stop and turn it over to Rich. Rich Carbone?","Richard J. Carbone","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So last night, we reported common stock earnings per share of $1.53 for the third quarter. That's based on adjusted operating income for the Financial Services business, and this compares to $0.84 per share in the year-ago quarter. Market-driven and discrete items, including the impact of the annual update of actuarial assumptions, which have significant impact this quarter as they did in our last quarter -- or the third quarter of last year, I should say. This year's annual review of actuarial assumptions included reductions in the long-term fixed income and equity returns. While expected returns vary by duration in the U.S. in the fixed income instruments, we reduced our fixed income and returns for longer durations by about 100 basis points and on long-term equity returns by 125 basis points, and that's across the board in all reserves.","In the Annuities business, our annual review of experience and actuarial assumptions, giving effect to lower assumed long-term returns and other refinements, resulted in a charge related to guaranteed minimum debt and income benefits and DAC that was offset by the third quarter favorable equity market performance, resulting in a $0.07 per share charge.","In Retirement, a write-off of intangible assets related to a business we acquired in 2008, together with an unlocking based on the annual review of experience and assumptions, resulted in a $0.05 per share charge.","In our Individual Life and Group Insurance business, the annual -- review resulted in a $0.03 per share charge.","In International, results for our Life Planner business benefited $0.03 per share from our annual review. Also in International Insurance, Gibraltar Life benefited $0.08 per share from a partial sale of our indirect investment in China Pacific Life. This benefit was partially offset by integration cost of $0.05 per share relating to the Star and Edison acquisition.","And finally, Corporate and Other results included an $0.11 per share charge to strengthen reserves related to certain of our pre-demutualization policyholder obligations, driven by the annual actuarial assumption update, as well as an additional $0.02 per share charge to write off some bond issuance costs on debt we redeemed prior to maturity.","In total, the items I just mentioned had an unfavorable impact of about $0.22 per share on the third quarter results. Our results in the year-ago quarter included net charges of about $0.65 per share from a number of items, mainly driven by negative unlockings related to the 14% decline in the S&P 500.","Taking these items out of both the current and year-ago quarters, the EPS comparison would be $1.75 for the current quarter versus $1.49 a year ago, a 17% increase driven by organic business results and the realization of cost savings from the Star\/Edison acquisition. And Mark will discuss our business results in more detail in a few moments.","Now moving onto the GAAP results of the Financial Services business. We reported a net loss of $661 million or $1.41 per share for the third quarter. This compares to net income of $1.6 billion or $3.18 per share a year ago. The GAAP net loss for the quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $1.3 billion pretax. This compares to $1.8 billion of pre-tax net realized investment gains in the year-ago quarter.","The $1.3 billion current quarter net realized loss can be broken down into 3 pieces: First, we recorded $684 million of net losses from product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activities, largely driven by changes in our assumptions for mortality behavior and -- for policyholder behavior and mortality that affected the annuity living benefit liability. Second, we recorded $521 million of losses from asset and liability value changes, driven largely by currency fluctuations. These currency-driven losses primarily represent changes in the value of non-yen liabilities related to products on the books of our Japanese companies, whose functional currency is yen, and that's what's important here.","As I've explained in the past, when the yen weakens in relation to currencies underlying these products, we'll record a loss in the income statement for the increase in these liabilities as measured in yen. That part is okay because it will take more yen to pay them off. However, we consider this noneconomic because the liabilities are appropriately matched with investments in the currencies, in which they will be settled, whose value went up in yen terms, as well and in equal amount to the decline or to -- excuse me, to the increase in the liability. The loss in the income statement is offset in AOCI where the revaluation of the asset sits, not through the P&L. With the end result that GAAP equity is essentially unaffected despite the volatility in reported net income. And third, we recorded $107 million of impairments and credit losses. The current quarter net loss also reflects a $685 million pretax loss from a divested business, a business that we divested during the quarter, driven almost entirely by our annual update of actuarial assumptions applicable to our long-term care business, including loan -- including lower long term interest rates.","Book value per share, on a GAAP basis, amounted to $79.51 at the end of the quarter, and this compares to $69.07 at year end. At the end of the quarter, gross unrealized losses of general account fixed income maturities stood at $2.4 billion, and we're in a net realized gain position of roughly $18 billion.","Excluding AOCI, book value per share amounted to $59.35 as of the end of the third quarter compared to $52 -- $58.02 at year end. For Prudential Insurance giving effect of statutory results and $600 million of dividends paid during the quarter for the 9 months of the year, we estimate the RBC remains above our 400% threshold as of the end of the third quarter.","I will discuss our capital position later on as part of our financial outlook. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier","Thanks, John and Rich, and good morning, good afternoon or good evening. I'll start with our U.S. businesses. Our Annuity business reported adjusted operating income of $207 million for the third quarter compared to a loss of $192 million a year ago. The reserve true-ups and DAC unlocking that Rich mentioned had a net unfavorable impact of $48 million on current quarter results. This net impact included a charge of $106 million, reflecting the annual update of our actuarial assumptions, mainly driven by reductions in the assumed long-term rates of return we apply in projecting growth of consumer account values. This charge was partly offset by a benefit of $58 million from favorable market performance in comparison to our assumptions, largely driven by the 6% increase in the S&P 500 for the current quarter.","Results for the year-ago quarter included a net charge of $421 million from an unfavorable DAC unlocking and reserve true-ups, largely driven by unfavorable equity market performance. Stripping out the unlockings and true-ups, annuity results were $255 million for the current quarter compared to $229 million a year ago for a $26 million increase. This increase, in what I would think of as baseline results, was driven by higher fees, reflecting growth in variable annuity account values, including the benefit of $13 billion of net flows over the past year.","Our gross variable annuity sales for the quarter were $5.9 billion, up from $4.5 billion a year ago. In August, we launched our new variable annuity product, HDI 2.0. We're starting to sound like Microsoft. This product increased our rider fee to 100 basis points on individual contracts and 110 basis points on spousal contracts from 95 basis points on our earlier HDI product. The new product also increased the minimum issue age by 5 years to age 50 and reduced the payout rate from 5% to 4% for the age 59.5 to 65 band. HDI 2.0 continues our successful highest daily value proposition, backed by auto-rebalancing tailored to the risk profile of each individual contract.","We also took other actions over the summer to improve the risk profile and enhance return prospects on new business and enforce contracts. These actions included the withdrawal in July of our X shares or bonus product and our suspension commencing in September of acceptance of subsequent premium payments on generations of highest daily products earlier than the HDA -- HDI product that we introduced early last year. We estimated about $500 million of current quarter gross sales came from acceleration of subsequent premium payments on in-force contracts in advance of that suspension. Adjusting for that and perhaps some uptick in sales in advance of our product change, sales in the current quarter were roughly in line with our average of about $5 billion per quarter since we introduced the HDI product.","The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $110 million for the current quarter compared to $111 million a year ago. Current quarter results included $29 million charge to write off intangible assets relating to a business we acquired in 2008 and a charge of $13 million from updating of DAC and other amortization items based on our annual review. Results for the year-ago quarter included a charge of $24 million, reflecting a similar annual review.","Stripping these items out of the comparison, results for the Retirement business are up $17 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from a greater contribution from net investment results. Crediting rate reductions we've implemented on our Full Service Stable Value business in January and July of this year, together with more favorable results from non-coupon asset classes, more than offset the impact of lower reinvestment yields over the course of the past year and the loss of spread income on bank deposits we transferred to third parties in connection with our decision to restructure our savings and loan to a trust-only organization.","The benefits of current quarter results from higher fees, driven by account value growth in the Institutional Investment Products, was largely offset by a lower contribution of about $10 million from mortality-driven case experience on our traditional retirement products.","Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $6.4 billion for the quarter compared to $9.5 billion a year ago. The decrease is mainly a result of lower current quarter standalone sales of stable value wrap products to plan sponsors and fund managers, which contributed $2.5 billion in the current quarter and $5.1 billion in the year-ago quarter to sales of our Institutional Investment Products. These sales are mainly driven by large case business and tend to be lumpy from one quarter to another.","Full Service Retirement gross deposits and sales were $3.5 billion in the current quarter compared to $4 billion a year ago. We continue to see limited activity in the mid-to-large case market, which is our major focus. Overall, net additions for the Retirement business were about $800 million for the quarter, and the cap values passed the $250 billion milestone as of the end of the quarter, up 17% from a year ago.","Last week, we announced the closing of our pension risk transfer transaction with General Motors, which will bring us approximately $25 billion of group annuity account values, representing the transfer of benefit obligations for 110,000 salaried retirees from GM's pension plan to Prudential. This transaction and the approximately $7.5 billion Verizon pension risk transfer transaction, which is expected to close in December, are building our leadership position in a market where we see great potential and an excellent fit for our skills in managing group annuity, where we have a track record of more than 80 years.","The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $187 million for the current quarter compared to $123 million a year ago. While the segment's basic earnings come from asset management fees, the increase in results in relation to the year-ago quarter was mainly driven by a $55 million greater contribution from what we call other related revenues. This bucket encompasses results from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, which are variable in nature and partly driven by changing valuations and the timing of the transactions. In total, these activities produced pre-tax income of $71 million in the current quarter compared to $16 million in the year-ago quarter. The greater contribution from these activities came mainly from more favorable performance of fixed income and real estate funds.","Stripping out our results from activities that come under the heading of other related revenues, the Asset Management business produced adjusted operating income of $116 million in the current quarter compared to $107 million a year ago. The increase reflects higher asset management fees driven by growth in assets under management, net of higher expenses in the current quarter. The segment's assets under management stood at $670 billion as of the end of the quarter, up $71 billion or 12% from a year earlier. Adjusted operating income for our Individual Life Insurance business was $112 million for the current quarter compared to $111 million a year ago.","Current quarter results included charge of $27 million from an unlocking of DAC and other items resulting from our annual actuarial review, driven mainly by our reductions in assumed long-term rates of return for fixed income investments and equities. Results for the year-ago quarter benefited by $27 million from a favorable unlocking based on the annual review.","Stripping these items from the comparison, results from Individual Life increased by $55 million from a year ago. The increase reflected more favorable mortality experience in the current quarter, as well as charges of about $15 million in the year-ago quarter to accelerate amortization of DAC due to unfavorable separate account performance linked to the decline in the S&P 500.","Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $98 million for the current quarter, up from $70 million a year ago. The increase was driven by strong current quarter universal life sales through third-party distribution and reflects our improved competitive position as some key competitors have recently raised rates, bringing their pricing more in line with our premium rates, which we increased several years ago. We expect our universal life products to remain competitive following further price increases we implemented last month.","Our acquisition of Hartford's Individual Life Insurance business, expected to close early next year, represents a rare market opportunity to bring high-quality business onto the books with appropriate returns, accelerating growth that might have been achieved organically over a period of years, along with offering potential expense synergies that we believe are clearly achievable. We are also gaining distribution strength in the bank and wirehouse channels that will contribute to organic growth going forward.","The Group Insurance business reported adjusted operating income of $35 million in the current quarter compared to $45 million a year ago. Current quarter results benefited by $7 million from refinements in Group life and Disability reserves, reflecting our annual review, while results for the year-ago quarter benefited by $22 million from a similar review.","Stripping the reserve refinements out of the comparison, Group Insurance results are up $5 million from a year ago. [Audio Gap] Less favorable group life underwriting results.","Group Insurance sales for the quarter were $46 million compared to $40 million a year ago. Most of our Group Insurance sales are recorded in the first quarter based on the effective date of the business. We are taking significant actions to enhance our return prospects in Group Insurance. We announced our exit from the long-term care insurance market in July and are focusing on our core group life and disability coverages, where we are exercising pricing discipline on new business and as cases come up for renewal.","Turning to our International businesses. Gibraltar Life's adjusted operating income was $390 million in the current quarter compared to $329 million a year ago. As Rich mentioned, Gibraltar's current quarter results include income of $60 million from the partial sale of our investment in China Pacific Group by the Carlyle consortium. As of the end of the quarter, our remaining investment in China Pacific had market appreciation of about $50 million, which is included in the net unrealized gains on our balance sheet.","Going the other way, Gibraltar's results for the current quarter absorbed $34 million of integration costs for the Star and Edison acquisitions. With all major aspects of the business integration completed or nearing completion, we currently estimate that total integration cost will be below $450 million, with about $300 million incurred through the end of the third quarter and $10 million to $15 million expected for the remainder of the year.","Results for the year-ago quarter included income of $84 million from a partial sale of our investment in China Pacific and absorption of $43 million of integration costs. Excluding the China Pacific gains and integration costs, Gibraltar's adjusted operating income was $364 million for the current quarter, up $76 million from a year ago. The increase reflects business growth and cost savings from Star and Edison integration synergies.","Current quarter results reflect about $40 million of cost savings achieved thus far as a result of the business integration compared to about $500 million of early saves that benefited the year-ago quarter. We remain well on track to achieve our targeted annual cost savings of about $250 million after the business integration is completed. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of our hedging program, contributed $13 million to the increase in earnings from a year ago.","Our Life Planner business reported adjusted operating income of $393 million for the current quarter compared to $331 million a year ago. Current quarter results benefited by $20 million from refinements of reserves and other items reflecting our annual review. Excluding the impact of these refinements, Life Planner results are up $42 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from continued business growth.","On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up","8% from a year ago. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates contributed $14 million to the increase in earnings in the Life Planner business from a year ago.","International Insurance sales, on a constant dollar basis, amounted to $900 million for the third quarter compared to $810 million a year ago. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $636 million in the current quarter compared to $537 million a year ago. Current quarter sales reflect accelerated purchases of our Single Premium yen-based whole life bank channel product, which amounted to $311 million in the current quarter compared to $29 million a year ago. This sales surge reflected recent actions by competitors, which limited the alternatives available to bank customers with significant funds available for investment in life insurance products. In order to limit our concentration in this product and maintain appropriate returns, we have taken actions to limit monthly sales of the bank Single Premium yen product through December of this year to roughly the pace of the third quarter, and we will be implementing a crediting rate reduction thereafter.","Although our sales numbers count the Single Premiums we received at 10%, based on industry practice for recording annualized new business, they are reflected at 100% in our income statement, with an offset in reserves that we include in insurance and annuity benefits. These sales added about $3 billion to both premiums and the benefits line in the current quarter, distorting ratios that some of you may calculate.","Excluding the bank channel Single Premium product, Gibraltar's current quarter sales were $325 million compared to $508 million a year ago. The decrease reflected acceleration of sales in the first half of the year, as we anticipated, due to a tax law change in April that affected our cancer whole life product and due to crediting rate reductions we implemented in the second quarter for our U.S. dollar retirement and whole life products.","Life planner sales were $264 million in the current quarter compared to $273 million a year ago. Sales by Life Planners in Japan amounted to $171 million, down $27 million from a year ago. This reflected decreases of $23 million from U.S. dollar retirement income and whole life products and $16 million from our cancer whole life product, reflecting the acceleration of sales into the earlier part of this year due to the tax law change and our crediting rate reductions.","Life Planner sales outside of Japan were up by $18 million or 24% from a year ago, reflecting higher sales in Korea and several other markets. Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $452 million for the current quarter compared to a $349 million loss a year ago. As Rich mentioned, the current quarter loss includes a $78 million charge to strengthen reserves based on our annual actuarial review for obligations we retained to pre-demutualization policyholders and a $16 million charge to write off bond issue cost for debt that we redeemed prior to maturity.","In the year-ago quarter, we absorbed charges of $99 million to increase reserves for estimated death claims based on applying new matching criteria to the Social Security Death File and charges of $20 million for a contribution to be made to an insurance industry insolvency fund. Excluding these items, the Corporate and Other loss was $358 million in the current quarter compared to $230 million a year ago. The greater loss in the current quarter was mainly a result of higher expenses, including some non-linear items such as employee benefit costs and advertising and higher interest costs, mainly reflecting our deployment of capital debt in our businesses.","To sum up, I would say that our current quarter results reflect strong business performance virtually across the board and that we are in a solid position to achieve the goals that Rich will talk about shortly. Our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Asset Management businesses are continuing to benefit from growth of our base of fee generating businesses. Current quarter results also benefited from more favorable investment results in the Retirement business and a greater contribution from activities that complement our main focus on recurring fees and asset management. Our prospects in Retirement are enhanced by our leading position in the pension risk transfer market, where we recently announced 2 major groundbreaking transactions that will contribute to our future results.","Underlying results for our U.S. Protection businesses benefited from more favorable mortality in Individual Life and a greater contribution from investment results in Group Insurance. We will strengthen our Individual Life business with our acquisition of Hartford's business expected to close early next year. This acquisition will bring us a high-quality bloc of business, market-leading distribution in key channels and a strong pool of talent. In Group Insurance, we're taking actions to enhance return prospects through a focus on our core Group Life and Disability businesses and pricing discipline.","Our International businesses continue to perform well, benefiting from sustained growth, driven by multiple distribution channels and cost savings from business integration synergies on track with our targets.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Rich. Rich?","Richard J. Carbone","Okay. Let me give everybody a minute to get out their decks. So get on that line. Get their iPads warmed up. And we'll take you through the 2013 guidance. All right.","On Slide 4, you'll see the items that should help you understand how 2013 may unfold. First, we need to develop a starting point, a baseline 2012, which includes an accounting change in the fourth quarter of this year for pensions. And I'll discuss that in detail in a moment.","We are assuming the S&P ends 2012 with 1,425 and appreciates at 6% in '13, and that's a change from our traditional 8% assumption, resulting in an average S&P of 1,470 for 2013 that will drive our fee income.","In 2013, the yen is hedged at 80 versus 85 in 2012, and the won is hedged at 1,160 versus 1,180 in 2012. So they're going in opposite directions. We have assumed that interest rates will follow the forward curve with a 10-year treasury beginning 2013 at 1.73% and rising to 1.94% by 12\/31\/13. Obviously, we invest in spreads above that, mainly in the A and AAA space or around the board there. We're doing a little better in our private placements.","We expect a higher tax rate as the result of higher earnings as the relative portion -- proportion of tax preference items to taxable income declines. Leverage will remain at around 25% debt-to-capital. And lastly, the major transactions in pension risk transfer, Hartford and Star\/Edison contribute substantially to 2013 earnings.","Slide 5. That summarizes the impact of the items I just mentioned in somewhat of a graphic form, so let's walk through it. We'll start with our reported AOI EPS for the first 9 months, and that should total $4.41. Adding back to our reported AOI, the onetimers or unusual items, that Eric and I and Mark have called out throughout the year, gets us to a normalized 9-months EPS of $4.74. We then add the impact of a pension accounting change.","Now here goes with the explanation of that. Every year, we update our pension assumptions, such as the discount rate and the expected return on the plan assets, and that's the discount rate on the liability. This year, we also plan on making a change to our pension accounting to remove the smoothing of the return on fixed income assets. This change is to a preferable method of accounting under GAAP that better aligns the interest rate sensitivities of the fixed income assets with the pension liability, thereby mitigating a revenue and expense disconnect. That has about a $0.22 per share impact on 2012 results. Though that will be spread amongst the whole year, we will restate the first 3 quarters for that, and the fourth quarter will contain 1 quarter of that impact.","Adding an estimate for the fourth quarter results including that 1 quarter's impact of pension gets us to EPS for 2012. This baseline estimate, on a normalized basis and including the pension accounting change, is the starting point to build to, to get to 2013. As you can see, without providing numbers for the fourth quarter estimate or the baseline 2012, we simply are not comfortable in providing a single quarter's estimate.","Okay. Starting from there, we'd add the U.S. and international growth, income from the risk transfer -- the pension risk transfer transactions in the Hartford acquisition, then adjust the denominator for capital activities that I will discuss later on, we expect 2013 normalized AOI EPS to range from $7.70 to $8.10. Reported EPS, on an AOI basis, puts in Hartford or takes out Hartford integration costs and Star\/Edison integration costs and is estimated at $7.50 to $7.90.","Slide 6. Slide 6 shows our capital view at year end. While not on the slide, capital capacity at 9\/30\/12 was $4 billion to $4.5 billion, about the same as 6\/30\/12. Approximately $2 billion of which was readily deployable. The 2 pension risk transfer transactions, the statutory impact of the LPC [ph] third quarter reserve, which will be reflected in our year-end asset adequacy testing reserves and our annual shareholder dividend take capacity down to around $2 billion to 2.5 billion at 12\/31. Over 1\/2 of which, however, is readily deployable. So readily deployable was not depleted as much as the total capital on a proportional basis. You'll also see these impacts in our year-end PICA RBC, which is estimated to be above 400%.","Now moving onto ROE. Slide 7 notes the items impacting both the numerator and the denominator, and that little fuzzy line in between is trying to delineate which is which, but we all know that these things leak into both the numerator and the denominator. Income is obviously dependent on meeting the organic growth plans. Interest rates rising modestly to the forward rates I just mentioned. The 6% appreciation in the S&P, and the integration of Hartford Life. The denominator we used in our estimate, which can cause some mischief, as we all know -- but the denominator we used in the estimates for average equity simply took our 9\/30\/12 FSB equity of $27.7 billion and rolls forward earnings and plan capital actions from 9\/30\/12 to 12\/31\/13. As a result of the Hartford acquisition and the pension transactions and our desire to reduce overall leverage below 25%, of the $1 billion of share repurchases authorized under the current plan, we assume repurchases of $400 million. This would be $250 million more than the $150 million we purchased in the third quarter.","Slide 8. Slide 8 rolls 2012's ROE into '13. AOI increases for both organic growth and capital deployment, the acquisition of Hartford and the execution of the 2 historic pension risk transfer transactions. Additional capital management activities will adjust the denominator. And ignoring the accounting noise from FX and whatever else goes on in accounting, ROE for 2013 will range from 12.5% to 13.1% from normalized results. Put in the effects, positive and the negative, of the known onetime items -- and I guess these are both negatives like the -- unlike the known unknowns from Rumsfeld's day, like Hartford and Star\/Edison, integration costs resulted in a reported ROE of 12.2% to 12.8%.","And finally, and unfortunately, we can't predict the outcome on the regulatory front, particularly around the non-bank SIFI impact. We've disclosed that we are in a stage 3 evaluation and continues to have really constructed dialogue with our regulators around the significant differences between insurance and banks. And I want to make one other point. It is a judicious process. Everybody is listening on both sides.","And now, I'll turn the question over to Mark -- to everybody, I'd like to turn it.","John Robert Strangfeld","So we'll open to questions.","Mark B. Grier","This is Mark. Just one quick correction. I'm advised by my colleagues that I misspoke with respect to year-ago Star\/Edison synergies. It wasn't $500 million, it was 5. Maybe a little wishful thinking in there.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","First, I just wanted to make a couple of clarifications. Can you just repeat the share repurchase assumption? I think I didn't fully understand the assumption that you guys were using.","Richard J. Carbone","Okay. We had a $1 billion authorization. We purchased the $150 million in the third quarter, and we are going to purchase another $250 million over the next several months through June 30, 2013 for a total of $400 million.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And then does the plan -- and then presumably, there could be something in additional, post mid-year in 2013?","Richard J. Carbone","That will have to go to the Board at that time, and it depends on their approval.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And then, turning to the Hartford Life deal, we know that you're paying a $600 million seeding commission. Can you talk about how much additional capital will be required to support that business? And how do you expect your expense synergies to merge over the next couple of years?","Mark B. Grier","John, you want to take the expense? And I'll take...","John Robert Strangfeld","I'll take the capital base. Let me do that first. Let me do the capital piece first. That capital is going to -- the capital that we're going to get to pay for Hartford is coming from the reduction in the buybacks. So the capital capacity we're paying is relatively unchanged as a result.","Mark B. Grier","But I think Ryan was asking a different question. He was asking how much over and above the 615 [ph] we intended to put in, in support of the acquisition. That's the number that we're not prepared to give you today nor are we prepared to give you the expense synergies today.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And -- all right. Maybe just one more quick one. That pension accounting change -- so I should think about the accounting change as adding $0.22 to your operating EPS definition for 2012 versus what was previously recorded?","Richard J. Carbone","That is correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just -- okay. I totally got it in a different way. The pension accounting change adds to earnings, adds to the baseline for 2012?","Richard J. Carbone","That's correct. Yes.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And is it expected to have a similar effect for 2013?","Richard J. Carbone","Yes.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- I wanted to move away from this. I just want to talk about Gibraltar. Numbers have kind of been all over the place because of various different items having gone through the quarter. Do you guys -- when you back out everything, are you guys thinking now that this is probably a decent run rate on Gibraltar? Or is there some over earning may be going on or under earning that wasn't really pointed out?","Edward P. Baird","Are you speaking about earnings or sales?","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Earnings, Ed.","Edward P. Baird","On the earnings side, I think what you're starting to see here is what we had forecasted, which is you're starting to see the improvements taking place in terms of the expense savings coming into play here. You're also getting improvement coming from the growth of the business. So aside from onetimers, of which the third quarter does have some because of annual adjustments, you do have a steady improvement taking place as this business grows and gets the expense savings.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one more, if I may. I know you're not really ready to talk about SIFI stuff. But, John, I think you made the assumption in the -- at the Investor Day that you didn't expect anything SIFI-wise really to come down and affect you until 2014. I'm wondering if -- what your thoughts are on that right now?","Mark B. Grier","Well, as you know, we're in the midst of the process right now, reviewing the designation question. We're in stage 3 of that process, which is interactive, involving the company and a variety of regulators and FSOC staff. I guess relative to what we thought at the beginning of the summer, the process is moving more quickly. They have set more ambitious deadlines and targets and objectives for addressing the designation process. However, the loose end there relates to the question of capital standards and solvency and risk regime if we are designated as a SIFI. And that process is more uncertain. It's possible that we could go through the designation process without having a resolution of the capital and solvency regime question. And so, I would still, I guess, convey some uncertainty around the timing of knowing, understanding and implementing whatever capital insolvency rules might arise if we are designated a SIFI. So while designation is -- may be moving more quickly, although that's a process that, as Rich said, is an earnest and hard-working process with good quality, give-and-take, the issue of standards is still highly uncertain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one question. So in your discussion of the DAC unlockings, you indicated that -- I think you said that you have lowered your expectation for long-term equity returns. Two-part question, what do we mean by the long term over each of the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years? And why do you think that the common stocks will permanently produce -- and that's a pretty heavy thing to say that common stocks will permanently produce a lower rate of return than you had anticipated, why do you think that's the case?","Mark B. Grier","Eric, it's Mark. With respect to the time horizon for the assumptions, it reflects the duration of the products. So where we need a 30-year assumption, we have a 30-year assumption that reflects the decrease in expected returns that we just talked about. So that long-term assumption is over the life of the underlying products. And by the way, it is stable over the lifetime. We extrapolate the returns from 4 years to 10 years to 26 years or whatever we need. With respect to the question about why lower returns, I think, at 40,000 feet, maintaining a reasonable relationship between fixed income returns and equity returns is appropriate. The risk premium in the market tends to be, over a long period of time, fairly durable and we're reflecting in our assumptions now interest rates lower by 100 basis points. And so, coincident with the broader return picture and relative return relationships, it seems appropriate to reconsider the equity return as well, otherwise we'd be widening the gap and probably distorting some of our reserve entries, where we're more heavily dependent on equity assumptions. It may be viewed as conservative, but we would certainly view it as appropriate.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No, I got it. That's very clear. Actually, one quick related follow-up. When you talk about your expected return to fixed income, do you mean the coupon income or do you mean the total return to the investor from investing in a bond?","Mark B. Grier","It's generally total return to investor because, ultimately, what matters here is the accumulation of assets either in our general account where we support a product or in a separate account where the client owns the asset.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question about Slide 6, the 12\/31\/2012 projected numbers. Given HIG Hartford Life is closing in the first quarter, I'm assuming it's not in these numbers, is that correct?","Richard J. Carbone","That's correct.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So in terms of the capital that you plan to use to back that -- I know you're not going to give us the amount, but which bucket should we take it out of? I mean, is it coming out of the readily deployable capital or the on balance sheet capital?","Richard J. Carbone","Well, what's going to happen is it's going to go in the required equity, required capital up at the top. And then, it's going to -- what's going to happen is we're going to have attributed equity go up through -- due to earnings, and then we're going to go serve on the buybacks, so the buybacks will not deplete the attributed equity. And at the end of it all, I think it'll even out.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, similar question in terms of the RBC ratio. You're saying above 400% for year-end 2012, but if we put Hartford Life in here, I mean, is that number going to be still be above 400% as your -- is that your expectation?","Richard J. Carbone","Yes, because the capital that was going to be used to buyback stocks will remain in a FICA or be sent down to FICA.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess my second question is on the non-bank SIFI. Maybe just asking it in a slightly different way, I get everything you're saying in terms of the uncertainty and things are constantly moving. But with that as a given, meaning things are uncertain, how did you get comfortable adding what looks to be $39 billion of general account assets? If I take the GM pension, the Verizon and then the Hartford Life, it seems like that's a pretty big amount of assets coming on, where there might be some uncertainty around the capital required to back that. So how did you get comfortable with that?","Mark B. Grier","We got comfortable, I guess -- or maybe the way you're asking it, in 2 -- sort of in 2 worlds. One is, with respect to where we are today, we apply a pretty sharp-penciled analysis to the economics of these transactions, and we're very careful about understanding the risk dynamics and concept of economic capital that we believe is consistent with what you guys as investors would expect and demand on these products. From there, in terms of the current picture, we also look very closely at the statutory impact then we look very closely at the GAAP impact. So there are 3 prongs, 3 different levels to the static question about the way that fits our books and where we have to be comfortable, and the answer is we have to be comfortable with all 3. Then looking at the question of SIFI-ness and the possibility of operating in a different capital regime and what this may mean, we have had a view that we're well run and well capitalized and doing the right things with respect to both risk and balance sheet, and that we'll address SIFI standards and issues around whatever insolvency and capital regime we face at the time that, that's actually settled. And as we pointed out, we generate a lot of capital. If we have to do something different in order to satisfy a new requirement, we believe that we have the capacity and flexibility to address those issues.","John Robert Strangfeld","And this is John. Suneet, I'd like to add on to that. Actually, not the question you asked but I think providing a better context around how we think about pension risk transfer as an important thing to do because I don't think we've really done that in a setting like this other than focusing on individual transactions. So let me just take a moment. And then, if there's a second part of your question, we'll come back to it. But let me just take a moment to talk about this a little because innovation of a scale of this magnitude is rare. And from our point of view, this is a wonderful complement to organic growth in M&A, and some context around it is, I think, is useful. This did not arise because of some sort of opportunistic flash in the pan that came in over the transom and nor is this is a kind of business that's simply driven by the sleight of hand and structuring or pricing. In our case, what we did is we established a dedicated PRT, pension risk transfer team as an R&D project in 2007. We saw some interesting macro forces. We thought we were well positioned for a whole variety of reasons. And frankly, we continue to invest in [ph] it and right through the financial crisis. And the reason for that is we thought that there are a lot of good reasons why we would have the opportunity to be well positioned to take advantage of this. And in a sense, this type of opportunity is just the opposite of a commodity. It's complex, it's big, it's multidimensional and high-value added. And while it may be less obvious to the outsider -- to the client, it's just best done by those who have businesses and cultures that do a really good job of interweaving different disciplines. And what I'm talking about there are things like actuarial investment business, legal, administration and asset management skills. It's not easy for people to do this or to replicate it. And furthermore, it's not only about the pricing. It's about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution and doing it on a timely basis as GM has been quite focused upon and Verizon will be as well. I think you'll find -- for those who are thinking about this area and trying to put in some context, I think you'd find that we have very good marks for this in the industry. And I actually doubt that anyone else -- any other insurer, at least, has started in early -- as early or invested as heavily as we have in this era. So I think this is what explains both our interest in this area and I think what explains our early successes and market-leading position. Now when you back, back to the financials of this, just to complete the picture, what this produces is a stable earnings stream with moderate market sensitivity. It's consistent with our 13%-plus ROE goal. It involves risks that we know and manage well, and it doesn't have onetime costs or synergy phase-ins that are normally associated with a large outsized activity. And when we look at this from a multi-year context, when you think about what we've done post crisis, whether it's a strong organic growth, whether it's the well-executed M&A like Star\/Edison and, prospectively, Hartford, and then the addition of the outsized organic growth on PRT, we really think this is probably the best business portfolio we've ever had in terms of an attractive balance of growth, stability and sustainability. So that's how we're thinking in the broadest terms about PRT, the role it plays and our thinking perspectively. And I understand that wasn't exactly to your question, but it felt like there's an opportunity here for me to speak to that.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","No, that's helpful.","Richard J. Carbone","I would just like to add one other point because I know there's a lot of folklore running around in the street. The capital that we hold against this product is significantly in excess of capital that we hold against similar products, such as Stable Value, GICs and Group Annuities. So the -- we went back and we lost just a proportion of capital we have traditionally held against these products, these 2 transactions hold per capital at a higher level.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm sorry, did you say the capital is higher or lower?","Richard J. Carbone","Higher.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, just as you think about the returns on this business, I know you've said it's accretive to your ROE objectives. I'm not sure what that means if the capital is currently earning very little. So can you put some parameters around what, sort of, return you'd expect?","Mark B. Grier","Yes. When I was talking about the first answer I gave, the idea of a pretty sharp pencil and a careful look at risk adjustment returns and the performance of these products is very much true. We work hard to make sure that we understand the right capital and the right risk return picture here. And while we've talked about this in the context of our stated objectives and made the observation that these transactions are accretive to our objective relative to where we are without them and consistent with the goals that we've set, they are also consistent with what we believe to be the real economics of the transactions. These are sophisticated counterparties. Everybody is doing their homework and looking carefully from both sides at how these happens. And we recognize the discipline of the market to make sure that our economics are fully justified, and we believe they are, but I think what that also means is that if this were a stand-alone company starting up, doing these deals, you would invest in it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So first, I just had a question on your ROE. As I think about the 13% to 14% target, you're getting there if you use the top end of the range, but there are items in there in your guidance that we wouldn't have, like, really expected previously. There is the pension accounting change, the book value hasn't grown as much as you would have thought, given the charges, and I don't think all of the charges would -- were expected at the beginning of the year. So if I adjust for these, the is ROE still getting better but not as much as you would have assumed previously. So my question was just on, what do you believe are the key drivers of that? Is the performance in some of the businesses falling short? Or is it the macro environment, or is it something else? And then secondly, on your -- in the Gibraltar business, you had pretty strong sales of single-premium, whole life policies. And that -- obviously, your capping production levels in the fourth quarter lowering crediting rates next year, I mean, just how comfortable are you with the margins and returns on the business that you've sold over the past few months?","Mark B. Grier","Jimmy, it's Mark. Let me start off on your first one. We set this goal several years ago. And almost everything is different. And we knew when we set it that we were putting a stake in the ground around the earnings power of the company, but we were not putting a stake in the ground around every line item that was going to get us there. And over a period of several years, we know that almost everything is going to turn out to be different. In fact, we faced substantial headwinds with respect to the level of interest rates, and the cumulative impact of that, by the way, is larger than the impact of either of the items that you mentioned. And so our view is not to parse line items and try to reconstruct the -- either each assumption and the way in which that has come through or individual line items on our income statement and balance sheet and the way in which they have evolved in the context of what's come true relative to assumptions. I think the idea at a time was a reflection of our earnings power in a variety of circumstances. And we believe that, as you correctly point out, we made substantial progress, we are differentiated from the pack with respect to our level of returns and we're certainly within an eyelash of being totally consistent, at least in the aggregate, with the objectives that we've set. So I think you can look at the headwinds and look at the negatives and look at the positives, but our view is that we're doing what we said we were going to do under pretty difficult conditions. And you mentioned the macro environment, that would be the biggest one.","Richard J. Carbone","And Jimmy, the guide in volatility and returns on Gibraltar. Just a quick reminder: In terms of the volatility issue, we have 3 different distribution systems going on inside Gibraltar now. We have the traditional life consultant, we have the bank channel and we have the independent agent. Those last 2 are very spreadsheet-oriented, third-party kinds of supplemental businesses. So you're going to see a lot of volatility, as we've discussed in Investor Day, in those 2, less so on the life consultant one. Although for, frankly, even there for the next couple of years, you'll see more volatility than you have historically or that you will when we finish Prudential-izing the Star and Edison sales organizations. So just to the first point, unlike POJ and Life Planner, inside Gibraltar, for the next couple of years, we will see more volatility in results permanently in the third party but, in the short term, also in the life consultants. And specifically on the Single Premium product, which as you point out, was a primary driver of the bank channel, which is really what it's limited to it, it's not much of a factor outside of that, but inside the bank channel, it really dominated the quarter primarily because, as Mark pointed out in his opening comments, a lot of the competitors have been pulling back for more aggressive either plan designs, product designs or the rate setting. So there, it's gone up a fair bit. The challenge with that part, because it's Single Premium, it's much more sensitive to the interest rate market, so we applied a few techniques there that we don't apply anywhere else. One is we do adjust the crediting rates, but those, obviously, you can't move every time the interest rate market moves. So we will moderate as time goes on with that, as was pointed out. But secondly, we also, in this product can manage the sales volume by channel, so we will limit some of the sales. And the third is we also look at commissions, so we can lower commissions over time both to dampen the sales if we think it's disproportionate and also to improve the profitability. So all 3 of those will be active factors. In general, we're pretty comfortable that, while it's at the lower end of our target range at the moment, as interest rates move up, it will be better. But then on average, it's -- we're comfortable with it as part of the portfolio. For example, while it's high in this quarter, year-to-date, it's less than 20% of our sales, which I think is a key fact to keep in mind unlike some of the competitors who concentrate or are even limited to third party. For us, this is simply part of a supplemental distribution.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe if I could ask just one more of Charlie. In the disability business, margins are still pretty depressed but you've seen a couple of quarters of improvement now, so just what's your expectations for that business? And as you are raising prices, what do you see in the market in terms of competitor behavior? Is the pricing environment overall getting better or is it not?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","I think it's still, on the disability side, relatively competitive, but we do see pricing going up. We are certainly raising pricing consistent with what we've said before. So while we're not pleased with the overall number yet in disability, we're pleased that our efforts are beginning to have some tractions. We've had 4 quarters of declining benefit ratio. It's not back to the 88% to 92% that we're -- that is the -- is where we wanted to be. But what we said on Investor Day is that we're taking aggressive action and that we have been, for over a year now, to grind down that ratio back to where it should be. And we've made some progress this quarter, particularly in claims management. Cases that are terminated were ones with relatively high severity, meaning the average reserve amount released had increased. On the other hand, new claims incidents and severity continue to remain high consistent with where the economy is today. So while we can't predict accurately the rate of improvement in our disability ratio, we have been and we'll continue to do whatever it takes to get the ratio back to where it should be. But said differently, this will not be a linear process. It has been for the past 4 quarters, but it won't necessarily be. We're in 1 year into our multiyear process and the economy isn't helping, so while the trends lane -- the trend line down will continue, you can expect there to be variation quarter-to-quarter, but over the long term, we'll get the ratio back to where it needs to be.","Mark B. Grier","Jimmy, it's Mark. I want to come back to one thing. And I know I promised I wasn't going to parse line items, but I want to make sure this pension accounting change doesn't devolve into something that it's not. This pension accounting change mitigates a drag that would not be here under our original assumptions. It doesn't represent an unanticipated benefit or a windfall. It's offsetting something that wouldn't have been part of the negatives as we set the original objective. So you shouldn't be thinking of this as a nice healthy surprise on the upside, you should be thinking of it as something that helps out a little on some of the other stuff that's gone on, on the downside.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just one more kind of around capital and FSOC. Assuming there's a designation -- whether or not there's a designation sometime next year for Prudential and other folks that are non-bank SIFIs, what's your expectation about how the stress test process would move forward kind of before designation and after designation, based on what you know now?","Mark B. Grier","I would say, highly uncertain. The discussion of the capital insolvency and risk regime is very much ongoing. And I think there have been lessons in the market about the challenges related to applying the bank stress test to an insurance company, and I believe that those challenges have been noted. So I'd say, very much work in process. I wouldn't want to speculate, and really don't know. That's got to be sorted out.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Could you -- is it -- but if you were designated but there were no Prudential standards, could you even take a stress test?","Mark B. Grier","Well, we need a framework in which to conduct the stress test. We do our own around here. We've talked about our capital protection plan. And the way in which we stress our system for our internal test is actually extremely harsh and probably, all in, in terms of the direct impact on us, harsher than the bank framework. Although, I don't want to comment on a lot of specific details there because we don't do it that way. But we would need a framework in which to conduct the stress test. And right now, I don't think we have that.","John Robert Strangfeld","But just taking from Mark's point: We conduct our own internal stress test, and we put in a plan in place to remediate the impacts of that stress.","Mark B. Grier","In a way, there's something inconsistent because our core business is loss absorption, whereas the approach that's taken to the banking world is to think of loss absorption as an add-on. And for us, it's built into everything about the way in which we reserve and the way in which we manage assets and liabilities and the way in which we capitalized. So -- and there's kind of an anomaly there around the imposition of a loss absorption picture on a company whose core business is loss absorption.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Right, understood. And I'm just trying to think about it more from a procedural perspective, but I appreciate your commentary. And if I could, real quick, just on the long-term care charge. I wanted to try and understand, and I apologize if I missed this, how much of that $685 million is ultimately reflected in stat? And would that all come through AAT [ph]? Or is that going to be spread across different areas in stat?","Richard J. Carbone","Well, it's going to -- it's not going to be spread across a whole bunch of areas. The first step is the charge will reduce surplus, but at year end -- and I don't want to get into this now, at year end, we will have to run the AAT testing against the cash flows and establish an AAT reserve at year end.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So when you've adjusted AAT in the past, has long-term care been the big driver? And what -- because that reserve's built actually over time, right, over the last few years as rates have gone lower. Has that been the big kind of thing in the background for long-term care?","Richard J. Carbone","Right. As you know, AAT is sensitive to interest rate. So as interest rates have graded down over the years, we have been building in AAT reserves for our long-term care. I can give you the math. At year-end 12\/31\/11, that AAT reserve for long-term care was $400 million.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And when you tested -- when you did discharge for long-term care, I assume you updated your outlook for lower interest rates. Was that by the -- so was it larger than the overall change of around 100 basis points?","Richard J. Carbone","No, no, no. You apply the same, we applied the same rules in long-term care, as we did across the portfolio.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, randy, you know that the AAT reserve will reflect the low rate scenario in the New York 7, so it won't exactly match the assumption that we're using in GAAP. But as Rich pointed out, we had $400 million at the end of last year. It will be rerun this year. Actually, the way AAT works is you start from scratch every year and post a new reserve, and that work has yet to be done.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a real quick follow-up on Randy's question on the long-term care charge, though. There's no corresponding statutory charge in 3Q from this GAAP charge, is there, or do I have that wrong?","Richard J. Carbone","Yes, there is. There's a -- there's not a corresponding charge. There's an independent calculation in statutory for this event in the 3Q, but that will be refreshed in the 4Q when the final number is cast.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, so we'll get that next quarter. So then just real quick one on the pension adjustment. So this benefits 2012, does it -- in your guidance for 2013, is there any expectation that, that benefit grows?","Richard J. Carbone","It does not decline, but it continues.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. Okay. And then I just -- I know you guys don't want to talk about capital deployed or earnings expected from any of these one-off transactions individually, the GM, the Verizon or the Hartford, but I'm hoping you'd be at least somewhat willing to give us some help in understanding the capital deployed and the earnings contribution from maybe the 3 of them in aggregate. I mean, there's an awful lot of -- it appears, anyway, that there's an awful lot of capital and there's an awful lot of earnings that ought to come that's being deployed and should be generated from these transactions. At least in part, it's being funded by what was otherwise expected to be buybacks. So is there any help you can provide on that? Because I think it's an important one.","Mark B. Grier","The help that we provided has been to acknowledge that the range of capital requirements that's been discussed in the marketplace is reasonable in terms of how we think about these businesses and to add that the return is consistent with the objectives that we've set for this kind of a transaction but also consistent with the overall corporate ROE objectives. So we've acknowledged those points and believe that the people who have thought this through and put numbers out there have not been very far off.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, I -- and that's fair. I think that's been probably a little bit more -- a little bit easier to do, though, with the pension risk transfer deals. I'd -- I'm still sort of curious as to, beyond a reinsurance ceding commission that you'll be paying for the Hartford life deal, how much more capital you'll be putting behind that once it's on your books, but...","Richard J. Carbone","Randy, in a way, it doesn't matter because, whatever that capital is, it's going to return the hurdle rates that we need to support our 13% objective.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then last quick question for you is, on the S&P 500 assumption, they -- over a long period of time, you have assumed 8%. You're assuming 6% now. I -- it's probably certainly more conservative relative to 8%. I'm just wondering if you can give us some kind of an estimate on how much that difference in assumption impacts your overall earnings outlook or ROE expectation for 2013. Can you help us with an estimate on that impact of 8% versus 6%?","Richard J. Carbone","It's not. It...","Mark B. Grier","Everybody is shaking their head. But it's all in our forecast, but I'm not sure we have it broken out the way you're asking it.","Richard J. Carbone","Cumulative over time, it may amount to something, but one year, I wouldn't sweat over it. I guess the other thing I'd say, John, this is John, is that what is important to keep in mind here is that some of these moves we've made recently that, start at the 2 risk transfer transactions, Hartford and Star\/Edison, had all made us less market sensitive, less appreciation sensitive, and we clearly were going into the financial crisis. And we've got a lot more balance. They've got more stability, kind of like International, and Star\/Edison. It's got both stability, scale and growth but it's a materially enhanced business mix from the one we had at that time. And less dependent on appreciation, frankly, more driven off of business fundamentals on flows and sales than as that time too. So we think we're in a much better place.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Well, I -- and John, I appreciate that. Where I was trying to go with the question was I -- your business mix versus many of your larger peers has been less rate sensitive, more capital markets sensitive. And in an environment certainly post the election where it appears, long-term rates, lower for even longer, I would have thought there'd be even that much more interest in Prudential on a relative basis. That's why I was trying to go there.","Mark B. Grier","We appreciate that sentiment.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, following up on John's question in terms of the aggregate of capital management, I think most of us have kind of thought about the pension risk transfer business from capital absorption as roughly 5% to maybe 6% of the liability. And I think, Rich, you alluded to a number maybe above that because that's typically what we thought about in terms of GICs and other products. So I guess if we take -- I guess the math I was going to try and do is, if we take the 5% to 6%, say we take 6%, for the liabilities. We add in Hartford, we add in the dividend and we add in the buybacks, we're getting in around $3.7 billion of capital management. So I guess that would be along the lines that, John, you talked about in terms of being well in excess of the $3 billion. I mean, is that the math? Or are we missing something on the pension side of things?","John Robert Strangfeld","You got the math right. I just want to correct one thing, well not correct one thing, modify one thing you said. What I was saying was that the -- and Mark -- to embellish on Mark's point. Mark said that you guys are out there calculating what you think the capital we need to hold against these transactions are. And I'm talking about risk transfer. You're in the ballpark, okay? And that is the ballpark, those ratios, the 5% to 6% that you just quoted, exceed the historical capital that we keep against GICs and stable value and group annuities, and yet we are getting our hurdle rates on those higher capitals as we do on those other products.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, just a few follow-up. The buyback, I mean, I guess, what gives you kind of the comfort that you can and you should be buying back stock given the murky kind of regulatory outlook?","Mark B. Grier","Remember, we've been under the over-side of the Fed since summer of last year when the thrift holding company supervision kicked in at the Fed level, so we have worked with the Fed and discussed our capital actioned with the Fed as we've gone through the past 12 months. In terms of the current status of things, we have de-thrifted, so we're no longer under that umbrella. And as a forward-looking question about the potential impact of SIFI, as I've said, we believe that we're very well capitalized and I think, if you took a proper economic look at the GAAP balance sheet, you would see capital ratios that are multiples of typical bank standards. And we believe that, right now, the emphasize on doing the right thing, and supporting the business and managing capital as, we believe, is appropriate should still be our course.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just lastly, you guys did a pretty interesting hybrid offering back in August where you qualified for Tier 2 capital, 100% equity treatment from S&P. And I guess we view this as a positive given some of the unknowns around non-bank SIFI and stress testing. So just curious why you limited it -- limited this to just $1 billion? And could you do more to kind of bolster capital for stress tests? Or are there limitations on how much you can do?","Richard J. Carbone","That was a very economic transaction we did back in August. We took out some senior debt, higher-costing senior debt, replaced it with lower-costing junior capital, okay, got the equity credit. And as we conditions like that present ourselves -- themselves in the future where we can call expensive debt and restructure our capital structure to make it more efficient, we will do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question I had was on the Hartford deal. Rich, if I understand it correctly -- and I guess you haven't given out explicit guidance, so I'll talk more in general terms. But my understanding was the Hartford deal was not expected to be highly earnings accretive in the first year. And if that's true, and I understood your other comment correctly that, that deal is taking directly away from buyback, is that actually earnings dilutive in the short term when we consider the opportunity cost? That's my first question.","John Robert Strangfeld","It's hard to tell. Maybe slightly dilutive to being a push. Meaning, that started up [ph] between a buyback and making an acquisition. In the long run, it will be accretive. In the short run, it's likely a push to be accretive [ph].","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so that implies actually Hartford will be contributing something in the 2013 time frame?","John Robert Strangfeld","Oh, sure. Sure. The normalized basis, x onetime charges, it will be accretive to EPS, absolutely.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, I just wanted to clarify that. The next question I had, I guess it's a little higher level so for either Mark or John. So when we think about what you guys are doing from a buyback standpoint, $250 million buyback over the next 3 quarters, which is obviously a lighter number than you've done for a while now. Is it safe to say directionality that, just given the uncertainty, that your view as a firm is it's safer to deploy money into block deals or pension deals or organically than it is for capital management activity that might come to an abrupt halt at some point depending on new regulations. So how are you thinking about that from a high-level standpoint?","Mark B. Grier","No -- this is Mark. We look at these deals, as I've used the phrase a couple of times, with a very sharp pencil, and it really is a better deployment of capital that we're looking for. So I know there's been off and on questions about whether or not the potential regulatory environment would nudge us, one way or the other, vis-\u00e0-vis acquisitions or business investments versus dividends or share repurchases. And right now, the answer to that is no, we're making these decisions based on the best deployment of capital. These are attractive transactions for us that will allow us in the future to pay more dividends and buy back more stock. And so, I understand the question but that has not been part of our analytic at this point.","John Robert Strangfeld","I guess I would say that -- Tom, that generally speaking, the organic growth is cheaper and less intrusive way to develop business than M&A. And outsized organic growth, like the PRT activity is particularly attractive, for the reasons we talked about. Everything from skill sets and absence of onetime costs that are -- or the execution risks and synergy realization. This sort of thing.","So we still feel very, very positive about the role that they have and the opportunity that presents itself to put the capital to work.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And Mark, you had mentioned you guys have officially de-thrifted. When did that happen? And I assume that means it's totally done, there's no further hurdles.","Mark B. Grier","The answer is yes. It's totally done, there no further hurdles and that happened right at the end of October","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question I had -- and Rich, correct me if I'm wrong, but I -- it sounded like a change on -- maybe just a subtle change when you commented on reducing financial leverage. Is that a change at all? And maybe that's just been ongoing. Because one thing that certainly comes to mind for me, if you look at what AIG announced, and obviously they are regulated by the fed now officially and they had a very abrupt change with capital management plans where they said essentially they're going to start deleveraging from a share buyback program that they had previously indicated. So just curious, are you guys hearing anything similar in your preliminary discussions in terms of where you think eventually your financial leverage is? Is that going to be a real hot button item with where things are going here?","Richard J. Carbone","This decision to reduce leverage below the 25% level is ours. And what -- it's not that big a change. We have always had a target of 25%. Over the past couple of years, that's bumped up above that, and our objective is to get it below 25% so if we want to do something and we push it back to 25% or we push a bit over 25%, it's okay because everybody is confident. Then we're going to push it back down below it. So yes, 25% is our target. We'd like to run a little bit, borrow that, but we're not going to not push it back there if there's the right deal, it's got a lot of economics and it can support the leverage.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then last question, the -- what you guys have done in terms of lowering your futures and returns in both fixed income and equities, how does that apply to pricing products? I assume, when you were using 8% return on equities and a somewhat lower-return for fixed income, in the old way, that's how you were pricing. But -- or have you changed pricing to reflect that yet? Or is that on the come? How should we think about that?","John Robert Strangfeld","I think we are -- we look at pricing relative to the markets and relative to our assumptions. So as Mark said, we just changed pricing on some of our life product. We changed pricing recently on annuities. We're changing pricing in our Group products. So we look at this continually and we'll change pricing accordingly. And these assumptions feed into those decisions. So it's a continuous thing we do and we'll continue to do it going forward.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. That'll be from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","I just have one point of clarification. On Slide 5, as we get to the guidance on an AOI basis, in the footnote, for unusual and non-recurring items, you've got business integration costs and DAC unlockings. Are we to take that to mean that there are going to be further unfavorable DAC unlockings on the legacy PRU business for which you just did the actuarial assumption review?","Richard J. Carbone","This is -- I want to get the right spot here. This is the -- this is that little box just to the left of the last gray column which says 2013 AOI basis?","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Yes.","Richard J. Carbone","Okay. What's going in there, there is some mean reversion. It's not wholesale unlockings that we're expecting on anywhere along the magnitude that we talked about this year. That bucket is 90% Hartford and Star\/Edison integration costs. Then maybe a little in there is we use the mean reversion technique. If the equity markets don't perform the way we plan for them to perform, we have a mean reversion formula. We may have to unlock a bit of DAC in there. But that column now does not -- plans for a modest amount of that. It's mostly Star\/Edison and -- or at Hartford.","Operator","Thank you.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a good year for Prudential. Our ROE exceeded 14%. And in a challenging year, we met our financial objectives. Business fundamentals remain strong with both our strategic positioning and execution supporting superior performance.","Fourth quarter earnings of $2.07 per share based on adjusted operating income excluding market-driven and discrete items was adversely affected by higher expenses, which we had previewed on the third quarter call, and lower non-coupon investment income returns.","As many of you know who follow Prudential are aware, our recent results have tended to be stronger in the first-half of the year and weaker in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, earnings per share on the same basis of $9.86, was at the midpoint of the guidance we set out in our financial outlook call in December of 2014, achieved despite less favorable market conditions than were assumed in the guidance.","This translates to an ROE for 2015 of 14.2%, which was modestly exceeded the high-end of our long-term ROE objective of 13% to 14%.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement grew nearly 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This strength reflects more consistently between our operating income and net income, one of our key priorities.","Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our results as well as our capital position in more detail. I will touch on a few highlights.","To start, our international businesses had a solid year. In the fundamentals and earnings power, these businesses are strong. On a constant currency basis, year-over-year earnings excluding market-driven and discrete items grew modestly, and constant dollar sales grew 8% at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses.","Additionally, we are seeing positive trends in our distribution network. While the interest rate actions taken by the Bank of Japan are clearly a headwind, and we will react appropriately, as we\u2019ve done in Japan over many years, our Japanese businesses have historically generated ROEs in the 20% range. And we expect them to continue to generate superior returns.","Earnings for our U.S. businesses excluding market-driven and discrete items were down from 2014, though this was due to more than $300 million swing in non-coupon investment income from the favorable results of the prior year. But underneath the headline numbers, we are seeing solid fundamental growth drivers in several businesses.","Asset Management generated unaffiliated third party net flows of $22 billion for the year, representing its 13th consecutive year of positive institutional flows. And individual life insurance sales grew 31% across products, while meeting our targeted product mix.","Our Retirement business continues to show leadership in the pension risk transfer market, with participation in all of the larger funded transactions completed in 2015.","And Full-Service Retirement had solid net flows for the year with a meaningful large case win in the third quarter. And although the annuity business reported lower sales in 2015, we remain disciplined in our pricing and are achieving our diversification priorities.","We have also seen good underwriting margins across our domestic businesses, most notably our Retirement business had $80 million of positive case experience in pension risk transfer for the year. And our Group Insurance business produced solid underwriting results, particularly in disability, which is benefited from its multiyear repricing efforts.","As we turn to 2016, the outlook is clearly more challenging as we highlighted on our financial outlook call. Market headwinds have only intensified in early 2016. While these pressures are meaningful, we benefit from our unique mix of businesses that produce top-tier returns and diverse source of earnings and cash flow as well as our very strong capital position.","Our business mix combined with the strong execution and an opportunistic approach to markets has enabled us to grow adjusted operating earnings per share at a pace well above industry averages, about 12% annually over the last five years. This has contributed to our ability to deploy increasing amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, amounting to about $9 billion since the beginning of 2011 or roughly a quarter of our current book value.","Recall that we raised our dividend 21% in December and the board increased our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion for 2016, which reflects an increasing level of capital generation in our businesses. Additionally, one of our key strategic priorities as a company is to reduce the complexity and volatility in our business and increase transparency, issues that have distracted from our strong fundamental picture.","At our financial outlook call, we announced the planned recapture of our living benefit riders from our variable annuity captive, in order to house all of the product risk together in our statutory entities. We expect this important step to further simplify our operations and reduce a significant source of volatility.","We will provide more details through 2016 as the transaction is finalized, but I\u2019d like to provide an update on our recapture and also provide perspective on our annuities business in the context of a broader retirement strategy.","We managed the annuity business conservatively and we hold strong reserves and capital to support the economic product risks, a practice that we will continue subsequent to the recapture. And we priced this into the product.","Even with the decline in interest rates in equity markets in early 2016, we expect the planned recapture to increase and not detract from our capital flexibility. And we expect it to reduce the overall volatility in our capital capacity.","We generate good risk adjusted returns on variable annuities, particularly as competitors have exited the market and the risk profile of the product has improved. We are targeting and achieving mid-teen returns. And expect the business to generate deployable capital consistent with the 60% of our earnings we target for Prudential overall.","So as we sit today, we view variable annuities of the core product with solid return and cash flow prospects. And it\u2019s well managed in the context of a global platform of businesses that produce a diverse set of risks and sources of cash flow.","We also view the annuity business as part of a broader retirement theme, which is a compelling long-term growth opportunity, and one where we have invested heavily to build differentiated capabilities. We serve retail and institutional clients in multiple capacities, including through our defined contribution, stable value, pension risk transfer and annuity platforms. And we bring exceptional execution skills and asset management capabilities.","We believe the growth and margin opportunity through this longer-term theme puts us in a position to deliver significant value to our shareholders.","Now, let me touch briefly on the regulatory environment, before handing it over to Mark.","We continue to participate with the Federal Reserve and the IAIS, as they develop capital standards applicable to insurance entities. While we do not know what these standards will ultimately be, we continue to manage our business to very strong capital levels. And this gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to meet any reasonable standards without competitive disadvantages to our products.","It\u2019s also unclear what the Department of Labor will issue as the final fiduciary standards. And we have participated actively with the industry groups in sharing our views of the unintended consequences of the draft regulations. But we also believe that our business mix and global platform puts us in a less exposed position than many of our peers.","Thus, as we think about 2016 and beyond, the combination of our differentiated business mix and strong capital position provides us confidence in our ability to produce solid results even as market conditions remain volatile. And also to take advantage of opportunities that will likely emerge.","With that, I\u2019d like to hand it over to Mark.","Mark Grier","Excuse me. Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our year-end earnings call. I\u2019ll take you through our results and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover our capital and liquidity picture.","And I\u2019ll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to a $1.94 per share for the quarter, compared to $2.12 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.26 from a year ago. While underlying performance across our businesses was solid, the decrease reflected a lower contribution from non-coupon investments and higher expenses in the current quarter.","Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $40 million below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago, when the contribution was about $90 million above expectations. And the higher expense level included nonlinear items such as business development costs, benefit plan true-ups and technology expenses.","We estimate that these two items together with less favorable currency exchange rates had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. In thinking about our quarterly earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses for items such as technology and business development, annual policyholder communications and onboarding, and advertising and other variable costs were about $175 million above our quarterly average for the year; consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results.","Considering the higher expenses in the quarter relative to the full-year average and other variances from average expectations, including non-coupon returns, the impact on earnings this quarter would be roughly $0.25 to $0.30 per share.","On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $735 million for the current quarter. This compares to $1.2 billion net loss a year ago, which included a substantial negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement, which we have taken steps to mitigate.","Slide 3, shows financial highlights for the year. Earnings per share for the year amounted to $9.86, after adjusting for market driven and discrete items, which implies an ROE of 14.2%. The full-year EPS comparison reflects lower non-coupon investment returns and less favorable currency exchange rates. Together, these items had a negative impact of roughly $0.75 per share on the comparison of results.","Turning to Slide 4, for the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items resulted in a net charge of $0.13 per share. These items included estimated remediation costs in Corporate and Other related to administration of separate accounts, also included a reserve true-up in Individual Life related to conversion of a valuation system and also included our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the annuities business.","Moving to Slide 5, our GAAP net income of $735 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $196 million, and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to pre-tax losses of $141 million. Of note, the gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from rebalancing activities in our Japanese general account.","We haven\u2019t seen signs of significant credit deterioration in our investment portfolio. The majority of the current quarter impairments relate to equity holdings and were taken based on the length of time with unrealized losses. Energy sector related realized losses were roughly $30 million in the quarter.","Product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $534 million, largely due to the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits, which decreased due to rising equities and interest rates in the quarter.","Moving to our business results, starting on Slide 6 with annuities, I\u2019ll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I\u2019ve already mentioned.","Annuities earnings were $403 million for the quarter, up $13 million from a year ago. Return on Assets or ROA was 104 basis points for the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the earlier quarters of the year and up from a year ago. The earnings increase in ROA improvement came mainly from lower interest expense. A 3% decline in policy charges and fees driven by the decline in average account values was essentially offset by lower base amortization and distribution costs.","Slide 7, presents our annuity sales. You can see the impact of our product diversification strategy in the change in our sales mix. Notably, we have reinsured the living benefit guarantee related to our Highest Daily or HD product, representing about 18% of gross sales for 2015.","Recall that this contract started in April and extends through 2016. We\u2019ve also grown sales of our fixed income based PDI product and investment-focused annuities. As a result, only about 40% of our sales for the year and about one-third for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees.","Turning to Slide 8, retirement earnings were $168 million for the quarter compared to $294 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by a $105 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments and mortgage prepayment income were about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $70 million above average expectations a year ago.","Bond portfolio yields were also lower in the current quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from higher expenses including business development costs.","The sequential quarter decline in earnings was mainly driven by a lower contribution from investment results and higher expenses. The latter of which were about $15 million greater in the fourth quarter than our quarterly average for the year.","Turning to Slide 9, total retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including $1.8 billion from three significant funded in PRT cases, compared to sales of $8.5 billion a year ago, which included about $7 billion of significant funded and unfunded PRT cases. Full-service sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Total retirement account values amounted to $369 billion at year-end, up by about $5 billion from a year earlier.","Net flows were about $4 billion for the year, driven largely by our full-service business. In our institutional standalone business, we more than offset our run off of funded PRT business with just under $4 billion of significant new cases that closed during the year.","Turning to Slide 10, Asset Management earnings were $198 million for the quarter compared to $192 million a year ago. While most of the segments results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was driven by a greater contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, reflecting a gain of about $10 million from an asset disposition in the current quarter.","Asset management fees are up 3% year-over-year tracking the increase in overall assets under management. Unaffiliated third party AUM grew about $25 billion from a year ago with $22 billion of net flows over the past year, including about $5 billion in the current quarter, mainly driven by new institutional fixed income mandates.","The earnings benefit from continued growth of asset management fees was more than offset by a lower contribution from the segments other operations, which included an earn-out gain of about $10 million a year ago and also included higher expenses, including to support growth initiatives.","Turning to Slide 11, Individual Life earnings were $119 million for the quarter compared to $135 million a year ago. The net contribution from claims experience was modestly below our average expectations for the current quarter and about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. For the full year, our mortality experience was roughly in line with our average expectations.","The current quarter contribution from investment results was also down from a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments slightly below our average expectations. Considered together, these items had a negative impact of about $10 million on current quarter results.","I would highlight that expenses in the quarter were about $20 million greater than our quarterly average for the year.","Turning to Slide 12, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $49 million or 38% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal life sales contributed $30 million of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands where we re-priced to bring our rates more in line with the market. The remainder of the increase came mainly from our other Universal Life products.","Turning to Slide 13, Group Insurance earnings were $27 million for the quarter compared to $44 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by a lower contribution from investment results with non-coupon returns slightly below our average expectations, and modestly less favorable underwriting results reflecting the impact of a smaller disability block driven by our re-pricing actions.","Slide 14 presents a timeline of our Group Insurance benefits ratios after adjustment for the impact of our actuarial reviews and other refinements. Our benefits ratio for 2015 is near the low-end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%, reflecting the substantial completion of underwriting and re-pricing actions we\u2019ve taken over the last few years.","As we\u2019ve commented, benefits ratios can fluctuate from one quarter to another. But we feel that we are now positioned for controlled growth with ongoing pricing and underwriting discipline.","Moving to International Insurance and turning to Slide 15. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $367 million for the quarter, compared to $382 million a year ago. Excluding a $14 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by higher expenses and less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter.","The higher levels of expenses in the current quarter reflected benefit plan costs, including an unfavorable true-up and costs to update technology as part of an ongoing project.","Mortality experience in the current quarter was about $10 million more favorable than average expectations, but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. The sequential quarter decline in earnings mainly reflects the concentration of expenses in the fourth quarter, which are about $40 million above the quarterly average for the year, including items such as benefit plan and technology costs.","Turning to Slide 16, Gibraltar Life earnings were $371 million for the quarter compared to $385 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $13 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year-ago.","The contribution to quarterly results from policy benefits experience included mortality about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations. But mortality was about $10 million below the year ago quarter, which benefited from higher surrender gains.","The benefit of business growth was offset by a lower net contribution from investment results, including non-coupon returns about $10 million below our average expectations in the current quarter. Expenses in the fourth quarter were about $15 million above the quarterly average for the year.","Turning to Slide 17, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis was $692 million for the current quarter, up $43 million or 7% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and other key markets and by Gibraltar\u2019s bank channel and life consultants. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 7% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent-count and mainly driven by greater term insurance sales.","Life Planner sales outside of Japan were up 10%, mainly from an increase in Brazil where Life Planner count has grown about 20% from a year ago. Gibraltar sales were up by 5% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased 12%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product that is popular among high net worth clients of a key distributor that we recently cultivated.","Turning to Slide 18, the corporate and other loss was $378 million for the current quarter, compared to $326 million loss a year ago. Corporate expenses can fluctuate. The increased loss came mainly from higher expenses, including items that are inherently variable such as strategic initiatives and hedging costs that we retain in corporate and other.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Falzon","Thanks, Mark. I will provide an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility.","Starting on Slide 19. While statutory results are not yet final, we estimate that PICO will report RBC well above our 400% target as of year-end. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 853% and 900% respectively, as of their most recent reporting date September 30, 2015.","Looking at our overall capital and liquidity position on Slide 20, a year-ago we estimated our available on-balance-sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion a gross basis, less $2 billion earmarked to reduce capital debt, to arrive at our long-term targeted financial ratio of 25%.","During the year, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of share repurchases and over $1 billion of common stock dividends, including a fourth quarter dividend representing a 21% increase. At the same time, we\u2019ve increased our on-balance-sheet capital capacity to over $4 billion at year-end, and have brought our leverage ratios within our targets of 25% for financial leverage and 45% for total leverage.","The increase in capital capacity in the standalone fourth quarter was mainly driven by capital generated from our businesses and a favorable impact from estimated statutory AAT reserves; net of about $600 million of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.","The fair value of the Japan equity hedge, which is not included in our capital capacity was about $1.7 billion at year-end. As John mentioned, we remain on schedule to recapture our VA living benefit rider and managed the risks in our statutory entities. We continue to believe this action will not have a negative impact on our available on-balance-sheet capital capacity, and expect it to contribute to our overall financial flexibility.","As we noted, we will continue to manage the risks to AA standards and CTE 97 levels. We will provide more details as the recapture occurs during 2016. To address the current topic, our direct and indirect exposure to the energy sector at year-end was about 4% of our general account portfolio excluding the Closed Block.","Our energy exposure is mainly through public and private corporate fixed maturities, of which roughly 90% are investment grade, and net of unrealized losses of about $200 million.","Turning to the cash position of the parent company, cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to about $5 billion as of year-end. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion of liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to John.","John Strangfeld","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. We\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I was first hoping you could give us some perspective on how to think about your sensitivity to - excess capital sensitivity to lower interest rates that are currently in the kind of the 160 range. Anything you could provide there would be helpful.","Robert Falzon","Ryan, it\u2019s Rob. Happy to do so. First let me caveat that, obviously, we can\u2019t update guidance or initially update our year-end numbers. And actually, if you don\u2019t mind, what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to take the liberty of anticipating your follow-up question which is thinking about the same question in the context of what the impacts may be to our earnings. And so let me hit both of those in the same - at the same time if that\u2019s okay. And actually I\u2019ll just start with the earnings, because I think that\u2019s relatively straightforward.","If you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, what we would note is that there have been no changes in the underlying business fundamentals from the point which we provided guidance. We knew and communicated about the level and timing of expenses. And we stated that we expected 2016 to be about $0.15 over these levels.","With regard to the sensitivity to the capital markets, specifically to the question you asked, I think we\u2019ve given those - the guidance on that out before, about a 100 basis points plus or minus and interest rates is $0.20 a share, and equity markets plus or minus 10% is about $0.30 a share, excluding our alternatives portfolio.","On the capital piece, we actually don\u2019t provide similar rules of thumb for capital. And it\u2019s primarily because it\u2019s not linear and it\u2019s also subject to management actions. We actively obviously manage that capital position. But I have a couple of observations.","First, if you look historically, the two largest drivers to our capital volatility in response to markets has been in our annuities business and as a result of AAT updates. So let me turn to AAT first.","If you pro-formaed the decline in interest rates since year-end back on our calculation at the end of last year, it would not have a material impact on the year-end calculation. And the reason for that is there are three components for the AAT calculation in addition to assumptions, three market components. It\u2019s underlying treasuries, but it also reflects credit spreads. So while treasuries have come down, credit spreads have expanded pretty dramatically. And it\u2019s also the calculation is floored off the - it\u2019s keyed off the five-year treasury and that has an impact as well.","So turning from AAT to the annuities business, as you know, we are in the process of recapturing the risks that we ceded out to our captive. There are number of motivations for undertaking to do this. One of which is to reduce the volatility in capital and leverage that has been associated with market movements historically in that business, and as a result of that captive.","It\u2019s inappropriate for me to comment further. Given that we\u2019re still on process. But I\u2019d caution you to remember or encourage you to remember that it\u2019s our expectation that we will be substantially less sensitive to rate movements going forward in the annuities business subsequent to the completion of that recapture.","And actually, let me add one last thought. And that is that while the market movements are certainly not welcome, they are not by any means unexpected or unanticipated. And what I mean by that is the degree of movement that we\u2019ve seen so far this quarter is anticipated in our own cyclical stresses, that we consider before we make decisions about how we\u2019re going to be deploying capital during the course of the year.","We run those stress scenarios in order to ensure that we can execute on our plans in the face of what we think of as moderate or cyclical levels of market volatility, and what we\u2019ve seen to date would fit within that definition.","Ryan Krueger","That\u2019s very helpful, Rob. Thank you. And then a separate question, can you give us some sense of how much non-coupon investment income you would expect in either a normal quarter or a normal year?","Robert Falzon","I think I can answer that question. Yes, so if you look at the expected level of our earnings across the - if I look at first the U.S. portfolio, for the fourth quarter our expected level of earnings was about - total was 9.3 - hang on one second.","John Strangfeld","Do you want to go on another question and come back to that while you check it?","Robert Falzon","Yes. Yes. I am actually not finding that right up, but let me come back to that, Ryan, if it\u2019s okay.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. That will be great. Thanks.","Robert Falzon","Actually, I think I - actually, I think I have the numbers here. The total returns in the fourth quarter across both the U.S. and international businesses were about $48 million. The expected variance on that against what we would otherwise have anticipated was about negative 30. So if you add those two numbers together, that would get you to a total expected level. Does that make sense to you?","Ryan Krueger","Yes, yes. Yes, that\u2019s perfect. Thanks.","Robert Falzon","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. Just first, can you just discuss the impact, if any, of the recent moves by the Bank of Japan on your Japan business?","Mark Grier","Sure. I will take that probably in two parts, because there is a part that has to do with product and there\u2019s a part that has to do with investment. So let me start with the products first, in terms of sort of rates and re-pricing. But if I can, let me step back and put the Japan business into perspective.","So if you look at the entire year within our Japan business, yen-based products are slightly more than half of sales and foreign currency is slightly under half. In terms of the entire international operation the yen-based products are about 45% of sales.","Now, it\u2019s also important to note out or to point out that about 82% of what we do - what we sell is recurring pay products. And of the 18% that is single pay, 13% is fixed annuities, which we price every two weeks. So if you put all those numbers to the Cuisinart and you boil them down, you see that less than 5% of our international sales are single premium life or retirement products in Japan, and we monitor those really carefully.","And to put that into perspective, what that 5% means, we sold less than $20 million of single premium life or retirement products in the fourth quarter.","So the next point I\u2019d like to make is we\u2019ve been dealing with decreasing interest rate environment for a long time and maintaining profitability. For example, we sell no single premium A&H products. We only sell recurring premium products, so there is minimal spread risk associated with these.","In addition, we stopped selling any single premium endowment products last year. Having said that, of course, there will be some impact to low rates, but it\u2019s a matter of degree. And the way we manage the risk is we continuously examine our product lineup and its profitability, adjusting pricing when necessary to reflect lower rate levels, which again we\u2019ve been doing for years as rates have been coming down.","We also reduced commissions or discontinued sales of certain products that are more interest-rate sensitive, if they can\u2019t meet our profit expectations. For example, Gibraltar Life stopped paying its - stopped selling its six year single premium endowment product in March of 2015. And in July, we discontinued selling the single premium whole life through the bank channel.","Gibraltar also discontinued selling its 10-year single premium endowment product, which again means that all sales of single premium endowment products in the Japan business have been discontinued. And we\u2019ve also reduced crediting rates on certain products for BOJ and Gibraltar.","So we\u2019ve taken and will continue to take action on all our product lines to maintain the appropriate level of profitability in the face of the current interest rate environments or changes to interest - valuation tables or mortality tables or other things.","The other thing to remember is that within Japan over 60% of our premiums enforce a new sales or from products where most of the profits come from mortality, morbidity or expense margins. So inherently, we\u2019re less dependent upon spread even when you think about recurring premium product or low interest rates for a long period of time.","So in summary, there are three main reasons for our ability to maintain the profitability. One are the factors that - other factors other than just price which are important, i.e., our strategy to emphasize service to our customers, which gets the strength of our capital distribution which is critical. And the way they approach both their customers and the way that we approach third party distribution.","The second is the type of products we sell, most of which are recurring premium and much of which is less dependent upon spread, given the extraordinary emphasis we have on protection products.","And the third is the discipline we have around profitability, i.e., re-pricing products, reducing commissions or eliminating unprofitable product. So that\u2019s the product side. The other part of your question really has to do with, I think, reinvestment which is how do we - how are we reinvesting the premiums and the rollover in this environment.","So first, let me talk about rollovers and size-band. In the existing portfolio our Japan portfolio is about $121 billion, of which about 45% of the portfolio is in JGBs. The portfolios have long duration. The LP portfolio is about 16 years and Gibraltar is about 10. So rollover is relatively light. And to put a number on that, rollover this year is less than $1 billion of the yen denominated investments at the portfolio level.","The second issue is how should we invest new premiums and rollovers given the recent lower rates. But first, recognize that a significant portion of the investment portfolio supporting the yen product is invested in long-term bonds that have been acquired over time and it yields higher than the current Japanese government bond yields. So we\u2019re starting out in a good place.","But we have adjusted our investment strategies to changing market conditions. And post the BOJ announcement on January 29 we did significantly reduce our purchase of JGB. However, strategically our long-term investment philosophy emphasizing discipline, asset and liability management hasn\u2019t changed. And so for new investments given the long duration nature of our liabilities, we are purchasing JGBs further out on the curve in the 20- to 40-year range to the extent we\u2019re investing in the shorter end of the curve, i.e., 10 years or less. That\u2019s where we focus on non-yen investment hedged back to yen.","So our investment strategy for yen products will be to continue to invest in longer term JGBs and combining those purchases with a considerable allocation to more attractive yielding U.S. dollar assets hedged back the yen, including U.S. dollar private placements, commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds. This enables us to earn yields that are higher than those available from just having JGBs. Thereby, somewhat mitigating the impact of low interest rates at the short-end of the curve. So hopefully that addresses both the product and the investment side.","Erik Bass","Yes. Thank you very much. And then, I just had one bigger picture strategic question, I guess is in light of the recent announcements from Met and AIG. And I realize that your situation is different in some ways given the higher return profile of your current business mix. I guess, just curious, are you currently exploring a sort of plan B options in case final SIFI rules end up being more onerous than you expect, and the SIFI off-ramp is shown to exist.","John Strangfeld","Erik, one actually [ph], this is John. Let me tell you how we are thinking about that and other related questions, and do it more macro, do it more expansively, start with retirement annuities and then work it back into business mix evaluation. Because we know and anticipated there is likely to be questions about that. So let me give you a long form answer that hits that range I just talked about.","Firstly, retirement in general and the income phase in particular is one of the largest macro trends in financial services for the next 20 years. And these macro forces not only bode well for financial services industry in general, but they particularly are for insurance companies in particular.","We\u2019re not interested in disinvesting in retirement. And one of the reasons - the reasons for this are both strategic and financial. Strategically, we\u2019ve intentionally positioned ourselves to be in the thick of the retirement macro, PRT, annuities, DC, DB, stable valued Asset Management. And we\u2019ve executed on the strategy I think exceptionally well. It\u2019s reflected in our investment performance, our success in the marketplace and our fundamentals in terms of sales and flows.","And the motivation is not simply strategic, it\u2019s also financial as well as, as you are acknowledging, our retirement businesses make a major contribution to our growth rate, which has averaged over 12% per year in the last five years. Our ROE, which has exceeded our 13% to 14% target for some time, both of which are considerably better than peers as you are commenting.","Turning more specifically to annuities just for a moment, helping clients accumulate retirement savings is something many financial players can do. Creating income streams for life is primarily the domain of insurance companies. So it\u2019s very easy to foresee a landscape shift and the relative importance of players are purely asset gatherers, asset managers, to those who can also contribute to the lifetime income dimension.","And that\u2019s where annuities can play a particularly important role, particularly in broader and simpler applications than we think are likely to evolve in the future.","Now, beyond on the strategic relevance, the financial aspect of our annuity business is a very positive as well as, as we talked about strong returns and a well-capitalized business, strong cash flows. And those are not aspirational. That\u2019s a reality and 2015 is a good example.","The challenge for us in this area has been historically the earnings and capital volatility. And in the last two years we\u2019ve taken very significant measures to moderate that volatility, whether it\u2019s the reinsurance with Hamilton or the recapture of our annuities captive. And we expect these measures, as Rob was referencing, to substantially reduce the volatility going forward and to enhance our capital flexibility.","So when you combine the reduction in the volatility with already attractive returns and cash flow, it makes the businesses, the business all the more attractive. Now, once it go more to the - broadly to the business mix, one-time Prudential\u2019s business mix had the attributes of a financial supermarket with healthcare, P&C, brokerage, investment banking and a whole lot of other things. And you could really challenge the wisdom of that and we certainly did.","And so we went through the challenging and difficulties of dramatically changing this and changing the cost structure that supported it. And what we have today is very conscious, very deliberate. It\u2019s by design, it\u2019s not by default. And we are just focused on three things: retirement, protection and asset management, taken together and even more powerfully in combination.","And that\u2019s what enabled us to produce that earnings track record, the ROEs we talked about and the $9 billion of capital that we\u2019ve returned to our shareholders. For us, our challenge isn\u2019t delivering the results or the return on capital. It\u2019s getting it better reflected with what we believe should be a premium valuation.","And the factors we think about, when we think about valuation and what\u2019s influencing it, it really go into three buckets: the macro-environment including low rates and foreign currency fluctuations; the regulatory uncertainty; then the complexity and transparency challenges in our business. And I\u2019ll just touch briefly on each and I\u2019ll wrap.","So insofar as the macro environment, we provided the sensitivity disclosures on each key area and we\u2019ll continue to provide more. But overall, our business mix and how we manage our operations mitigates earnings impacts of any one macro driver. And further, our balance sheet strength is able to absorb substantial strain from low rates, equity markets and credit shocks, and still maintain very competitive solvency ratios.","On the regulatory requirements, we don\u2019t have an answer on future capital rules yet, but we are hopeful the picture will be clear over the next couple of years. We maintain a strong balance sheet. As we say, we have substantial capital resources, which we believe will be evident and adequate under any reasonable capital standards.","And in the meantime, we\u2019ve returned capital to shareholders in a very substantial and very disciplined way.","And finally, a point of great emphasis that was been underway for nearly two years, it\u2019s been our focus on reducing the complexity and volatility in our business, which we believe has distracted from the underlying fundamentals and return attributes in our business.","And these are very significant actions, including enhancing the visibility into our results through the raise, dividend and buyback authorization, which reflect the increased expectation of cash flow from over a year ago to 60% from 50%; the implementation of the divisional structure in Japan to mitigate the net income volatility from foreign currency remeasurement; the restructuring of the Closed Block business, which simplifies our operating structure; and preparing the recapture the VA risks, which will eliminate a substantial driver of volatility and simplify of our operations.","And we\u2019ve also taken other steps like reinsuring a portion of living benefit rider on our newest Highest Daily VA business. And we will take more of those over time. Now, those actions sound technical to many, but they\u2019re very meaningful.","And over time - some are kicking in right away, and others will kick in overtime - but overtime it will certainly reduce the noise in our results that distracted our broader story and create a much clear line of sight between operating results, net income, book value growth and the like. And we believe we will have a very positive effect on our view.","So we are going at it with a real effort of looking at better alignment between our operating results, our financial results and our evaluation. And these are the steps we think are most appropriate for us.","Erik Bass","Great. Thanks, John. I appreciate the comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally. Please go ahead.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thanks and good morning. A couple of quick questions, first on capital, you mentioned that lower AAT was one of the factors helping capital this quarter. Just hoping you can mention how much that provided a boost in the fourth quarter. And then on non-coupon, just a follow-on from Ryan\u2019s question, can you also discuss the total amount invested in non-coupon investments and the competition with those investments?","Robert Falzon","Nigel, it\u2019s Rob. So let me hit the first question. I can\u2019t actually give you the AAT number, because we have not yet filed our statutory numbers, our statutory blank, so the front-running are filing with the regulators. I would note it was a significant contributor to our increased capacity. There are a lot of inputs there. They\u2019re not limited to just interest rates. It also includes assumption updates.","But if you look at where we are versus the end of last year, treasury rates are little higher and credit spreads have expanded as well. And those of both been positives for AAT release in addition to whatever assumptions that we\u2019ve taken there, so it was a positive and significant contributor.","On the second piece, on the portfolio, so if you look at our - what we label as our non-coupon or alternatives portfolio, it\u2019s about - it\u2019s a little under $8.5 billion portfolio. The biggest pieces of that would be in private equity. It\u2019s about a quarter of it, hedge funds figure that\u2019s 15% or so of what\u2019s in there, and then, real estate, which is about $1.5 billion of that number.","The residual would actually be in public equities, and so we have a fairly significant contribution in what we call as our non-coupon or our alternatives coming from public equities, largely held in our international business. A big piece of that would be in REITs.","Nigel Dally","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Nadel, Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Hi, good morning, everybody. I was hoping we could get a little bit more color on the retirement segments\u2019 earnings and the trend line as you think about it there. If I think about the last couple of quarters before the fourth quarter, after making some adjustments for non-coupon and client activity and better underwriting results et cetera, I think the quarterly pre-tax earnings rate would have been somewhere in the $220 million, the $230 million range.","If I make those same adjustments this quarter, I think I am getting to around $205 million, so it\u2019s about a 10% reduction give or take. What\u2019s the better way of thinking about that as we think forward from here?","Stephen Pelletier","John, this is Steve Pelletier. I\u2019ll answer that question. When you look at the retirement business, I\u2019d speak to the following areas, first of pressure on the trend line in earnings. First is, as you say from non-coupon investments. That\u2019s experienced across several of our U.S. businesses, but a lot of that impact is concentrated in the retirement business.","Second is from lower reinvestment rates, in particular in the full-service business. And again our pressure from lower reinvestment rates is something that works across the U.S. businesses, but shows up to a large extent in full-service.","Third has been some degree of record-keeping fee compression, that\u2019s a trend we saw throughout 2015, although we do see it moderating in the latter part of the year. Now, the levers that work the other way, the levers that we manage in the face of those pressures, again it kind of really taking about the full-service business where a lot of this shows up.","First, it\u2019s the overall size of the book. We\u2019ve made significant investments in the business over the past couple of years. Those investments have really been around improving service levels and the client experience, the actual participant experience. Those investments have led directly to meaningfully increase sales in the past couple of years and higher persistency.","Second is crediting rate management. We\u2019ve done some of that in each of the past couple of years and we have the latitude to take that further as appropriate and necessary. Third is management of unit costs. And a lot of our work around cost efficiency is focused across the board in our businesses, but in full-service as well.","For example, some of the references we made to higher expenses in the fourth quarter in the retirement business were actually efficiency charges that we took, charges that we took to prepare for - taking steps that will drive further cost efficiency in that regard. And then finally, our focus on the total economics of a full-service case, including investment management opportunities in a given case.","So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re - how we\u2019re looking at the different types of pressures that show up in full-service. Having said that, like I say, the impact from non-coupon and the impact from spread compression shows up to a large degree in that business.","Other parts of the retirement business such as pension risk transfer for example, we had a very solid quarter and a very solid year. And we look for further growth and further expansion of our results in those lines.","John Nadel","Okay. Thank you for all of that. And I have more of a - maybe just a transactional question, if you will, something that I\u2019m wondering if you might be considering particularly post the BOJ moves and the impact on the JGB curve. You\u2019re in a unique position relative to a lot of your peers and then you have such a large operation in Japan. And a significant exposure to JGB is something order of magnitude $50 billion in U.S. dollars I think.","The unrealized gain there must be significant at this point. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve given any thought to monetizing some of those unrealized gains, reinvesting even after tax, reinvesting proceeds into U.S. dollar or other denominated securities hedging back to yen and taking the excess and buying your stock, I mean - or more of your stock. At six times earnings, John, you\u2019re talking about an outlook that sounds so appealing over the long-term. Are there things that you can take advantage of today to reduce your share count?","Robert Falzon","So, John, it\u2019s Rob. Let me just take a stab at responding to that. So a couple of thoughts. One, understand, we actually do very actively manage our portfolio. We manage that portfolio in the context of a very-disciplined ALM.","And so we would be - want to be careful about doing any kind of restructuring of that portfolio that would cause breakage between what is to be appropriate construct on the asset side particularly from a duration standpoint and an FX standpoint against the liability side. That\u2019s one.","Two, we\u2019re also sensitive to not wanting to do mechanical transactions, which on the substance of it would - on the surface of it would appear to have good accounting outcomes, but not change the economic outcome in any way. So we really don\u2019t undertake to play those sorts of games with our portfolio.","And then third, I think as we think about stock buybacks, I think I have delivered this message before. And it\u2019s consistent with how we think about it, which is that we are - we think ourselves as very good stewards of our capital capacity. Stock buybacks are an important component of that stewardship.","But we think about that in the context of delivering current returns back to our shareholders as a complement to our dividends as opposed to using an opportunistically to speculate on the valuation of our stock vis-\u00e0-vis what\u2019s fair value for that.","John Nadel","Okay.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Hey, just had a question on the variable annuity business. If I look at current market levels and I think about your Highest Daily value product, I think we\u2019re now at the point where you have a lot of the auto rebalance kick in, which I believe starts between 10%, 15% market down levels.","Can you can you dimension a little bit what sort of happens mechanically from an accounting standpoint? I realize a big asset reallocation from equities into fixed income, limits the tail risk, but is there - is there like an interim degradation of margins or returns, DAC charges that we should expect if in fact there\u2019s a pretty meaningful movement of the auto rebalance that occurs?","Stephen Pelletier","Tom, this is Steve, I\u2019ll address that question. The algorithm and the auto rebalancing mechanism has been active in the face of this kind of market volatility, as you would expect. But it is really designed to manage the risk profile of an individual contract, and thereby, when you add up all those individual contracts, overall risk profile of the product line.","It\u2019s not designed to produce any type of change in short-term financial results and current financial results. It\u2019s designed to effectively manage the long-term risk profile of the contract, especially as we\u2019ve communicated in the past, especially tail risk.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. But maybe this one is better for, Rob. Just in terms of the way that you would think about the accounting implications, if there was a big kicking in of the auto rebalance in a given quarter, would that necessitate anything real meaningful or is there still an ability to use reversion to mean when you consider normal assume market recovery and money coming back out of those contracts? Can you help frame that a little bit?","Robert Falzon","Yes. So I think, Tom, what you\u2019re talking about are EGPs, Estimate Gross Profits, and how that\u2019s going to be affected by the auto rebalance. And in fact as a result of that you get unlock and you get a change in the K factor and the amortization of DAC. Is that sort of the line of thinking you\u2019re chasing?","Tom Gallagher","Exactly.","Robert Falzon","So the answer would be, no. That does not affect it. Remember that under GAAP, the valuation of our reserves is actually gone in a risk neutral construct. And obviously what we eliminate of the margin piece of that that\u2019s in the GAAP reserve. It\u2019s coming up with our hedge target. That in fact is not affected by the mix in the account values between equities and fixed income because there is a presumption that actually the account values are going to grow at the swap curve rate effectively, a little bit of a premium on the equity side.","So while there\u2019s always some level of differentiation associated with that between the equities and the fixed income, it\u2019s not material and we would not expect as a result of changing of the portfolio from the auto rebalance to have a material outcome with regard to an unlock and\/or impact on our K factor.","Tom Gallagher","That\u2019s helpful. And then just one last follow-up, if I could, if - I don\u2019t know, if you guys have quantified it, the $1 billion gain that you had in deployable capital at year-end. And then, is there a way to at least give a rough estimate of if the quarter closed around current levels would there be a meaningful change in deployable capital, because I think some things have changed in terms of the way you guys have managed particularly the variable annuity business.","And I think the volatility should be lower, but I just wanted to get a sense for if you could give some indication on that.","Robert Falzon","Well, I would, Tom, reflect back on some of the comments I made in answering Ryan\u2019s initial question, which is, how we think about capital volatility sort of post year-end. And so, as I mentioned, the two biggest drivers of that being AAT and the annuities business. I think I walked through the AAT calculation, which is pro forma, put it back to the end of last year. There\u2019s not a material difference in terms of that outcome. And so therefore, would not have changed capital capacity.","The second piece of it on the annuities, as I mentioned there, the - our expectation as a result of the recapture of the risks that we ceded out to our captives is that we will be significantly less sensitive from a capital and leverage standpoint going forward to movements in the market. And so I can\u2019t really comment on where we are in that process and what the exact sensitivity will be, because it\u2019s not completed.","But that is in fact the objective of that - or one of the objectives of that undertaking. And therefore, we would expect a level of reduced volatility all around relative to kind of market movements that we see.","Tom Gallagher","Got it. And, Rob, when is that expected to be done?","Robert Falzon","Well, we haven\u2019t given a specific date, Tom. But it is during the course of 2016 we expect that the recapture would occur and be completed by call it the middle of the year.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. So I just want to start with the annuity business. I guess, John, you made a pretty strong argument for the sustainability of the variable annuity business industry-wide. But as we think about this vis-\u00e0-vis the DOL, some of your competitors have talked about pretty significant shifts in that business away from upfront commissions to trailing compensation.","Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you\u2019re positioned if we move down that road. And if you think we might see a slowdown near-term in terms of sales for the industry as we make that transition.","John Strangfeld","Yes. Steve Pelletier will speak to that.","Stephen Pelletier","Yes, Suneet. I\u2019ll speak to that. And I\u2019ll speak kind of give another level of detail on how we\u2019re preparing for the DOL to fiduciary standard. We\u2019ve been conducting extensive planning for it. And we expect it to be released in late March, early April. We don\u2019t yet know the details of the final rules, but we are preparing for a full range of contingencies and degrees of potential impact on our businesses. A lot of our planning is focused on annuities, retirement and Prudential Advisors.","In annuities, to address your specific questions, we said we\u2019re taking measures to prepare first for increased service requirements on our part in support of our distribution partners; and second, taking steps on the product front. Now, in regard to - in regard to compensation structures and product, I note that we already have had for some time of fee-based options in place in a lot of our existing products.","Those structures, those options have had limited uptake as of yet. But as the regulation takes hold, we may see further migration towards those structures. More broadly though and looking forward, we\u2019re going to continue to evolve our product line and our product mix. We have already proven very successful in that sort of diversification over the past couple of years.","And we\u2019re going to continue to evolve that product line and mix to extend the franchise and address a larger portfolio of opportunities with, as John mentioned streamlined and simpler solutions.","If I could, I\u2019d just touch on retirement and Prudential Advisors as well, because I think it\u2019s important to kind of give the perspective on how we\u2019re seeing the break. In retirement, we will be adapting the communications that we have, that educate plan participants who are retiring or changing jobs on the options that they have for their retirement plan savings. And Pru Advisors, there will be on day one of the regulations effectiveness, there will be an immediate impact on our customer-facing activities.","For example, we will - or already adapting our systems for the data collection and compliance that will be part of those customer-facing activities. And part of that, that systems move really entails accelerating the deployment of some technology platforms that we had already long since planned.","I will just frame out the point that Prudential Advisors is a very important part of our retail distribution strategy. However, given the way we\u2019ve reshaped our distribution platforms over the past decade or so, it today accounts for only about 20% of our retail life insurance, annuity and mutual fund sales.","And so, as I say, I wanted to give you that flavor for the granular preparation we\u2019re taking for the regulation. We do see coming back to your specific question, the potential for some disruption. But we feel that we have the strength of distribution relationships and the skills around distribution support and around product design and development that will enable us to make those necessary adaptations.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then, just a separate one on expenses, if I did my math right, if I start with your consolidated G&A, so I\u2019m talking about the company level, and I back out your $175 million of overage, it still looks like your G&A is running maybe 4% or 5% above the nine month average.","So I guess I just want to make sure as we think about 2016, if there\u2019s anything in terms of the expenses that we should be thinking about that was elevated in 4Q that might persist in the balance of - in remaining quarters of 2016?","Robert Falzon","So, Suneet, it\u2019s Rob. I think what we\u2019ve said in the past I think still holds true, which is - actually if we look at our expenses for the entire year, they\u2019re about consistent with what we were expecting, reflecting a number of the initiatives that we have, which are requiring near-term spending.","But with that expectation or hope that those things that are outside of enhanced supervision, of which most of it is occurring outside of that, are going to have longer term payoffs in terms of positioning of our businesses and expanding our addressable market.","That initiative spending, as I said, is consistent with what we expected for the year on a total-year basis. And when we gave our guidance, I think we mentioned that expectation would be about $0.15 above that level - or the level for 2015 going into 2016.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. So just to come back on the guidance and the outlook that you gave, and I know you don\u2019t revisit it, but I think, Rob, what you were saying at the beginning was that sort of everything that happened in the fourth quarter was largely contemplated when you gave that, what it was, 975 to 1025 range. And that other than kind of the macro sensitivities of the equity markets and interest rates, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s really changed in that line of thinking.","Robert Falzon","Yes. Again, not updating, but I would say from a business fundamental standpoint nothing has changed with our regard to our view to that. Obviously, market forces are outside of being able to actually predict that. And then, the usual things that we walk you through from a run rate standpoint around mortality and returns from alternatives, those are variables in the course of the quarter as well. But from a business fundamental standpoint the picture that emerged was consistent with the picture that we were seeing when we established guidance.","Suneet Kamath","All right. Thanks.","Alan Mark Finkelstein","Roxanne, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","That question comes from the line of Michael Kovac, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Kovac","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a high level question here on bank SIFI and we don\u2019t know the rules yet obviously. And the insurance rules are likely going to be different than the bank\u2019s rules. But if you look at some of the macro scenarios that regulators are considering, they\u2019re kind of looking at sort of the recent bank CCAR rules that came out. And they consider equity markets down 50% and the 10-year down below 2% among some of the other things.","I imagine that Pru\u2019s running sort of similar analysis today. I\u2019d be curious to know your thoughts and how that does compare to your own stress-test set Prudential runs on its businesses.","Robert Falzon","So, Michael, it\u2019s Rob again. The level of stress testing that we see in the CCAR analysis and the sorts of things that we\u2019re talking about internally, there is a high level of consistency there. In fact, I would suggest that actually across the spectrum of risks that we measure, the sort of things that we look at in our tail scenarios are actually more extreme than the sort of things that the banks are being asked to look at in the course of their CCAR test.","Some of them are consistent, the equity one that you mentioned. Our assumption when we do our tail scenario is a 50% to 60% decline in equities by way of example to make it comparable. So there is not anything surprising in the way of the regulatory scenarios vis-\u00e0-vis the scenarios that we look at internally.","Michael Kovac","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a product-specific one, thinking about pension risk transfer market in 2016, how do you think that some of the current macro volatility maybe changes demand on the one front, and then second, potentially the appetite?","Stephen Pelletier","I will address that. This is Steve. Our appetite continues to be strong for this business. We have built a position of market leadership based on our capabilities, especially in the large case market. And we look to continue to earn that leadership by advancing a strong value proposition into the market.","In terms of market volatility and its impact on plan sponsor, propensity to transact, I would say certainly funding levels have a - the funding levels matter. So impact of market volatility on those levels would matter.","But on the other hand, I think that the really expectation now of prolonged low interest rates would also in and of itself make a plan sponsor think about transacting in the sense that the plan sponsor isn\u2019t going to be able to inflate their way out of the issue at all. The rising interest rates and rising discount rates for the liability won\u2019t relieve the matter.","I would say that, when we think about the growth in the pipeline over the past couple of years, growth in the industry, and what we see in our pipeline, it\u2019s been driven and will continue to be driven much more by factors that don\u2019t really relate directly to capital markets. And those factors would be: number one, increased awareness and sensitivity to longevity risk and desire to transfer it; and number two, pretty much relentlessly increasing PBGC premiums.","That\u2019s what\u2019s been the driver over the past year or two and we would consider those factors to remain drivers in the future.","John Strangfeld","And I\u2019ll just add on from a risk - from an appetite standpoint, when we look at the risks associated with that business, particularly the longevity risk, we continue to have plenty of appetite to take on longevity risk, given the size of our mortality book. And with respect to the capital availability, given the numbers that we shared with you as to where we stood at year-end, we have more than adequate capital capacity to continue to pursue the business.","Michael Kovac","Thanks.","Alan Mark Finkelstein","Operator?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 1:30 PM today, running through February 18, 2016 at midnight.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.33. We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12.1% for the full year. Looking back on 2019, we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long-term. As a result, we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives against which we will execute with a renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance.","I'll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019. First, we launched a process, talent and technology transformation initiative, which is on track to realize $500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022. As part of this program, we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U.S. workforce during the fourth quarter, which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce.","Second, we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The 10% increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield on book value in excess of 4%. Third, we completed our acquisition of Assurance IQ in October adding a leading direct-to-consumer financial wellness solutions platform.","We're encouraged by the growth in customer demand, the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform, and the level of talent we're attracting from well-known technology companies. Finally, we made progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance.","In 2019, our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment, the annual assumption update in our individual life business and higher than typical expenses in our international businesses. In 2020, we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead.","We're focused on executing three key initiatives. First, we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long-term sustainable growth while generating $140 million in cost savings this year. Second, in our international business we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets. Supporting this objective, this quarter we closed on the acquisition of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat, expanding our presence in Latin America.","We also completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets including Korea. We will share further details at the appropriate time. And third, we're continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment, such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products.","Turning to Slide 3, I'll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results which Rob will cover in more detail. Our U.S. businesses benefited from record account values in retirement and individual annuities. Earnings increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment spread results, partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business.","PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.3 trillion, as well as higher net asset management fees and other related revenues. Our international businesses increased earnings driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth, partly offset by higher than typical expenses.","Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to touch briefly on four ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way. First, we are a purpose driven company. We strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders.","Second, in December our Board introduced a multi-stakeholder framework that extends the Board's accountability to investors, employees, customers, and society at large, reinforcing the Board's commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns.","Third, this multi-stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental, social and governance practices. Finally, we provide transparency, so investors can measure our progress. We disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability Board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures. This includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and water usage.","In addition, we publish metrics in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold. Just last month, Fortune included us on its list of World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. We are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the Life and Health Insurance Category each year.","In closing, we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place, including the three initiatives I have outlined for 2020.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook.","Robert Falzon","Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S. PGIM and international businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook.","Turning to Slide 5, our U.S. businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions, and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from these investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. businesses have three key priorities for growth. First, we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins.","Second, we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities, including by way of example, the non-jumbo corporate segment of the full-service retirement market and the Premier segment of involuntary products offered by our group insurance business.","And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market, including through workplace financial wellness and Assurance IQ. As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities, over time we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns.","In the near-term we expect underlying earnings in the U.S. businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels, as underlying business growth in retirement, group insurance and Assurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our individual annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline. We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business.","Now, turning to Slide 6, PGIM asset management business continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model, global distribution in affiliated flows to grow in higher value-added strategies that serve investors globally. With a record $1.3 trillion of assets under management as of year-end, PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager. It is the fifth largest investor in fixed-income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investor platforms.","We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies, and expanding in both retail and international markets. And as the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and international businesses.","Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success. More than 80% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3, 5, and 10-year periods. This performance helped us to generate $1.9 billion of net third-party flows during the fourth quarter, including $1.2 billion of institutional and $700 million of retail net flows.","In addition, PGIM rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows, up from 14th in 2018. PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 32% in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and has grown over the last three years as we balance business reinvestment with margin expansion.","For the full year 2019, PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4% higher than 2018 and 6% higher after adjusting for business acquisition related costs. Looking ahead, we believe PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid to high single-digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager. And we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year.","Turning to Slide 7, our international businesses continued to benefit from our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution, as well as from our focus on other operations in high-growth markets. Life Planner sales increased by 17% compared to the year ago quarter. This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil, Korea and Taiwan.","Sales for Gibraltar were 14% lower than the year ago quarter. This primarily reflects lower single pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our Life Consultant and Independent Agency channels, as the recent decline in U.S. interest rates led us to lower credit rates. In addition, we continue to focus on quality distribution. The number of Life Planner as a result has declined. The lower Life Consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales.","We continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability. Total inforce for international increased by 3% from the prior year, including a 5% increase in Life Planner and a 1% increase in Gibraltar. In the near-term we expect total inforce to grow at a similar level. We expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.","Ken Tanji","Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 8 which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We begin with pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.33 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items.","First, in the fourth quarter we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income which was a benefit of $135 million. Second, the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $435 million or $0.85 per share and is comprised of two items. The fourth quarter included $160 million of seasonally higher expenses and $365 million of implementation costs including the impact from the voluntary separation program.","As indicated in the 8-K filing on December 17, we expect implementation costs of $175 million in 2020 with about 20 million of these costs in the first quarter. And long-term compensation expense for retiree eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each year. In the first quarter of 2020 we expect this expense to be about $70 million split between PGIM and corporate and other. These items net to $0.85 per share.","Third, there are other considerations that we expect will have a $20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. And fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth-quarter. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.95 per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases, business growth, and market impacts in 2020.","The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS by approximately $0.15 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020.","I'd also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix. On Slide 18 we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll forward by business.","And on Slide 19 we've provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. In addition, we have included some other considerations for 2020 on Slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs, the yen foreign exchange rate, and the effective tax rate.","Now turning to Slide 9, I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We've returned $900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses.","On December 19, we announced the Board's authorization for the repurchase of the 2 billion of common stock in 2020. In addition, we increased the first quarter dividend to $1.10 per share which represents a 10% increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4.4% yield on our adjusted book value.","We also continue to maintain a rock solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continued to be above our AA financial strength targets and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our $3 billion $5 billion liquidity target range.","We will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities, and return capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 10 and in summary, we had numerous accomplishments in 2019. We are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020 leading to greater earnings in 2021.","Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Dally","Great, thanks, and good morning. I had a question on annuities, is one of the areas that you do expect a decline in earnings in 2020, so I just wanted to check, is that just because of a modest decline in AUM because the anticipated outflows of evolving [indiscernible] depreciation or is there also an underlying element of some deterioration in the return on assets, and if it is the latter what's driving that\/","Andy Sullivan","So Nigel, thanks for your question. This is Andy. There's really two major impacts that we're seeing in the annuities business. one, as you pointed out is the outflow. That really is coming from we're being very disciplined in our pricing of product and in our return on new sales. And if you look back where we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range, so that's creating that outflow.","The other thing I would point to though is, as that business is rolling across it surrender period, we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect.","Ken Tanji","Yes Nigel, this is Ken. I'll just add, you know I know there has been some questions about the ROA. You know, our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE and our variable annuity business is very profitable and that is evident by the higher ROE that is in the high teens and that high ROE reflects your unique product design, our robust risk management, and disciplined pricing. And our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings capital and cash flow even with significant market moves.","So as a result, our earnings capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values and ROA may move as market moves, but our - again our earnings capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome. Though the decline in rates and the increase in equity markets, while it had an increase in account values, had a less meaningful impact on our earnings, again due to our robust risk management.","Nigel Dally","Okay, I got it. Second question which is on dividends, good to see the incremental dividends again this quarter and I think that brings the payout ratio to around 35%. So the limit to how high you'd like to go or is there incremental upside there?","Ken Tanji","Yes, sur. So maybe just a little bit of reflection of our capital management and shareholder distribution philosophy that's been very consistent over time and it starts with our free cash flow, which is about 65% of after-tax earnings, this year a little bit better than that. And this we then distribute in both the forms of dividends and share repurchases.","Our dividends have increased actually 12 years in a row now and if you looked at the average increased over the last five years, it's been 11%. And now that dividend represents as I mentioned in my opening comments of 4.4% yield on book value. Our board has also authorized 2 billion of share repurchases for 2020. So generally a very consistent approach to our shareholder distributions which balances both dividends and returns of excess capital through share repurchases.","Nigel Dally","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. So maybe a question on interest rates, on last quarter's call you increased your guided interest rate sensitivity to $0.30 of EPS impacts for 50 basis point drop in rates and now we've seen in 2020, well maybe not today, but I would just maybe 30 basis points so far in 2020. So I just want to make sure there are no changes. Should we expect $0.15 to $0.20 negative impact on 2020 EPS based on that or are there some other factors there and with that maybe you could tell us what your new money yields are [indiscernible] portfolio?","Ken Tanji","Yes, sure. So the sensitivity that we gave to interest rates of 50 basis points at $0.30 that's still good. So that rough rule of thumb and do you apply it I think that still is appropriate. Our new money yields in the second half of the year were about 3.65% and you can think of that relative to our \u2013 and that's in the U.S. relative to our U.S. portfolio yield of about 4.2%.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, thank you. And then just shifting over to the Individual Life segment I'm trying to thinking back second quarter you had that $200 million plus charge, the third quarter that was about $30 million of underwriting income below expectations and the 4Q is about $15 million now below expectations. So I'm wondering as we look forward, are you comfortable with underwriting assumptions into the year and your sales were really robust at $209 million you cited and is a record since 2013. So what are you selling that you are excited about?","Andy Sullivan","Yes, so Andrew it's Andy, thanks for your question. So we would consider our actions are expected in the fourth quarter as in line with our expectations, the results was 103% and I would encourage you to think of \u2013 there was a quarter around that 100 plus or minus a couple of percent. So that \u2013 we really that's in line. As far as you referenced the assumption of dates, we're seeing that our business performance has been consistent with the updates that we made in the second quarter.","Shifting over to the new business sales, we are very, very, pleased with the performance of sales in the Individual Life business as you cited it. Best quarter in five years. We're probably even more pleased that reverses the absolute level in the mix of sales. The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from guaranteed Universal Life which obviously is highly interest rate sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life which has much, much less sensitivity changes rates.","So, I'm pleased with what we're seeing. The success is really coming from, we have a very, very strong brand name. We believe our product portfolio is very strong and our distribution system is top notch. ","Andrew Kligerman","And then in term Life is at the balance of the sales margin?","Andy Sullivan","Yes, awesome.","Andrew Kligerman","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Just a first question on the Assurance IQ deal in terms of how were you thinking about the results so far. It looks to me based on the disclosure that the revenues are coming bin below what was projected initially I think it was \u20ac500 million was the 2019 guide and looks closer to maybe \u20ac300 million on a full year basis. I guess, the first question is, is that right? And secondly, does that cause you to rethink revenue and earnings projections 2020, 2021?","Andy Sullivan","So maybe, Tom, this is Andy. I'll start and then I'll had it off to ken. So as you would imagine these are early days to just closed the acquisition in October, but I'll tell you there is a lot of things that we're excited about. We are \u2013 as we sit here today even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this business?","You know, in the fourth quarter we saw very, very strong consumer demand flow across the platform. We saw 6.5 million shoppers and just to define that for you. We define a shopper as an individual that has an absolute to buy a financial service product and that is willing to share their contact information with us. So we saw 6.5 million shoppers across the platform in 4Q. That is compared against 3.5 million in the year ago quarter, so we're very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand.","A very positive for us on that is we have product providers literally lining of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform. So, from a revenue potential perspective, we - are strong as we were. We are in \u2013 kind of where we're focused right now is getting those additional products on to the platform.","As far as your number is around revenue, yes, our revenue for the year came in just North of $300 million, and really what I would tell you there is, we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents, call it capacity on the platform and we learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 healthcare agents on to the platform. I will tell you that we are already well underway in getting those agents appointed for 4Q of 2020. Now that's a completely rectifiable situation and we are well out in front of it.","Ken Tanji","The only thing I'd add there is, as you heard from Andy describe, this business is in a very high growth phase and we were not expecting meaningful earnings in the near term or in 2020 as a result. And so, it is early days and we will report this information to you each quarter and just as Andy indicated, just a reminder that is a seasonal business primarily fourth quarter loaded.","Thomas Gallagher","Got it and Ken would you say you are sticking to the $700 million revenue projection for 2020 still or is that sort of TB [ph] day?","A \u2013 Ken Tanji","Yes well, okay now, given the high growth nature of this business, we don't want to get into the practice of updating each and every quarter. So again, you are going to see the results as they occur in a separate segment.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks. And then just my follow up is, is PRU planning on early adopting variable annuity reform at year-end 2019, and if not - is the plan to do full implementation in 2020 or three year phase and\u2026","A \u2013 Andy Sullivan","We're going to adopt on the effective date, which is January 01, 2020. But it reminds you that, we made big structural changes that were very much aligned with the new reform many years ago. So we're well positioned and expect to be very well capitalized before the reform and after the reform.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, and Ken, no three year phase and you'd fully adopt in 2020.","A \u2013 Ken Tanji","Only adopt January 1st.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. So you've clearly taken two big steps to accelerate the timing of realizing the expense savings you've talked about. Can you just help us think about when we'll start to see these end results and where they'll come through, it\u2019s whether in terms of the business segments or through in corporate?","A \u2013 Andy Sullivan","Yes, sure, our 8-K that we filed, we gave some information of our belief of the progression of the saves. They were modest in 2019. And we provided an estimate for 2020. That $140 million would be realized in the P&L in the year.","Those results you can expect to build as we go through the year. And you can expect to see them emerge with primarily in the U.S. businesses and in corporate, but throughout those businesses, but again, because it's a company, it's a U.S. business wide program.","Erik Bass","Got it. And when you're giving sort of your walkthrough in the slides of kind of future earnings trajectory, am I right that there's nothing really explicitly contemplated there from savings in the businesses?","A \u2013 Andy Sullivan","Only what was accomplished through 2019 or the first or the fourth quarter, and then any future improvement, whether it's from business growth or share repurchases or additional expenses, incremental expenses would not be included in that baseline. That's all in the future.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then you mentioned in the remarks, potential actions to continue streamlining your business portfolio. And realized it's premature to say much specific, but how would you think of redeploying any proceeds, you potentially generate. Would you look to reinvest these in the businesses or potentially would they be available to return to shareholders?","Charles Lowrey","The answer is yes. So what we mean is what we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But let me take a step back for a moment and make a more general comment on how we think about capital in particular, the optimization of our capital, which I think we've been doing for years. So we always look across our businesses both domestically and internationally to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment.","And when we see attractive opportunities, you've seen us invest in growth and make acquisitions. And you've also seen us scale back our liquid divestitures over the years when they are better uses of capital. And then put that capital to use either in growing the franchise or if there aren't opportunities, returning it to shareholders.","So we'll continue to look for ways to optimize capital deployment and to maximize outcomes for our shareholders, whether that be in investing in new business opportunities which again, you've seen us do or return capital to shareholders.","Erik Bass","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, good morning. I guess first have you completed the yearend cash flow testing analysis and if so, can you give us any indication of the impact?","Ken Tanji","Yes, the statutory filings will come out at the end of the month. And so yes, that will include our updated cash flow testing or acid adequacy testing. You'll see those results when we report them. What I offer you now is, given lower rates, we would expect some strengthening in our ATT reserves or cash flow testing. But we have derivative games or interest rate hedges that offset that and we expect to have RBC ratios that are above our AA financial strength objectives.","Ryan Krueger","Got it, thanks. And then when you did the second quarter assumption review, and had some impacts to the individual life business, at the time, you talked about reinsurance as being a potential option to improve returns in that business. That's something that you're still contemplating and can you give us any update there?","Andy Sullivan","Yes, Ryan this is Andy. So I would broaden your question and say we're taking a number of actions to strengthen the performance of our life business. First and foremost, we are working diligently on expense efficiencies. And you can think about that in the context of the broader work going on at the company and the \u20ac500 million in outcomes we expect over the next couple years. We already talked about the sales, which we think is a meaningful \u2013 will be a meaningful contributor to giving earnings left over time in the business.","And then yes, you are correct. We have been looking at options and we'll continue to look at options from a reinsurance perspective \u2013 with the block. And what we're looking for there, obviously is the right partner, and the right terms that make economic sense for us. There's nothing currently that we want to report, but we'll keep you posted as we go forward.","Ryan Krueger","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Just focusing on Slide 20 of your deck in the international businesses, it looks like at least over the next 12 months Life Planner and Gibraltar are expected to be flat, which is, lower than that intermediate earnings growth guidance, you gave at Investor Day of mid single digits. So just want to get a sense of if we stay in this interest rate environment, what kind of gets us from flat back up to the mid single digits and sort of over what timeframe?","Scott Sleyster","Hi Suneet, this is Scott. Let me take that. So as we pointed out, the underlying business fundamentals for our international businesses actually look quite strong. As Rob pointed out, our reinforced block is growing at about 4%, four to five in LP and about 1% in Gibraltar. Unfortunately, given the low rate environment, for the most part, we're giving back a lot of the earnings growth associated in the block and we're continuing to make some portfolio in investments on technology and the like.","So right now, I would say over the, certainly looking out to this year, we think we're going to be closer to flat. We hope over time as we make adjustments that will start to build. But I would say even right now, looking at the intermediate term, we'd say we're looking at low single digit growth.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, thanks. And then a follow up is just on Assurance IQ. I think it was mentioned that there are about 6.5 million shoppers in the fourth quarter, what should we expect to be the conversion rate of that balance? In other words of the 6.5 million how many would you expect to actually buy a product?","Andy Sullivan","So, Suneet it\u2019s Andy, I'll take your question. Conversion rate is a very complex topic. So it very much depends on the product mix that's on the platform. And as we talked about, we are in a phase of rapidly looking out \u2013 looking to roll new products onto the platform. So the conversion rates that we're currently experiencing are going to change quite a bit with that product mix shift, as well as, as you can imagine, with the shopper demand we had, but the mismatch with our agent capacity, our conversion was lower than we would expect going forward. At this point, we're not going to put out explicit numbers, but hopefully that gives you a way to think about it.","Suneet Kamath","And have you put any PRU products on that platform yet? I know that was one of your objectives when you announced the deal.","Andy Sullivan","Yes, so it absolutely is one of our primary objectives. We have been working diligently to get our simply Term Life product onto the platform. We are ahead of schedule on those plans and we will get that product on the platform in the second quarter of this year. And we're very encouraged with our brand name and the quality of our products that that will give both Assurance and obviously, Mother Prudential some lift.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","John Barnidge","Thank you. Have you seen any meaningful acceleration in PGIM\u2019s UK business post election or demand for products from that market in continental Europe?","Andy Sullivan","So, John, this is Andy, I'll take that question. So what I would tell you is in the short term, with all the flux that's been going on, we haven't seen any meaningful change or lift. I would kind of frame it as, in many ways the marketplace is a bit hunkered down. So as an example, on the real estate side, we haven't seen a whole lot of capital fundraising and deployment. We are absolutely ready. No matter how that plays out we have licenses in all the right places and people in all the right places to continue not only serving our current clients, but to capitalize on potential opportunities if and when the dust settles.","John Barnidge","Okay, and then my followup, as we look back to SARS over 15 years ago in light of the coronavirus, do you see any increased demand for your products on the benefit side to note?","Scott Sleyster","Hi, this is Scott again. On the specific question, I would say history would show that any time there is a widespread illness, it creates a greater sensitivity among the customer base about the kinds of products that we sell. In particular, as you know on the international side, especially, we're very focused on death protection products. And so, anytime you have something like this that goes on, you're very concerned about your employees and your customers and you're taking lots of actions there. But I do think there is a follow on effect of greater sensitivity to the products that we offer.","John Barnidge","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A question related to PGIM, so looking at your retail flows it looks very strong from an inflows perspective. I think it maybe even a record number. But then at the same time it seems like you have record withdrawals as well. I was just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of where you see the inflows and what happened in the outflows and how do you think about in 2020?","Andy Sullivan","So yes, this is Andy, Humphrey. So, we are very pleased and proud of the retail flows that we saw as I think Rob mentioned in his opening. We moved up to number seven in the quarter. The retail flows are really coming from an expansion of our product portfolio on that platform, as well as the work that we've done around usage. From an outflow perspective, what I would say is that will tend to be episodic. And I think over the long term, we feel very, very good that due to our investment performance and our range of strategies that we will see a continued upward trend over time.","Charles Lowrey","And I'm pretty, I would just add on the institutional side that, those flows can be a little bit lumpy. And we saw a couple of clients who wanted to consolidate this year, and sometimes we're the beneficiary of consolidation, sometimes we're not and a couple of dominoes, tilted against us this year. But that doesn't affect how we think about our institutional capability or the quality of flows that we can have going forward.","Humphrey Lee","That makes sense. And then just a clarification regarding Assurance IQ. So I think Ken was talking about the - given the growth that you\u2019re expecting and then you're not necessarily expecting any earnings from Assurance IQ in 2020. I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly because I think originally at the time of the announcement, you were expecting maybe $0.10 EPS accretion for 2020. So I just wanted to kind of bridge the indifferences.","Ken Tanji","Yes, no, I didn't mean to say no earnings. I said not meaningful earnings, again, because of the high growth nature of the phase that they're going through.","Humphrey Lee","So the $0.10 is still kind of, I understand you're not going to update guidance or anything like that, but is the $0.10 still a reasonable expectation?","Ken Tanji","Again, we don't want to get in the practice of having to update this every quarter.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. All right, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And I'd now like to turn the call back to Charlie Lowrey for any closing comments.","Charles Lowrey","Okay, thank you very much. So in closing, I hope you all walk away from this call with a clear picture of our progress and priorities, our continued sense of conviction and urgency and our path forward to deliver meaningful outcomes for all of our stakeholders including investors. So thanks again for joining us today and have a nice day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning. To say the least, we know that you have been running a gauntlet of earnings calls today, so special thanks for joining our call. We actually delayed the beginning of this call to accommodate those of you who have been otherwise engaged.","Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Ed Baird, Head of International; Charlie Lowrey, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Peter Sayre, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. Our presenters today will be referring to slides. If you would like to follow along, they can be found on our Investor Relations website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the first quarter of 2013, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, in managing our businesses, we use a non-GAAP measure we call Adjusted Operating Income to measure the performance of our Financial Services businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses, as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments, as well as results from divested businesses. Adjusted operating income also excludes recorded changes in asset values that are expected to ultimately accrue to contract holders and recorded changes in contract holder liabilities, resulting from changes in related asset values. Our earnings press release contains information about our definition of adjusted operating income.","The comparable GAAP presentation and the reconciliation between the 2 for the quarter are set out in our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website.","John?","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we discuss specifics in the quarter, I'd like to kick things off with a few words: first, regarding our results; and second, regarding the visual aids Eric mentioned that we've added to enhance the discussion. So let's begin with the results.","We're very pleased with the results for the first quarter, and we believe we're off to a good start to achieve our goals for 2013. The building blocks supporting our enhanced performance are solidly in place and, in particular, we're encouraged by the visibility results from a number of initiatives we've implemented over the last few years. Retirement, U.S. Individual Life and International Insurance all contributed significantly to our results for the quarter.","Now we're mindful that one quarter does not a year make, and that we did benefit from a generally favorable market conditions and mortality in the quarter. That said, solid fundamentals largely account for the promising start to the year. Of course, challenges remain, and we'll continue to focus upon the delivery of business results that drive financial performance that support our goals. In sum, a great start.","As for the new slides, as Eric mentioned, these are available on Prudential's Investor Relations website. They have been provided to enhance our discussion with you. We appreciate that noise in the numbers, as well as developments like new product introductions or prices changes can sometimes make it difficult to interpret what's going on. We hope these visual aids will help clarify underlying trends and results and business drivers, and that's the basic intention of them.","In a moment, Mark Grier will take you through our results for the quarter, then Rob Falzon, our new Chief Financial Officer, will cover our capital and liquidity picture. And then I'll sum up very briefly and move on to the Q&A.","So with that, Mark, over to you.","Mark B. Grier","Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening, depending on where you are. I'll add my thanks to joining us. And as both John and Eric mentioned, I'll be referring to slides that are in the deck to which you have access through our Investor Relations website.","I'll start with Slide 2, an overview of our financial results for the quarter. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.28 for the first quarter, based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $1.61 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 49%, amounting to $2.13 compared to $1.43. This increase is largely the result of underlying organic growth in our U.S. businesses over the past year; the first full quarter contribution from the pension risk transfer business we put on the books in the fourth quarter; the initial contribution from the in-force Individual Life Insurance business we acquired from The Hartford in January; continued growth of our International Insurance business; and finally, a more favorable claims experience across several businesses.","On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $721 million for the current quarter. This reflects the accounting impact of foreign currency remeasurement of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese insurance companies.","Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI, amounted to $55.94 at the end of the first quarter, down $1.92 from year end on a reported basis. If you adjust for the foreign currency remeasurement of non-yen liabilities, in other words, if we didn't have the geography mismatch where the offsetting gains on the assets are included in AOCI rather than net income, book value would be up $1.50 per share since year end after payment of our first quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. And if you add the numbers shown on Slide 2, at the bottom, you would arrive at a book value of $59.74, adjusting book value for the total impact of the FX revaluation.","As we've told you, we won't consider ourselves to have achieved our ROE goal based on printing a result that is largely driven by reducing the denominator due to foreign currency remeasurement. If you adjust for that, our annualized ROE for the first quarter would be 15.6% based on adjusted operating income as reported.","Slide 3 shows a rundown of the short list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter. In the Annuities business, the equity market increases in the quarter caused us to release a portion of our reserve for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and led to a favorable DAC unlocking, resulting in a benefit totaling $0.08 per share.","In Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to The Hartford Life acquisition.","In International Insurance, a gain in Gibraltar Life from the sale through our consortium of the last part of our investment in China Pacific Group resulted in a benefit of $0.09 per share. This has been quite a successful investment for us. From the time of our initial investment in 2006 through its conclusion in the current quarter, we realized a total of about $525 million on an initial investment of $75 million.","Lastly, within corporate and other results, we recorded a charge of $0.01 per share to write off bond issuance costs on high coupon debt that we plan to redeem prior to maturity.","In total, the items I mentioned had a net favorable impact of $0.15 per share on current quarter results.","Removing the benefit of market-driven and discrete items from adjusted operating income and increasing the ROE denominator to add back foreign currency remeasurement would produce an annualized ROE of 14.7% for the quarter.","Slide 4 shows 2 views of our ROE trend. The blue bars are as reported based on adjusted operating income and with equity, excluding AOCI. And you can see some variability that results from the impact of market-driven and discrete items on the AOI numerator and foreign currency remeasurement on the denominator.","You can see a trend that's more closely aligned with our business results in the green bars, where we've removed the impact of market-driven and discrete items from the numerator and removed the effect of foreign currency remeasurement from the denominator. On this basis, annualized ROE for the current quarter was 14.7%, as I mentioned, compared to 10.2% a year ago.","On a GAAP basis, results for the Financial Services business in the first quarter include amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $3 billion pretax, comprised of the items you see here on Slide 5.","Foreign currency remeasurement losses primarily represent changes in the value of non-yen liabilities relating to products denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies on the books of our Japanese companies whose functional currency for accounting purposes is the yen. The weakening of the yen during the quarter required us to record an accounting loss in the income statement because it would take more yen to pay off these liabilities. We consider this loss noneconomic because the liabilities are matched with assets in the currencies in which they will be settled. And the loss in the income statement is offset in AOCI, a component of equity but outside of the income statement.","The remainder of the $3 billion of net pretax realized losses included mark-to-market driven losses of $412 million from product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activities and $87 million of impairments and credit losses on investments.","Moving to our business results and to Slide 6. I'll start with U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division. This slide shows a view of the results of these businesses and the adjustments that we would make for market-driven and discrete items to get a view of underlying performance relative to a year ago.","Slide 7 highlights the Annuity business. After adjusting for the unlockings I mentioned earlier, which were mainly driven by favorable market performance relative to our assumptions in both periods, Annuity results were $310 million for the quarter, up $85 million from a year ago.","Slide 8 is a view of the trend of earnings for the Annuities business. Most of the earnings come from base contract charges linked to account values. And when we remove the impact of unlockings and other one-off items we've disclosed, what remains is an earnings trend that reflects our account value growth. Account values amounted to $143 billion at the end of the quarter, up 15% from a year ago. The increase was driven by $11 billion of net flows over the past year together with market appreciation, and produced a 16% increase in policy charges and fees. Results also benefited from a reduced drag from distribution and other costs, which rose less rapidly than account values or revenues.","On Slide 9, our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $4.2 billion, down from $5 billion a year ago. The lower level of current quarter sales reflects actions we've taken to adapt our products to the current environment. In late February, we launched our current living benefit feature called HDI 2.1. This update limited the 5% roll-up period for protected withdrawal value to a maximum of 10 years and reduced payout rates at various age bands while retaining rider fees at 100 basis points for individual contracts and 110 basis points for spousal contracts and continuing our highest daily value proposition, backed by auto rebalancing tailored to the risk profile of each individual contract.","This product update continues a series of actions we've taken to maintain appropriate return prospects and improve our risk profile. Over the past year, we've increased rider fees, raised the minimum issue age for living benefits and reduced payout rates. In addition, we've withdrawn our X shares or bonus product and suspended acceptance of subsequent premiums on generations of products offered before 2011. While it's reasonable to assume that a portion of our first quarter sales represented accelerated purchases due to the change over to HDI 2.1, we believe our new product continues to offer a solid value proposition in an attractive market.","Slide 10 highlights the Retirement business. The Retirement business reported adjusted operating income of $228 million for the current quarter compared to $156 million a year ago. Current quarter results benefited by about $70 million from greater contributions from net investment results and from case experience, largely representing the first full quarter of results from the 2 major pension risk transfer transactions that we closed late last year. A benefit of roughly $10 million from higher fees, driven by account value growth, was essentially offset by higher expenses as we continue to invest in this business.","On Slide 11, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $9.5 billion for the quarter compared to $9 billion a year ago. Full service gross deposits and sales were $5.7 billion for the quarter, including 5 large case sales of $100 million or more, up from $4.6 billion a year ago.","Stand-alone institutional gross sales amounted to $3.8 billion in the current quarter compared to $4.4 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included $3.7 billion of stable value wrap products sold to plan sponsors and fund managers, while the year-ago quarter included $3.5 billion of those sales and a $700 million longevity reinsurance case.","Total retirement net flows for the current quarter amounted to $2.5 billion, and account values stood at a record high $299 billion at the end of the quarter, up $60 billion from a year ago, including about $33 billion from the pension risk transfer transactions late last year.","Slide 12 highlights Asset Management. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $175 million for the current quarter compared to $128 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from Asset Management fees, the contribution from what we call other related revenues, which encompasses results from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, is inherently volatile. These activities contributed $40 million to current quarter earnings, an increase of $26 million from a year ago, driven largely by performance-based fees associated with public equity and fixed income funds we manage and also improved commercial mortgage results.","The remainder of the increase in results came from higher Asset Management fees, driven by growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management reached a record-high $840 billion at the end of the quarter, up 15% from a year ago.","Slide 13 shows U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division results. Here the results adjusted for The Hartford integration costs.","The next slide highlights the Individual Life business. After adjusting for integration costs, Individual Life reported earnings of $145 million for the current quarter, up $33 million from a year ago. The in-force block of business we acquired from The Hartford contributed about $32 million. While the business integration is off to a good start, these early results reflect only modest initial realization of cost synergies. We expect a total of about $130 million of integration costs over a period of 2 to 3 years, including about $50 million this year to achieve targeted annual cost savings of about $90 million after the business integration is completed.","Excluding the Hartford business, Individual Life results were essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit of more favorable mortality experience on the legacy Prudential business was essentially offset by a lower contribution from net investment results and by higher distribution costs, reflecting the expansion of our third-party distribution system with the acquisition, as well as higher sales in the current quarter.","On Slide 15, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums amounted to $216 million for the current quarter, including $63 million from the third-party distribution partners that came to us with The Hartford acquisition. This compares to total sales of $79 million a year ago. The current quarter sales level was mainly driven by the strong competitive position of our universal life products, coupled with our growing footprint in banks and wirehouses, which was significantly enhanced by The Hartford's strength in those channels. We continue to focus on appropriate returns on these products, and we implemented price increases both in the fourth quarter of last year and in February of this year.","Slide 16 highlights Group Insurance. The Group Insurance business reported adjusted operating income of $9 million in the current quarter compared to a loss of $40 million a year ago. Claims experience was more favorable in the current quarter, both in Group Life and Group Disability.","Slide 17 shows the earnings trend in Group Insurance. Fluctuations in claims experience and expenses have affected the pattern of Group Insurance results. Our Group Life claims experience in the year-ago quarter was the most unfavorable of the past 5 years, and the return to more typical levels thereafter and through the current quarter confirmed our analysis that revealed no systemic or systematic issues.","Group Disability results, while improved from a year ago, continue to be a drag on segment earnings. The actions we are taking to address this performance include pricing discipline on new cases, repricing of cases that are up for renewal and enhancement of claims management, which contributed to increased claims termination and an 8-percentage-point improvement in the benefit ratio from a year ago.","Slide 18 shows the results of our International Insurance business, adjusting for the China Pacific gain in the current quarter and for integration costs.","Slide 19 highlights the Life Planner operation. Our Life Planner business reported adjusted operating income of $422 million for the quarter, up $40 million from a year ago. Foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 80 this year versus JPY 85 last year, contributed $14 million to the increase in earnings. The remainder of the increase was driven by continued business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up 12% from a year ago in the Life Planner business.","Slide 20 highlights Gibraltar and other operations. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, including integration costs, Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $392 million for the current quarter, up by $120 million from a year ago. The current quarter benefited from a greater contribution from investment results, driven partly by non-coupon investments, which produced about $25 million higher income than the average of the past 4 quarters.","Current quarter results reflected about $50 million of cost savings achieved, thus far, from the Star\/Edison business integration compared to about $30 million in the year-ago quarter. The current quarter also benefited from a more favorable level of policy benefits, with a mortality contribution of about $10 million above the average of the past 4 quarters. The remainder of the increase reflected continued business growth and a $6 million benefit from foreign currency exchange rates.","Turning to Slide 21. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $860 million for the current quarter compared to $850 million a year ago. Market developments and pricing actions we've taken have produced some volatility in the quarterly pattern of sales. The first and second quarters of last year reflected surges in sales in Japan from our cancer whole life product in anticipation of a tax law change and in our U.S. dollar whole life and retirement income products from purchases in advance of price increases we implemented.","In the third and fourth quarters, we experienced a surge in bank channel sales of our single premium yen-based whole life insurance product, reflecting competitor actions earlier in the year, which limited the alternatives available to bank customers who had substantial funds to invest in life insurance products. In order to limit our concentration in this product and maintain appropriate returns, we implemented crediting rate reductions and reduced commission rates effective in January of this year. Excluding the products I mentioned, you can see a sales increase in the red portion of the bars of just over 30% from a year ago, driven by life insurance protection products.","Turning now to sales by channel and starting with the Life Planner channel. Life Planner sales were $372 million in the current quarter compared to $391 million a year ago. The variability in the quarterly pattern here comes from the cancer whole life and U.S. dollar products that I just mentioned. Sales of these products in the current quarter were $82 million below the year-ago level, more than offsetting the $56 million increase in sales of other products in Japan and a $7 million increase in sales outside of Japan.","Slide 23 shows sales in Gibraltar. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $488 million in the current quarter compared to $459 million a year ago. Current quarter sales include $110 million from the bank channel yen-based single premium product, mainly representing residual sales before the repricing and up $33 million from a year ago.","Sales of cancer whole life and U.S. dollar whole life and retirement income products were down $81 million from a year ago, reflecting the tax law and pricing changes that I mentioned.","Sales of other products in Gibraltar's portfolio were up $77 million from a year ago, driven largely by life insurance protection products sold by life consultants and in the bank channel.","Slide 24 shows corporate and other results. After adjusting for the write-off of bond issue costs in the current quarter, the corporate and other loss was reduced by $23 million from a year ago, driven by lower expenses.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon","Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 25, you'll see a summary of some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility.","First, I'll focus on our insurance companies. We are continuing to manage these companies to capital levels consistent with what we believe are AA standards. As of year end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 456%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $12.7 billion. The GM and Verizon transactions did not have a major impact on RBC because the day one gains under statutory accounting largely offset the risk charges associated with that business. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio is above our 400% target at Prudential Insurance after giving effects to The Hartford transaction and other activities since year end.","Our Japanese insurance companies will soon report solid key margins as of their March 31 fiscal year end. While the calculations are not yet final, we expect Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life to report strong solvency margins relative to their targets.","Looking at the overall capital position of the Financial Services business, we calculate our on balance sheet capital capacity for Financial Services business by comparing the statutory capital position in Prudential Insurance to a 400% RBC ratio threshold and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries. As of year end, we estimated that our on balance sheet capital capacity was roughly $3 billion before funding The Hartford Life acquisition. We'd also estimated that about $1.5 billion to $2 billion of this amount was readily deployable.","Based on results for this quarter, including the closing of The Hartford Life acquisition and our first quarterly common stock dividend of $0.40 per share or about $200 million, we estimate that our on balance sheet capital capacity has not changed materially since year end and that nearly half of the $3 billion is readily deployable. Bear in mind that noneconomic GAAP items, such as the foreign currency remeasurement, don't affect our capital capacity.","There were no share repurchases during the first quarter. We continue to target about $250 million of additional repurchases under the $1 billion authorization, which extends through June 30 of this year. The additional repurchases would bring the total under our existing authorization to about $400 million.","Turning to the cash position at the parent company. Cash and short-term investments at the parent company, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $6.6 billion as of the end of the first quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.2 billion liquidity cushion is available for deployment such as to redeem high coupon debt prior of maturity, to repay maturing date and to fund operating needs. Specifically, we have called approximately $450 million of senior debt, with an average coupon of 6%, and we intend to call our $920 million 9% junior subordinated notes in the second quarter. These actions, along with the issuance of $1.2 billion of hybrids during the first quarter, are consistent with our plans to reduce leverage.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thanks, Rob. So I'll very briefly summarize with 5 points. We had a strong first quarter, and we're off to a good start for the year. Earnings improvements were broadly based and were supported by strong sales and flows. The landmark pension risk transfer transactions we completed in last year's fourth quarter contributed to record quarterly results in our Retirement business. The Individual Life Insurance business of Hartford that we acquired in January is contributing to results in line with expectations. And finally, International Insurance performed exceptionally well, with record earnings and strong sales across multiple distribution channels.","With that, we welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question, just on share repurchases. So you still have the $250 million authorization out there that you've intended to complete by the end of 2Q. Just wondering if that's still the case or has anything changed either from regulatory uncertainty or additional M&A that should lead us to believe that you won't get that done this quarter?","Mark B. Grier","Yes, this is Mark. That is still the case. When we discussed The Hartford acquisition and share repurchases, we indicated at that time that we anticipated using $250 million more of our share repurchase authorization in the first half, and we still expect to do that.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on The Hartford Life, the transaction there, I just want to make sure I have pieces here that you pointed to us. You paid $600 million for it. I guess, you had the $32 million or so contribution this quarter. So if we annualized, we'd be talking at $100-and-so-odd million of annual earnings, and that's before the $90 million of cost saves post integration. Are those pieces correct?","John Robert Strangfeld","Yes, they are. Don't forget that there was about $9 million of that synergy was in the first quarter. But those numbers are correct, yes.","Mark B. Grier","Just maybe one small qualifier. Capital in the Individual Insurance business actually went up by $700 million for the quarter, and the $600 million was the ceding commission. There's a little bit of other stuff going on in there, but you got the gist of it.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick one, just for John. I mean, you've laid out the '13 to '14 ROE target for this year. And I think in the past, you said you're not going to stop there. So curious if you still believe you can generate returns in excess of that 13% to 14% or has anything changed that could maybe cap your returns in that 13% to 14% range?","John Robert Strangfeld","Well, let me offer a couple of observations, one as it relates to the current year and the other relates to going forward. On the one hand, we would caution you about annualizing Q1 results. On the other hand, I'd also would say, though, that Q1 gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our 13% to 14% objective. So I think that's how I'd look at it in terms of the current year. In terms of long term, we actually think 13% to 14% is the right and proper place for our line of business, with our mix of business and it creates the right balance between strong and differentiated returns and also achieving growth in investing in the business. So I think that's actually a representative place that we would think as not only attainable but sustainable over the long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A question on integration costs as it relates to Gibraltar. They were pretty light this quarter. I'm just wondering whether that's a matter of timing or if we should infer that maybe total integration costs are going to ultimately come in below your original expectations?","Edward P. Baird","John, it's Ed Baird. It's a matter of timing. I think it's too soon to conclude just from this quarter that.  If we think at some point that it's going to be even lower than the $450 million, we'll let you know. But it would be premature to signal that.","Mark B. Grier","Remember, we ratcheted that down once already.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I do, I remember. And maybe just -- maybe a broader, a bigger picture question for you on Japan. So we're seeing now an environment where currency has moved significantly. Risk assets in Japan are in vogue again. Monetary policy is aggressive. Short term, this is obviously driven JGB yields down. I'm just curious if the combination of all of these factors is leading you or management to make any shifts in your strategy or day-to-day operations in what is clearly a very important market for you?","Robert Michael Falzon","In terms of basic strategy, no, no shift. As you know, our primary focus has always been on death protection and recurring premium. And in those areas, we're not seeing any material movement. The one area in which you are seeing changes, and it's reflected in this quarter, is on the more volatile single premium bank channel sales, which, as you know, made major movement in the third and fourth quarter of last year. We quickly took action, as Mark mentioned, in terms of reducing both the crediting rates, which were already pretty low. We were at 1.0 during that period of time, which I think you'll find was conservative. And we took it even lower down to 80 bps. We reduced the commission. We put in caps, et cetera. So that's why you see the kind of material drop in those sales because they are more reflective of some of the factors you described, in particular, interest rates. But the vast majority of our business is unaffected by that. And again, as you know, that carries through into our earnings because 80% of our earnings comes from mortality and expenses. So shifting investments really only affects the Gibraltar book. And the reason that, that book has influenced from investments is simply because that got to reset on the crediting rates. So the bulk of our earnings continue to come from M&E and it's not being fully affected by this. So bottom line, no change in strategy.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And just a real quick one for John or Mark. Any updated thoughts as it relates to federal regulation? I know the Financial Stability Oversight Council indicated they expect to make decisions on non-bank SIFIs soon. I was wondering if you have any additional color you might be able to provide based on your discussions and interactions.","Mark B. Grier","This is Mark. Calendar-wise, we're getting a sense that we should be expecting some conclusions from FSOC, which, remember, would result in a round of review and discussion with us and then back to FSOC again. I would add calendar-wise, we're also anticipating developments on the International side as the FSB considers G-SIFIs and, as a subset of that, considers the globally systemic important insurance companies. And timing of that may also be within the next few months. Let me just comment on a couple of things, one, to reinforce that our engagement with FSOC has been very high-quality. We've had a chance to respond to the data request but also respond to the data request with substantive context as we view it. We continue to believe that we don't meet the standard qualitatively to be designated systemically important. Beyond the process, which, again, has been high-quality, the SIFI issue tends to cascade pretty quickly down through capital and solvency standards to the question of scaling capital and ultimately to the question of whether or not we would be inappropriately constrained with respect to the management of capital as a SIFI. And I want to just make 2 points about this. One is that we are engaged in discussions with various regulators about appropriate capital standards. And I think we're being heard with respect to the concerns that Prudential, as well as others in the industry, are expressing about the inappropriate application of bank-centric capital models to insurance companies. And we have a chance to talk about why and how we think the approach to capital insolvency should be different, reflecting the intrinsic characteristics of insurance relative to banking. The second point to make is that we're spending a lot of time trying to explain why our GAAP balance sheet is not a very good representation of solvency and risk. And it kind of comes down to that as a starting point, focusing on things like separate accounts and participating policies, that the nature of reserving activities and the nature and real guts of product design as it impacts liquidity, are very much in front of us as we talk to the regulators. And we feel like right now like the level of engagement is pretty good. And the opportunity that we have to have a high-quality discussion around capital and solvency thought of in the context of a company like Prudential, I think right now is appropriate and favorable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a couple of questions, the first one on the GM and the Verizon pension closeout transactions. It seems like they contributed around $70 million to earnings, so I just want to get an idea if that's a normal run rate. And if you annualize that, if it is the normal run rate the tax affected and look at, I assume, 5% to 6% capital or around 6% or so capital on the assets, it seems like the transactions are generating a low teens, 10%, 11% type ROE. So I just wanted your views on that? And then secondly, on the full service pension business, you had pretty strong flow this quarter, I think, partly because of a large case wins, but you've been cautious on the business in the past. Wondering if you're a little bit more optimistic on trends there or is it just an anomaly that the results are good?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Okay. Jimmy, this is Charlie. I'll take those in order. First, on the PRT front, I think your math is generally accurate. These are closed box. There's no new premium coming into either GM or Verizon. So you look at this on that basis and you can annualize, plus or minus, a little bit. So I think that's about accurate. We haven't said the amount of capital we have associated with the business, but I think you're reasonably in the ballpark. And what we've said is that the returns would be consistent with the returns that we expect for the entire business. So John and Mark have said that this is sort of what we expect, a 13% to 14% return this year, and we have said that these transactions are consistent with that. So I think that's what we'd say about the first question. In terms of the full service business, we did have positive flows. You're right, there were some larger cases. We continue to be very disciplined about the business that we take on and the pricing of that business as we have for the past few years. We will continue with that discipline, so I don't think you're going to see a breakout quarter happen anytime soon. But I think this is representative of the way the business is hit. By that, I mean that there are, I think, more cases in the pipeline that we're seeing, and some of those are check bids in but some of them aren't. And we see that we are receiving more RFPs that we think are actually real. So I think that's good news. In addition, I think we have been investing in this business. And as a result of that, consultants are seeing that, and we are the recipient of more RFPs. So I don't think, again, you'll see a breakout quarter happen anytime soon, but I think this is an indication of the investments we've made and the current market as we see it...","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is the standard fee reductions still ongoing or has that abated?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","I think that's abated. We don't see -- we still think that it is very competitive out there, but there seems to be some pricing stability in the marketplace. And that's why we have been perhaps a little more successful in garnering some business. Because, as I said, we're going to maintain pricing discipline in this market. And if that means we have negative flows for another quarter or 2 or for whatever period of time, we'll sustain that. But pricing discipline is paramount.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to follow up on John's question in terms of how you're thinking about capital. Rob, you had talked about capital adequacy and capacity having at least half of the $3 billion as being readily deployable. And I know, Mark, you're thinking about things along the lines of moving the ball in the direction of sticking with regulatory capital. But just from a standpoint of trying to be pragmatic about what's likely to happen, the G-SIFI requirements are, I think, looking at consolidated financial statements. That's clearly what the fed has been using for the banks. And so just thinking about the reality of consolidated financial statements and the technical problem of using statutory financials because they're not consolidated and they don't look at the holding company, isn't it highly likely that, that's what you're going to be dealing with, whether it's G-SIFI or whether it's nonbank SIFI? And if so, have you started to do the work to evaluate capital adequacy along the lines of using GAAP financials and does that -- would that still generally be consistent with what your view of capital adequacy is today?","Mark B. Grier","There are a few things buried in there. You did make one point, although not quite directly that's important, which is that whether we're designated a SIFI or not, there is likely to be some group supervisory regime under which we fall. And within that context, we'll have to think about consolidated capital standards in a way that we don't currently have to think about with respect to regulation. So part of that point is SIFI or not, this methodology question around the solvency approach is going to be important for us. I think that the effort that we're making comes at this bottoms up in a sense that you described, which is focusing on the regulatory financial statements. And those, by the way, are intended to measure solvency. So in a lot of respects, because that's the purpose of those financial statements, they do a much better job than GAAP does, and the extrapolation and the inferences that we can draw from what we see at the regulated insurance company level then moving up to other subsidiaries in the holding company. But coming at it the other way, the issues on the GAAP balance sheet are as I described. It's not a very good economic portrayal in the line of sight to the capital of the company from various items that fall under this umbrella that we call the GAAP balance sheet varies all over the place. There are some things where our capital is directly on the hook as principal. There are other things that are reflected on the GAAP balance sheet that have virtually no line of sight at all to the capital of the company. And so as we look at it from a GAAP perspective, I think the point on our side is to try to understand the reality of the economic risk picture as opposed to the accounting convention that puts it on the books. So the answer is, yes, we've looked long and hard at all kinds of dimensions of GAAP and Basel. We've done a lot of work on understanding how we would interpret the economics of the GAAP balance sheet as it relates to risk and solvency. And that's the substance of the conversations that we're having with various regulators at this point. By the way, just making a couple of sort of rough ballpark adjustments to the economics of our balance sheet would result in Tier 1 ratio of 15% to 20%, so we're very, very well-capitalized by most economic regulatory standards. And that's why we continue to believe that as this is understood and as standards are set appropriately, companies like Prudential and others will be determined to be more than adequately capitalized. I'd add, by the way that, that the G-SIFI process has a couple of different dimensions: one is targeting either nontraditional insurance activities or noninsurance activities and trying to deal specifically analytically with those 2 aspects of our business lines; the second is a process that would take a considerable amount of time to sort out the identification and quantification of any ultimate so-called SIFI buffers. In the international arena, it's called enhanced loss absorption. But that process would be long and very interactive from our point of view with the regulators.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful, Mark. So it sounds like even if as you all have interpreted capital adequacy through a Basel lens using GAAP, you would still feel comfortable with your $1.5 billion deployable capital, at least making the adjustments that you think are appropriate?","Mark B. Grier","Yes, I think to use Basel language, if you appropriately risk-weighted the balance sheet and really understood what was there, you would conclude that we're more than fine. Let me just add one other point though, which is that it's not just scaling, it isn't just whether there's more or less capital, it's the dynamic of how capital changes in a stress test and the particular overlay of long-duration assets and long-duration liabilities for companies like Prudential and others is a big challenge. There's a lot of volatility in capital measures, as Basel would interpret them, that's not economic for us. So keep in mind, it isn't just scaling, part of it is workability and part of it is the appropriate suitability of measuring solvency and capital in the kind of businesses we're in.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just one last follow-up. Just based on at least some of the articles that have been out there on G-SIFI, at least my interpretation of what's been out there and you had referenced it, too, with some of the nontraditional insurance activities, it sounds like the life industry is -- things are probably headed in a more negative direction for variable annuities, but things are probably headed in a more favorable direction on the way general account risk-weighted assets are going to be treated. Does that seem right directionally where things are going right now, whether it's G-SIFI or nonbank SIFI?","Mark B. Grier","Well, I guess, I'd be more comfortable with the second part of it, which is, I think, there is a growing acceptance that traditional insurance doesn't present systemic risks. There's still uncertainty around nontraditional insurance and variable annuities generally would fall into that category. So that one, I'd be more uncertain about. I'm not quite sure where that's going. And at the end of the day, that's a risk that depends on longevity and investment performance. And that looks to me like a lot of other risks that we take.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to follow up on Tom's question on nonbank SIFI and this whole conversation. If I hear you talk about it, it seems like you're putting forth your arguments, you're getting feedback from FSOC. And I guess my question is, is there anybody from the insurance world other than you guys and the other big competitors that are under the same consideration? Is there anybody else from the insurance industry that's got a seat on the table? I'm thinking, I don't know if it's actuaries or NAIC regulators or just so there's a little bit of a third-party verification of some of the things that you're saying.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, a couple of things. One is that the industry groups like the ACLI are active. The NAIC is active. We're aware of the involvement of consultants. I'm not sure you would consider them to be aligned one way or another, but we're aware of the involvement of consultants and some of these examinations. And there have been some independent articles written recently by academics that are making the points that we try to make about the nature of our business and its connection to systemic risk. So I think the body of work on this is piling up above and beyond the things that we're saying and the things that, as you mentioned, our other large competitors are saying. So it's accumulating out there. And there's a fairly consistent theme, I believe, which is reinforcing the view that, as I said, we don't meet the quantitative standard to be deemed systemically important.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then, I guess, maybe you used the word soon in terms of designation. But in terms of the actual writing of the rules and I'm assuming that's going to be subject to commentary as well, I mean, what is your sense just in terms of when we might get some clarity on that? Is that a 2013 event in your mind or do you think it pushes into '14?","Mark B. Grier","I'm less sure about that. I think this will take some time to pursue a high-quality process to arrive at the right standards, and I can't really put a timeline on that.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then my -- I just had a quick follow-up for Ed on the bank channel sales in Japan. I haven't mapped the bank channel sales against the individual products, but my sense is that most of what has been sold through the banks is the single premium whole life product. And so with you guys deemphasizing that, I mean, it seems like you've invested a lot in the bank channel with the seconded life planners and all the stuff that you've talked about. Do you still think that you can generate sales growth through the bank channel beyond -- once we get beyond this hump from the difficult comps in terms of protection life? Because it seems like they continue to want to sell whatever savings-oriented products or retirement-oriented products, and that was talking about maybe mutual fund products. So I'm just wondering how big of a role the bank channels are going to play in your sales going forward.","Edward P. Baird","I can't make a forecast, but I can identify for you some of the factors that could support our perspective that there is continued growth opportunity here. One would be the number of distribution points. As you know, in the last year, we have been growing the number of distribution points and also the quality. What I mean by that is we now have all 4 of the mega banks, and 2 of those were added within the last 12 months or so. In addition, just a number of banks, meaning the extension beyond the mega banks into the regionals and into the local banks, we're now up to over 70 banks. So even without a change in strategy, just the extension of the footprint, I think we'll continue growth. Secondly, we will, I believe, deepen the penetration in these points of distribution. So for example, even now out of the 73 or so banks we're in, only 65 of them are even selling anything. So a number of them are still new, and we will gradually develop them. And then the biggest part is the point you're raising, which is the nature of the demand. And I think it's logical to realize that in the evolution of this  distribution, banks are going to concentrate in the early stages more in products that are similar to their depository products, so things like single premium, things that emphasize the savings component of it. But we see signs that with some of the more mature, more sophisticated banks, they realize the benefits to them, as well as to their customers, are gradually transitioning over into recurring premiums that focus more on the death protection. I'm particularly optimistic about our ability to tap that segment, however big or rapidly it grows, because of our unique application of our Life Planners into the banks. Because we send in not just the product, but we send in at this stage over 170 of our Life Planners. So these people are uniquely equipped in comparison to a bank teller to be able to sell a genuine death protection product as opposed to a traditional bank teller who is naturally going to focus primarily, if not exclusively, on the crediting rate that's embedded inside the product. So if you aggregate those 3, i.e., the growth and the number of distributions, secondly, the increase penetration, and then third, this gradual strategic shift, it gives me some basis for thinking that there will be steady growth in a more stable aspect. But you will see continued volatility in the sales that are related to the more of the savings aspect of it, and that's the single premium. And I think our numbers are a good example of that. In the fourth quarter last year, we were distributing through the bank channel over $500 million. And I think over 80% of that was single premium. In this quarter, it's down to about $200 million and less than 60% of that is single premium. So there will be volatility, and that will mask what I think over time will be a gradual shift and a heavy emphasis on savings to more death protection.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actually my questions at this point have been all asked and answered, so thank you very much.","Operator","Next will go to the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So with Japan, looking at the impact of the yen, can we get an update as to where you stand with hedging. I think last quarter was 78% hedge for '14, 28% hedge for '15. Can we get an update on those numbers and perhaps some color as to what yen rates you've locked in? Also, one of you competitors highlighted that movement in the yen led to escalated lapse activity on the foreign denominated products that provided a meaningful benefit to their earnings. Hoping you can comment on whether you've seen some dynamics to your results. And then just lastly on The Hartford Life transaction out of the $90 million of targeted synergies, can you provide some color as the timing of those saves? Should it be relatively linear or is it weighted towards any particular year?","Robert Michael Falzon","Okay, Nigel, it's Rob Falzon. I think I'll take the first 2 of those, I think there were 2 there. And then I'll turn over to Charlie to talk about The Hartford transaction piece of it. Let me step back and, I think, give you a holistic view of this, Nigel. I think it's helpful to put it into the context from an FX standpoint. If you look at our International earnings, only about half of those earnings are yen denominated. Remember, we've got operations in Korea. We've got other products that we sell out of Japan that are non-yen denominated. If you ignore hedging, right, and you look at the yen-dollar forward rate, it's got about a 15% to 20% move from where our planned rate is off of 2012 and 2013. So if we weren't hedged, you would see that sort of order of magnitude of decline in our earnings as a result of applying that move in the FX rate against that percentage of our earnings. But we do hedge. So first and foremost, to your direct question, we have our income hedges in place. We're 100% hedged for the next 4 quarters. We are -- our policy is to 2\/3 hedge the 4 quarters after that, and do the 1\/3 hedge quarters sort of 9 through 13. So if you look at our hedging, we're 100% for '13, we're 80% for 2014 and then we're around 35% or so for 2015. And we continue to roll into those hedges on a quarterly basis. In addition to that, we have equity hedges, so we look at the economic value of our yen-based equity and we protect that through a series of equity hedges in order to insulate the long-term ROE that we're generating to our shareholders. And we look at that -- so we look at our FX exposure holistically. We don't look at it opportunistically. In other words, we don't trade FX. We'd rather insulate ourselves from the movements up or down in FX. I think that answered the first 2 questions, if I got them correctly.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Also just the impact of the movement in the yen in terms of a policyholder behavior. Did you see some escalated lapse activity on the back of the movement in the yen?","Robert Michael Falzon","Let's ask Ed.","Edward P. Baird","Sure. Nigel, there was some activity there, but it did not -- it was limited to the Aussie dollar not to the U.S. dollar products. And in our case, it was not material to the quarter because it was essentially offset by some one-timers going the other way. So net-net nothing there that you would need to adjust for in terms of extrapolating.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Nigel, this as Charlie. In terms of the synergies, we expect them to feather in over a 3-year period. It will be slightly back-loaded, but there will be some in the first year. But if you put in your models that they'll be more back-loaded than front-loaded, that's probably accurate.","Operator","And we have time for one final question, that will be from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I was a little surprised that the balance sheet capital capacity of $3 billion didn't go down from year end, given the fact that you added $700 million of life capital, you had the ceding commission, you've had the dividend. Can you just help explain the sequential flatness, given all those factors?","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes, Mark, it's Rob again. It's actually pretty straightforward. If you look at our earnings before the impact of NPR and FX remeasurement, recall that those things are noneconomic and, therefore, they do not affect our capital capacity. That essentially entirely offset the things that you were just identifying and we wound up about even with where -- at end of the quarter with where we ended up the year.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just back to International. Obviously, it was a very strong quarter. But I mean, even after adjusting for favorable mortality, investment gains, a little bit of seasonality and some of the identified items that you pointed out, I guess it was still a fairly good quarter above certainly our own expectations. Should we be thinking about that level of earnings as a good run rate? Or is there another factors that influenced the quarter that we should be considering?","Edward P. Baird","Well, it was, as you said, a very strong quarter pretty much across the board. Beyond the identified normalizing factors, I think Mark has identified those that you might want to consider as you decide what to extrapolate going forward. I mean, on the mortality side, there was an above-normal benefit there of about $15 million on the Life Planner, about $10 million on the Gibraltar. There was a seasonality factor that one could estimate at say $20 million for the first quarter. And then the final one would be the one Mark mentioned on sort of the non-coupon investment at $25 million. But once you get past that, everything else is within the normal range and is benefiting from, frankly, just steady business growth. So you take a look inside Gibraltar, where even with a drop of 2,000 down to 10,000 in the headcount, you see an increase in sales. And that's because the productivity increased by 25% and the average premium increased by about 9%. And the reason I highlight that, to the spirit of your question of how to look forward, is this is exactly the transformation that we accomplished 10 years ago with Kyoei. And it's the key to what we're looking to do here. And that is to bring down the headcount but increase the productivity. So in spite of the 16% drop in the headcount, you see a growth in the sales of about 15% with the life consultants. So that's what gives me some confidence that there is -- as John pointed in his opening comments, there's very strong fundamentals here that I think are sustainable.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. One final question, if I may. Just on -- Mark, you made a comment about how you've limited excess contributions into the VAs, and I think you said -- I wondered if you said prior to '11 vintages. I'm curious actually why you didn't limit them in '11 and '12, and can we infer anything about kind of the comfort level in those vintages of product on the VA side?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","I'll take one, it's Charlie. We made the decision that prior to the HD series, we would limit the drop-ins, and it's pretty much as simple as that. So we went back and looked at the drop-ins, looked at the economics of them and decided that, that was going to be cut off. So that was the thought process behind it. We review that on a consistent basis, but that was the decision we made at that time.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. today until midnight, May 9.

And with that, I will hand it over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We had a very good start to the year, reporting strong earnings and showing continued underlying momentum across our businesses. I will provide some higher level observations on our results for the quarter, the core fundamental drivers in our businesses and capital deployment, and then hand it over to Mark and Rob to go through the specifics.","First quarter operating earnings of $2.76, which excludes a $0.03 benefit from market driven and discrete items, exceeded the $2.26 we reported in the first quarter of 2016, which, as you will recall was subject to considerable market headwinds. Our annualized return on equity for this quarter was very good at just over 14% which is above our near to intermediate ROE target of 12% to 13%.","Results benefited from particularly strong spread income in the quarter, with our returns on non-coupon investments outperforming our longer-term expectations. We also continue to benefit from solid underlying growth in a number of our businesses such as Retirement, Asset Management and our International businesses.","Our underwriting experience on an overall basis was slightly weaker than our average expectations as we experienced adverse mortality results in our life insurance businesses. However, this was largely offset by favorable experience in our longevity businesses, namely our Retirement segment.","First quarter has historically shown some larger swings in underwriting experience at the segment level, but we are pleased to see that the benefit of our mix of mortality and longevity businesses moderates these impacts. We also recognized higher expenses in the quarter related to a change to our long-term compensation program. This change only affected the timing of expenses during 2017. As a consequence, we reported certain expenses in the first quarter that, under former plan provisions, would've been spread throughout 2017. But overall it was a good, clean quarter without a lot of noise. Our net income per share of $3.09 was modestly above operating EPS and we continue to show solid adjusted book value per share growth, up 7% over the first quarter of 2016, which is after paying $2.85 in dividends per share.","I'll now touch on some key fundamental trends in our businesses, starting with our domestic businesses. We produced record earnings in our Retirement business. While outsize non-coupon investment results and strong case experience were the notable drivers of the earnings strength, which you will hear more from us on, Retirement also benefited from some other smaller items in the quarter. And so while we would be cautious on extrapolating current quarter adjusted results through the remainder of the year, we are very pleased with the underlying earnings trends of the retirement business. We are benefiting from solid account value growth and outstanding underwriting results, particularly from our pension risk transfer block.","Asset management had another good quarter, benefiting from positive net flows and stable overall fee rates. Total assets under management of $1.1 trillion, up 7% over the prior year, benefited from $600 million of third-party unaffiliated net flows. Notably, we set a record for unaffiliated third party assets under management of $543 billion.","Individual Annuities also had very good results, with earnings equal to the record set in the third quarter of 2016 after adjusting for market driven and discrete items. We are continuing to benefit from strong margins aided by the actions we took last year to more efficiently manage the living benefit risk and reduce capital volatility. Not surprisingly, we did see a sizable decline in variable annuity sales over the prior year, which is consistent with the pressures others in the industry have also experienced with the DOL rule uncertainty. Nevertheless, this is an important business for our franchise and we expect individual annuities to be a solid source of earnings and cash flow.","As I mentioned, our Individual Life and Group Insurance protection businesses did experience elevated mortality claims in the quarter which weighed on our results. In the case of Group Insurance, this was mitigated by favorable group disability results. We reported the second lowest disability benefit ratio in five years, which continues to reinforce the success of our recent underwriting actions.","Now turning to the International division, I would characterize our International results as solid, with few surprises. Foreign currency continues to be a modest headwind, but overall we are seeing stable quarter growth and continued steady results. Sales overall were strong, up 8% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. This was driven by particular strength in our Life Planner channel, which was up 34%.","We did experience a sales surge in advance of a premium rate increase on yen-based products in Japan, but, more broadly, we continue to show good growth in our Life Planner count, solid increases in U.S. dollar product sales and overall favorable fundamentals. Partly offsetting the strength in the Life Planner segment, we experienced lower year-over-year sales at Gibraltar due to declines in the bank channel.","Our adherence to profitability standards and the nature of third-party bank distribution does give rise to the potential for more sales variability. In that regard, we terminated sales of certain yen-based products last year in response to interest rate declines and I would add that bank channel sales for the industry are also showing pressure.","Moving to capital deployment. We returned $640 million to shareholders in the quarter, which was about equally split between dividends and share repurchases. We have a robust capital position and generate considerable free cash flow. This puts us in a good position to continue to invest in our businesses for long-term growth while also returning large amounts of capital to our shareholders.","And finally before handing it over to Mark, I would conclude by observing that there's obviously a fair amount of uncertainty in the broader environment around topics like tax reform, regulation, the direction of interest rates and policies that affect the macroeconomic landscape. While we don't know how all of this will play out, we remain highly active in our advocacy efforts to make sure that our ability to deliver strong customer value while also producing strong shareholder value remains intact.","Additionally, we benefit from our superior mix of businesses and diverse sources of earnings, supported by a strong capital position that positions us well to deliver differentiated returns and a high level of free cash flow. And further, this combination puts us in an optimal position to capitalize on opportunities and succeed across a wide variety of outcomes and circumstances.","And, with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark?","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights.","I'm starting on slide two. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.79 per share for the quarter compared to $2.18 a year ago. After adjusting for $0.03 per share of market-driven and discrete items, EPS amounted to $2.76 for this quarter, up from $2.26 a year ago and implying an ROE of 14.1% on an annualized basis.","Core performance of our businesses was strong in the quarter, with earnings from asset-based fees in Asset Management, Annuities and Retirement about $100 million higher than a year ago, driven by market appreciation and positive flows. In addition, results benefited from continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis as well as greater spread margins, partially offset by higher expenses.","As John mentioned earlier, current quarter results also benefited from a few notable or inherently variable items. Non-coupon investment returns and pre-payment income were about $125 million above our average expectations in the current quarter. We experienced modestly unfavorable net underwriting results as compared to our average expectations. This reflects adverse mortality experience in our Life Insurance business which was mostly offset by favorable case experience in our Retirement business. These items together had a net benefit of about $0.15 per share in the current quarter.","In addition, current quarter expenses reflect the impact of modification to certain provisions within our long-term compensation program, where a minor change in retiree service requirements triggered a change in the timing of expense recognition. This resulted in an expense of approximately $80 million, or $0.12 per share, which would previously have been recognized in subsequent quarters of 2017. While the plan modification only affects the timing of when certain expenses are recognized in a given year, it is a permanent change and, therefore, will affect the pattern of expenses in future years as well.","On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.4 billion for the current quarter, about $100 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income.","Moving to slide three. For the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items consist only of our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the Annuity business, driven mainly by the performance of equities in our customer accounts, which resulted in a net benefit of $0.03 per share.","Turning to slide four. Our GAAP net income of $1.4 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment gains of $38 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to a net pre-tax gain of $72 million. The current quarter net realized investment gains were driven by pre-tax gains in our International Insurance Investment portfolio, partially offset by losses from other risk management derivatives, including currency hedges, as the yen strengthened modestly during the quarter.","Moving to our business results and starting on slide five, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Annuities earnings were $449 million for the quarter, up by $68 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income, primarily a result of an 8% increase in our variable annuity average account values as well as the continued benefit from our refinement in risk management strategy for product guarantees, which we implemented in 2016. Also contributing to the growth in earnings was more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and pre-payment fees about $15 million above our average expectations.","The increase in return on assets, or ROA, from a year ago to 114 basis points includes the benefit of changes in our risk management strategy for product guarantees as well as more favorable investment results. Quarterly ROA can vary from a baseline and the current quarter and the third quarter of 2016 both benefited from items that were stronger than what we would expect as a base case.","Slide six presents our annuity sales. Total gross sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter are down by $600 million from a year ago. This trend in gross sales reflects the actions we have taken to reprice our PDI product as well as the broader industry sales pressure seen, we believe, in response to the anticipation of the DOL fiduciary rule.","Turning to slide seven, Retirement earnings were $397 million for the quarter, up by $178 million from a year ago. This increase was driven by a greater contribution from net investment results, more favorable case experience and higher fee income. The contribution from net investment results was up $135 million from a year ago. Current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $65 million above our average expectations, compared to a contribution about $40 million below expectations a year ago. Higher spread-based account values also contributed to the stronger net investment results. Current quarter case experience was about $50 million more favorable than our average expectations, primarily from our pension risk transfer business which continues to perform very well.","Turning to slide eight, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $10.8 billion for the current quarter compared to $8.7 billion a year ago. The increase was driven by higher institutional investment products sales in the current quarter including two longevity reinsurance cases totaling about $2 billion and a modest increase in stable value wrap sales. Total Retirement account values were a record $396 billion, up 6% from a year earlier. This includes the benefit from market appreciation as well as $5 billion of positive net flows over the past year.","The modest net outflows in the quarter reflect the episodic nature of the large case business inherent in both full service and institutional investment products, as well as the impact of the normal runoff of group annuity and longevity reinsurance cases. In addition, there was an increase in participant withdrawals due to market activity.","Turning to slide nine, Asset Management earnings were $196 million for the quarter compared to $165 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher Asset Management fees and a greater contribution from other related revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in Asset Management fees reflected greater fees from growth in fixed income assets under management and the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate in the third quarter of last year.","The current quarter included about $25 million of expense related to modifications of certain provisions within our long-term compensation program which I mentioned earlier. Asset Management reported about $600 million of net unaffiliated third party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, driven by another quarter of strong fixed income flows.","Turning to slide 10, Individual Life earnings were $118 million for the quarter compared to $120 million a year ago. Higher expenses and adverse claims experience were partially offset by a greater contribution from net investment results. Earnings for the current quarter reflected claims experience that was about $50 million below our average expectations compared to claims experience about $35 million below expectations a year ago. We do not adjust our average quarterly expectations for seasonal variances. However, it is not uncommon for us to experience adverse mortality in the first quarter. The higher contribution from net investment results included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $15 million above our average expectations in comparison to results of about $10 million below our average expectations a year ago.","Turning to slide 11, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were essentially unchanged from a year ago and down about $37 million from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. The sequential quarter decrease came mainly from Guaranteed and Other Universal Life, including tax and estate planning sales that tend to peak in the fourth quarter. The prior quarter also reflected accelerated purchases in advance of price increases and face amount limits we implemented for our Guaranteed Universal Life products.","Moving to slide 12, Group Insurance earnings were $34 million for the quarter, up by $8 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results partially offset by less favorable underwriting results and higher expenses. Current quarter earnings included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees that were about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations, compared to about $10 million below average expectations a year ago. The current quarter total benefits ratio was at the midpoint of our long-term targeted range of 87% to 91%, reflecting less favorable Group Life experience offset by favorable Group Disability experience.","Turning to slide 13, most of our Group Insurance sales occur in the first quarter reflecting calendar year effective dates. Current quarter sales based on annualized new business premiums of $301 million were solid and slightly lower than the year ago quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by the absence of a large life case sale in the year ago quarter partially offset by growth in Disability sales.","Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 14. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $408 million for the quarter compared to $410 million a year ago. Excluding a $13 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $11 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth with constant dollar insurance revenues up 7% from a year ago, partially offset by less favorable policy benefits experience with claims experience about $15 million less favorable than our average expectations. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $25 million in relation to the quarterly average.","Turning to slide 15, Gibraltar Life earnings were $391 million for the quarter compared to $369 million a year ago. Excluding a $2 million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $24 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth including a full-quarter contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile which was acquired in March of last year. In addition, results reflect the greater contribution from net investment results partially offset by less favorable policy benefit experience. The contribution from net investment results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees modestly above our average expectations compared to about $20 million below average expectations a year ago. Mortality experience in the quarter was about $10 million less favorable than our average expectations compared to slightly more favorable than average expectations a year ago.","Turning to slide 16, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $825 million for the current quarter, up by $61 million or 8% from a year ago. This includes a 6% increase in Japan driven by higher Life Planner sales, partially offset by lower bank channel sales in Gibraltar. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 41% from a year ago, reflecting an elevated level of sales in advance of repricing actions associated with the standard discount rate changes on yen-based products effective April 1. Also contributing to the sales increase was an 8% increase in the Life Planner count in Japan driven by sales manager appointments and higher retention.","Gibraltar sales were down by 14% from a year ago, driven by a decline in bank channel sales. This includes the effects of terminating sales of single premium yen-based products in 2016, increased competition, as well as the impacts of an industrywide decline in bank channel sales. About half of our sales in Japan in the quarter were from U.S. dollar products. This percentage is down sequentially from 60% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the higher yen-based sales in Life Planner in advance of premium rate changes as well as lower bank channel sales which primarily consist of U.S. dollar products. We continue to benefit from our long-standing competitive advantages in distribution of U.S. dollar products in Japan, emphasizing recurring premium death protection products with returns mainly based on mortality and expense margins. Sales outside Japan are up 18% from a year ago driven by continued growth in Brazil and increased sales in Korea.","Turning to slide 17, the Corporate and Other loss was $352 million for the current quarter compared to a $312 million loss a year ago. The increased loss was driven mainly by higher expenses. The current quarter included an expense of about $25 million related to modifications of certain provisions within our long-term compensation plan as I mentioned earlier, and higher compensation expenses that are linked to equity returns including our share price.","Going the other way, results reflect lower interest expense from our pay downs of debt last year, a higher contribution from net investment income and higher income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year-end.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide a brief update on the key balance sheet items and financial measures starting on slide 18.","Following the recapture of our living benefit risks and the refinements we made to our risk management strategies in 2016, most of the contract risks and supporting capital for annuities reside in our PALAC statutory entity. Therefore, we view the RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance or PICA and PALAC, as well as the composite RBC shown here, to be important measures of our financial strength. Having said that, recall that we manage our annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding total assets to a CTE 97 level with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time, we may see some variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC over our target ratio.","At December 31, 2016 the PICA, PALAC and composite ratios were 457%, 867% and 527% respectively and we estimate that they continue to be well above our target at the end of the first quarter.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margin ratios of 841% and 967%, respectively, as of December 31. These solvency margin ratios are comfortably above our targets and we estimate that they continue to be so at the end of the first quarter.","Looking at the liquidity leverage and capital deployment highlights on slide 19. Cash and highly liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4 billion at the end of the quarter. The decline of about $600 million from year end was primarily driven by our shareholder distributions exceeding capital inflows from the businesses in the first quarter. I would highlight that distributions received for the businesses are not uniform across all quarters. Recall that the parent company received a $1 billion distribution from PALAC in the fourth quarter of 2016 and historically has received a significant dividend from PICA in the second quarter.","During the first quarter, we returned about $640 million to shareholders, including $327 million of dividends and $312 million of share repurchases under the $1.25 billion authorization for the year. And finally, our financial and total leverage ratios declined modestly from year end and remained within our targets as of the end of the first quarter.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Rob. Let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I had a question on the Life Planner count. I guess the 8% increase in Japan was pretty significant. Can you give a little bit more color on the dynamic there and as well as your expectations going forward?","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure, Ryan. It's Charlie. You're right in your observation that it is a new record count for POJ. And it really has to do with a couple of things actually. One is our concentration on sales managers and creating more sales managers. And obviously when you do that, they then go out and recruit more Life Planners. And sales managers were up about 8% year over year.","But there's another initiative that we started last year, which I think is pretty interesting and pretty exciting, and that is that we put a team together to try and attract more women to become Life Planners. And last year, we actually hired 82 women LPs in 2016, which represented about 13% of all recruits.","Now, those are really the two main reasons why I think Life Planners have increased and there has been, I think, a higher level of increase than we've seen in the past. So I think in general, the long-term average for POJ has been about 2% to 4%, and we've been a little hotter than that in the past few quarters. But I think as you think about it going forward, probably 2% to 4% is the right number.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then related question was just how much of the sales in Japan in Life Planner this quarter would you characterize as more accelerated ahead of the discount rate reduction versus other products that aren't going to be impacted?","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, POJ sales were up, as was stated earlier, about 41%. And part of that is the fire sale or the accelerated sale in front of the standard discount rate change. But I think part of it also has to do with product mix and it also has to do with the first quarter. So let me go through that. The first quarter is obviously POJ's highest quarter, and that's because of some of the annualized premiums that come in and it's also the end of the qualification period for Life Planners. So POJ always has a strong first quarter. But I think the other reason is you're seeing a shift to U.S. dollar product.","So what was so interesting I think about this quarter is, while there was increased activity from the Life Planners as they went out and talked to their clients about potentially purchasing insurance product ahead of the standard rate change in the premium increases, they did that for yen product, but they actually sold proportionally more dollar product. So dollar sales were up 50%, whereas Japanese yen product sales were only up 38%. So, in total, dollar sales were 31% as opposed to 29% a year ago.","So I think there was some increase obviously that can be attributed to the fire sale, but the first quarter's always a good quarter for POJ. So I don't have an exact percentage, but if you look back a couple of years, you'll see there is always a slight peak in the first quarter and then it goes down in the second quarter. I think that would be accelerated this time around because you've probably taken some of the second quarter sales that would have occurred in the second quarter and accelerated them to the first quarter.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. Thanks a lot, Charlie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. So I had a question first on just the drivers behind weak sales at Gibraltar. I think they were down around 14%. And then relatedly, you'd mentioned increased competition in Japan when speaking about Gibraltar. So wondering if you could just give us details on which product lines or specific channels you're seeing that in.","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure. The weak sales in Gibraltar are really entirely attributed to the bank channel. So let me start with that and then I'll come back to the other question. But the full story to explain the bank channel trend really consists of a few contributing factors. First and foremost, as John mentioned, we've always viewed the bank channel as a complementary distribution channel where we're committed to growing profitably. So sales will vary. And we saw that some a few years ago as well.","But, as such, following the negative interest rate play or policy in early 2016, we took very swift action to suspend sales of all yen-based single-pay products. And the absence of those single-pay sales this quarter represented roughly a third of the year-over-year decline. So it was a tough comparison year-over-year.","Secondly, we're seeing our competitors begin to offer more easily sold recurring-pay products, primarily yen denominated, which has had an impact on the sales in the first quarter. And this is because we primarily sell one yen-based denominated recurring premium product in the bank channel, which is a whole life product that's sold for estate planning purposes and, consequently, requires more time and explanation to be sold. We can do that because of the (35:33) LPs we have there, and so it's a more sophisticated type of sale. And while we understand that our competitors' recurring pay products, the yen products were popular ahead of repricing, we continue to main our discipline around product, profitability and pricing.","As an example, we suspended further sales of any three- or five-pay recurring premium whole life product after April 1 because much of that becomes an advance pay. That becomes a single premium product with the advance pay option.","And then thirdly, there has been some decline in sales as a result of certain banks enforcing tighter control over the sales process in connection with essentially, a fiduciary duty standard. And this really exerts itself in the form of banks not enforcing month-end sales targets. And so I think you've seen all bank sales across the industry decline slightly. So as a result of this, our bank sales declined by about 32%, but the mix of sales we did also continues to migrate to non-yen sales.","So just as I said in the previous question with POJ, U.S. dollar product sales increased this quarter to 83% from 68% a year ago and total non-yen sales which includes Aussie dollar and U.S. dollar increased 90% from 75% a year ago. And this is consistent with what I'd call our kind of simple philosophy, and that is we'd rather sell less more-profitable product than more less-profitable product. And as a result, we feel pretty good about the results in the bank channel this quarter.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful detail. And I notice there was a decline in the Life Planner count outside of Japan, I think down about 2% or so from last year. Can you give us some details on which markets drove that?","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. Overall Life Planner count went up. Outside of Japan it went down slightly, but what we've done is we have raised recruiting standards and validation requirements in a number of countries in order to make sure that we're hiring the right people. And so that was particularly in Korea and Taiwan where we did that, and the result was that fewer Life Planners were able to stay on, essentially. And we've hired a few less as the recruiting standards have increased. So that's a case of really protecting the quality of the franchise if you will, and you'll see us do that in all the countries as we continue to raise the bar as we go through. But Brazil still has very good Life Planner count growth and that counteracted some of the decrease in the other countries.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee, Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just looking at Asset Management's profitability, it looks continue to improve, even when I account for the asset \u2013 the AUM growth, there seems to be some margin expansion going on there. Can you maybe talk about at a high level in terms of what you see as the earnings power for Asset Management? And then also maybe comment on the expenses excluding the long-term compensation charge in the quarter.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Humphrey, it's Steve. I'll address your question by mentioning a couple of points. First of all, in terms of average fee levels, we've been able to maintain those. Even we've seen equity market \u2013 equity outflows, but we've seen substantial inflows in fixed income, in real estate, in our origination businesses, our private debt and mortgage origination businesses, all of which are relatively \u2013 especially certain parts of fixed income where we've been able to attract close \u2013 are relatively higher fee levels. In fact, in real estate, we were able to raise the fees as we mentioned last year on our existing asset base and that's been attractive.","Second, kind of taking the next part of the equation in computing margin, a lot of our flows has been into our fixed income business and that is a business where the scale economies of our platform are exceptionally attractive. So all of that really relates to being able to sustain our fee levels, even in the face of pricing pressures across the industry. We're not immune to those pressures, but we've been able to attract flows into categories that have solid fee levels and the margins inherent in our scale economies.","In regard to the expenses, we do continue to see expense growth in the business, but that's by design. We're investing in this business significantly. We've been investing both in terms of expanding our investment capabilities and in terms of our distribution platforms. And as you'd expect, those investments are starting to pay off. It kind of stands to reason that the distribution investments start to pay off first and a lot of our flows that we've seen, particularly in fixed income, have come from international markets, in particular Japan, and that's directly attributable to the investments we've made in our global institutional distribution platform.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Appreciate the color. So maybe a question for Charlie. Looking at the life insurance business in Japan, there's definitely a discussion about mortality table change that will affect the pricing. Can you talk about what that may potentially impact Gibraltar or Life Planner's topline and sales growth outlook?","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure. Humphrey, let me take that sort of generally. As you said, the new Japan statutory mortality table has been released as an exposure draft. It's expected to go into effect for new business issued after April 1, 2018. At least that's what they're saying at this point. And as expected, life mortality rates are lower than the prior 2007 table.","And while this will put some downward pressure on profitability protection products, there are mitigating options such as revisions to expense loading and other things and also lower statutory mortality rates result in lower cash values and statutory reserves, reducing the statutory strain associated with new business. So with the mortality tables, there are going to be ups and downs and we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. But the good news is we still have some time. So we'll wait and see but we think we'll be able to deal with it.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Good morning. First question, more of a strategic question for you, John. I'm curious about your appetite, if at all, for Group Insurance acquisitions. I ask because while you're a size player, Prudential is a size player in that market, it's clearly not a significant contributor to your overall earnings. And so I'm curious whether you would have an appetite to make the Group Insurance business a bigger contributor of the M&A if the opportunity was available.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So John, let me start with a bigger picture response of just how we're thinking about M&A in general, or opportunities in general, and then M&A more particularly. And then I'll turn it over to Steve to speak more specifically to Group.","When we think about opportunities, actually our starting point is around organic because organic's cheaper, it's less intrusive and it's also able to be more custom tailored to the specific needs that we're seeing in terms of our customer set. So we continue to think this is a really good time for a strong brand, strong capital position and a leadership team with the skills to both evolve the business in a natural organic way, but also to innovate.","And when you look at our track record of converting those kind of opportunities into realities, it's one that inspires confidence in our ability to continue to do that looking forward. Now, when we think about M&A, it's more of a nice to do, not have to do, meaning \u2013 you've heard me say that before, meaning it's not critical to strategic positioning and we're not depending on it to achieve our financial objectives.","But nevertheless, it can play an important role in our long-term success. So in the recent past, that's been things like Habitat just in the last 12 months or so. Habitat pension business, the Deutsche Bank investment management business in India, step-up of our ownership in our India life insurance business or, most recently, the Group Insurance business acquisition from Ita\u00fa in Brazil. So there's a not necessarily high profile in each individual case, but in aggregate they're meaningful and strategically they're important in terms of our long-term positioning.","Now, that's sort of a construct around both opportunities in general, the role of organic and generally how we're thinking about M&A. Let me turn it over to Steve to speak more specifically to your question on Group.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, John. John, I'd address the Group perspective as follows: we're certainly aware of and alert to opportunities that may appear from time to time in the space. We are certainly a \u2013 have stronger capabilities to be in acquirer than we did say a few years ago due to the investments we've made in our business platform and the way we've strengthened the business platform and we have an interest to grow. We see the Group business as an attractive one, both in its own right and as a highly effective client acquisition model for relationships that we can deepen and individualize across our businesses.","At the same time, I'd pick up on some of the themes that John just mentioned. We have good momentum in organic growth in the business and we're mindful of continuing that and that's really what our priority is. And I'd also say that some of the things that have taken place in the group market recently have done so at fairly full valuation shall we say and so while we're alert to opportunities that appear, we're going to be disciplined and measured in the way we approach our own valuation of those opportunities.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Very, very much appreciate that last comment especially. And then I have a follow-up for Mark on the regulatory side. Any insight yet, Mark, into what's likely to come out of the review of FSOC's designation process, especially as it relates to SIFI insurance companies? And if ultimately your SIFI designation was rescinded, how does that impact your G-SII designation? Is that automatically rescinded as well since you're not deemed systemic by your home regulator? How does that work?","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Right. On the current outlook, we've expressed optimism about the general tone of the discussion in Washington around regulation, and more specifically, around SIFI designation. And I think it's challenging to predict specific outcomes, but we continue to believe that as time passes and as either processes or specific designations are reviewed, we expect that ultimately we may not wind up as a SIFI. Exactly how we get there, I'm not quite sure. So it's work in process. It's an uncertain environment, but we think the tone of things is moving in the right direction in terms of the regulatory burden, and the consideration of non-bank SIFIs in particular.","With respect to G-SII designation, the two don't go hand in hand. And having our domestic designation rescinded would not result in necessarily the removal of the G-SII designation. That comes from the FSB, the Financial Stability Board. And there have been circumstances where there are differences between being domestically significant and internationally significant. So that's not in the cards. Those things won't necessarily move together.","Having said that, though, remember that there is no mechanism currently to directly implement any standards as it relates to our G-SII designation. Right now, that process would depend on Federal Reserve supervision. As New Jersey plays a role as a group supervisor, we'll see how they deal with the international aspects of questions and issues related to supervision. So that's out there as a channel, or mechanism, for enforcing G-SII standards, but I'd say we're not quite there yet.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood. So New Jersey could play the Federal Reserve role potentially?","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yes. They are currently a group supervisor of ours.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question then comes from the line of Suneet Kamath, Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to start on slide six of your earnings deck on the Annuity business. If I look at the mix of annuities HDI retained by PRU, that percentage of your total has gone up year-over-year. And I guess two questions related to that. What are the impacts that that reinsurance arrangement is now expired? And then, second, is another reason just DOL and the fact that advisors are now more focused on living benefit types of products?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Suneet, this is Steve. I'll address your question as follows. I think that in terms of the change of mix, you're looking at a couple of different things. First of all, yes, the reinsurance arrangement with Union Hamilton did expire. They informed us and other counterparties that they've reached capacity for this line of business. And I think that another contributing factor is the decline in PDI sales that Mark referenced in his opening comments.","PDI is sensitive to pricing changes. As we've discussed before, we have a unique capability across the industry to reprice monthly from new sales in several of our product lines, including PDI. Twice last year, in the face of a very low interest rate environment, we took down the PDI benefit and we saw impact of sales in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. So that was a driver of what you're pointing to.","I will mention, though, that we did take the benefit back up in February. Market conditions and higher interest rates permitted us to do that while still writing business at target returns. So we have seen a pick-up in PDI sales momentum over the last month of the quarter.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just shifting to Retirement, and specifically PRT. Has there been any change in either, I'll call it the supply or capacity to do PRT transactions by the industry, or demand on the part of plan sponsors to execute such a transaction, given where we are with interest rates?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. First off, in terms of the competitive environment, there are several competitors in the space. Some of them are sharpening their appetite. So we see capacity, at a minimum, holding steady, if not increasing. So that's been the case for some time now and that trend continues.","In regard to the pipeline, we see a very robust pipeline. The rate environment is at a sweet spot right now in that regard. There's been a pick-up in rates from last year and that's improved plan funding levels, and so that certainly strengthens the ability of plan sponsors to transact. At the same time, though, most plan sponsors don't seem to anticipate near-term rapid further increases in rates, so their propensity to transact still remains strong.","And, of course, there are other contributing factors to that propensity to transact, like rising PBGC premiums and heightened awareness of longevity risk. So the business will remain episodic, but we see the pipeline as being very solid.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And with that increase in supply by insurance companies, is that creating any pricing pressures in terms of these competitive dynamics?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","The business is a price competitive one. And at the same time, though, our focus in the midsize to large cases really continues to work for us. It's an area where, while there's certainly a need to be price competitive, we see that the competition takes place across a number of dimensions, including strength of the value proposition, including our certainty of close and our very effective process for shepherding a transaction to closing.","Large case market also gives us very robust information and census data that enables us to fully deploy our underwriting skills. And, in particular, the large case market also involves assets in kind rather than being a cash market, as the smaller end of the market is. Those assets in kind and our ability to take those over and redeploy them really plays to our asset management skills.","So for all those reasons, while we're not absent from all spectrums of the market, we, relatively speaking, write less in the small end that is all about price competition and write more in the larger segments of the market where some of these value-added dimensions can come into play.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question is from the line of Tom Gallagher, Evercore. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Hey, Charlie, I just wanted to circle back on Japan. So I get your comments on the changes in pricing on some of the end products, but you've had very good momentum for your U.S. dollar and Aussie dollar products for a while here. Can you provide a little perspective on what's been happening there? Are those high-margin products, well above yen? What is competition like in that end of the market and do you think you can sustain pretty good sales momentum for the foreign currency products?","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So let me make a couple of comments in general and then I'll come back to kind of competition. So looking at our Japan business, much of what we sell, in fact two-thirds of what we sell is protection. And so we are in a segment of the market right off the top that many other people either aren't in or kind of shy away from. And that's because of the strength of our distribution model. So two-thirds of our business or three-quarters of our business comes from what I'd call our tied agency system, and only about a third comes from third-party distribution. So we're able to sell protection products because of the sophistication of our Life Planners and Life Plan consultants.","The second point I'd make is that most of our product, over 90% of our product is recurring premium product, and the rest is almost all fixed annuities or annuities that re-price every two weeks. So again, we sell a more sophisticated product. And then on top of that, we're able to sell U.S. dollar product. And that's really I think one of the competitive advantages that you see that we've had and we continue to have as we shift our business mix to U.S. dollar product, which is by \u2013 I will say by definition. It's not by definition, but is more profitable than yen product. So yen product we're selling, it's within our target range. Quite frankly, before the re-pricing, it was probably at the lower end of our target range. But the dollar product is at the high end of our target range. And we look at the business mix of all that together and it's \u2013 that is what produces the momentum and the profitability of our franchise.","Now in terms of competition, we haven't seen much competition in our captive channels for U.S. dollar product, nor in the IA channel. That's partly because of the nature of what we sell, which I said was death protection, and it's partly due to the way in which we sell it, through needs-based selling through the sophistication of our Life Planners and Life Plan consultants. We have seen some increased competition in the bank channel but, frankly, not as much as we might've expected. So there is some there, but we have seen \u2013 we haven't seen as much as we might've thought we would. So again, I think we're in a fairly reasonable place in terms of the momentum we have and the way in which we're conducting our business.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","And so the foreign currency products you're selling are mainly protection? I would've thought a lot of that would've been driven by the spread on interest rates and more for the investment orientation of the product.","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","No. Again, if you think, two thirds of what we sell is protection product. That's the basis of our franchise. And so there is some investment component in some of the product, but most of it, you think about the amount of mortality and expense margin that we have from our protection products. We rely much more on that than we do on spread margin.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then just my final question. Just curious, I think you've been asked this before, just on economic solvency in Japan and whether you guys would provide an estimate of what that ratio would be for you, or just some perspective on the way you view your solvency under SMR. And then more under some economic framework and whether it gets better or worse when you think about change, ultimate change in where the regulatory environment may go.","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Hey, Tom. It's Rob. Let me try to take a stab at that. So as you're alluding to, the JFSA is working on developing a more economically sensitive solvency regime to either evolve or complement the SRM regime that's currently in place. It's important. This is a long-term project, Tom. Development of any replacement is going to be something that's going to be beyond even what the IAIS is talking about. So think about it as being beyond a 2020 sort of a timetable. They have conducted field tests. We've participated in those. The field tests were modeled after some of the things that were being done by the IAIS.","Importantly, what came out of those field tests, we think that the lesson that came out of that for the JFSA was that it pointed to the inherent flaws in some of the constructs that are being floated, particularly as it applies to life companies and life companies that are selling long-duration life products like the Japanese insurers. So when you see the composite ratios that were released from that, it sort of indicates that it didn't work very well for the Japanese companies and that's \u2013 wasn't a surprise to us and I think it was helpful in terms of an education process for the regulators.","With respect to us, our Japan business is extremely well-capitalized. We see this in our existing solvency margin ratios and we see it in our own internal economic ratios. So we have, and always have, and will continue to manage our business with an economic lens and hold capital to the higher of whatever is required from either a statutory or an economic standpoint. We would expect this to be evident in any appropriate solvency regime that the FSA might develop over the next course of the next several years.","And to answer the question that you didn't ask but I'm sure was the intent of your question, we don't expect our capital redeployment in Japan to be in any way affected by the evolution of the solvency margin regime in Japan and have no intents at this point to change our philosophy or distribution targets.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 1:30 p.m. today, running through May 11, 2017, at midnight.

Please go ahead, sir.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, Chairman and CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark, and Rob, and then we will answer your questions.","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide higher-level observations on the quarter, the core fundamental trends in our businesses and capital deployment, and then hand it over to Mark and Rob to cover the specifics.","We had a few moving parts that impacted reported results in the quarter. Looking through those items, one can see that we reported strong results. Second quarter adjusted operating income, excluding market-driven and discrete items of $2.93 per share, was well above the prior year of $2.46 per share. The annualized ROE for the quarter on the same basis was over 14%, exceeding our near-to-intermediate term objective of 12% to 13%.","Results for the quarter reflect the benefits from positive net flows and favorable equity markets in our fee-based businesses, top line growth in our International businesses and overall strong margins. While results for the quarter were better than we would ordinarily expect partly due to items that were inherently variable, we are pleased with our overall operating earnings trends.","We did experience some volatility in our reported results in the quarter. Reported adjusted operating income of $2.09 per share and net income of $1.12 per share were adversely impacted by adjustments taken as a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions and other reserve refinements. These adjustments primarily affected our Individual Life business.","To put this in context, over the last few years, we've undergone a process of upgrading our systems across our Domestic businesses. This has enabled us to model our data at a more granular level and create efficiencies in our businesses. As you migrate to enhanced systems, there can be impact to reserve balances due to calculation differences as well as revisions to estimates facilitated by these enhanced capabilities. And these items comprise the majority of the impact to the quarter. Updates to our underlying policyholder behavior and capital markets assumptions overall had a relatively modest impact on our results.","In addition to the annual review of actuarial assumptions, net income in the quarter was impacted by mark-to-market losses in our variable annuity businesses, due mainly to items we view as non-economic, and, therefore, don't hedge, as Mark will discuss.","Overall, you can look through these significant items and see that the earnings power, cash generation and capital position of our combined businesses all remain in a very strong position, largely unaffected by the volatility we experienced in the quarter.","I will now touch on key fundamental trends in our businesses, starting with our Domestic businesses. We reported very good earnings in our Individual Annuities business, driven by record account values and exceptionally strong margins. We continue to benefit from the actions we took in 2016 to more effectively and efficiently manage the product guarantees in our variable annuity business.","The particularly strong return on assets in the quarter of 127 basis points exceeds our run rate expectation for the business, which continues to generate very good core margins and earnings and represents a strong source of cash flow to the holding company.","Retirement core earnings were also strong benefiting from record account values, another quarter of favorable case experience in our pension risk transfer business and better than expected investment performance.","Results have continued to trend modestly above our internal expectations, even after adjusting for the favorable items we call out. Having said that, Retirement's earnings power is very good and we remain optimistic on the long-term growth and earnings characteristics of this business.","Net flows were negative in the quarter, largely reflecting the quarterly lumpiness that we observe in this business. Nevertheless, we are pleased with the $1.6 billion funded pension risk transfer case we closed in the quarter, and have onboarded a $5.7 billion defined contribution plan that we closed early in the third quarter.","Our Asset Management business, or PGIM, had another outstanding result, generating solid earnings and outstanding net flows of $7.7 billion for the quarter. Total assets under management of $1.1 trillion and unaffiliated third-party assets under management of $565 billion were both records. PGIM continues to benefit from strong investment performance, and the pipeline for new mandates remains robust.","Results from our U.S. protection businesses were mixed. It was clearly a challenging quarter for our Individual Life Insurance business. Notably, results reflect a lowered expectation of earnings due to the ongoing impact from the annual actuarial assumption review. However, our Group Insurance business delivered very strong earnings, driven by a benefit ratio that was the lowest in recent memory. It was a nice bounce-back quarter for Group Insurance after seasonally lighter first quarter results, and our underwriting trends continue to perform very well.","I will now turn to our International businesses, which had one of its strongest core earnings quarters on record and generated 14% growth in constant currency sales. The quarter benefited from stable growth, better-than-expected underwriting margins, and other areas of favorability. Life Planner constant currency sales increased 23% over the prior year, which reflects the continued impact from a sales surge related to the repricing of yen-based products in Japan.","Gibraltar sales increased 8% over the prior year on a constant currency basis, benefiting from the same sales dynamic. While the acceleration in sales produced strong growth in our yen products at both Life Planner and Gibraltar, I would highlight that growth in our U.S. dollar products in Japan increased 18% over the prior year and comprised over 50% of our Japan sales.","Shifting to capital deployment, we returned approximately $640 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter, about equally split between dividends and buybacks. We have a robust capital position and generate considerable free cash flow, which enable us to return healthy amounts of capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in our businesses for long-term growth.","On that note, we recently announced a realignment of our U.S. businesses that will better position us to leverage our business mix to capture long-term growth opportunities within and across our Domestic businesses. As we communicated at our June Investor Day, we believe that our unique capabilities, customer base, and culture of innovation and collaboration put us in an enviable position to deliver needed products to customers at attractive returns to our shareholders.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights.","I'll start on slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.09 per share for the quarter compared to $1.84 a year ago. After adjusting for $0.84 per share of market-driven and discrete items, which I will discuss momentarily, EPS amounted to $2.93 for the quarter, up from $2.46 a year ago, as the core performance of our businesses overall was strong in the quarter.","Looking across our businesses, I'll mention a few highlights of results compared to a year ago. First, fees from our Individual Annuities and Asset Management businesses increased by about $160 million, reflecting market appreciation and positive flows. We also benefited from refinements to our annuities risk management strategy, which was implemented last year. Second, continued business growth in our International Insurance business on a constant currency basis. Third, a lower loss from Corporate & Other operations, driven by favorable fluctuations in expenses and investment income.","These benefits were partially offset by higher expenses in several of our businesses. In addition, current quarter results also included a few inherently variable items. We experienced $80 million of favorable net underwriting results as compared to our average expectations. Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $55 million above our average expectations. And we incurred higher-than-typical expenses in our Life Planner business of about $25 million. These variable items had a net positive impact on current quarter results of about $0.16 per share. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $5.69 for the first half of 2017 implies an ROE of 14.4% on an annualized basis.","On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $491 million for the current quarter, or $1.12 per share, about $400 million below our after-tax adjusted operating income. This difference was mainly driven by a negative impact from product derivatives, which I will discuss shortly.","Moving to slide 3. This year's actuarial review, including reserve updates and refinements for our ongoing businesses, resulted in a net unfavorable pre-tax impact of $492 million, including a net charge of $622 million to AOI, partially offset by a net benefit of $130 million outside of AOI. The annual updates to insurance assumptions were generally modest across our businesses with the exception of Individual Life, where the updates aggregated to a net charge of $560 million.","This charge is driven by the following items. During the quarter, we completed an upgrade of an Individual Life valuation system. This resulted in an increase in reserves from a refinement in the calculation of estimated mortality claims. In addition, our Individual Life systems upgrades provided enhanced cash flow estimates that enabled us to revise our reinsurance accounting methodology, which accelerated the recognition of reinsurance expense. These two items accounted for most of the Individual Life charge in the quarter, with the remainder due to other factors including modestly lower lapse experience in our Guaranteed Universal Life block.","The overall impact of the changes in policyholder behavior and capital market assumption was largely offsetting across our businesses. I would highlight that this year's review of economic assumptions included a reduction in expected long-term fixed income returns. While returns vary by duration, we reduced our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate by 25 basis points, and now grade to 3.75% over 10 years.","In Japan, we reduced the long-term expected return by 40 basis points on Japanese government bonds and now grade to 1.5% over 10 years. Our expected long-term U.S. equity returns remain largely unchanged. As John mentioned, the annual actual update had a largely inconsequential impact on future earnings as the favorable effects on our Annuities and Retirement businesses mostly offset the unfavorable effect on our Individual Life business. And our view of capital capacity was also largely unaffected.","Turning to slide 4. Aside from the annual review of actuarial assumptions, the additional market-driven and discrete item for the current quarter consists of our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the annuity business. These favorable unlockings were mainly driven by performance of equities in our customer accounts and resulted in a net benefit of $0.08 per share.","Moving to slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $491 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment losses of $679 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income, amounting to a net pre-tax gain of $73 million. Of note, product-related derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $961 million, largely due to the impact of applying our tighter credit spread to the gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits. The gain from the general investment portfolio and related activities are driven by pre-tax gains in our International Insurance investment portfolios.","Moving to our business results and starting on slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned earlier. Annuities earnings were $512 million for the quarter, up by $137 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income, primarily a result of a 6% increase in our variable annuity average separate account values. They were driven by the benefit from our retirement and risk management strategy for product guarantees implemented in 2016, and by the favorable impacts of the annual actuarial review.","Also contributing to the growth in earnings were more favorable net investment results from higher invested asset balances and current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $5 million above our average expectations compared to results modestly below expectations a year ago.","The return on assets, or ROA, of 127 basis points reflects the items I just mentioned and is well above recent trends. While we believe that some of the ROA improvement is sustainable, including the impact of the annual actuarial review, we do not expect to be able to maintain this elevated level as a baseline in the future.","Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total gross sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter are down by $800 million from a year ago and up by $100 million from the prior quarter. This trend in gross sales reflects the actions we have taken to reprice our PDI product as well as broader industry sales pressure we believe partly in response to the DOL Fiduciary rule, which was partially effective in June and is expected to be fully implemented in January of 2018.","Turning to slide 8. Retirement earnings were $328 million for the quarter, up by $98 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by a greater contribution from net investment results and by more favorable case experience. The contribution from net investment results was up $72 million from a year ago. Current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $25 million above our average expectations, compared to a contribution about $30 million below expectations a year ago.","A 5% increase in average spread-based account values also contributed to stronger net investment results. Current quarter case experience was about $30 million more favorable than our average expectations primarily from our pension risk transfer business, which continues to perform very well. This compares to about $20 million more favorable experience a year ago.","Turning to slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $7.8 billion for the current quarter compared to $8.1 billion a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower institutional investment product sales in the current quarter, as prior year sales included two longevity reinsurance cases totaling about $2 billion, while the current quarter included a $1.6 billion funded pension risk transfer case.","Total Retirement account values were a record at $401.3 billion, up by 7% from a year earlier. This includes the benefit from market appreciation as well as about $2 billion of positive net flows over the past year. The net outflows in the quarter reflect the episodic nature of the large case business, inherent in both full-service and Institutional Investment products, as well as the impact of the normal runoff of group annuity and longevity reinsurance cases. In particular, we experienced an elevated level of net outflows in our investment-only stable value business this quarter.","Turning to slide 10. Asset Management earnings were $218 million for the quarter compared to $207 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher Asset Management fees, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in Asset Management fees is driven by the 7% growth in assets under management and from the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate in the third quarter of last year. Asset Management reported $7.7 billion of net unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, with contributions from the Institutional and Retail businesses, each driven by strong fixed income flows.","Turning to slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $96 million for the quarter, compared to $130 million a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower underwriting results and higher expenses, partially offset by a greater contribution from net investment results. The lower net contribution from underwriting was driven by the impact of the annual actuarial review and other refinements on current quarter results, partially offset by more favorable claims experience.","Earnings for the current quarter reflected claims experience that was about $10 million below our average expectations, compared to claims experience about $20 million below our average expectations a year ago. The higher contribution from net investment results included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, essentially consistent with our average expectations and compared to returns about $5 million below our average expectations a year ago.","Turning to slide 12. Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, were down $6 million or 4% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales were down 34% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of price increases and face amount limits in the second half of last year and the migration to our principles-based reserve compliant version of this product launched in March of this year. Partially offsetting that were other Universal Life sales, which increased by $10 million from the prior year, driven by large case estate planning sales and term product sales, which increased due to pricing actions.","Turning to slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $81 million for the quarter, up by $33 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from more favorable underwriting results and a greater contribution from net investment results. Group Insurance benefits ratio of 84.5% was well below the low end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%, driven by favorable Group Life incidents, which produced about $30 million of favorable earnings as compared to our expected range.","Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 14. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $396 million for the quarter, compared to $381 million a year ago. Excluding a $9 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $24 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by continued business growth with constant dollar insurance revenues up 7% from a year ago, more favorable policy benefits experience and a greater contribution from investment results, partially offset by higher net expenses.","The more favorable policy benefit experience included current quarter claims experience which was about $20 million more favorable than our average expectations, compared to about $10 million more favorable a year ago. The higher contribution from net investment results included current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million above our average expectations and compared to returns, only slightly above our average expectations a year ago. In addition, the current quarter also included about $25 million of higher than typical net expenses, including true-ups to legal reserves and deferred acquisition costs.","Turning to slide 15. Gibraltar Life earnings were $473 million for the quarter, compared to $494 million a year ago. Excluding an $8 million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings decreased by $13 million from a year ago. The decrease reflects higher net expenses and a lower contribution from net investment results, partially offset by more favorable policy benefits experience and business growth. The higher net expenses in the current quarter are driven by the absence of about $40 million of income recognized from a sale of a home office property that was part of the acquisition of Star and Edison in the year ago quarter.","The lower contribution from net investment results includes current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $15 million above our average expectations, compared to returns about $35 million above expectations a year ago. The more favorable policy benefit experience includes claims experience, which was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter. Benefit experience was essentially consistent with our expectations a year ago. In addition, a concentration of annual mode revenues favors second quarter results. We would estimate that the benefit to current quarter earnings was about $25 million.","Turning to slide 16. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $835 million for the current quarter, up by $101 million, or 14%, from a year ago, driven by higher sales in Japan. Life Planner sales in Japan were up by 35% from a year ago, reflecting primarily an elevated level of sales associated with rate increases due to the standard discount rate change on yen-based products effective April 1. Also contributing to the sales increase was a 6% increase in the Life Planner count in Japan.","Gibraltar sales were up by 8% from a year ago, also driven by a sales surge ahead of premium increases on yen-based products, as well as the introduction of a low cash value U.S. dollar whole life product with nursing care benefits, partially offset by a modest decline in bank channel sales. A little over half of our sales in Japan in the quarter were from U.S. dollar products despite higher yen-based sales.","Turning to slide 17. The Corporate & Other loss was $308 million for the current quarter, compared to a $376 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the variants are lower expenses, including such items as fixed asset disposals, legal costs, and other expenses which can fluctuate, and higher investment income, including the absence of a $40 million charge in the prior year from a decline in value of a tax-advantaged investment that we account for under the equity method. We also recognized higher income from our pension plan, following our assumption update at year-end, and lower interest expense from our paydowns of debt last year.","Now, I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures and I'll be brief. Following the recapture of our living benefit risks and the refinements we made to our risk management strategies in 2016, we view the RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance, or PICA, and PALAC, as well as the composite RBC shown here to be important measures of our financial strength.","Having said that, as we have highlighted previously, we manage our annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding capital, holding total assets to a CTE 97 level, with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time, we may see some variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC over our targeted ratio. At December 31, 2016, the PICA, PALAC, and composite ratios were well above our target, and we estimate that they continue to be so at the end of the second quarter.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margin ratios of 879% and 893%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. The solvency margin ratios are comfortably above our targets, and we estimate that they continue to be so at the end of the second quarter.","Looking at the liquidity, leverage, and capital deployment highlights on slide 19. Highly liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $3.7 billion at the end of the quarter. While this represents a decline of about $300 million sequentially, cash balances at the parent company will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of subsidiary dividends and holding company commitments.","During the second quarter, we returned about $640 million to shareholders, including $320 million of dividends and $313 million of share repurchases, under the $1.25 billion authorization for the year. And finally, our financial leverage and total leverage ratios were within our targets as of the end of the second quarter.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. Now we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. If I could start with a question on annuities, you commented that the 127 basis point ROA is exceeding your run rate expectations. Could you classify what do you think is a more sustainable level and then help us map the difference between that level and the 105 basis point run rate we've seen the last couple of years?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Seth, it's Steve Pelletier. I'll start by offering some comments on that score and I think Rob can follow up. The elevated ROA level reflects a number of factors. In particular, as Mark touched upon, favorable market conditions and the ongoing impact of our annual assumption updates and how that interacts with our risk management strategy. Those factors were significant drivers. And that contributed about 13 basis points of ROA compared to the first quarter.","Some of this list is sustainable, but we aren't necessarily expecting to maintain the full increase going forward. There was some favorability in the quarter on our hedging costs and other factors, and we're always assessing ways of managing the risk to create the best possible economic outcomes across multiple scenarios.","With that said, we think the block is very well-capitalized, well-managed, and generates very considerable free cash flow. So we would kind of update our thoughts about long-term sustainable ROA to the 110 to 115 basis points range over the long run, with meaningful upside to that in the near term. Rob?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Maybe just pick up where Steve left off, which is just to reiterate that our annuities book is performing really strongly and we're quite happy with it. Earnings are up significantly, as is free cash flow. It's well-capitalized and our capitalization strengthened further during the course of the quarter. And volatility remains quite low.","So, the ROA that you saw in the current quarter is about \u2013 call it 125 basis points on kind of a run rate basis. It's about 15 basis points above the guidance that Steve has provided before, which was 105 to 110 in terms of what we thought was sustainable. We believe the sustainable rate in the long term is probably, as Steve mentioned, in that 110 to 115 range, though recognize that it's likely it will trend higher than that in the more immediate and intermediate term.","There are three things to keep in mind. First, we're benefiting from some positive hedge breakage and that's factored into that 125 basis points. And in the long term, we don't believe that's sustainable, we think that sort of nets out to zero, and so there will probably be some reversion on that over the course of time.","Secondly, recall that fee levels in our annuities business are likely to compress for two reasons. One, we've undertaken a product diversification strategy and the fees relevant to AUM and some of the newer products are lower than they were in our HD product. And secondly, as the book matures, we have step-downs in our scheduled fees, and so we'll see some impact from that over the course of time as well.","And the third is the item that Steve alluded to, which is with respect to our hedge strategy. We are likely to look at hedging tactics as we go forward. Recall that we manage, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, this block to a CTE 97 level, with the ability to withstand that level through cyclical or moderate stresses. But as we've previously said, we continually reevaluate our hedging strategy in order to optimize the balance between cash instruments we use and derivative instruments to manage the risk balancing between earnings, liquidity, capital flexibility, and volatility.","Given the recent run-up in the markets and some of the benefits that we're seeing from our assumption updates, this is a good opportunity for us to revisit that strategy, evaluating the tradeoffs between our increased ROAs and the ability to further decrease volatility and increase our flexibility with respect to distributable earnings and capital.","I'll reiterate, it's fair to say that we will likely trend above our view of that sustainable level in the near term, but we think that's how we would guide you to think about this business in the long-term.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's incredibly helpful. Thank you very much. And then just a quick one on the actuarial review. The system updates that you refer to have not an inconsequential impact on book value. Are there any more system updates coming forward that we should be aware of? Or have you mostly made your way through all these conversions?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, let me, if you don't mind, Seth, answer that perhaps a little more broadly and then come back and answer your very specific question. We are highly sensitive to the non-economic outcomes that have been created by virtue of the systems enhancements and the disconnect that that creates between our operating income and our reported GAAP income. And while we would portray those things as not really reflective of any change in the underlying economics, we recognize that to the extent that we have that disconnect, that creates noise in the marketplace, can have an impact on our share price. And if it has an impact on our share price, it is, by definition, economics, and so we care about it.","We've taken a lot of actions and we've been investing in systems in order to address that disconnect that we've seen in the past by reducing complexity and reducing earnings volatility. You've seen the payoffs from this in a number of places already. So, we did the Closed Block restructuring a number of years ago, we did our division restructuring in Japan which mitigated the FX remeasurement volatility we had been seeing in the past. We've significantly reduced our duration management swaps by some 60% or so, and implemented derivative hedge accounting wherever it was permissible. And then most recently, we did the VA captive recapture and the restructuring, and along with that, we eliminated the corporate interest rate under-hedge. All of those things took a substantial amount of volatility out of our financial statements.","We've also been going through this multi-year series of significant actuarial systems enhancements to sort of get back to your very specific question. They have facilitated, as John indicated in opening remarks, a more sophisticated and granular capability for modeling. Over time, this enhanced capability leads to better modeling and less reliance on estimates and approximations, and that we expect will then produce less volatility prospectively. However, the initial process of implementing the systems can generate greater interim volatility as we migrate from old platforms and models to the newer ones. And that's what you've seen in Life this quarter.","Now, the good news is that we have substantially completed the upgrades to our most significant actuarial valuation systems. Evidence of this, you can see in the results from our Annuities business, where volatility has declined significantly as it was one of the earlier businesses to go through the systems and model enhancements that we've been undertaking. Life is now at the tail-end of that, as well, and our other businesses have that largely behind them.","So, while we will still be subject to changes in experience, which can give rise to actuarial assumption updates, we would expect the refinements components of our 2Q updates that are driven by model updates and enhancements to be more muted on a go-forward basis. We expect these and other actions that we've taken over time will result in a more clear and consistent representation of economics of our business model in our reported financial results. I apologize for the tangent, Seth, but I thought it was important that you and others understand that we continue to be sensitive to this and we wanted to address it and let you know that we're still very engaged and focused on this.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could provide more detail on the implications of the Individual Life assumption changes for the overall profitability of the block and the go-forward operating earnings. And then, assuming there is a reduction in earnings, and is that more a function of timing in terms of recognizing reinsurance expense or lower assumed future profitability?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, Erik, let me take a stab at that and then Steve may want to jump in as well. So, if you \u2013 you should think about the updates that we've made during the course of the second quarter, on an after-tax AOI basis, it aggregates, call it around $420 million. It had three principal components to it. As John mentioned in his opening remarks, the first two relate to refinements in modeling and changes in accounting methods for the mortality on the Hartford block and for reinsurance on all of our GUL and VUL.","Together, those two components account for about 75% of the charge. The result is a change in a pattern of future earnings, which will result in a level of lower \u2013 a level of earnings in the near-term, low level of earnings in the near-term that will be offset by a higher level of earnings further out. What I would emphasize is that there is no statutory impact, no capital impact, or no cash impact from this. Neither reflects a change in our view of the underlying economics, either.","So, and then generally, those updates, as I described to my answer to Seth, were really enabled by the system enhancements, which allowed much more refined modeling. And also important to note, with respect to the Hartford component of this, recall that a year ago we adopted this PFL, profits followed by losses accounting, and that tends to very much magnify small changes. So, you have relatively small changes on a large block, then magnified by PFL accounting, resulting in some of the larger change that you've seen.","The remaining piece of the $420 million after-tax, so, is about 25%. It does reflect a change in actuarial assumptions, primarily lapse rates. This is a change in underlying economics, and it affected both GAAP and stat. The statutory impact was offset by other positive things that happened in stat during the course of the quarter.","So, to directly answer your question, on a combined basis, if you take all of this and you look at both the updates and the refinements and how it manifested itself in the period run rate of AOI for Life, it's about $40 million lower than what we've seen in previous quarters, on a pre-tax basis. Now, that's largely offset by the run rates that we've seen in our other businesses, the increases there. But we would suggest that that's the appropriate way to think about the earnings run rate for the business going forward and we think, as a result of these changes, those earnings now bear a much closer relationship to the economics that underlie that business as well.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Got it. Thank you.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Erik, it's Steve. Just to amplify one note on what Rob said, we don't usually talk about business unit returns, but I think for purposes of this quarter and your question, it's useful to do so. Even as we absorb the impact that Rob mentioned in terms of our run rate earnings in the Individual Life business, we still see returns in the range of 10% on an unlevered basis, which we consider to be quite respectable in the current environment.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you. That's very helpful. And I guess, thinking about it, based on that sort of expected run rate, it looks like Individual Life earnings are kind of back to the level where they were sort of prior to the Hartford acquisition, and obviously, there have been moving parts in terms of interest rates and other factors that affect earnings. I guess, how should we think about the contributions of that acquisition?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","I think, Erik, again, we'd see the Hartford acquisition as still a very attractive step forward for the business. It generated meaningful scale economies and expense synergies. It very considerably strengthened our return, our distribution footprint, and our ability to cover really all the relevant distribution channels in the business.","And again, we would characterize returns, unlevered IRRs in the 10% range on the acquisition. Modestly lower than we might have expressed a couple of years ago or a few years ago, due largely to interest rate environment \u2013 movements in the interest rate environment since the acquisition, and to certain experiences around lapsation in certain products, but still an acquisition that we're glad we made.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Great. Thank you for the comment.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody. I was hoping maybe, Rob, you could elaborate a little bit more. A couple of times here, I guess on this call, you've really talked about or expressed very favorable free cash flow dynamics associated with the annuity block. And I was just wondering, at least relative to your overall free cash flow expectations for the corporation, how does the annuity block look today? And I assume it looks better than it did even a couple of quarters ago, given some of the increase in earnings here.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, John, I think that's sort of appropriate conclusion for you to reach. So, one, the level of earnings is up significantly. Two, as a result of both assumption updates and the sales environment that we find ourselves in, the business is throwing off a tremendous amount of cash. And so, at this point in time, the cash coming from the annuities business would be very accretive to the overall target that we have of 60% of free cash flow relative to our adjusted operating income.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. That's all I have.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","The sales reference, by the way, is to the fact that lower sales means higher cash flow.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes, I understand.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Just another question on the review, Rob. You mentioned a 40 basis point reduction in assumed JGB yields, I guess that's a large percentage change. Just curious if that had any impact. It doesn't appear to have any impacts on the balance sheet or future earnings associated with that, but I'm guessing, if you bake that into EGPs that would \u2013 that could be meaningful from a future earnings standpoint. So, just trying to reconcile how to think about that.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, Tom. So, in the International businesses on a combined basis, as a result of taking that long-term reversion rate down, you saw a pre-tax charge of about $50 million between the businesses. Now, what I will say is that it was more prevalent in POJ than it was in Gibraltar. Gibraltar had \u2013 one, it's a shorter duration book than POJ is, but two, Gibraltar also had some offsets in other areas. So, when you actually look through the numbers, you won't see the Gibraltar charge, you'll see it a little bit more clearly in POJ. So, yeah, on a percentage basis, a relatively large charge, but not a particularly large charge given the size of those books.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","I guess I'm more curious about future earnings and the way to think about profitability of the block. If you're taking that future yield on new money assumption down by that much, I would imagine it would have a negative impact. Is the reason that you wouldn't have a change in DAC amortization because you have more FAS 60 business where it's not an EGP construct or I just want to \u2013 if you could help me think through that?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me hit that in two parts, Tom. First, yes, the Japan block is largely a FAS 60 block, so you're not going to see the types of K-factor resetting that you see in the FAS 97 and related products. So, that's correct.","Having said that, and I guess the second point I was going to make is that, when we look at pricing, and so having adjusted down our long-term reversion rate, and Charlie may want to elaborate on this, but within the business or within all of our businesses, when we look at pricing, we don't look at pricing under any single scenario, we look at pricing across a range of scenarios. And I always like to describe the bookends of those scenarios. At one end of the book is the actuarial assumptions, and we would have taken that down from the 1.9% down to the 1.4%. At the other end of the spectrum would be a flat forever scenario where we assume that the current interest rate is sustained and we want to ensure that we're comfortable with the profitability of the book under that scenario. And in between there, we follow the forward curve and see what that looks like, as well.","And so, any point in time we're pricing, we want to ensure that we're going to get adequate return relative to all of the scenarios in which we look at it. And we define that at \u2013 we do adjust the hurdle rate to reflect those different scenarios. So, if interest rates are likely to rise to our long-term reversion rate, we have a higher hurdle rate than we might have if we're in a sustained low interest rate environment forever. We would adjust for that.","The diminution in our Japan books, in the latest quarter, if you looked at the delta between the pricing on those two bookends, it'd be a couple hundred basis points. That's for a series of products that do double-digit returns from a pricing standpoint. So, while it's a not-insignificant decline, what we wind up with is a book of business that's still producing a very attractive return on the capital that we have to hold against it. Charlie, I didn't know if you wanted to add anything to elaborate on that.","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, and I'd just add a couple of things. One, Rob's absolutely right. We look at both bookends, and we make a determination on the pricing we want to have based on those two bookends. And it's usually somewhere in between, but we absolutely take into account low rates forever and look at that scenario.","The other thing I would just say, which is kind of an obvious comment, but is the amount of U.S. dollar product we sell and foreign currency product we sell. So, while we are affected by the diminution in interest rates, we also \u2013 over 50% of our book that we sold this quarter was U.S. dollar product.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Got you. And then just, Rob, just one final follow-up on that point, just to make sure I understand it. So your point was that maybe it's a couple of hundred basis points of deterioration on the ROE, but you'd still have double-digit returns, even after the reset. And because it's FAS 60, as long as you don't have no profit on the block, that would determine DAC amortization and whether DAC is recoverable. So you're not even remotely close to having any kind of impairment impact on DAC. Is that more or less the right way to think about it?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, that's all correct, Tom.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey, thanks, good morning. I was just hoping you could provide some more color on the drivers of the $7.7 billion of Asset Management flows and how the pipeline looks going forward?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Ryan, it's Steve. I will address that. The $7.7 billion reflects strength in multiple asset classes \u2013 particularly, however, fixed income. And the strength in fixed income is really across the board. It reflects positive flows, both institutional and retail, both from existing clients and from new mandates. It also reflects positive flows from both public and private sectors of the fixed income asset class. We're seeing the payoffs from our investments in our businesses \u2013 in our Asset Management business payoff. We really see that materializing, particularly in the distribution arena.","A lot of our investments have been to be sure in our investment capabilities, but also in our distribution capabilities and strengthening our global Institutional client management framework. And we see that paying off. So, we still see the basis \u2013 high demand for what we do and the basis for strong flows. Obviously, we'll see what level they prove out to be, but we're confident that we have a very strong value proposition, and that that's being reflected in our flows.","The other item I would mention is that outflows in our equity business continued, but at a mitigated level, due largely to our improved performance in those businesses. So, while we continue to see outflows in the equity business, they've been mitigated by that factor.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then on Retirement, you've fairly consistently had, I guess, what you've been characterizing as favorable case experience for a while now. I guess at what point \u2013 or are you getting closer to the point where you just feel like the profitability of the block is perhaps better than you originally priced it for?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Ryan, I just mentioned that we have, over the years, made several refinements and improvements of our expected case experience in pension risk transfer. So, it's not as if we haven't been raising the bar. At the same time, we've continued to see very strong case experience, even above those expectations that we have raised over time, including, by the way, this quarter where we raised expectations with a quarterly impact of about $5 million.","We think that this type of case experience really serves to validate the very strong basis on which we have underwritten and priced this business. We continue to write this business in full achievement of our targeted returns in PRT, and we think that this type of case experience really bears that out. At the same time, we will continue to review our experience going forward. We have made some adjustments. We'll make further if our experience and analysis dictates that that's appropriate.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, there, thanks. Just wanted a clarification on the CTE 97 at moderate stress, assuming moderate stress. Can you just help us understand the \u2013 how you define moderate stress scenario, both in terms of equity markets and interest rates, and then over what sort of duration you're thinking?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Suneet, yeah, it's Rob. So, a combination of things that go through there. So, we look at a 20% decline in equity markets. I'm going to get the interest rate assumption wrong on that, and look to see if someone knows that. I want to say it's 50 basis points, but we'll have to verify that for you after the fact. And then, we have a \u2013 more importantly than that, we also have a credit deterioration that you would typically see in a recessionary-type scenario, so you have an expansion in credit spreads and some incurrence of credit losses. That extends out for a multi-year period of time and then is assumed to recover thereafter.","So, the point, the duration of it is less important than when it actually happens because you have to actually survive the point of that downturn. And then, after that point in time, the stress becomes less. So, the duration of it is frankly less important than the actual quantums that we hit within a one to two-year period of time.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Just on like the equity markets, what sort of recovery after that initial 20% do you assume?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","It's a normal, 8%, our long-term reversion rate, so it's an assumption that the total return on equities thereafter goes up by 8% per year; a combination of 2% dividend, 6% appreciation.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then just, I guess, a question for Mark, maybe on the ROE. I think at the Investor Day, you talked about the International ROE coming down 50 basis points a year, I think largely due to interest rates. But given that that division, I think, it uses almost half, maybe 40% of your overall equity, what are the businesses that you have that can generate ROE expansion to help offset that ROE decline? Or are we just looking at consolidated ROEs just continuing to face some pressure going forward? Thanks.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","This is Mark. On Investor Day, I talked about regulation and supervision. So, I'm going to hand that one over to Rob, unless you want to come back to regulation and supervision.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, actually, and we're going to pass this right along. I think Charlie is probably in the best position to answer that. So, go ahead, Charlie.","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So what I would say is I think what we talked about was in Japan, the interest rates are coming down, and therefore, there would be some potential diminution over time of ROEs. On the other hand, we have some other countries like Brazil, which are small at this point, but which are increasing. And so, I think what you'll see is as we are successful in terms of expanding in other countries, that that diminution may be mitigated some \u2013 the diminution in Japan may be mitigated to a certain extent by the growth in the other countries.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","I guess the other thing I'd add is that when we think about ROEs, obviously, they're not \u2013 we're not immune to the market environment, but what we're focusing on is relative performance of ROEs. And what we believe, Suneet, is by virtue of our business mix, by virtue of our fundamentals and the quality with which we're operating these businesses, that we would aspire to be very near the top of the pack in terms of relative comparison to anyone in the space. Absolute numbers may move a little because of absolute levels of interest rate, but in terms of relative performance, our aspiration is absolutely unchanged from what it's been in terms of our overall outcome.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","And just adding to that, so it's fully understood the 12% to 13% guidance that we provided last year fully incorporated the anticipation of the diminution in the ROE in Japan over time. So, there was \u2013 that's not something above and beyond the guidance that we gave that went from the 13% to 14% to 12% to 13% ROEs.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I got that part, it's just once we get past the near-term, which I think is your target, 12% to 13% is sort of over the near term, I'm trying to think of, is the next phase higher than 12% to 13% or is it actually potentially lower than that, just given the International business coming down?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","I'm not 100% sure how to answer that question, Suneet. What I would say is that when we look at the long-term sustainable rate, we look at it against the interest rate environment. And so, if interest rates in Japan remain low for a long period of time, but rates rise within the U.S., then, yeah, the Japanese component of our business would continue to have a more modest ROE. And therefore, we might go back to the lower end of the 13% to 14% range that we gave before, as opposed to a mid or higher point of it. So, you'd have to think about. If what you're asking is if rates go up in the U.S. but don't go up in Japan, how do we think about that? Japan is 40%, 45% of the earnings, and therefore, the return there would be \u2013 the lower return there would be sustained and we'd have a more muted bounce back, but nonetheless, a bounce back.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, I had a couple of questions. First, you've discussed in the past just disruption in the annuity market from the DOL rule. So, wondering if that's continued through this quarter or has that eased a bit? And besides annuities, how do you think about the impact of the rule on other businesses in the U.S., specifically the DC business? And then, could you just discuss the driver of the drop in the Life consultant count at Gibraltar?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Jimmy, this is Steve. I will address your question. In regard to annuity sales, we do think what we've seen over the last couple of quarters, not just us, but the industry, is meaningfully driven by continued ambiguity around final outcomes in the DOL Fiduciary rule. As you know, a review period is underway and we, along with many others in the industry, are making our voice heard in that review and about the importance of ensuring that middle class Americans are still able to access financial advice and financial solutions, including retirement income solutions.","But, as that review is still pending and still underway, I think continued ambiguity regarding final outcome of the rule may still continue to have an impact on sales. For us, while we saw a decline from year ago quarter in sales, we did see a modest sequential quarter pick-up, and that was due to some repricing of our PDI product that we did towards the end of the first quarter.","In regard to other businesses, we do think that on an industry basis there could be some impact from the rule to the DC business. However, we think that impact would be largely felt at the smaller end of the market, where, for example, high proprietary ratios of Asset Management products in DC plans are the norm. We generally participate in the upper range of the market and we would expect the impact on us from that phenomenon to be minimum.","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","And Jimmy, this is Charlie. On the second \u2013 your second question, I'll be short and sweet. We raised the bar. So, we have a more stringent recruiting process, we have slightly higher terminations because we raised the standards. We've been doing that around the world in various countries, so you saw us do it in Korea and Taiwan last year and we continually raise the bar.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just one more on International, did you see a benefit on your sales from front-ending, just related to the pricing changes with the lower discount rate? And if you did, then would you expect to drop off in the second half? Not have been looking for guidance as much as just what you're seeing in the market of second quarter versus second half.","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, intuitively, I think your comment is correct. We certainly saw an acceleration or a surge, if you will, from yen products in the first half of the year. Interestingly, we also saw a commensurate increase in the sales of U.S. dollar products. So, it wasn't just yen products, but U.S. dollar products, which weren't affected by the discount rate. I think that shows the power of our distribution franchise.","But, given the fact that we had accelerated sales in the first half, I think it is intuitive to say that in the second half we may see sort of a slight decrease, but hard to tell how much, in part because Life Planner count did increase by 6% and Gibraltar usually has, or always has a seasonal surge in the second quarter to a certain extent. So, hard to tell how much, but intuitively and directionally, I think your comment is correct.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Brad, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And there currently are no more questions in queue at this time, sir.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Good.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Prudential reported strong second quarter results driven by solid fundamentals across our businesses. We achieved operating earnings per share of $2.62 after adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, representing a 4% increase over prior year earnings. This quarter's ROE is in excess of 15% as we continue to outperform our longer term target of 13% to 14%. Our operating results reflect solid core growth fundamentals across many of our businesses and favorable underwriting margins, which more than offset the headwinds presented by continuing low-interest rates and adverse currency impacts.","Net income for the quarter was modestly above operating earnings. And I would also highlight that, during the quarter, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumptions and this had a relatively benign impact on current quarter results.","Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results, and capital position. I will provide some high-level observations.","To start, we are pleased with the core growth drivers across our enterprise. Retirement and Asset Management both had $6 billion of positive net flows. Retirement benefited from pension risk transfer cases that closed in the quarter and Asset Management continues to attract assets based on its strong investment performance and proven capabilities.","Our Individual Life Insurance business produced 26% sales growth over the prior year. This was accomplished while achieving appropriate returns and meeting product diversification targets. We also completed our integration of The Hartford Life acquisition, with targeted run rate annual savings of $90 million achieved and integration costs a little better, meaning lower than our expectations. And we had solid sales results in our International business, producing overall sales growth of 6% over the prior year with increases in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. I would highlight that Life Planner constant currency insurance revenue growth was a solid 9% over the prior year.","Our Annuities business continues to show stable sales results, as we have carefully managed pricing and product features. But importantly, our product and risk diversification effort is showing success. Only about one-third of our total Annuities sales this quarter includes equity focused living benefit guarantees where we retain the exposure. And over time, this should help lower the volatility in our Annuities business.","We also benefited this quarter from strong underwriting margins in several of our businesses, including our Life Insurance and Retirement businesses, which produced underwriting results better than our average expectations. And our Group Insurance business continues to benefit from pricing and underwriting actions in our disability block.","Overall, as we look at our businesses and our opportunities for measured growth, we remain confident that we will continue to produce strong earnings that will generate substantial deployable capital that can be used to support outsized organic and inorganic growth initiatives and returns of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Recall that we believe our business model generates cash flow equal to about 60% of operating earnings over time.","Now, DOL. As most of you are aware, we followed a comment letter on July 21 with the Department of Labor in response to proposed regulations that effectively redefine who will be considered a fiduciary in transactions that involve certain plans, plan participants, and IRAs. In that letter, we have requested clarification on certain provisions within the proposed regulation as well as made suggestions for modifications to ensure that consumer access to important retirement products is not impeded. And while we embrace effective regulation, like others, we are concerned about unintended consequences that could have \u2013 result from these proposed regulations.","Having said that, we benefit from a diversified business model by geography, by product, and by distribution channel. And so while the process is still very much in flux, we remain confident that we will successfully navigate whatever the ultimate outcome may be. Otherwise, we continue to work with our Federal Reserve supervisor and international regulatory bodies on capital frameworks and remain encouraged with the dialogue in developing capital standards that reflect the unique attributes of insurance.","With that, I'll hand it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Thanks, John, good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Thank you for joining our earnings call this morning. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture.","I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter shown on slide two. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.91 for the second quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income. This compares to EPS of $2.49 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 4%, amounting to $2.62 compared to $2.51 a year ago.","Looking across our businesses, here are some highlights of this comparison. I'll mention four key items. First, higher fees reflecting growth in average account values in our Annuities business and greater assets under management in our Asset Management business. Second, improved claims and reserve experience in our U.S. Insurance businesses. Third, a greater contribution from pension risk transfer case experience, which continued to be more favorable than our average expectations. And fourth, in International Insurance, continued growth on a constant currency basis in our Life Planner operations.","These benefits were offset by three primary items. One, higher net expenses in several businesses. Two, a lower contribution from net investment results with returns on non-coupon investments below our average expectations in the current quarter. And three, less favorable currency exchange rates in International Insurance.","I would also note that decreased corporate income tax rates in Japan drove a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter.","On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.4 billion for the current quarter, modestly above our after-tax adjusted operating income. We've taken some steps to mitigate volatility of our reported net income in relation to the operating results driven by our business performance, particularly with respect to foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement.","Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement, amounted to $71.09 at the end of the second quarter, up by $6.34 from year-end after the payment of two quarterly dividends totaling $1.16 per share. This includes the benefit of the Closed Block restructuring in the first quarter. Annualized ROE for the first half of the year was 15.6% based on after-tax adjusted operating income excluding market-driven and discrete items and using book value excluding AOCI and the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. This ROE reflects strong underlying business performance, bolstered by a net benefit that we would estimate at about 110 basis points from net favorable variances in comparison to our average quarterly expectations in a number of areas. These include the seasonal revenue pattern in our International businesses, pension risk transfer case experience, returns on non-coupon investments, and items that affected Corporate and Other results in the first quarter. I'll discuss the impact of these run rate items on the current quarter in reviewing our business results.","Slide three presents the AOI impact of our assumption updates. This year's annual review of actuarial assumptions had a net favorable impact of $117 million on pre-tax adjusted operating income, or $0.17 per share. The most significant items are a $68 million benefit in Individual Life to adjust amortization and reserves, including the impact of a mortality experience update on legacy business; $31 million in Annuities, mainly driven by more favorable guaranteed minimum income benefit utilization experience; and $28 million in Group Insurance, primarily from more favorable disability claims resolution experience. As you'll recall, we moved up the annual actuarial review to the second quarter in order to have a refreshed view of our assumption update in place before the start of our year-end forecasting and capital planning cycle. Last year's review, completed in the third quarter, had a net unfavorable impact of $186 million on pre-tax adjusted operating income.","Turning to slide four. The remainder of this quarter's list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results consists of only two items, with a net benefit to results of $0.12 per share. In the Annuities business, we released reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and adjusted DAC to affect market performance and future expectations, resulting in a benefit of $0.13 per share. And in Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to The Hartford Life acquisition. The current quarter marks the substantial completion of the business integration and these costs. Over the two-and-a-half years since the acquisition, we have integrated the distribution platforms and product portfolios and achieved our targeted $90 million of annual run rate cost savings, with the full impact commencing in the third quarter of this year. Total integration costs amounted to $110 million or $10 million less than our original expectation. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net charge of $0.02 per share.","Moving to slide five. On a GAAP basis, our net income of $1.4 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $286 million and divested business results, and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to a pre-tax loss of $43 million comprised of the items you see on this slide. Of the larger items, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activity had a positive impact of $510 million as the benefit from the increase in interest rates in the quarter was partially offset by the application of credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability for Variable Annuity living benefits.","General portfolio and related activities mainly in our International operations resulted in net pre-tax gains of $405 million. And mark-to-market losses on derivatives, including those used to manage asset\/liability durations with values that reflect changes in interest rates, had a negative impact of $728 million. The current quarter loss from divested businesses of $57 million mainly relates to long term care and includes interest rate-driven decreases in the market value of derivatives.","Moving to our business results and starting on slide six, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items I have mentioned. Slide six highlights Individual Annuities. Annuities results were $423 million for the quarter, up $29 million from a year ago. Slide seven gives a view of our trend in earnings and return on assets. Most of our operating earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. The 7% earnings increase exceeded the growth of average account values from a year ago, resulting in a higher return on assets, or ROA, in the current quarter. ROA for the quarter was 105 basis points, up from 101 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Lower interest expense and more favorable base amortization factors in the current quarter contributed to the higher ROA. Looking back over the five quarters shown on the slide, I would note that ROA tends to vary within a range depending on the quarterly pattern of expenses and other non-linear items.","Slide eight covers our Annuity sales. Our gross Variable Annuity sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, compared to $2.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our risk diversification strategy has resulted in a dramatic change in the mix of new sales, with just over one-third of our new business for the current quarter adding to our net exposure to equity market linked Highest Daily, or HDI, living benefit guarantees, compared to 70% in the year-ago quarter.","As we discussed on our Investor Day, effective on April 1, we entered into an agreement with Union Hamilton to reinsure approximately 50% of our HDI 3.0 optional living benefit risk on new business for this year and 2016, up to a maximum of $5 billion. This agreement will effectively convert about half of our sales with the HDI rider to sales without optional living benefits. During the current quarter, we reinsured the living benefit rider risk associated with about $550 million of the $1.4 billion of total HDI sales. In addition, we sold approximately $600 million of our Prudential Defined Income product, which directs a client's investment to a fixed income fund that we manage, and sales include about $350 million of products without a living benefit guarantee. Overall, only about one-third of our Variable Annuity sales in the quarter include living benefit riders with equity market exposure that we are retaining.","Slide nine highlights the Retirement business. Earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $237 million for the current quarter, down by $49 million from $286 million a year ago. The decrease was driven by a $55 million lower contribution from net investment results. Current quarter returns from non-coupon investments were about $20 million below our average expectations, while the contribution to results for the year-ago quarter was about $10 million above our average expectations. Fixed income returns were also lower in the current quarter as the impact of lower earned rates on our institutional and full-service product portfolios more than offset the benefit of growth in our funded pension risk transfer business.","The lower contribution from net investment results was primarily offset by a greater contribution from case experience on pension risk transfer business, which was about $25 million above our average quarterly expectation.","Turning to slide 10. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $14.2 billion for the current quarter, compared to $6.6 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were just over $9 billion in the current quarter compared to about $2 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales reflected the closing of four significant pension risk transfer transactions totaling about $7 billion, including roughly $5.5 billion of unfunded longevity reinsurance as well as $1.4 billion stable value wrap sale to an existing Group Life Insurance client. Full service gross sales and deposits, shown in the dark blue bars, were $5 billion for the quarter, up from $4.5 billion a year ago. As we have commented in the past, sales of both full service and institutional retirement products can fluctuate meaningfully on a quarterly basis.","Total Retirement account values amounted to $373 billion at the end of the quarter, up by $42 billion or 13% from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $35 billion largely driven by longevity reinsurance and funded pension risk transfer business together with favorable market performance.","Slide 11 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $196 million for the current quarter compared to $200 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the decrease in earnings from a year ago was driven by a $9 million lower contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing, and commercial mortgage activities. This contribution, which amounted to $24 million for the current quarter, is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuation and the timing of transactions. Asset management fees were $540 million for the current quarter, up by 7% from a year ago, largely tracking a 6% increase in unaffiliated third-party institutional and retail assets under management which totaled $471 billion at the end of the quarter.","Net inflows over the past year amounted to $14 billion including $6.4 billion in the current quarter, which was largely driven by institutional fixed income mandates. The benefit of higher asset management fees was largely offset by higher expenses. The higher level of expenses in the current quarter includes variable compensation reflecting performance, including our $3 billion increase in unaffiliated third-party asset under management net flows compared to a year ago, investments we are making to build teams and infrastructure to expand our product and distribution capabilities, and higher upfront commissions associated with $2 billion increase in gross retail inflows for the quarter.","Slide 12 highlights our U.S. Individual Life business. Individual Life earnings were $177 million for the current quarter, up by $11 million from a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by more favorable claims experience in the current quarter including reserve updates, mortality, and related amortization. The contribution to current quarter results was about $30 million more favorable than our average expectation. This compares to a contribution from claims experience about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations a year ago on the same basis. The benefit to current quarter results for a more favorable claims experience was partly offset by a lower contribution from investment results and higher expenses, including distribution costs driven by increased sales.","Slide 13 shows Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $130 million for the current quarter, up by $27 million from a year ago. The higher level of sales reflects selective re-pricings to improve our competitive position where we saw opportunities to build business with appropriate returns, together with expanding distribution and product enhancements over the past year.","The increase of $19 million in universal life sales was mainly driven by greater sales in selected age bands where we made pricing changes earlier this year to bring our rates more in line with the market. Term insurance sales in the gray bars are up $6 million from a year ago, with a continuing benefit from pricing changes we made last August. We also saw an increase in variable life sales driven partly by product enhancement.","Slide 14 highlights the Group Insurance business. Group Insurance earnings amounted to $47 million in the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Benefits from continued improvement in group disability claims experience and more favorable group life underwriting results were largely offset by higher expenses and a lower contribution from investment results.","Slide 15 presents the trend of our Group Insurance benefit ratios after adjusting for the impact of the actuarial reviews in the current quarter and in the third quarter of last year. In group disability, favorable claims experience, mainly driven by resolutions of existing claims, produced an improvement of about eight percentage points in the benefit ratio from the year-ago quarter. While the benefit from the actions we've taken, including pricing adjustments and enhancements to our claims management process, is now evident over several quarters and we recognized the history of improvements in long term disability claims resolution in our assumption update, we continue to expect that claims experience will fluctuate from one quarter to another. The group life benefits ratio was near the favorable end of our expected range and improved from a year ago, including a benefit from fewer new claims.","Moving to International Insurance. Slide 16 highlights our Life Planner operations. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $392 million for the quarter, up $10 million from a year ago. Excluding a $12 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reflect our hedging of yen income at \u00a591 (25:31) this year versus \u00a582 (25:33) a year earlier earnings are up by $22 million or 6%. Results benefited from continued business growth with insurance revenues including premiums, policy charges, and fees, up by 9% from a year ago on a constant dollar basis. The benefit to results from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses, including technology costs, and slightly less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter.","Slide 17 highlights Gibraltar Life and Other operations. Earnings for Gibraltar Life were $471 million for the current quarter compared to $502 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $26 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, results were essentially unchanged from a year ago. Higher net expenses in the current quarter largely driven by a benefit from fixed asset sales a year ago more than offset a greater current quarter contribution of about $20 million from investment results. The benefit to current quarter results from non-coupon investments and mortgage prepayment income was about $30 million above our average expectation.","Slide 18 shows the quarterly pattern of earnings for our International Insurance businesses over the past seven quarters. Looking at the trend, you can see the seasonality pattern that favors the first half of the year, which results from a concentration of annual mode premium revenues for our Life Planner operations in the first quarter and for Gibraltar Life in the second quarter. We would estimate that this benefited current quarter earnings for Gibraltar Life by about $40 million in relation to a quarterly average.","Turning to slide 19. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $777 million for the current quarter, up by $45 million, or 6%, from a year earlier. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan, shown in the dark blue bars, were $183 million in the current quarter, up $12 million, or 7%, from a year ago. The increase reflected a 5% greater Life Planner count, partly driven by our appointment of additional sales managers earlier in the year and higher agent productivity as measured by the number of policies sold per agent per month. At a product level, the increase came mainly from greater sales in term insurance. Life Planner sales outside of Japan were up $14 million from a year ago mainly driven by an increase in Brazil, where we've also grown Life Planner count meaningfully.","Gibraltar's Life Consultant sales, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $204 million in the current quarter, down by $16 million from a year ago. This decrease was driven by lower fixed annuity sales as our reductions of crediting rates we offer on new business, which are continually updated to reflect market interest rates, made these products relatively less attractive than other investment-focused alternatives in the market. Our fixed annuities have been popular among retiring teachers, many of whom are clients of our Life Consultants, for investment of lump-sum payouts upon retirement in the second quarter of the year.","Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gray bars, amounted to $191 million for the current quarter, up $30 million, or 19% from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by greater sales of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life insurance, reflecting broadening distribution among our Japanese bank relationships. Sales through independent agents, shown in the green bars, amounted to $81 million in the current quarter. The $5 million increase from a year ago was driven by greater sales of retirement products.","Slide 20 shows the results of Corporate and Other operations. Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $305 million for the current quarter compared to a $341 million loss a year ago. The reduction in the loss came mainly from lower expenses in the current quarter. Expenses in Corporate and Other are inherently variable and current quarter costs for items including deferred compensation programs and employee benefit plans were below recent averages, accounting for about half of the reduction in loss. An additional benefit from investment income on remaining assets that were formerly associated with our Closed Block business and initially transferred to Corporate and Other when we completed the restructuring of that business at the beginning of this year was largely offset by higher interest expense.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mark. I'll now provide you an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility. Starting on slide 21. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we manage to a 400% RBC ratio. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 498%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our June 30 RBC ratio remains well above our 400% target after giving effect to results for the first half of the year, including a $2 billion dividend to the parent company in May following the completion of our Closed Block restructuring. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 844% and 882%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets.","Looking at our overall capital position on slide 22, we calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held in Japan and other operations and at the parent company. As of year-end, we estimated our available on-balance sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion of gross capital capacity less $2 billion earmarked to reduce capital debt to arrive at our long-term targeted financial leverage ratio of 25%. Net capital capacity on the same basis increased to over $2.5 billion at the end of the first quarter.","During the second quarter, our estimated on-balance sheet capital capacity increased to over $3 billion. The current quarter increase was mainly driven by capital generated by our businesses and changes in interest rates, which had a modest positive net impact on our capital position. These increases to capital capacity more than offset about $500 million of distributions including $250 million each from share repurchases and our $0.58 per share quarterly dividend.","As I mentioned, during the quarter Prudential Insurance paid a $2 billion dividend to PFI, the holding company. As a result of that dividend as well as other sources of capital generated, we were able to reclassify about $2 billion from capital debt to operating debt as this debt is no longer supporting capital needs within our businesses.","As our outstanding debt matures, all else equal, funds will be available at the holding company to reduce overall borrowings. As a result, our financial leverage ratio is now below our targeted level of 25% and there is no adjustment to earmark a portion of our capital capacity for reduction of capital debt to arrive at this target.","Our overall level of borrowings is essentially unchanged from year-end and our total leverage ratio is down modestly, reflecting the increase in our equity. The fair value of the Japan equity hedge, after subtracting the remaining unsettled amount that we locked in during the first quarter and already included in capital capacity, was about $2.2 billion at June 30.","Turning to the cash position at the parent company, cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to about $5.6 billion as of June 30. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs, and to redeploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And we'd now like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail around the drivers of the $500 million in improvement in excess capital, particularly the capital generated by the business. And maybe touch on any amounts from the settlements of the capital hedge that contributed to that.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Erik, it's Rob. Happy to do so. As I said, the capital that we generated this quarter was primarily from business earnings and there was a modest benefit from interest rates. The math is relatively straightforward, if you think about the guidance that we've given before. If you look at our after-tax operating income, you net from that the buybacks and dividends that we provided during the course of the quarter, and the rule of thumb that we use for business growth that has the amount of capital that needs to be put back into our businesses to finance their growth, you come up with a number that's pretty close to the $0.5 billion that we generated. So it comes primarily from the earnings that are generated at the business level.","The capital hedge \u2013 I presume in that case you're referring to the FX equity hedge, actually did not have a material impact in this quarter. If you recall in the first quarter, we accelerated some of the \u2013 locked in, I should say, some of the gains associated with that. And so that included most of what we otherwise would've realized during the course of this quarter.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And given the volatility that we've seen in the excess capital over the past three quarters, can you just talk about how comfortable you are in redeploying this capital? And does the volatility at all limit kind of your deployment options in terms of, I guess, how you would think about using that capital?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, Erik, the way I would respond to that is we had \u2013 I think the volatility was limited to a single quarter as opposed to volatility that you've seen on a consistent basis, first. Secondly, as we look at that capital capacity I think our inclination and philosophy toward redeployment has not changed. We look at holding a prudent amount of it to ensure that we retain and\/or maintain a strong balance sheet and we otherwise look to redeploy that capital either to finance growth organically or inorganically and to keep a balanced distribution back to our shareholders as well.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Just the final question. Given the recovery in the excess capital position and the uptick that we've seen in interest rates, have you given any consideration to either reducing or eliminating the rate under-hedge?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We look at our interest \u2013 that particular under-hedge is looked at in the context of our overall interest sensitivity across the enterprise. At this point, we're comfortable with where we stand on that position. I think, as we've said before, we have a positive convexity toward interest rates, meaning that as rates rise we will benefit and we'll benefit more than we would suffer should rates decline. And we like that position at this point in the cycle.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Yeah, this is Mark. Let me just remind you that you need to take a broader view of that. That narrow product under-hedge does go the other way from some other things in our income statement. And particularly in my remarks I commented on nearly $800 million of negative mark-to-market on basically duration hedging derivatives. And so you've got to think more generally about what goes the other way and how that's netted off before you start thinking about specifically the under-hedge as a standalone either view on rates or influence on our overall balance sheet.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you for the comments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning and thank you. To follow up on the theme of capital, if we look at the parent company cash and short-term investment, $5.6 billion, I believe this is the highest it's been in about two and a half years. I understand excess capacity, you think about holistically in terms of HoldCo and the statutory entities, but given the higher parent company cash position, should we think of that as any type of short-term opportunity to deploy or are there near-term timing needs of cash that we should consider?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Seth, I would point to the comment I made in my opening remarks about our leverage position, and specifically I would note that if you look forward to maturing operating debt that we've got during the course of this year, we've got about $2 billion worth of debt that matures in the second half of the year. We're sitting on a substantial amount, as you noted, cash at the holding company and we would expect to be able to pair those things off during the course of the year.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So is there no plan to roll those debts?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have a lot of liquidity sitting at the holding company, and we don't \u2013 we would not, based on our current position, think that we would want to add to that liquidity by effectively rolling over our existing debt rather than look at the opportunity to just repay that as it becomes due in its natural course.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could just follow up one in the Retirement segment. I think we've seen positive case experience in the pension closeouts for several quarters, or a couple years now. Perhaps you could just comment, maybe give a little bit more granularity on where that positive case experience is coming from and if that's something that \u2013 I know you're not guiding to anything sustainable there, you're being pretty specific about calling that out in both the releases and in earnings calls here, maybe just explain why that should normalize lower.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Seth, this is Steve, I'll comment on that. I'm not going to attribute the positive case experience to any particular transactions or any particular part of the book. I will say that we call it out because we recognize that these are liabilities with longer average duration, about 9 years to 10 years on the funded side, as we spoke about, and about 8 years to 12 years on the longevity side. So we're not about to take the positive case experience and kind of bake it into our expectations, however, I will say that, as you pointed out, the consistent positive case experience does serve to bolster our already high confidence that we've priced this business appropriately and assessed the risks accurately.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Maybe just to follow up in terms of just the kind of risk characteristics of this. Is this something that will have quarterly volatility like a group or life that maybe we're a little bit more accustomed to, and that it's just been several quarters of good luck, or is there may be just a better trend here that we could think about?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Well, I wouldn't necessarily call it good luck. I'd call it, again, reflecting strong underwriting of the business. But, again, this would be something that we wouldn't expect to see the same type of number emerging from this every single quarter.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. The first question I had is, Rob, when you take the 60% ratio of free cash flow versus GAAP earnings that you all have put out there, and then you compare it to the results you've had for the last few quarters, I get something closer to 90%. And so my question is, and I don't know if that would be precisely the way you would calculate it, but I think directionally that's right. Where is that, we'll call it above average or above expectations capital generation, where is that coming from right now? Is that something going on within the Arizona VA captive? Is that broadly related to interest rates? Can you just expand upon how you're over-earning from a cash flow generation standpoint right now?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tom, without benefiting from exactly how you're doing your calculations, I'd note a couple of things that have positively benefited our cash flow ratio, the most significant of which would be the Closed Block transaction. So as a result of that restructuring that we've talked about before, there's been a substantial freeing up of cash from the Closed Block business up to the parent holding company, and we've seen the benefit of that in our cash flow and, hence, that may be skewing the numbers that you're looking at. And, again, then depending on the timeframe that you're looking at, if you look at the positive convexity that I've mentioned that we have to interest rates, as interest rates have increased from their lows we have benefited from that and that frees up capital in a way that you don't see it coming necessarily from earnings, but from outside of earnings.","Oh, and then I'm sorry, the one other point is the benefit from the yen hedge. So that's outside of our AOI number, but winds up. As we monetize that, we're able to get the cash from that and you've seen that, we've talked about that in the course of the first and second quarters, that yen has contributed to cash that has been available and is sitting at the holding company. The total of that, on an after-tax basis, in the first quarter we mentioned, was several hundred million dollars. And while it was not material in the second quarter, we've benefited from that in the cash position.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just a follow up. The Closed Block transaction in terms of how much that moved the needle to your overall enterprise view of leverage and excess capital was how much?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the dividend this year was $2 billion from PICA, about $125 billion of that was associated with the Closed Block. So if you \u2013 you could do the math and figure out the attribution of that to our decline in the capital ratio. The decline in the financial ratio really came about by virtue of three things. That was the first. The second was we issued $1 billion of hybrids and 25% of that hybrid goes toward equity attribution and so that helps on the leverage ratio. And the third was just a growth in our earnings during the course of the quarter that increased the denominator.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks. And then just one last follow up. So I guess to get back on the question of interest rate sensitivity, overall capital position, would you guys be willing to provide sensitivities to this number which is now $3 billion in terms of balance sheet capital capacity, how much sensitivity is there if we were to see a \u2013 say, around year end this year, a decline in interest rates to either a 2% level on the 10-year treasury or 1.5%, is that something that you could help frame for us, because that's one of the main questions that I still get from people as to one of the concerns that they have.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have not provided direct sensitivities of capital to interest rates, Tom. I think what we did say on Investor Day is that we've run stresses and I think what we ran was a 50 basis point decline, 50 basis point to 100 basis point decline in our \u2013 in levels of interest rates and looked at what that would do to our capital capacity, and the result of that was a relatively modest impact to our capital capacity and just a slight elevation to our leverage ratio, so I would say that we feel reasonably comfortable that our capital capacity is sustainable in a declining interest rate environment.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath at UBS. Your line is open.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with Retirement, if I could. If I go back to the Investor Day, you showed a helpful slide that shows the profit emergence of PRT versus longevity transactions over time. So my question is, what is the relative size of those two businesses? I'm not sure if \u2013 what's the right way to do it in terms of reserves or capital or earnings, but can you give us some sense of, given the deal that you've announced today, the relative sizes of those two businesses?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Suneet, this is Steve. I'll speak to the business that we've done in this quarter. As Mark mentioned in his comments, we had about $7 billion in sales in the quarter, of which about $1.5 billion was funded business and the remainder was in several different longevity transactions. In terms of the overall size of the book, we're looking for that data now and can provide it to you in due course.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And I guess my follow up question is just a follow up to Seth's on the $2 billion of debt that's maturing that you're going to repay. I haven't done the math on what the financial \u2013 the implications are for the financial leverage ratio if you repay that debt, but just based on where you sit today it would seem that you're going to be well below your 25% target that you use when you assess access capital capacity. So just wondering what the thought is there? Are we going to, at some point, see a reduction in that target from 25% to something lower? Or how should we think about that?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The debt reduction would actually be in the total leverage ratio would not affect our financial leverage ratio. So we've already re-characterized the debt that's to be repaid from financial to operating, so the $2 billion that's coming up will further reduce \u2013 will then repay operating debt. So our total financial ratio will decline from around 44% to around 42%, but there would be no impact on the reported financial ratio.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So you're still going to travel around that 25% target that you've talked about?","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's our targeted number and while we may bump above or below it, depending on any given quarter and particular situation that or opportunity that we're looking at, our intent is to have it hover around that number, yes.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Suneet, let me just follow up on your question. If you look at page 18 of the QFS, we do break out total account values for longevity reinsurance and group annuities and other products, so you'll see those numbers there.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. But is all that group annuity stuff PRT or are there other pieces in there? That's why I was -","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, there are some other products and there's legacy PRT in there.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right, I'll follow up later.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","But you do see the longevity, which is essentially the U.K. longevity block that we've added over the last couple years.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I had a few questions. First on the FSA business, you've had positive flows now, I think for three straight quarters, so \u2013 and this quarter was especially good. So in the past, your outlook for the business and your view on market trends hasn't been that positive. I'm wondering if that's changed recently. And then on Group benefits, margins in both group life and disability seemed like they were unusually good. Not sure if it was an aberration or it's the result of pricing actions that you've taken and is this somewhat of a sustainable level in margins into the second half? Or would you expect margins to compress from these levels?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Jimmy, this is Steve, I'll address both your questions. We think the full service flows that we've seen reflect the investments we've made in the business to be \u2013 to lower our unit costs and manage our unit costs more effectively and to improve our persistency and our sales pipeline. So we think that the \u2013 like I say, the sales we've seen reflect our enhancement of our competitive position.","By the same token, we still view this as a highly competitive business and one in which sales and flows will be fairly chunky over time. This quarter's sales did not reflect any particularly large jumbo cases on either the sales or on the withdrawal side, but for example, in \u2013 it's been publicly announced, in July, we closed the State of Connecticut business, which was over $4 billion. So we still view this as something that will, like I say, have its ups and downs and that we see as a highly competitive business in which we're going to maintain our pricing discipline.","On Group benefits ratios, I'd segment it out into life and disability. In life, we think the guidance we've given of a target range for the benefit ratio between 88% and 92% still holds. This was a good quarter, at the lower end of that range, but still within the range. On disability, we've given a similar range of 88% to 92%. Quite frankly, I do think that range is rather stale, as we see our successful efforts in remediation of the existing book and as we in particular see our successful efforts in improving our claims management capabilities. We think there's the potential for, as things settle down in our remediation of this business for revising that target ratio over time. I don't have a different type of figure for you yet, but I would expect that as we take a look at that, we'll come up with something that is in between the 88% to 92% range at the high-end and where we are today at the low-end.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then for Mark, on the Department of Labor fiduciary standards, how much of an impact do you expect the standards, if they are approved in final form similar to how the preliminary guidance was, how much of an impact would you see on your business and what are the specific product lines that you think will be the most affected?","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","That's actually a question for Steve.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Jimmy, I'll respond to that. I think some people have been asked on their calls do they see the DOL impact as a net-negative or a net-positive. We see it as a net-negative on the marketplace that we serve. We see the risk of individuals having restricted access to advice and certain types of solutions, in particular around guaranteed retirement income solutions. Just to give you a little bit of a flavor, the regulation itself is certainly voluminous and so is the industry commentary that has been made in response to the regulation. I think it's far too early to anticipate exactly what changes will ultimately be enacted and to give you an estimate of the impact of those changes.","I can say that in our own comments, we highlighted a few different areas that really need clarification or outright amendment. To highlight a couple of those: like many in the industry, we believe that the fiduciary definition in the regulation, as drafted, is too broad, encompassing activities such as traditional marketing that were really never viewed as or intended to be fiduciary in nature. We also share concerns expressed by many others that the best interest contract exemption, as it's written and as it could be interpreted, would be highly problematic and could entail higher compliance burdens and costs and potentially higher legal exposures for industry participants. And we also highlighted where the DOL really needs to clarify and sharpen the distinction between education and advice.","For us, in Prudential, as I highlighted on our last earnings call, we do believe that our market position, our mix of businesses, and the strength of our franchise will help us to adapt to any regulatory framework that emerges. We think that there are some aspects of our particular business model that benefit us in this regard. For example, most of our DC recordkeeping businesses is with cases with over 100 participants already, and that's relatively less impacted in this regulation. The investment platforms supporting both our Retirement and our Annuities businesses already operate on very much of an open architecture basis, and our own agency force, Prudential Advisors, sells a range of proprietary and non-proprietary products. So we think we're relatively well positioned to deal with an emerging regulatory framework. However, we still do view this, as I say, as something that has the potential for unintended negative consequences on the marketplace and the clients that we serve.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. I'd like to start by talking about the Retirement business. Just eyeballing the set of column charts on the right on slide 10. I'll let you get to that. It looks like the business, the real growth in the business is on the longevity reinsurance side as opposed to the funded side. Is that right? And if so, why are clients gravitating towards that option?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Eric, this is Steve. I think we've seen growth on both fronts. I think that, naturally speaking, the longevity reinsurance business, being reinsurance activities at its core, tends to be in higher tickets, higher transaction sizes. But as we've spoken about before, both in terms of earnings attribution and in terms of capital attribution, the funded business has higher earnings per dollar of account value and higher capital attribution.","In terms of the solutions and what kind of marketplace is developing more rapidly, I would say that the U.K. longevity reinsurance industry has been established for several years now. There's a regular stream of transactions in the marketplace in what has become a relatively well-established business. The pension risk transfer business on the funded basis in the U.S. tends to be more episodic in nature. We still view the business as having developed very nicely over the past couple of years, but particularly in the large case market in which we tend to do most of our business, that's naturally going to be episodic in nature.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","And, Eric, the longevity reinsurance transactions are more attractive to clients in the U.K. for structural and cost reasons. In the U.S., we've actually done much better on the fully funded deals. So it's not that clients choose one or the other, you're kind of seeing two different places here.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Yeah, the longevity reinsurance business really has not yet emerged in the U.S.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Before turning to a question about Annuity, I just want to ask one quick one further about Retirement. Just to make sure I understand what exactly we mean by case experience here being favorable. Is the idea plainly and simply that deaths of plan participants are happening at a greater rate than you priced for, so you're ceasing payments to annuitants sooner than you priced for it, is that what you mean by favorable case experience?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","That's primarily it, Eric. There's also an impact from investment experience as well.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","One last question regarding the Annuity business and I'll be wrapped up. One of the things I noticed in your supplement is that despite the \u2013 what has now been a multi-quarter effort to de-risk the Annuity business, the relationship between the two sets of account values, those with higher risk and those with less risk, whether they're reinsured or don't have equity risk, hasn't really changed, that's what at least I'm taking away from the supplement. Is that right? And if so, why hasn't this ratio changed?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Well, Eric, I think on that front \u2013 this is Steve, again \u2013 it's just more a matter of the math. We have a very large in-force book and we have embarked on this product diversification effort for basically two years now. We've had, I think, remarkable success in altering our sales pattern over those two years, as Mark highlighted in his business commentary. But the plain mathematical fact of the matter is that it will take time for that altered sales pattern to have a significant impact on the nature of the in-force.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very good. I'm all set. Thanks very much.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Cynthia, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Certainly. And that will be the line of Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering, on the assumption review this quarter, if you could walk us through in a little more detail relative to last year what some of the underlying changes that you made were and specifically thinking about long-term and shorter term interest rate assumptions embedded in some of your products.","Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Michael, it's Rob, I'll try to tackle that. First, let me answer the latter part of it. We actually brought down our long-term reversion rate, both in the U.S. and Japan, by 25 basis points, and that had a negative impact on our assumption update for the year. Offsetting that were positive drivers that we had. And if I had to sort of summarize them across the businesses, it would be that mortality was a positive impact both in our Life and Corporate and Other business. The annuity utilization rates, specifically on our GMIB product, was a positive impact, and then we had a positive impact from long-term disability termination rates. If you look at the AOI impact of that, I think as Mark highlighted, that was a positive of about $117 million, but importantly on a GAAP net income basis it was also a positive of about $60 million, and so while it had less of a positive impact on a GAAP basis we nonetheless had a positive outcome there as well. Did that answer your question without getting into specifics on any individual business? Happy to do so if you're looking for more detail.","Michael E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, I can follow up on the individual businesses. I was looking at the rate level. And then one more question on the Annuities business, I think you might have (63:19) run rate for this, you called out some of the one-time items but is scale really driving this to a more reasonable maybe $425 million (63:28) run rate on a quarterly basis, and that's part one on the Annuities. And then second, when you think about sales going forward with now the reinsurance in place, do you expect to be able to accelerate the pace of sales in this business going forward?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Michael, it's Steve. I'll tackle that. In regard to how we view a run rate for the business, I'd guide you to my comments that I made earlier about ROA. We're pleased with the progress on that front, but we still view this as a business where the sustainable ROA over time will be in the low-100-basis points ranging up to 105 basis points. In regard to reinsurance, we view that as a risk management initiative and tool. We do not see it as something that we intend to use to lever up our HDI sales. That's not how we view it at all. We continue to price our HDI product without regard to the reinsurance contract, for example. And conduct ourselves in the market accordingly. So I really emphasize that the reinsurance arrangement is purely a risk management tool, one of several at our disposal.","Michael E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 1:30 P.M. today until midnight, August 13.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential today are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, head of our U.S. businesses; Ed Baird, head of our International Businesses; Bob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Peter Sayre, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.","We'll start with prepared comments and then we'll answer your questions. In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the fourth quarter of 2013, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, this presentation may include references to adjusted operating income or to earnings per share or EPS or return on equity or ROE, which are determined based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services businesses that exclude certain items. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for an income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, GAAP, and the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the comparable GAAP measure, please see our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also included on our website. John?","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Now that we've closed the books on 2013, I'd like to kick things off with some high-level comments regarding the year as a whole.","First, earnings. Earnings per share were at $9.67 compared to $6.40 per share for 2012 based on adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This is an increase of 51%. Excluding the significant items we disclose each quarter, such as DAC unlockings and business integration costs, the EPS increase would be 33%. Our results reflect strong organic growth across our businesses, coupled with pricing discipline and effective expense and risk management.","In addition, the successful execution of the Star and Edison acquisitions in Japan, the emerging success of The Hartford Life purchase and the addition of the large pension risk transfer deals we closed in late 2012, all contributed meaningfully to this year's earnings.","And while our businesses are performing exceedingly well, we've also been helped by healthy tailwinds. As we have said recently, the things that tend to fluctuate generally fluctuated in a positive direction in 2013. In particular, we benefited from strong income from non-coupon investments, especially in our Retirement business in the Gibraltar; from favorable mortality, especially in Individual Life; and from good case experience in Retirement.","Turning to return on equity. It was in 2010 that we set out an ROE goal of 13% to 14% for 2013. We believed then, as we do now, that achieving and sustaining the 13% to 14% represents superior performance relative to our peers. As you can see, we exceeded the top end of our stated ROE objective. This reflected our strong underlying business performance, the noteworthy step-function changes made possible by M&A and outsized organic, as well as the tailwinds I mentioned earlier.","That said, 2013 is behind us and we're looking forward. We've never hit our goal as a 1-year, once-and-done objective. On the contrary, our goal is to sustain an ROE of 13% to 14% over a full cycle. And we believe achievability of that is made possible by the quality and mix of businesses, our approach to capital management and most importantly, the quality of our people.","I'll close with a few comments on Prudential's financial strength. The capital position of our U.S. and Japanese insurance companies continue to meet the high standards we managed them to, we believe AA, as you will hear from Rob Falzon shortly. We also have the capacity to remain strongly capitalized even in stressed environments. We've lowered our ratio of capital debt to total capitalization within our targeted range, and diversification of our risk profile has been a priority. The pension risk transfer transactions added significant longevity risk to our profile, other examples include an innovative annuities product that offers retirement income solutions without linkage to equity markets and greater emphasis on non-guaranteed universal life products in Individual Life.","And finally, the quality of our investment portfolio has never been better. With this strong financial position, we are able, over time, to deploy capital in a way that supports a healthy blend of normal organic growth, outsized organic such as pension risk transfer, M&A such as Star and Edison and Hartford, and returns to shareholders such as the $750 million of share repurchases and $800 million of common stock dividends in 2013. We cannot tell you the precise composition of those elements in any specific timeframe, but we think over the long haul, it has been balanced and appropriately supportive of both our strategic and our financial objectives.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier","Thank you, John. Good morning, good evening or good afternoon, whatever the case may be. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results for the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter, shown on Slide 2.","On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.20 for the fourth quarter, based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $1.76 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 31%, amounting to $2.22 compared to $1.69. On that basis, pretax earnings for our operating divisions increased by 41% for the quarter. Nearly 1\/2 of this increase came from organic growth in the base of account values and assets under management, driving higher fees in our U.S. businesses. In addition, lower expenses in several businesses reflect non-recurring costs we incurred a year ago. The remainder of the increase came mainly from a greater contribution from investment results in our retirement business, driven largely by the pension risk transfer business we put on the books late in 2012 and bolstered by exceptionally strong current quarter returns from non-coupon investments; the contribution of the business we acquired from Hartford through our Individual Life results; and finally, by continued growth of our international Insurance business, which also benefited from lower expenses, including cost synergies as the Star and Edison integration is now essentially complete.","On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $427 million for the current quarter. This reflects the accounting impact of foreign currency remeasurement of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese insurance companies, reflects losses on sales of lower-yielding securities from portfolio repositioning and reflects negative mark-to-market on derivatives we used in duration management driven by rising interest rates. The comparison of book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, is affected significantly by the geography mismatch from asset and liability changes due to foreign currency fluctuations, where the impact on non-yen liabilities runs through the income statement while the offsetting impact on the assets is included in AOCI rather than net income. After adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of this mismatch, book value per share is $59.99 at year end, up $1.91 from a year ago after payment of dividends totaling $1.73 per share.","As we've told you, we also evaluate our ROE performance in relation to our goals after adjusting for this accounting geography mismatch, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. After removing this benefit, along with the net benefits to results for market-driven and discrete items, our ROE for the year 2013 would be about 15%, reflecting solid underlying performance across our businesses with tailwinds including a strong contribution from non-coupon investment results, favorable life mortality and favorable retirement case experience.","Slide 3 presents a rundown of the short list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter. In the Annuities business, improving fixed income returns for our separate account funds and the equity market increase in the quarter caused us to release a portion of our reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and led to a favorable DAC unlocking, resulting in a benefit of $0.14 per share.","Going the other way, based on an internal review, we strengthened reserves in our International Insurance Life Planner business for a group of policies that came to us in an acquisition a number of years ago. In Gibraltar Life, we recorded reserve true-ups mainly in connection with an update of a policy administration system that is now essentially complete. Together, these reserve refinements amounted to a charge of $0.14 per share. In addition, charges for integration costs in the quarter totaled $0.02 per share. In total, the items I just mentioned had a net unfavorable impact of just $0.02 per share on fourth quarter results.","During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net benefit of $0.07 per share. In addition, results for the year-ago quarter included expenses that we estimated to be above a baseline level for items such as bond start-up costs and business process improvements with the negative impact of about $0.14 per share, about 1\/2 of which was offset by a favorable catch-up in our effective tax rate for the quarter. The outsized expenses in the year-ago quarter contributed to favorable current-quarter expense variances in some of our businesses, which I will cover in a few minutes.","On Slide 4, you see a view of our ROE trend with the underlying earnings performance. In order to show a trend that is indicative of our business results, the earnings per share and ROE we displayed here are based on after-tax adjusted operating income, excluding the market-driven and discrete items we've identified in our earnings releases. In addition, we've excluded the impact on ROE of foreign currency remeasurement that affects our book value through net income.","Our earnings per share on this basis grew at a compound rate of about 20% over this period, roughly the same as our reported EPS and drove the ROE expansion. While rising equity markets and the tailwinds in 2013 that I mentioned contributed to our results, the main drivers of this progression were: Continued organic growth, the successful integration of the Star and Edison businesses we acquired in 2011, the pension risk transfer transactions we closed in late 2012 and the contribution of the Individual Life business we acquired from Hartford in early 2013.","Turning to Slide 5. On a GAAP basis, the net loss of $427 million for the Financial Services businesses in the fourth quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $2.4 billion pretax, comprised of the items you see here. Foreign currency remeasurement losses primarily represent changes in the value of non-yen liabilities relating to products denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies on the books of our Japanese companies where the functional currency is the yen. The yen weakened in the fourth quarter, causing us to record a loss in the income statement because it would take more yen to pay off these foreign currency liabilities. We consider this noneconomic because the liabilities are matched with assets in the currencies in which they will be settled. The income statement loss results from the accounting geography mismatch that I mentioned.","Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activity had a negative impact of $193 million in the quarter. The current quarter pretax loss also included $342 million from negative mark-to-market on derivatives, mainly related to asset liability duration management and largely driven by rising interest rates. The realized losses of $573 million in the quarter for general investment portfolio activities were driven largely by bond sales. We took advantage of market conditions to reposition our general account investments and the interest rate-driven losses on the securities we sold allowed us to monetize tax benefits. Impairments and credit losses on investments were $48 million in the quarter.","Moving to our business results, and starting with Slide 6. Slide 6 shows our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses with a view of the results of these businesses and the adjustments we would make for market-driven and discrete items to get a view of underlying performance relative to a year ago.","Slide 7 highlights annuities. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, which include unlockings and experienced true-ups in each year and a software write-off in the year-ago quarter, annuity results were $384 million for the quarter, an increase of $128 million from a year ago. Stripping out the impact of market-driven and discrete items, as we've done on Slide 8 in the gold bars, the trend of earnings from the Annuities business had outpaced our account value growth over the past year. Account values passed the $150 billion milestone, reaching $154 billion at year-end, up 14% from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by market appreciation, with gross sales for each of the past 3 quarters at just under $2.5 billion. The rising account values drove a 16% increase in policy charges and fees compared to the year-ago quarter and have reduced our estimate of the perspective cost of guaranteed death and income benefits associated with our contracts. In addition, the improvement to our gross profits have contributed to a more favorable DAC amortization rate. Current-quarter results also benefited from lower expenses, reflecting the inclusion in the year-ago quarter of $17 million of costs that we estimated to be above a baseline level for items including business process improvements in areas such as technology and back-office functions.","Shown on Slide 9, our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, in line with this year's second and third quarters but down from $3.8 billion a year ago. We regard our level of sales as an outcome rather than a target and we've taken a number of actions over the past year to adapt our products to the current environment in order to maintain appropriate return prospects and improve our risk profile. With the introduction last February of our current living benefit feature called Highest Daily Income, or HDI 2.1, we reduced the income payout rates at various age bands and eliminated the guaranteed doubling of protected withdrawal value after 12 years, while leaving writer charges unchanged. In addition, we have withdrawn our x shares or bonus products, we have suspended acceptance of subsequent premiums in generations of products offered before 2011 and we've implemented a cap on subsequent purchase payments on more recent HDI products. We've also reduced the commissions we pay.","We've also taken steps to enhance our product portfolio, allowing us to broaden the choices we can offer to retirement-focused clients and their advisers while diversifying our risk exposure. We have brought to the market a product we call Prudential Defined Income, or PDI, which directs a client's entire investment to a multi-sector fixed income investment portfolio. PDI provides a guaranteed lifetime income amount, which is determined by applying an income payout rate based on the client's age at time of purchase to the premium the client pays. The payout percentage grows at a contractual roll-up rate until lifetime withdrawals begin. The product design allowed us to change both the income payout rate and the roll-up rate for new business on a monthly basis, enabling us to keep pricing in sync with changing market conditions. PDI has begun to meaningfully contribute to our sales mix accounting for about $450 million, or just under 20% of gross sales for the quarter, growing from about $250 million in the third quarter as more investment professionals have become familiar with the product's value proposition and additional distributors have signed on to include it in their platforms.","Slide 10 highlights Retirement. The Retirement business reported record-high adjusted operating income of $295 million for the current quarter. This compares to $147 million a year ago after adjusting for a $78 million benefit included in the year-ago results from the recovery under a settlement of losses we have recorded in 2007. Excluding this recovery item, earnings were up $148 million from a year ago.","Third quarter results benefited by $112 million from a greater contribution from net investment results. This includes about $55 million of returns that we would consider above our average expectations on non-coupon asset classes. The remainder of the increase came mainly from higher fees driven by account value growth and the greater contribution from case experience reflecting the pension risk transfer business that came on the books in late 2012.","Turning to Slide 11. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $9.9 billion for the current quarter compared to $43 billion a year ago, which included $33.6 billion for the GM and Verizon pension risk transfer transactions. Standalone institutional gross sales amounted to $4.1 billion in the current quarter compared to $5.6 billion a year ago, excluding the GM and Verizon transactions. Third quarter sales included $3.2 billion of stable value wrap products while the year-ago quarter included $5.3 billion of those sales. We are beginning to see greater competition in the market for these products with a decrease in the number of wrap providers. Full service gross deposits in sales were $5.8 billion for the quarter with 5 case sales of over $100 million, including a major case win of $1.2 billion. This compares to a total of $3.9 billion a year ago. Net flows were positive for the quarter. Total retirement net flows for the quarter amounted to $1.4 billion and account value stood at a record high $322.9 billion at year-end, up $33 billion from a year ago.","Slide 12 highlights asset management. The asset management business reported adjusted operating income of $209 million for the current quarter compared to $185 million a year ago. Results for the year-ago quarter included a $41 million benefit from the sale of a real estate-related investment that you see here as a market-driven and discrete item. The absence of this year-ago benefit led to a $32 million lower contribution in the current quarter from what we call, other related revenues, which encompasses incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the contribution from these activities is variable in nature since it reflects changing valuations and the timing of transaction. The increase in earnings for the asset management business was mainly driven by higher asset management fees reflecting growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management amounted to $870 billion at year end, up 5% from a year ago, reflecting about $24 billion of net positive institutional and retail flows over the past year. Results also benefited from lower expenses associated with asset management activities reflecting costs we incurred a year ago that we estimated to be in excess of a baseline level including those associated with the launch of the closed-end mutual fund.","Turning to Slide 13. Here are the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses showing the adjustments to Individual Life results for integration and transaction costs related to The Hartford acquisition and an adjustment to the group insurance results a year ago for an increase in legal reserves.","Slide 14 highlights Individual Life. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, Individual Life reported earnings of $165 million for the current quarter, up $51 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by the contribution of the in-force block of business we acquired from Hartford. The business integration is well on track. We are now benefiting from a unified distribution system, drawing on Hartford's strength in financial institutions and our solid positioning in the brokerage general agency channel. As planned, we transitioned to an integrated product portfolio as of the beginning of this year and cost synergies are continuing to emerge in line with our expectations. Mortality was favorable in comparison to our average expectations, both in the current quarter for the acquired Hartford business, as well as the legacy Prudential business, and in the year-ago quarter. Including reserve requirements, this contributed about $30 million to current-quarter results.","Moving to Slide 15. Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $166 million for the current quarter, including $69 million from the third-party distribution partners that came to us with The Hartford acquisition. This compares to total sales of $144 million a year ago.","Guaranteed universal life sales for the quarter amounted to roughly $80 million, essentially unchanged from a year ago when we did not yet include the Hartford distribution system. We've taken actions to limit concentration in these products and to maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases most recently this past October. And we've implemented a cap on the amount of premium a client can invest when purchasing a contract. These actions have contributed to the decline in our overall sales level from the first 2 quarters of 2013. Current-quarter sales of universal life without secondary guarantees, shown in the gold bars, contributed $27 million to current-quarter sales, up $20 million from a year ago. This type of product has been popular among clients of the distributors who came to us with The Hartford acquisition. And we've carried the best features of The Hartford product portfolio into our integrated product portfolio through our Prudential Founders Plus product that we launched a few weeks ago.","Slide 16 highlights group insurance. Group insurance earnings amounted to $58 million in the current quarter compared to $8 million a year ago after adjusting for the charge to increase legal reserves. The $50 million increase reflected improved claims experience in group life with a lower claim count in the current quarter and in group disability where we had a greater benefit from claim resolutions.","Turning to Slide 17. Slide 17 shows the results of our International Insurance business adjusting for reserve refinements in the current quarter and for integration costs.","Slide 18 highlights our Life Planner operations. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our Life Planner business reported earnings of $381 million for the quarter, up $49 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by continued business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up by 7% from a year ago. Foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 80 for 2013 versus JPY 85 in 2012, contributed a benefit of $11 million to earnings in comparison to a year ago.","Slide 19 highlights Gibraltar Life. After adjusting for the items I mentioned, Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $378 million for the current quarter, up $53 million from a year ago. The current quarter benefited from a contribution from investment results about $20 million greater than a year ago, with the increase mainly driven by our yen-based fixed income portfolio. Third quarter results also reflected lower expenses including additional cost savings from the Star and Edison business integrations. With the integration process now essentially complete, the $250 million of annual cost saves that we had targeted has been substantially achieved on an annualized run rate basis. Current-quarter results for Gibraltar also benefited by $10 million in the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates.","Shown on Slide 20, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $742 million for the current quarter compared to $1.1 billion a year ago. Our international sales pattern is affected by: Market developments; seasonality, which favors the first and second quarters; and by actions we've taken such as repricings. Gibraltar's yen-based Bank Channel Single Premium Whole Life product contributed $419 million to sales in the year-ago quarter, marking the crest of a sale surge that followed market developments earlier in 2012. In order to limit our concentration in the product and maintain appropriate returns, we implemented crediting rate reductions and reduced commissions effective at the beginning of 2013. And we recently discontinued sales of this product. The decline in sales of this product in the current quarter compared to a year ago more than offset an overall increase of $76 million or 12% for the remainder of our international insurance product portfolio.","Moving on to Slide 21. Life Planner sales were $314 million in the current quarter, up $38 million or 14% from $276 million a year ago. As you see in the dark blue bars, more than 1\/2 of the increase came from Japanese yen-based products, including a retirement income product where a pending change in commission rates contributed to accelerated sales. Sales of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life and retirement income products shown in the gold bars are essentially flat from a year ago. Changes in currency rates have made products that are denominated in U.S. dollars more expensive to Japanese consumers in yen terms, making yen-based products relatively more attractive. Fourth quarter sales in our Life Planner operations outside of Japan were up $14 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from Brazil where we are growing our Life Planner force and from Korea.","Slide 22 presents the sales trend in Gibraltar. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $428 million in the current quarter compared to $785 million a year ago. Taking a look at the gold portions of the bars, you can see a $344 million decline in sales through the bank channel. This reflects a $395 million decrease in sales of the single premium yen-based product that I mentioned, with the current quarter including a small amount of residual sales. Sales of other products through banks increased by $51 million, mainly driven by recurring premium death protection policy. Sales by life consultants are down $21 million from the year-ago quarter. Over the past year, the life consultant count has declined by about 2,000 to roughly 9,300 life consultants at year end, which is consistent with our expectations as we implemented minimum production requirements and other Prudential standards for the sales force that came to us with the Star and Edison acquisition. The impact of this decline in headcount was largely offset by an increase in productivity in terms of policies sold per life consultant per month, contributing to more cost effective distribution. Sales by independent agents, which are mainly in the small business market, are up by $8 million from a year ago.","Slide 23 shows corporate and other. Corporate and other operations reported a loss of $397 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $303 million loss a year ago after adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, which included charges to increase our reported liabilities for employee benefits and to write off bond issue costs. The increase in the loss reflects higher expenses in the current quarter including nonlinear items such as compensation programs that are based on our performance for the year. This result includes the impact of a one-time special recognition program covering our broad employee population, excluding senior management. The impact of this program amounted to $0.09 per share in the quarter.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon.","Robert Michael Falzon","Thank you, Mark. I'd like to give you an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility.","Starting on Slide 24. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we manage to a 400% RBC ratio, which we believe gives us some cushion against our AA objective. We began the year with an RBC ratio of 450%, a little above. While statutory results for 2013 are not yet final, we estimate that RBC for Prudential Insurance as of year-end 2013 will continue to be above 450%.","In Japan, Prudential Japan as Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 757% and 980%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, September 30, 2013. These are comfortably above our 600% to 700% targets, and we expect that our Japanese companies will continue to report strong solvency margins relative to their targets as of the end of their current fiscal year, which ends March 31 of this year.","Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses on Slide 25. We calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target, and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries. At the end of 2012, prior to funding the Hartford Life acquisition, our on-balance sheet capital capacity was roughly $3 billion, of which $1.5 billion to $2 billion was readily deployable.","During the year, we funded The Hartford acquisition; declared 4 quarterly common stock dividends totaling about $800 million, including a dividend of $0.53 a share in the fourth quarter that represented a 33% increase; and repurchased $750 million of common stock totaling $2.3 billion of capital deployment and returns of capital. These capital uses were more than offset by excess capital generated within our businesses, primarily from operating earnings.","The net result is that we ended the year with on-balance sheet capital capacity of about $3.5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we consider to be readily deployable, consistent with where we stood at the end of the third quarter.","Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $4.2 billion as of year end. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available through repayment or in debt to fund operating needs and to redeploying over time. As you may have seen, in November, we issued $1.5 billion of trust securities without bringing debt onto our balance sheet or cash into the parent company. This transaction enhances our financial flexibility by providing a discretionary source of funds that can be accessed at any time over the next 10 years regardless of capital market conditions.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And we'd like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question I have goes to the book value per share and using the adjusted metric for foreign currency, it seems like it's a little flat. And I know you've spent some time in the past talking about the sensitivities coming from the embedded derivatives portfolios, but not boss [ph] at the end of the day, how do we see that number growing? What would lead to that? You look at 2013 really being a record year in terms of earnings and yet book value remains flat.","Robert Michael Falzon","Yaron, it's Rob Falzon, let me try to respond to that. First, let me put into perspective sort of that movement in book value. So adjusting for the FX remeasurement as we do when we report book value, the number grew year-over-year by just under 3.5%. Now there are a couple of notable noneconomic GAAP charges that don't help in the growth of our book value. Notably, this quarter and for the year, I would say that if you looked at the NPR, there was a fairly dramatic decline in that from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, about $2.50 a share. If you adjust simply for that change in NPR, we would have grown book value by close to 7% -- a little over 7.5% from year-end last year to year-end this year. Furthermore, as you know, we paid dividends and absent having paid those dividends, our growth rate and book value per share would have been close to around 10.5%. So I think if you look at the economic book value from year-end last year to year-end this year, it actually represents a very healthy growth rate. We have very little control over GAAP accounting. And so I think what I can hold out for you is that the NPR that sits on the balance sheet is not a very material number today although, obviously, that can move in different directions. We continue to look at the growth of book value x FX remeasurement and look to net out some of these noneconomic impacts on our book value. There are other non-GAAP measures that enter into there which would support an even higher growth than that, but those are the ones that are obvious and we adjust for those economically when we evaluate that growth rate.","Mark B. Grier","This is Mark. Let me just add that as we use the term noneconomic, you should be thinking that over time this will come back. And it's hard to predict exactly when, but as Rob uses the term noneconomic, we sort of think of it as things that will wash out over time. It may be over a long time, but we anticipate that those things will not be biased one way or the other in the longer run.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears to the individual annuities sales, do you have any target in mind regarding the new PDI product, what percentage of sales you want it to be or what percentage of account value?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","It's a good question, and the answer is, not really, but let me explain that. I think one of the strategies we've had with annuities is to -- is a diversification strategy. And if you look at what we've done and what we've filed over the past quarter, we're filing a new HD products, we've come out with PDI, we filed for a non-guaranteed product. So we're really going from a one-product shop to a multi-product shop and that's to diversify risk over time. So we're very pleased with the take-up of PDI, which represented about 20% of sales in the fourth quarter. And we would expect that might grow a little bit more over time. We'll wait and see as we gain traction and more distributors. But it's part of a larger strategy, which is to diversify the product mix over time.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And does that diversification add to rising interest rate risk at least on the, on an accounting basis?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","No, we don't think so. So specifically with PDI, which is a fixed income product, the duration of the assets are less than the duration of the liabilities. So when interest rates rise, we'll get a better yield on assets over time. And the present value of which should be greater than any value degradation in the bond portfolio. So in this particular product, we don't think so. And as we go forward with non-guaranteed products and other products, we think that the diversification of all these products when put together will lower the risk profile of the Annuities business overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question is on Japan. Can you comment a little bit, if we peel back the onion, whether or not the quarter's results being a bit weaker sequentially is related at all to margins that you're seeing on any of the single premium products, and how that will compare to the traditional products? Whether you're seeing any differentiation there or are we really just seeing the seasonally higher expenses that should largely reverse as you head into 1Q? That's my first question.","Edward P. Baird","Tom, this is Ed Baird. Your second option is the winning option. There really is nothing material going on in terms of a shift in the margins of the products. It really has to do with the seasonality and that's one of the reasons we try to deemphasize the merits of sequential comparisons and look more at the year-over-year comparison, where, I'm sure you've noticed, the results are far more positive. There were a number of sort of one-off positives in the third quarter and some one-off negatives in the fourth quarter, which when combined, made for a more dramatic comparison. But no, I don't see anything changing in terms of the margins of the products. If anything, there may be a slight strengthening taking place. For example, you mentioned the bank products. As you know, that's a product that is more susceptible, particularly the single premium, on its margins, to what's going on in interest rates. And that's one of the reasons we started almost a year ago to lower the crediting rate, to lower the commissions and ultimately ended up shutting down the product because we weren't comfortable with the margins in that product were going to satisfy in our current environment, our target ROEs. So no, there's no material change taking place, it's more a matter of the seasonality quarter-to-quarter.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Ed, suffice to say, and this is going to be kind of a crude way to calculate it but I just want to understand directionally, if I took 3Q and 4Q, added them, divide it by 2, that's roughly speaking what we should expect on a trend rate here?","Edward P. Baird","Well, I want to be careful about giving you any kind of forecasting methodology, particularly something as appealingly simple as the one you've just provided. But I do you think you're in the right direction by saying that some of what transpired in the third quarter was probably overly positive, in particular areas like the non-coupon investment whereas we pointed out at that time, I think the returns in that quarter were about $69 million. In this quarter, it's at $33 million. We took those 2, define the average, my hunch is an 89-er [ph]. But on that specific point, probably this quarter, it's closer to indicative than the third quarter. That's just one of the factors, but as you know, that was a relatively material factor in terms of explaining some of the differences Q-over-Q.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. And then just one other question on, if you can comment at all on emerging regulations, whether it's non-bank SIFI, G-SIFI, Comm Frame, and whether or not the things that are emerging on that changes your view on which businesses you want to emphasize going forward, in particular, variable annuities, any changes or altering of views there?","Mark B. Grier","This as Mark. As you know, there are a lot of moving parts in the regulatory arena. You listed the big ones. And I would say that we have an agenda that's independent of regulation around issues like diversification that Charlie discussed and the strength of our balance sheet and enhancing some of our risk management capabilities, for example. And I believe that the things that are high on our list of priorities are also probably complementary to the kinds of things that regulators would be interested in. But I wouldn't say that we, at this point, have targeted any specific products for regulatory reasons. As I've said before, we believe that we're well run, that our risk and capital measurement processes are robust and will stand up to the scrutiny of the various regulators that we have to deal with. So there's a context maybe that's a little more local but that's probably also aligned.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the Annuity business for a second, specifically on Slide 8. And you made a comment in your prepared remarks that the growth rate in fees has been much stronger than the growth rate in account value. And I just wanted to drill down into that a little bit more, try to understand what the underlying drivers are.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure. I think part of this is a scale issue. So in other words, as we have grown the business, the fees have grown and therefore the margins have grown. I also think that we have been very focused on expenses as well. And therefore, as a result, the margins have grown and our return on assets are remained, I think, relatively high at about a hundred, about 1 0 1. Right? 1.01%. So that's also affected a little bit by the K factor coming down. So I think it's partly scale, I think it's partly a focus on expenses and partly focused on -- or a result of the K factor as well.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is there another phenomenon playing here which is, I believe you charge your writer fees based on the protected amount, and with your highest daily feature, that protected amount, in theory, will go up pretty consistently. So is that playing in here as well or are those fees taken below the line to offset the cost of hedging?","Mark B. Grier","Suneet, it's Mark. I was going to mention that as a marginal impact, that methodology applies to the relatively more recent products that we've sold. So that may be in there somewhere but it wouldn't be among the biggest items. As Charlie said, there's operating leverage in this business.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then as we think about the operating leverage going forward and your sales -- your flows, I guess for the past couple of quarters, being fairly close to 0, I guess, a couple hundred million, should we still expect that this business will produce pretty strong earnings growth absent whatever happens in the equity market?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","We can't make forward-looking statements, but I think what we can say is that we're extremely pleased with the profitability of that which we are selling now. And all things being equal, that should lead to growth in earnings going forward.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just my other question, I guess for Mark, is on the pension risk transfer business. You've obviously done some deals over the past couple of years and I think you've funded them with essentially internal capital. Based on your capital position today, if another Verizon-type deal comes along of that size, do you think you'd be able to fund that with internal capital?","Mark B. Grier","I'll let Rob answer that.","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes. Suneet, it's Rob. Yes, we feel we're -- the numbers I threw in front, I think we have adequate capacity in order to do similarly sized pension risk transfer or transactions on a prospective basis without going outside.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And that pertains to Verizon. If something even bigger, GM size, came along, would that still apply?","Robert Michael Falzon","We would have the capacity to do a similarly sized transaction, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have just a couple of quick ones. On the group results, Charlie, I know in the prepared remarks that Mark indicated that mortality and morbidity experience had improved, but I do believe that was a year-over-year comment. I'm more interested in whether you think, as a result of the repricing efforts, that the current quarter results are more indicative of a sustainable recovery there?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Yes, John, it's Charlie. I would say that you need to be careful there. That if you look at fourth quarter results, and we'll talk about life and then if you want to talk about disability, we can do that. But in terms of life, there's a high degree of seasonality here. So if you look at our benefit ratio this quarter of 86.3%, that's below the range of 88% to 92%. But if you look back to 2012, we were at 86% as well. So the fourth quarter usually is the best quarter for us and the first quarter tends to be far worse than that just by virtue of what happens. So I'd be careful and not project forward in that fashion.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I should have mentioned. So taking into account the seasonality of the business, maybe it's just an overall question as to where are you relative to your targets against sort of repricing and recovery of margins overall for this business? Let's take the quarter out of it.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Okay. Fair enough. I think what I'd say is we're pleased with the process but we're 2 years into a multiyear process, multiyear being defined as kind of 4-ish years, right? So if you look at it from that perspective, I think there's a way to go, but we're pleased with the process. The only other thing I'd say is that it isn't going to be linear, right? There will be ups and downs but if you look at a 4-quarter trend, I think both in disability and to a certain extent, life, you see a positive trend.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then, Mark, just a question on the corporate expenses in 4Q, I think you indicated that $0.09 was essentially this one-time special risk [ph] recognition-related comp. I'm just curious, why didn't you call that out in the press release last night? I mean, my sense is the stock is pressured today, at least in part, because of a perception that earnings power had sort of declined a bit. I think if you make the adjustment for this item, it really changes perception.","John Robert Strangfeld","John, this is John. Let me just respond to further embellishing upon what it was. The journey we've taken from a 10% ROE in 2010 to 14%-plus in 2013 has been made possible by a whole lot of people, management, but also many folks in the rank-and-file. And that broad-based group of rank-and-file are people who do not participate in our long-term comp programs or other types of equity programs. And so what we concluded and what the board was supportive of is we needed to do something specific to recognize the efforts of these men and women who have been so extraordinary over the course of this journey. That prompted us to do an accrual in the fourth quarter. And it also -- and the order of magnitude of that, as Mark referenced, is around $0.09. The specifics of that actually haven't even been announced to the employees themselves, so we're a little bashful about how much we say about that but we concluded we should make a reference to that today.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. And like I said, I'm certainly not questioning whether it's deserved or not. Your results over the last couple of years have been terrific. I'm just trying to understand why it wasn't necessarily called out. Because, again, I just think it changes the perception of your quarterly results overall.","Mark B. Grier","This is Mark. I think it does in that respect particularly relative to headlines and we appreciate those comments. We're just in a situation where we have a little more communication that we need to work through and we're in that process, but your point is well taken.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And last one, real quick for Ed, just -- and I may have these numbers wrong. If I exclude the bank channel, and maybe that's the problem, I shouldn't exclude the whole bank channel, for Gibraltar, it looks like sales on a year-over-year basis fell. Am I looking at that right or should I not be excluding the whole bank channel?","Edward P. Baird","No, you're absolutely right, John. First, you can do it in a 2-step process. One, exclude the bank for the reasons we discussed, which is that we shut off the single premium yen product for the reasons of the margins that we talked about. And unfortunately, even with that, when you cut that out, the bank sales went up because they shifted over to the recurring premium. So if you cut out, and I think this is maybe inferrable somewhat from, I don't know what slide page -- is it Slide 22? What you'll see is that part of the sales that have been going to the lower-margin single premium shifted over to the higher-margin recurring premium whole life, so that's the first step. The second step is exactly as you've said, to look at the purer Life Consultant business. And it's completely appropriate to drill down as you're starting to, because if you look at the service number, the drop in sales is around 18% or 19%. But we actually feel pretty good about that because -- excuse me, the drop in the sales is more like 9% or 10%, and that's good because the headcount dropped by around 18% or 19%. In other words, what we've got is an 18% drop in headcount, only about half that drop, about 9% in sales. And the reason it didn't drop as much is because the productivity has gone up by about 13%, which is exactly what we're after. This is a model you recall we followed with Kyoei so successful 10 years ago, it's the same model we're following here. We will continue to put in place mechanisms that require people to produce at the level that we want. And until then, you'll see drops in headcount. I would suggest that we may be approaching that stability point because this is a quarter in which sequentially, we roughly stabilized and had a slight increase in headcount.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, on the non-bank SIFI topic, would you agree that the insurers are gaining traction, no argument that the capital requirements of insurers were different from the banks and when we might ultimately get some clarity on that issue?","Mark B. Grier","Well, on the question on when we may get clarity, I'd say it's very much work in process, and I wouldn't forecast that. I have felt all along that the conversations around capital have generally been constructive. And I do think that the insurance industry is at least being listened to and we continue to believe that when the dust settles, we will have a capital regime that works.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Switching gears to International, do you get the sense here that we might begin to see a rebound in International sales given that the bank sales channel has likely bottomed here?","Edward P. Baird","Let me break that down into a couple of pieces for your. The Life Planner sales, as you know, have continued to grow very steadily throughout this period. Getting growth in the low-double digits in spite of the fact that you get a lower growth rate on the headcount, that's been a trend that's been going on for some years now and I have no reason to believe there'll be a shift there. The trend on the Life Consultant is exactly as we just reviewed. What we're seeing is a flat to, in this quarter, slight drop in sales, but that's the result of a significant drop in the headcount that's being offset partially, in some cases fully, by a steady improvement in productivity. We'll see that trend stabilize. And at some point, I would be hopeful that we will experience exactly what we experienced with Kyoei, which has been stable, higher producing, therefore a higher-profit producing distribution system in Life Consultant. So those 2 trends, I think, are fairly stable and somewhat predictable. The bank channel is the one that's unpredictable. I think we'll continue to experience volatility there as an ongoing feature because we're not targeting revenue growth there, we're targeting bottom line growth. And that distribution system is more susceptible to the -- responding to competitors. So we will continue to do the kind of thing we've done it this past year. Last year, we were comfortable. I mentioned last year -- excuse me, in 2012 we were comfortable with the margins we were getting in the beginning with the single premium. As the competitor actions and the market movements made that less profitable, we then took actions to correct that. We're quite willing to absorb the reduction in sales in order to preserve our profitability.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Last quarter, you commented that capital planning will be part of the supervisory process with the Fed. In that light, could you just describe what conversation, if any, you had with the Federal Reserve prior to executing the share repurchase this quarter?","John Robert Strangfeld","We're not going to comment on any Prudential-specific regulatory conversations or issues. Again, we've commented numerous times on our general views on capital regime and the kind of issues we think are important and I'm happy to talk about that, but we're not going to comment on our specific relationship with the Fed.","Operator","And we have time for one final question and that will be from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With the pension closeouts, have you seen the pipeline increase as plan funded statuses improved? And I guess related to that, what do you think may be the biggest factor holding back more jumbo transactions from occurring right now?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Erik, this is Charlie. I think I would divide the market into 3 parts. And the first part is really 0 to $2 billion. And there, that's kind of the cash market. And we've seen that increase slightly over the past year. Now that's a very competitive market; there are lots of people who play in that market. But we've seen slightly more transactions than we have in the past in 2013, and we have no reason to think that, that will slow down. The second part will be sort of the $2 billion to $4 billion range, so that's what we call the mid-cap range, and there's definitely more activity in this range defined as a lot more conversations taking place with clients and a lot more consultant activity. This is more -- it could be a cash market, it could be an in-kind market, but there are a limited number of competitors in this market or a more limited number of competitors. But there are more conversations taking place. And then you have the jumbo market, which we would define as $4 billion and up. And we're having a lot of conversations there. I'd say, in many ways, the same conversations we've been having for the past 1 year, 1.5 years with a variety of different clients. But as you correctly point out, with funding ratios having increased substantially this past year -- average funding ratios for corporations are now somewhere in the 90s -- the intensity and specificity of some of those conversations have gotten higher or have increased. So again, these will be episodic there. They take a long time to do. To your point, there are a lot of constituencies that have to agree to this, so it has to go through HR, it has to go through the board, it has go through senior management. So they're a long time in planning. They also take time in planning in terms of repositioning of the portfolios. But there are transactions, which we are talking to a variety of planned sponsors about and they will be episodic but we think over time, some of them will occur.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful color. And maybe just if I could just ask one more on just the International business. I guess, how do you think about your current businesses and strategies in faster growth international markets? You would, I guess, have to include Brazil and Malaysia? And kind of what's your strategy for investing in these businesses and when do you believe they could become a meaningful contributor to results?","Edward P. Baird","Let me break that down for you into a couple of timeframes. We continue to have tremendous growth out of our existing businesses as we just reviewed, in particular, Japan, and secondarily would be Korea. If you look out more in the medium term, I'd bring up as an example, Brazil, which you mentioned. So let me provide you a little bit of specifics there. In fact, of the -- if you look at the chart, of the $14 million in growth year-over-year, that came out of the Other countries, $10 million of that $14 million came out of Brazil. And in sales I'm talking about, excuse me. I'll focus on sales and then we'll talk a little bit about profitability after that, because sales obviously, are the primary leading indicator of this. So that puts them up quarter-over-quarter almost 60%. And that quarter is not an anomaly. Brazil, for the year, is up around 60%. What's particularly encouraging about that is it's coming from all 3 of the healthy drivers, so the headcount is up around 35% and the rest of that growth is attributed to average premium and productivity. So last year, we saw a growth of roughly from 600 to almost 800 in the number of life planners. They have now broken into that range where they're covering their fixed costs and they're now starting to produce a small profit. So in the immediate future, I would not see them materially contributing to AOI. But if you extrapolate out into sort of a mid-range term, in the 3 to 5 year, I can see them starting to be a material contributor to the profitability. And I think that is the kind of growth that will be sustainable for a very long time. It's an enormous market with tremendous intrinsic secular growth that's available to it and we have an extraordinary position in that marketplace. And then in the long term would be markets like the Malaysia one that we pointed out to you, places like China and India, but I would position them to be somewhat further out on the spectrum. But what it gives us and what our plan is, is to have a steady sort of 3-staged growth where we get the profit coming out of our significant mature markets, we get some kicking in, in that midterm range and then others that hold potential, more in mid-term, long-term future. That's the strategy that we employ as we look at the markets.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. until midnight, February 13.

Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.","In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today.

Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. And we'd like to acknowledge also, today, we have Charlie Lowrey in a different role as Head of International and we welcome Steve Pelletier in his new role as head of the U.S.","Before I hand it over Mark and Rob for more specifics, I'd like to kick things off with some macro comments. We are very pleased with the results for the first quarter and we believe we're off to a good start to achieve our goals for 2014. Our annuities, retirement and asset management businesses have benefited from sustained growth and account values of asset under management. Returns and risk profile in our annuities operation continue to migrate towards our objectives for this business, as the sustained period of favorable equity markets and a gradual shift in the composition of our block have driven improvement. We're very comfortable with the risk profile as it stands today and we're also comfortable with the expected profitability of the products that we are selling.","Our Retirement business had its best ever quarter. Outstanding results were driven by improved investment spreads in both Institutional Investment Products and Full Service retirement, even excluding a higher than expected contribution from non-component investments. Higher fees also contributed to earnings growth this quarter. And although we recorded no pension risk transfer transactions this quarter, we continue to believe that PRT is an attractive opportunity that will develop further over time.","Asset Management achieved its growth in earnings entirely on the strength of growth in asset management fees, reflecting growth in assets under management. Other related revenue was down slightly from a year ago and contributed less than 20% of adjusted operating income for the quarter. So as assets management earnings have increased, we believe it's quality of earnings have improved as well.","In our domestic insurance operations, we see underlying improvement, even though adjusted operating income is lower than a year ago. After 6 consecutive quarters of mortality more favorable than expected, individual insurance had less favorable experience this quarter. Our integration of Hartford continues to progress well and our distribution capabilities are broader and deeper than before as a result. We believe our product portfolio, now fully integrated, is well diversified and poised to achieve appropriate returns.","Lower earnings in Group Insurance reflected a less favorable result to disability, attributable to an adverse fluctuation in claims. Disability remains a work in progress and while the business has improved, its improvement will not be linear. Getting this business right will take more time, but we are confident we will get there.","Finally, International Insurance, excluding the few significant items Mark will review with you, recorded modestly higher earnings with hindrance from currency translation. The Life Planner earnings continue to benefit from business growth but the benefit in that growth was partially offset by less favorable mortality and foreign currency translation. The business itself is still humming along, producing very attractive returns.","Gibraltar's results reflected lower expenses, as well as modest business growth. Gibraltar has now completed the integration of Star and Edison and the expense savings we plan for are now in the till. Within Gibraltar's captive agency system, we've raised performance standards and the sales productivity of our life consultants is now in line with that of Gibraltar's agents prior to the acquisition of Star and Edison. Over time, the number of life consultants will stabilize and then grow and that will give the business a boost.","So overall, we feel very good about our quarter and where we're going. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark, over to you.","Mark B. Grier","Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll take you through our results for the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture.","So starting with Slide 2, I'll begin with an overview of our financial results for the quarter. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.40 for the first quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $2.27 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 16% amounting to $2.46 this quarter compared to $2.12. On that basis, pretax earnings for our operating divisions increased by 17% for the quarter. This is largely the result of 3 things. First, a greater contribution from investment results, reflecting exceptionally strong current quarter returns from non-coupon investments, including our Fosun venture, as well as actions we've taken to reposition the portfolios for our pension risk transfer business and Prudential retirement. Secondly, higher fees driven by growth and account values and assets under management in our annuities, retirement and asset management businesses. And third, continued growth of our International Insurance business, which also benefited from lower expenses.","On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $1.2 billion for the current quarter compared to a loss of $735 million a year ago. The loss in the year-ago quarter reflected the accounting impact of foreign currency remeasurement of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese insurance company driven by a weakening yen. In the current quarter, the impact from this remeasurement was less significant because the yen was relatively stable in relation to the U.S. dollar and to other non-yen currencies in which we offer insurance products in Japan. The comparison of book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI, is affected by the accounting presentation mismatch from asset liability changes, driven by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The impact of these fluctuations on non-yen liabilities of our Japanese insurance companies runs through the income statement, while the offsetting impact on the corresponding assets, which are currency-matched with the liabilities, is included in AOCI rather than in net income. After adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of this mismatch, book value per share is $61.74 at the end of the first quarter, up $1.75 from year end, after payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. As we've told you, we also evaluate our ROE performance after adjusting for this accounting presentation mismatch, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. After removing this benefit, along with the impact on results for market-driven and discrete items, our annualized ROE for the first quarter would be about 16%, reflecting continued solid business performance with a tailwind from non-coupon investment results.","Slide 3 presents a rundown of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter. In the Annuities business, we strengthened our reserves for guaranteed minimum debt and income benefits and adjusted DAC, mainly due to a decline in interest rates from year end and resulting in a charge of $0.03 per share. In Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to the Hartford Life acquisition. And in our International Insurance Life Planner business, we recorded refinements to reserves and related items, mainly in Korea, amounting to a charge of $0.02 per share. In total, the items I just mentioned had a net unfavorable impact of $0.06 per share on first quarter results.","During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net benefit of $0.15 per share, mainly driven by a favorable reserve and DAC update in the Annuities business and a gain in Gibraltar Life from the sale of our remaining indirect investment in China Pacific Group.","Slide 4 shows net realized gains and losses. On a GAAP basis, our net income of $1.2 billion includes the items you see here, which were essentially offsetting in the current quarter. Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activities had a negative impact of $657 million, driven by mark-to-market on our GAAP liabilities for variable annuity living benefits, reflecting the decline in interest rates in the quarter. Going the other way, mark-to-market on derivatives, mainly related to asset liability duration management, resulted in a $275 million pretax gain, also largely driven by the decline in interest rates. General portfolio activities resulted in net pretax gains of $180 million and impairments and credit losses on investments were $37 million for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, foreign currency remeasurement had a relatively modest impact for the quarter resulting in a pretax gain of $231 million.","Moving down to our business results. I'll start with our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses shown on Slide 5. Here's a view of the results of these businesses and the adjustments we would make for market-driven and discrete items to get a view of underlying performance relative to a year ago. Slide 6 highlights Individual Annuities. After adjusting from reserve and DAC updates, which were mainly driven by a decline in interest rates in the current quarter and favorable equity market performance relative to our assumptions a year ago, Annuities results were $409 million for the quarter, an increase of $99 million from a year ago.","Slide 7 presents a view of the earnings trend for the Annuities business, where the results reflected in the gold bars exclude the impact of market-driven and discrete items. Most of our earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. On a point-to-point basis, as you see here, account values of $155 billion at the end of the first quarter are up 9% from a year ago, mainly driven by market appreciation. However, the increase in average account values compared to the year-ago quarter was 11%, outstripping the point-to-point increase and driving growth of $71 million or 12% in policy charges and fee income. Our results have also benefited from a reduced drag from charges for benefit costs and base amortization as the rising account values have lowered the perspective costs of guaranteed death and income benefits associated with our contracts and the improvements to our gross profits have contributed to a more favorable back amortization rate.","Slide 8 shows annuity sales. Our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, in line with the past few quarters, but down from $4.2 billion a year ago. In late February of last year, we implemented a number of changes to our highest daily income product, including reduction of income payout rates at various age bands and elimination of the guaranteed doubling of protected withdrawal value after 12 years while leaving the writer charges unchanged. Nearly all of the sales in the year-ago quarter were of the earlier version of the product, including some level of accelerated purchases in advance of the product change. We continue to take actions to adopt our products in order to maintain appropriate return prospects and improve our risk profile. As part of this process, we've taken steps to enhance our product portfolio, allowing us to broaden the choices we can offer to retirement-focused clients and their advisers, while diversifying our risk exposure.","Sales of our Prudential Defined Income, or PDI product, shown in the light blue bars, have begun to meaningfully contribute to our sales mix, accounting for about $460 million or roughly 20% of gross sales for the quarter, bringing cumulative PDI sales to over $1.2 billion. PDI directs a client's entire investment to a separate account fixed income portfolio which we manage and which provides a guaranteed lifetime income amount. This income level is scaled relative to the premium paid based on the client's age at purchase. The payout percentage grows at a contractual roll-up rate until lifetime withdrawals begin. One of the key features of PDI from a risk management and return perspective is our ability built into the product design, to change both the income payout rate and the roll-up rate for new business on a monthly basis, enabling us to keep pricing in sync with changing market conditions. We've also built this pricing flexibility into the current generation of our highest daily living benefit feature called HDI 3.0, which we introduced in February of this year. HDI 3.0 allows us to change the roll-up rate for the protected value that determines the basis for lifetime income and to change the withdrawal percentages for various age bands as often as monthly for new business. The new product also requires allocation of 10% of each purchase payment to a general account fixed bucket called a secure value account that helps provide account value stability through changing market conditions.","Shown on Slide 9, the Retirement business reported record-high adjusted operating income of $364 million for the current quarter, an increase of $136 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited by $123 million from a greater contribution from net investment results. This includes about $80 million of returns that we would consider above our average expectations on non-coupon asset classes. The exceptionally high returns on these asset classes in the current quarter, which also benefited the results of several other businesses, were largely driven by strong performance from private equity investment funds. Net investment results and retirement also benefited by approximately $30 million from actions we've taken to reposition the portfolios supporting our pension risk transfer business. The remainder of the increase in Retirement results came mainly from higher fees driven by account value growth.","Turning to Slide 10. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $10.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $9.5 billion a year ago. Full service gross deposits and sales were $8.6 billion for the quarter, with 5 case sales of over $100 million, including a major case win of $2.6 billion. This compares to total of $5.7 billion a year ago. We are not seeing major changes in the Full Service market and attractive large case opportunities are lumpy. Full service net flows amounted to $2.6 billion for the quarter.","Standalone institutional gross sales were $1.7 billion in the current quarter compared to $3.8 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included $1.4 billion of stable value rep products, while the year-ago quarter included $3.7 billion of those products sales. Greater competition is emerging in the market for these products with an increase in the number of rep providers. Our standalone institutional business had net outflows of $1.3 billion for the quarter, including benefit payments on pension risk transfer cases and withdrawals by stable value rep clients seeking provider diversification. Total retirement net flows for the current quarter amounted to $1.3 billion and account value stood at a record high $327.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $28 billion from a year ago.","Slide 11 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $193 million for the current quarter compared to $169 million a year ago. The $24 million increase in earnings was mainly driven by higher asset management fees, reflecting growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management amounted to $891 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 6% from a year ago, reflecting market appreciation together with about $17 billion of institutional and retail net flows over the past year.","On Slide 12, you see the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses, showing the adjustments to Individual Life results for integration costs related to the Hartford acquisition.","Slide 13 highlights Individual Life. After adjusting for integration costs, Individual Life reported earnings of $133 million for the current quarter compared to $145 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by less favorable claims experience in the current quarter. The contribution, the current quarter results for mortality experience, together with reserve updates, was about $20 million less favorable than our average expectations. This compares to a mortality contribution about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations in the year-ago quarter. The impact of less favorable claims experience in the current quarter was partly offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including about $15 million of returns that we would consider above our average expectation on non-coupon asset classes.","Turning to Slide 14. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $122 million for the current quarter. This compares to total sales of $216 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by an $88 million decline in sales of guaranteed universal life insurance products shown in the dark blue bars. We've taken actions over the past year to limit concentration in these products and to maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases. In addition, we discontinued substantially all sales of the legacy Hartford products at the beginning of this year as we introduced our integrated Individual Life product portfolio, representing a major milestone in the business integration, which remains well on track. As we expected, these changes caused some acceleration of sales of the legacy products in the second half of last year.","Term insurance sales in the light blue bars were down $8 million from a year ago, reflecting price reductions by several competitors. Sales of universal life without secondary guarantees, shown in the gold bars, contributed $25 million or about 20% of our overall sales for the current quarter. These products, which offer relatively low protection costs and are more investment growth oriented than secondary guarantee universal life, have been popular among clients and the distributers who came to us with the Hartford acquisition. We've incorporated the best features of the Hartford product and the Prudential founders plus product included in our integrated product portfolio, allowing us to broaden the choices we can offer to life insurance customers while diversifying our risks.","Shown on Slide 15, Group Insurance earnings amounted to $6 million in the current quarter compared to $9 million a year ago. The unfavorable impact on results of an adverse fluctuation in Group Disability claims experience and higher expenses at a year ago was largely offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including about $15 million of current quarter returns that we would consider above our average expectations on non-coupon asset classes. Slide 16 shows Group Insurance sales trends. Most of our group insurance sales are recorded in the first quarter based on calendar year effective dates. Group insurance sales, based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $170 million in the current quarter, down from $193 million a year ago. The sales decline reflects our focus on restoring appropriate returns in this business.","Turning to the International Insurance division on Slide 17. Here are the results of our International Insurance business. Adjusting for the current quarter refinements of reserves and related items in the Life Planner business and for the China Pacific gain and Star\/Edison integration costs in Gibraltar Life a year ago.","Slide 18 highlights the Life Planner operations. After adjusting for the charges I mentioned, our Life Planner business reported earnings of $435 million for the quarter, up $13 million from a year ago. Results continue to benefit from sustained business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up 6% from a year ago. The benefit from business growth was partly offset by less favorable claims experienced, including reserves update in comparison to a strong year-ago quarter. We estimate that the negative impact on the comparison and results was about $15 million. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 82 this year versus JPY 80 last year, had a negative impact of $6 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago.","Slide 19 highlights Gibraltar Life. Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $418 million for the current quarter, up $26 million from a year ago after adjusting for the items I mentioned. The current quarter benefited from business growth and from lower expenses than a year ago, including some nonlinear items such as employee benefit costs. Both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter benefited from strong investment results, with income from non-coupon asset classes contributing about $50 million to results in each period. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $9 million in the comparison of Gibraltar's results to a year ago.","Slide 20 shows the International Insurance sales trend. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $772 million for the current quarter compared to $841 million a year ago. Market developments, along with repricings and other actions taken by us and by our competitors, have produced volatility on our quarterly sales results. The impact of these factors over the past 2 years has been especially dramatic and distorts quarter-over-quarter comparison. Over that period, our international sales pattern has been affected by changes in the Japanese tax code resulting in a surge of business market sales for our cancer whole life product in early 2012; by repricing of our U.S. dollar products in mid-2012, along with weakening of the yen in relation to the U.S. dollar since then, which made our U.S. dollar products more expensive in yen terms to Japanese consumers; by product repricings by us and our competitors in reaction to changes in Japanese statutory reserve interest rates effective of April 2013, which accelerated sales of some of our products into the early part of last year; and also by opportunistic sales of over $1 billion of a yen-based single premium bank channel product at Gibraltar, followed by the discontinuation of that product late last year as we increased emphasis on recurring premium death protection products.","The comparison of overall first quarter international sales to a year ago was most significantly affected by the discontinued single premium bank channel products and going back 2 years ago, by that product along with cancer whole life. If you adjust first quarter sales to exclude cancer whole life, shown in the light blue bars and the discontinued product, shown in the brown bars, current quarter sales are up 5% from a year ago and increased at a compound growth rate at 6% from 2 years ago.","Slide 21 shows Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $369 million in the current quarter compared to $365 million a year ago. Life Planner sales are typically strongest in the first quarter which is the end of the Japanese fiscal year, driving sales of some products that are popular in the business market and March is the end -- is the close of the sales conference qualification period at Prudential of Japan. Sales in Japan for the current quarter amounted to $270 million, down slightly from a year ago. The comparison of current quarter sales to a year ago is affected by purchases in advance of a repricing of a number of our Japanese yen-based products in April of last year and by the weakening of the Japanese yen over the past year, which makes our U.S. dollar products more expensive in yen terms to Japanese consumers. Sales outside of Japan were up by $8 million or 9% from a year ago. Looking back over 2 years, the comparison of first quarter sales is most significantly affected by sales of our cancer whole life product in advance of a 2012 tax law change in Japan that made the product less attractive in the business market and by accelerated purchases of our U.S. dollar products in advance of a June 2012 repricing at Prudential of Japan.","Slide 22 presents the Gibraltar Life sales trend. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $403 million in the current quarter compared to $476 million a year ago. Taking a look at Gibraltar's sales by distribution channel, you can see a $63 million decline in first quarter sales through the bank channel, shown in the gold bars, compared to a year ago when the discontinued single premium product that I mentioned contributed sales of $107 million. Sales of other products through the bank channel increased by $44 million from a year ago, driven by the recurring premium death protection products that we are emphasizing.","Sales through independent agents, shown in the light blue bars, are up by $20 million from a year ago, mainly driven by retirement and investment focused products in the business market. Sales by life consultants in the dark blue bars are down $30 million from the year-ago quarter. Similar to Japanese Life Planner sales, the comparison is affected by accelerated purchases of a number of our Japanese yen-based products in advance of our repricing in April of last year. In addition, our Life Consultant count has declined by about 1,450 or 14% from a year ago as we implemented minimum production requirements and other Prudential standards for the sales force that came to us with the Star and Edison acquisition. Looking back 2 years, the comparison of first quarter sales is most significantly affected by the discontinued single premium bank channel products and by our active management of the sales force. Current quarter Life Consultant sales are at roughly the same level as 2 years ago, but with about 30% fewer agents now onboard as we've taken steps to build a more cost effective and productive proprietary distribution channel.","On Slide 23, Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $342 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $303 million loss a year ago after adjusting for a write-off of bond issue costs. The increase in the loss reflects higher expenses in the current quarter, including nonlinear items such as corporate advertising and a lower pension credit. The benefit of lower interest expense reflecting our refinancing of high coupon debt last year was a partial offset.","And now I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon.","Robert Michael Falzon","Thanks, Mark. I'll provide an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility with just a few slides. Starting on Slide 24. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. As of year end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 456%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $13.9 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio as of the end of the first quarter has not changed materially since year end and is above our 400% target, which we believe gives us a cushion against our AA objective.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 772% and 937%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, which is December 31, 2013. These are comfortably above their 600% to 700% targets. Our Japanese insurance companies will soon report solvency margins as of their March 31 fiscal year end. And while the calculations are not yet final, we expect them to continue to be in a strong position relative to their targets.","Looking now at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses on Slide 25. We calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and at other subsidiaries. As of year end, we estimated that our on balance sheet capital capacity was about $3.5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we consider readily deployable. Taking into account our results for the quarter, our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.53 a share or about $250 million and share repurchases also of about $250 million, we estimate our on balance sheet capital capacity was over $4 billion at the end of the first quarter. A portion of that we consider to be readily deployable has not changed materially since year end.","Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to $3.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing debt, to fund operating needs and to redeploy over time.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Great. Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A question for Mark. Met on their call last week talked about regulators getting a better understanding of separate accounts and that really regardless of what happens with the Collins Amendment, it's possible for them to either not assess capital charges or at least not assess significant capital charges for the nonguaranteed portion of separate accounts. So wondering if that's the message or sense that you guys are getting as well.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, it is. And I think I'd make an even broader statement about the insight that regulators are gaining into the whole solvency model and capital world of insurance. The issue around nonguaranteed separate accounts is specific and relates to the line of sight to the capital of the company, and I think that point, as well as others, are being discussed constructively and often.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a question for John. You've talked about the 13% to 14% ROE target is sort of, I believe, sort of a through-the-cycle return, so there will be periods where you're clearly above that, as we've seen more recently in periods that are below. But how should we think about -- what's a reasonable sort of standard deviation from this average?","John Robert Strangfeld","Well, I guess the way I look at it, Chris, is it's less about an average and more about something we think we can achieve through the cycle absent a tail event. So maybe just to put in a little more context, we've talked about this '13 and '14 aspiration since 2010. Obviously, it's no longer a goal, it's reality. And in fact, our run rate in '13, and again in Q1 of '14, is better than that. And we think this is something -- we don't think of it as an average, we'd rather think it was something we think we can achieve through the cycle absent, as I say, tail-type events. And by maintaining that through the cycle represents superior performance relative to peers and relative, I think, to most balance-sheet-oriented financial institution. So we're sticking with the '13, '14. We think its superior, it's not a once-and-done phenomena, it's a focus on sustainability over time. And that's how we're thinking about it.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you had some leadership changes take place post Ed's departure earlier in April. Just wondering if there's anything we should take from that in terms of potential changes in strategy or if Charlie or Steve if they've kind of assessed their businesses, if there's any incremental changes?","John Robert Strangfeld","Well, I'll just offer 1 or 2 macro comments on this. This is very classic Pru of carefully thought through, orderly change, planned over a long period of time. So you've seen nothing in this transition that's reflective of anything other than the intense focus that we always apply to talent management and to success in planning. And we're feeling very, very good about these transitions. Clearly, any new leader in a role takes a fresh look at things and that's the way to think about it. But we're feeling very good about where we are and where we're headed in the I think quality, continuity and stability in the leadership team.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question on Gibraltar. You've done a great job of improving the consultant productivity. So are they still seeing those relatively large declines in the number of consultants down another 5%, 6% on a sequential basis? I know you mentioned in your comments that you expect that number to eventually stabilize and then grow. Hoping we can get some color on when that's likely to happen.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure, Nigel. This is Charlie. So let's just -- let me take that in a couple of different ways. So the Life Consultant account was down about 14% year-over-year. And that really does reflect, as you said, a continuation of the active management of the Star and Edison sales force, enforcing validation requirements and doing a variety of other things. But a couple of comments on that: The second derivative of the decrease is derivating, in other words, is decreasing. In other words, the rate of decrease is decreasing. So this quarter, we went down by 14%. Last quarter, we went down by 18% and the quarter before that, we went down by 20%. So it is coming down. Now in terms of productivity, we're back up to where we were before we acquired Star and Edison. So we're back up at sort of 3.5 policies per month level. So productivity is where it was. And so I think what you'll see going forward, what you'd expect is the percent change in sales will reflect now the percent change in the Life Consultant account going forward. And that's exactly what we see is happening and that's exactly what happened with TOA. So if we go back about a decade to TOA, TOA took 4 years to actively manage their sales force to where wanted it to be. And the sales force was reduced over that period of time by roughly 40%, rough justice. Now we're 3 years into the Star\/Edison process and we're down rough justice, about 30%. So we have a ways to go. We're entering into the bottoming-out phase. But I think you'll probably see that later this year or the beginning of next year, somewhere in that time frame, as we finalize the process. But this is a sort of textbook -- sort of what we did with TOA and we're doing exactly the same thing here.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. Second question on group insurance, being that the repricing tools several years but results don't seem to be getting better. Is perhaps the price increases that you've been pushing through have been insufficient and that you need another round of rate hike beyond your original expectations or is it more just a matter of timing that the actions that you take are just going to take more time to be evident in the results?","Steve Pelletier","Nigel, this is Steve Pelletier. The results in group insurance this quarter are driven purely in the disability business and purely through claim severity in the disability business. When we look at what we've done over the past couple of years and are continuing to do in the business in terms of repricing, in terms of lapsation of unprofitable business, in terms of claims incidents, and in terms of effectiveness of managing claims, we don't see any reason to lack confidence in the path of recovery that the business is on. Having said that, as Charlie has emphasized in the past, that path is not going to be a linear one. It can have ups and downs as we saw this quarter in relation to claim severity. But we think that the price increases we've engineered in the past couple of years and that we continue to increase are at the appropriate level.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So first, a question on the stable value business. Your sales flows slowed down there. And you mentioned a little bit, you're seeing a little bit more competition. So just if you could elaborate on that and whether you're seeing competition from public companies, mutuals? And then secondly, on FSA, very strong flows during the large case, I think, about $2.6 billion in there. But maybe talk about competitive trends in that market as well and what your view is in terms of pricing conditions in the Full Service market.","Steve Pelletier","Jimmy, Steve again. I will take your questions in kind of reverse order, the points you mentioned. First of all, Full Service. No, we don't see any change in our view of competitive dynamics in the marketplace or in our business strategy in relation to those dynamics. We're obviously pleased by the first quarter sales and flows. However, I'd emphasize that, that contained one very large case, a $2.6 billion case, a public entity on the West Coast. We said before that we're selective in relation to these large cases. Selective does not mean we can't compete, though, when we like the characteristics of the case as we did in this instance. But I don't think that's anything that we can count on going forward. As Mark said, they are inherently lumpy. In IOSD, you are seeing a slowing of sales, and that's fully expected on our part. Our sales performance the last few years in the business reflected our stepping into a void in the marketplace. And now the competitive circumstances are changing. Having grown the book the way we did, we are now facing concentration limits at some counterparties as we would expect to. Also, as you mentioned, new competition, that is coming, Jimmy, both from banks and insurance companies. So I'd emphasize that there's a range of new competitors in that market. As of right now, we have not seen the entrance of that new competition and new capacity depress margins in the market. But obviously, we've got our eyes closely on that. We're not -- it would stand to reason that increased competition could do that, as we've done so to date, but we got our eyes on it.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then maybe one more on the Individual Life business. Hartford had showed a decent amount of universal life with secondary guarantees. You obviously pulled their product off the shelf and you've incorporated some of the features of their product into yours. How comfortable -- as you looked at the Hartford block more, how comfortable are you with the pricing in that -- in the block that you acquired?","Steve Pelletier","We feel solid about the block of business in terms of its profitability, in terms of its risk profile. The pulling of the product, of the Hartford product from the shelf, is simply reflective of our integrated product design strategy and it just reflects further integration progress following the acquisition.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","One quick follow-up on the Group business. The -- so just looking at the earnings trajectory and so the loss ratio on Group Disability, do you need to take another round of rate and repricing for that group disability block?","Steve Pelletier","We continue to repress the business as it comes up for repricing, Tom. So that's not a course of activity that ends. We are about 60% of the way through repricing the block of business that was on the books a few years year ago. We expect to make significant further progress regarding the remainder at the beginning of next year. Most of this business reprices at January 1 of the year and then the remainder would occur during the course of 2015. So this is not a process we're done with but it's a process that has been progressing as expected.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one for Mark. The -- any thoughts on the dual bills that are running through the house and the senate, focused on the Collins Amendment and whether that's significant from your end?","Mark B. Grier","Well, there's certainly a qualitative significance in the broad-based support for clarifying the original Collins Amendment as it relates to capital standards for non-bank SIFIs. And I think there's a compelling message in the fact that a number of legislators on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of Congress have stepped up to endorse or co-sponsor these bills. I'm not going to comment on the prospects for passing the bills because that's deeper water that I'm willing to swim in. I'm not quite sure how all that stuff is going to work. But I think there's a very clear message in the formulation and the positioning of these bills in both parties and in both houses.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And, Mark, just a follow-up on that. Is it important from your end that this does get passed and clarified in terms of the ultimate rule setting? Or do you believe that it -- even without these getting past that, ultimately, it's going to get to a place that you all would be comfortable with?","Mark B. Grier","I do believe that this will ultimately get to a place that we'll be comfortable with. The Collins Amendment, as originally drafted or passed and as interpreted by some, is actually an obstacle to implementing Dodd-Frank and achieving the objectives of the bill relative to stability and financial strength. And I think that's clear, and I think we will, ultimately, find a solution either through this kind of legislation or through a more direct administrative solution.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up on retirement. The margins there were quite strong even after stripping out what you've defined as favorable investment income. Can you describe what's really driving it? I saw crediting rest rates were down by a fair amount, is it really just spreads?","Steve Pelletier","Spreads are a contribution to it, but also, I mean, I think you're seeing when you take a look at, for example, the Full Service part of the business, you look at our ability to generate greater contributions through a lot of the work we've done in that part of the business. Greater implementation of auto enrollment activities, auto escalation features in plans. So that has helped as well. In the meantime, withdrawals stay at a relatively consistent percentage of unplanned balances. So that has also been a contributor.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just operating leverage in the business continues to flow through, is that a fair description?","Steve Pelletier","I think that would be a good characterization of it, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question to start on annuities and the ROA. If I look at Slide 7 of your deck, it looks like the year-over-year improvement in ROAs was pretty significant, from 87 basis points to I guess 105. And I know on the last call, we talked about some of the dynamics or drivers that are causing this to occur. But I just want to get a sense, order of magnitude. How much of that improvement would you say is related to the whole K factor adjustments that you make on a quarterly basis?","Steve Pelletier","I'd say a very significant portion of this today. This is Steve. When you look at the scale of economies in the business, those remain in place, the business has effectively managed expenses from a general administrative standpoint. But the lowering of the K factor has been significantly driven by outsized equity market performance of certainly the past year, but over the past few years. As you all know, our projections for equity market group are more modest. And so then it would only stand to reason that if markets performed in line with those expectations, any further expansion of the ROA would be at a much more modest rate.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then I guess -- I don't know if we can do this externally, but if you wanted to look at this annuity ROA maybe on a statutory basis, where I'm guessing that we would eliminate a lot of the noise around DAC and K factors. What would that improvement sort of look like, order of magnitude?","Steve Pelletier","We won't be able to address that today, Suneet. I haven't even looked at that. We report annuity results on a GAAP basis and we've got multiple legal entities here. It would be difficult to do in a way that would be very meaningful.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And I guess my second question is on unbaked civvies. As we think about some of the commentary we've heard from AIG and MetLife, it sounds like both companies are spending a fair amount of time, both in terms of investments of dollars and investments of people, in terms of improving their financial systems, to be able to give the Fed what it wants in the manner in which it wants it and the time in which it wants it. And I guess we've not really heard or at least have not heard the same sort of commentary from Prudential. And I'm just kind of curious how you think your systems and everything are positioned to kind of handle what could be some sort of new stress tests if this whole non-bank civvy thing goes in a way that's similar to what -- to the direction it's been going in.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, this is Mark, I'll start off and then I'll ask Rob to comment as well. I guess the beginning, starting point is that we're going through a lot of the same thing. The supervisory environment is evolving with the Federal Reserve and we're working on the same kinds of questions about reporting and interfaces and the capabilities that we need to be effectively supervised by the feds. So it's work in process for us. Let me comment briefly on stress test. We've shared with you our capital protection plan. And we go around the track on stress testing frequently here, that there will be challenges to align exactly what we do, what exactly what's expected. But we feel like that's an area in which we've refined our capabilities going back really to the beginning of the financial crisis in ways that are pretty constructive and helpful. The point of that isn't that we won't have to do some things differently but that we're coming into this with a lot of work already done around the things that we understand and also around the quality and credibility of the work we do in stress testing. The things that we understand as they affect our capital insolvency issues. Let me ask Rob to comment briefly and maybe a little more specifically on the capability issue and what's going on there.","Robert Michael Falzon","Suneet, I'd make a couple of observations. One, yes, we are going to make similar investments and are making similar investments in both talent and systems. I would observe that we're starting with a very strong foundation in each deliver off of. And so that's extraordinarily helpful. Second, as Mark mentioned, from a stress testing specifically standpoint, we have done stress testing over a long period of time. We've done that both within a statutory framework and we've done that in the context of our capital protection framework as well. For us, it's a matter of migrating that over to a framework that is more Fed-centric than that which we've used. And we expect that, that will occur over an extended period of time. We are confident that we both can execute on this and that we have an ability to meet any reasonable standards that may be put up with respect to both the process of testing and the results of that testing.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And should we think about that migration to Fed standards as sort of a -- from a statutory framework to more of a GAAP framework?","Robert Michael Falzon","I think that is absolutely one component of it. If you look at how we historically have been regulated, obviously, the statutory framework is critical to us. Although we have translated that historically into GAAP. But yes, the Fed is a GAAP regulator not a stat regulator and that would be one component of the migration.","Mark B. Grier","Yes. Just one comment on that. The standard language of the regulation of -- internationally, the regulation of large financial institutions, is in a consolidated framework. And the only place for us that consolidated numbers live is in the GAAP world. We don't have a consolidated statutory view. But I would emphasize that we also have to pay a lot of attention to what our specific individual legal entities look like and the bottoms-up issues related to capital and liquidity and stress. So we're going to have to bring together both dimensions. But as Rob said, the consolidated GAAP world is generally the starting point for looking at large financial institutions in any regulatory setting, as it's been historically and as standards have emerged now.","Robert Michael Falzon","I think I'll add one more comment, Suneet, which is when I described that migration, I would say that migration is coming from both sides. The existing stress testing framework that the Fed has used is very bank-centric. So it's not only GAAP, it's bank-centric. And so there's an acknowledgment that we need to move off something that's historically been entity level and statutory. And the Fed will need to look -- migrate its own stress testing away from those things that are appropriate to banks to those that are more appropriate to the insurance industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citi.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess could you first provide an update on your outlook for pension closeout activity. I know, John, you mention that in your opening remarks. And I guess is there a sticking point that's preventing larger deals from getting done right now or is it just a function of the long tail transaction process?","John Robert Strangfeld","Sure, sure. Let me ask Steve Pelletier to speak to that. Steve?","Steve Pelletier","Thanks, John. Erik, we still feel very positive about the prospects for development of the pension risk transfer markets. Funding levels are up, so are TBGC premiums. And revise mortality tables continue to sharpen every one's attention on longevity risk. So we continue to feel that, that bodes well for both the ability and propensity of planned sponsors to transact. These things take time to work their way through the system, both within plan sponsors and then on discussion with potential counterparties, like ourselves. But we still feel the basis for development is there. Charlie, last quarter talked about segmentation of the market from a size standpoint. I would add to that segmentation in the market from both a funded basis in which we're actually taking on the assets and on the part of the market where we're talking about pure longevity reinsurance. Look that in either way, both by size or by type of business, we are in a number of active discussions. We continue to feel that we will participate in the various segments of that market, in particular in the large segment that really plays to our strengths and our ability to develop customized solutions. But these transactions, as well as large full-service cases, these transactions are inherently lumpy and we'll see how they emerge. But the prospects for development of the market are still solid.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And if I could ask just one follow-up on the annuities business, where you've highlighted again how the earnings has outpaced AUM growth. I'm just wondered how much operating leverage do you have left in this business and can earnings growth continue to exceed AUM? Again, assuming there that the markets follow your normal assumptions, not the outsized returns we've had over the past couple of years.","Steve Pelletier","I think, Eric, just to echo earlier comments, there can be further progress from the operating leverage that's kind of inherent in the business but that progress is going to be much more moderate if markets perform more in line with our more moderate expectations.","Operator","And we have time for one final question and that will be from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If we look at the FX drag rate for this quarter, can you help us think about the forward impact of what with the rolling Japanese yen hedge program looks like for the next couple of years?","John Robert Strangfeld","Well, we don't disclose the forward rates beyond the current year. We will talk about next year's translation rate at some point before the end of this year. But just a reminder of that, the hedging program is rigorous and structured. It's not discretionary, we don't try to anticipate moves in exchange rates, we put in place a rolling hedge over 3 years. What that basically means is that at any point in time, the next 12 months are fully hedged, the 12 months after that are about 2\/3 of the way hedged and the 12 months after that are about 1\/3 of the way hedged. The hedging transactions are executed in forward markets. So you ought to pay attention to the difference between spot and forward if you really want to try to hone in on this number. But basically, if rates stabilize where they are after 3 years, it will have fully worked its way through our translation and we'll be translating at a yen rate that's where the current market is. So a long way of saying it depends on how the market moves, but we do smooth it out as a result of our hedging translations.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And to follow-up on that. As -- since you discontinued the yen-based bank channel single premium whole life product, is it fair to assume that the overall portion of U.S. dollar earnings would actually increase in Japan? And can you give us a sense of what the business mix, kind of denomination look like?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","We can't give you a specific mix, but there has been a proportion of obviously dollar-based sales. That's been the best-selling products in POJ for quite some time. With the diminution in the bank products, the single premium yen denominated whole life, the interesting part is that we are beginning to sell other products, as Mark said, in that particular channel. So the recurring premium whole life has come in, as we are selling more of now. And that's right down the center of the fairway of what we want to sell. So it's much more mortality-based and we like that product. In terms of the multicurrency product, we're not selling as much in the dollar-based product for a couple of reasons: one, interest rates have come down; and two, yen has depreciated against the dollar. So that product has diminished slightly against some of the other currency products that we sell.","John Robert Strangfeld","Keep in mind that the in-force is large. And so the impact of any particular product activities in any particular year isn't going to move the needle very much. Those yen-denominated single premium products, which had fairly thin margins anyway, didn't swing earnings very much in favor of yen. And any particular year's activities will have a modest impact on mix.","Eric Durant","Yaron, it's Eric. Without addressing what changes might occur in the future, rough justice, today, about half of the earnings in Japan are yen-denominated.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one more question on the annuity space. So clearly, you're successful in growing the PDI product, which is an income-oriented product. I think one of your competitors was talking last week about maybe shifting into a more of an investment-oriented product. Do you see a more attractive opportunity in the income protection side, or do you see some opportunities in investment growth, as well, in the annuities?","John Robert Strangfeld","First of all, just to address one fact point in your question. We did launch an investment-only product at the end of April. But now let me place that in context. Our strategy in the annuities business is based on helping clients achieve secure retirement income. And doing so through a range of products that diversifies and mitigates our risk, we feel very confident about the profitability and risk profile of all the products that currently populate that strategy. HDI, as we've redesigned it, as Mark spoke about; PDI, which you mentioned; and now going forward, the investment-only product as well. So we think the range of these products is important to fulfilling that strategy of helping achieve secure retirement income.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. today until midnight, May 15.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you, Cynthia. Thank you for joining our call. We hope we're not interrupting your summer vacation. Representing Prudential today are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.","In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the second quarter of 2014, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, this presentation may include references to adjusted operating income or to earnings per share, or EPS; or return on equity, or ROE; which are determined based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services businesses that exclude certain items. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for an income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, and the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the comparable GAAP measure, please see our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information related to the company's financial performance is also located on our website.","Over to you, John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. The central message today is that we had strong results in the second quarter, and we are on pace to achieve our goals for the year. While we've clearly benefited from some tailwinds, including strong investment results and favorable mortality, business fundamentals are the main driver of our improving results. We think it's significant that each of our divisions produced higher earnings than a year ago.","Mark and Rob will review the quarter in greater detail in a few minutes, but here are a few highlights. Our Asset Management business achieved its 27th consecutive quarter of positive institutional flows. Also, retail flows were positive. Sustained growth in assets under management is driving growth in asset management fees and in operating income. Our Annuities business has benefited from a sustained period of favorable equity markets, which has driven higher earnings, improved returns and a lower risk profile. We are very comfortable with the expected profitability, as well as the risks of the products we are selling today. Over time, we expect the risk profile of this business to improve as the composition of our block gradually shifts to products with less equity market exposure.","Retirement continued to produce outstanding results, largely because of strong investment spreads, including a contribution from non-coupon investments that was modestly higher than our average expectation. Although we recorded no pension risk transfer transactions in the second quarter, we completed 3 PRT deals in July, including a landmark longevity reinsurance transaction, which will hit our books in the third quarter. We continue to believe that PRT, both funded transactions like GM and Verizon, as well as those where we solely reinsure longevity risk, is an attractive business opportunity for Prudential.","Individual Life Insurance and Group Insurance both achieved higher adjusted operating income this quarter. In Individual Life, the Hartford integration continues on track, and expense synergies contributed to the positive earnings result this quarter. In Group Insurance, experience was more favorable than a year ago in both life and disability. We are confident that Group Insurance is on the right track, but improvement will not be linear.","Finally, International Insurance recorded solid results in the face of difficult sales comparisons and currency headwinds. Life Planner results benefited from sustained business growth and improved claims experience. Gibraltar's earnings topped $500 million for the first time, modestly above the strong result a year ago and a seasonally strong second quarter. Productivity in the Life Consultant channel is back to pre-acquisition levels, and the rate of decline in agents is slowing. And over time, we expect the number of life consultants to stabilize and then to grow, and that will give the business a further boost.","So overall, we feel very good about our quarter and our business trends. And with that, Mark, over to you.","Mark B. Grier","Thank you, John, and thank you, Eric. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. And thank you, all, for joining our earnings call today. I'll take you through our results for the quarter. And then, I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture.","Using Slide 2, I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.49 for the second quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $2.30 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up by 12%, amounting to $2.51 compared to $2.24 a year ago. This is largely the result of 4 things: first, higher fees, mainly driven by growth in account values and assets under management in our Annuities and Asset Management businesses; second, improved claims experience in our Group Insurance business; third, continued growth of our International Insurance business; and fourth, lower net expenses in several of our businesses.","On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of just over $1 billion for the current quarter compared to a loss of $517 million a year ago. The loss in the year-ago quarter reflected the accounting impact of foreign currency remeasurement of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese insurance companies, which was driven by weakening of the yen, as well as negative mark to market on derivatives we use in duration management driven by rising interest rates. In the current quarter, the yen was relatively stable in relation to the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which we offer insurance products in Japan, and the impact of interest rate changes on our duration management derivatives was more moderate. As a result, our current quarter GAAP net income is fairly consistent with our after-tax adjusted operating income.","We consider the foreign currency remeasurement that affects our net income to be essentially an accounting presentation mismatch because we hold currency-matched assets to support the non-yen liabilities of our Japanese insurance companies. And the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the liabilities runs through the income statement, while the offsetting impact on the assets is included in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI. Book value per share, excluding AOCI and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of this mismatch, amounted to $63.67 at the end of the second quarter, up by $3.68 from year-end after the payment of 2 quarterly dividends totaling $1.06 per share.","We also evaluate our ROE performance after adjusting for this accounting presentation mismatch, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. After removing this benefit, along with the impact on results from market-driven and discrete items, our annualized return on equity for the first half of the year would be about 16%. This reflects solid underlying performance across our businesses, with a tailwind from strong non-coupon investment results, particularly in the first quarter, and some seasonality that favors the first half in International Insurance.","On Slide 3, we have a very short list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the current quarter, with a net unfavorable impact of $0.02 per share. In the Annuities business, the impact of a decline in interest rates in the quarter exceeded the benefit of favorable performance of equities and our market-driven adjustments. We strengthened our reserves for guaranteed minimum debt and income benefits and adjusted DAC, resulting in a net charge of about $0.01 per share. And in Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to the Hartford Life acquisition. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net benefit of $0.06 per share, mainly driven by a favorable reserve and DAC update in the Annuities business.","Turning to Slide 4. On a GAAP basis, our net income of just over $1 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as realized investment losses of $273 million pretax, comprised of the items that you see on this slide. Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activities had a negative impact of $365 million, driven by a mark-to-market on our GAAP liabilities for variable annuity living benefits, reflecting the decline in interest rates in the quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement resulted in a pretax loss of $231 million for the current quarter. This reverses a gain of the same amount that we had in the first quarter. Impairments and credit losses on investments were $27 million for the quarter. Going the other way, general portfolio activities, mainly in our International Insurance operations, resulted in next -- net pretax gains of $199 million. And mark-to-market on derivatives, mainly related to asset and liability duration management, resulted in a $151 million pretax gain, also largely driven by the decline in interest rates.","Moving now to our business results and starting on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses. This is a view of the results of these businesses showing the adjustments to results for the Annuities business that we would make from market unlockings and experience true-ups. Slide 6 highlights the Annuities business. After adjusting for reserve and DAC updates, Annuities earned $394 million for the quarter, an increase of $69 million from a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7. Most of our operating earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to account values. At the end of the second quarter, account values were just under $160 billion, with market appreciation driving a 13% increase from a year ago. The resulting increase in fee income was the leading cause of the earnings growth from the year-ago quarter. In addition, the rising account values have lowered the prospective costs of guaranteed death and income benefits associated with our contracts and have contributed to a more favorable DAC amortization rate, resulting in a reduced drag from charges for benefit costs and base amortization. These developments have contributed to a higher margin for the business, compounding the increase in fees to produce a 21% increase in earnings from the year-ago quarter.","Slide 8 presents Individual Annuity sales. Our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.7 billion, up roughly $200 million from a year ago. As you see on this slide, the mix of our sales has changed significantly, reflecting our strategy to broaden the choices we can offer to retirement-focused clients and their advisors, while diversifying our risk exposure.","Sales of our Prudential-defined income, or PDI, product, shown in the light blue portions of the pie charts, amounted to $530 million in the quarter or about 20% of overall sales. PDI directs a client's entire investment to a separate account fixed-income portfolio that we manage, and the product provides a guaranteed lifetime income amount, which is determined by applying an income payout rate based on the client's age at the time of purchase to the premium pay. The payout percentage grows at a contractual roll-up rate until lifetime withdrawals begin. The design of PDI allows us to change both the income payout rates and the roll-up rate for new business on a monthly basis, enabling us to keep pricing in sync with changing market conditions. For example, a purchaser of PDI today would receive a 50-basis-point lower roll-up rate and a lower initial payout rate than in the first quarter, since our current pricing gives effect to recent interest rate declines.","Sales of our highest daily suite [ph], or HDI, products, shown in the dark blue portion of the pie charts, accounted for $1.9 billion of our current quarter sales compared to $2.1 billion a year ago. Substantially, all of the current quarter sales represent our current-generation product, HDI 3.0, which we introduced in February of this year. Similarly to PDI, HDI 3.0 allows us to change key pricing elements, including the roll-up rate for the protected withdrawal value that determines the base for lifetime income and withdrawal percentages for various age bands as often as monthly for new business.","The remainder of our current quarter sales, about $300 million, represents Annuities without living benefit guarantees. To further broaden our product portfolio and enhance the solutions we can offer to client focused on tax-deferred asset growth potential, in April, we introduced our Prudential Premier investment variable annuity product, which does not offer these guarantees and unbundles guaranteed minimum death benefits as an optional add-on.","Slide 9 highlights Retirement. The Retirement business reported adjusted operating income of $286 million for the current quarter, an increase of $7 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results. Current quarter results benefited by approximately $30 million from actions we've taken, mainly in the second half of last year, to reposition the portfolios supporting our pension risk transfer business, essentially migrating a portion of the portfolio from public fixed-income investments to private fixed income and commercial mortgages, consistent with our asset and liability management strategy for this business. This benefit was largely offset by lower income from non-coupon asset classes compared to a year ago. Returns on these investments exceeded our average expectations by about $10 million in the current quarter and exceeded our expectations by about $35 million in the year-ago quarter.","Shown on Slide 10, total retirement gross deposits and sales were $6.6 billion for the current quarter compared to $8.1 billion a year ago. Full Service gross deposits and sales were $5.5 billion for the quarter compared to $3.7 billion a year ago. Attractive large case opportunities in the full service market are lumpy, leading to a variable sales pattern from one quarter to another. For example, during the first quarter of this year, we closed 5 case sales of over $100 million each, including a major case win for $2.6 billion, while current quarter new sales plans included only one case over $100 million, and the year-ago quarter had no case sales of that size. We had net outflows of $1.5 billion in Full Service Retirement for the current quarter, reflecting elevated plan lapses, including the impact of client merger and acquisition activity.","Stand-alone Institutional gross sales were $2.1 billion in the current quarter compared to $4.4 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included $1.1 billion of stable value wrap products, while the year-ago quarter included $3.5 billion of those sales. Taking advantage of a market opportunity over the past several years, we have grown the book of this fee-based business to over $70 billion. We are now seeing greater competition in the market for these products, with an increase in the number of wrap providers. Our stand-alone Institutional business had net outflows of $2.5 billion for the quarter, including withdrawals by stable value wrap clients seeking provider diversification. In addition, ongoing benefit payments on pension risk transfer cases reduced account values. Total Retirement account values amounted to $330.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, up by $29 billion from a year ago.","Slide 11 highlights Asset Management. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $200 million for the current quarter compared to $172 million a year ago. The $28 million increase in earnings was mainly driven by higher asset management fees net of expenses, reflecting growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management amounted to $921 billion at the end of the second quarter, including $547 billion managed for institutional and retail clients. This represents a 16% increase in third-party assets under management from a year ago, driven by market appreciation, along with about $15 billion of positive net flows over the past year. Current quarter results also benefited from an $11 million greater contribution from the segment's other activities.","Slide 12 presents the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses, showing the adjustments to Individual Life results for integration costs relating to the Hartford acquisition. Slide 13 highlights Individual Life. After adjusting for integration costs, Individual Life reported earnings of $166 million for the current quarter compared to $152 million a year ago. The increase in earnings reflects a greater contribution from net investment results, mainly driven by portfolio growth and lower expenses. The integration of the business we acquired from Hartford is well on track, and on a run rate basis, the current quarter benefited from realization of about 3\/4 of our targeted $90 million of annual cost saves. Claims experience was favorable both in the current quarter and the year-ago quarter. The contribution to current quarter results from mortality experience, together with reserve updates, was about $15 million more favorable than our average expectation.","Shown on Slide 14, Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $103 million for the current quarter. This compares to sales of $184 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by a $75 million decline in sales of guaranteed universal life insurance products, shown in the dark blue bars. This sales decline reflects actions we've taken to limit concentration in these products and to maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases. In addition, a number of competitors have taken steps to make their products relatively more attractive, and several companies have recently entered or increased their presence in the guaranteed universal life market. Term insurance sales, in the light blue bars, were down by $7 million from a year ago, reflecting price reductions by several competitors. In July, we announced pricing changes on several of our guaranteed universal life and term insurance products, allowing us to enhance our competitive position where we see opportunities to offer attractive value propositions with appropriate expected returns.","Slide 15 highlights Group Insurance. Group Insurance earnings amounted to $46 million in the current quarter compared to $22 million a year ago. The increase was driven by more favorable claims experience both in disability and life. This is presented on Slide 16. In Group Disability, favorable current quarter claims experience drove an improvement of 9 percentage points in the benefit ratio compared to the year-ago quarter. This contrasts to an adverse fluctuation in the first quarter. While we've enhanced our claims management capabilities and are continuing to make progress in repricing cases as they renew, experience will vary from one quarter to another, and improvements won't be linear.","Slide 17 presents the International Insurance division. Slide 18 highlights our Life Planner business. Our Life Planner business reported earnings of $382 million for the quarter, up $14 million from a year ago. Results continue to benefit from sustained business growth. On a constant-dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up by 5% from a year ago. In addition, the current quarter benefited by about $20 million in comparison to a year ago from improved claims experience. We estimate that the mortality contribution to current quarter results was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations.","Higher expenses, driven mainly by technology and distribution costs, partly offset the benefits of business growth and improved claims experience. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of the yen income at JPY 82 this year versus JPY 80 last year, had a negative impact of $3 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago.","Slide 19 highlights Gibraltar Life. Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $502 million for the current quarter, up $14 million from a year ago after adjusting for integration costs. The current quarter benefited from lower net expenses than a year ago, including some nonlinear items, such as fixed asset sales and technology costs. The current quarter also benefited from a greater contribution from net investment results, mainly driven by improved spread on fixed-income investments. Going the other way, policy benefits experience, including mortality and surrenders, was less favorable than in the year-ago quarter. While mortality was somewhat more favorable than a year ago, with a current quarter contribution about $10 million greater than our average expectations, the year-ago quarter benefited by about $30 million from gains on an elevated level of surrenders of non-yen fixed annuities. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $11 million in the comparison of results to a year ago.","Turning to Slide 20. International Insurance sales, on a constant-dollar basis, were $769 million for the current quarter compared to $827 million a year ago. This is a product view of our sales. Our sales pattern has been affected by actions we've taken, including changes in our product lineup and commission rates. In addition, the seasonal sales trend favors the first quarter for our Japanese Life Planner business and the second quarter for Gibraltar Life. Our yen-based single-premium bank channel product, which we discontinued late last year after opportunistic sales of over $1 billion, contributed $62 million to sales of Gibraltar Life in the year-ago quarter, with minor residual sales through the fourth quarter of last year, as you can see in the brown bars.","In December of [indiscernible], we've reduced commission rates on the yen-based retirement income products sold by our Prudential of Japan Life Planners in order to limit concentration. This product, shown in the gold bars, contributed $29 million to current quarter sales, down $28 million from a year ago. Sales of all other products, including those denominated in U.S. dollars, increased by $32 million in the current quarter from a year ago. This includes a $10 million increase in sales of our U.S. dollar-denominated whole life and retirement income products, shown in the light blue bars.","Slide 21 shows Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $290 million in the current quarter compared to $277 million a year ago. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan were $185 million in the current quarter, down by $21 million from a year ago. In the gold bars, you can see the $28 million decline in sales of the yen-based retirement income product, affected by our change in commission rates that I mentioned. This more than offset an increase of $7 million or 5% in sales of other products, shown in the dark blue bars. Sales outside of Japan, in the light blue bars, were up by $34 million from a year ago, mainly driven by increases in Korea and Brazil.","Slide 22 shows Gibraltar sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $479 million in the current quarter compared to $550 million a year ago. Sales by Life Consultants, in the dark blue bars, amounted to $232 million for the current quarter, down $24 million or 9% from the year-ago quarter. Our Life Consultant count has declined by about 1,100 or 11% from a year ago, as we implemented minimum production requirements and other quality standards for the sales force that came to us with the Star and Edison acquisitions. In addition, the sales comparison is affected by accelerated purchases of a number of our Japanese yen-based products in advance of price increases in April of last year, which resulted in sales that were reported in the second quarter of last year.","Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gold bars, amounted to $167 million for the current quarter, down $51 million from a year ago. This decrease reflects the $62 million of sales of the discontinued single-premium product in the year-ago quarter that I mentioned, partly offset by an $11 million increase in sales of other products. We are emphasizing recurring-premium Death Protection products and life insurance policies with premium-paying periods of 10 years or longer comprised about 1\/3 of overall current quarter sales in the bank channel compared to just over 10% a year ago. Sales through independent agents, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $80 million in the current quarter, up modestly from a year ago.","Moving to Slide 23. Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $341 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $331 million loss a year ago after adjusting for a write-off of bond issue costs. The increase in the loss reflects higher net expenses in the current quarter, including the impact of a lower pension credit. The benefit of lower interest expense reflecting our refinancing of high coupon debt last year was a partial offset.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide you an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility. Starting on Slide 24. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 456%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $13.9 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio continues to be well above our 400% target at Prudential Insurance, after giving effect to the results for the first half of the year. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 777% and 955%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. These reported solvency margins are also well above our targets.","Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses on Slide 25. We calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our preset RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held at the parent and other subsidiaries. As of year-end, we estimated that our on-balance sheet capital capacity was about $3.5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we considered readily deployable.","During the first half of this year, we've returned about $1 billion to shareholders. These returns came in the form of quarterly common stock dividends of $0.53 per share in each quarter, for a total of about $500 million, and a repurchase of $500 million of our common stock. The net results of these returns of capital and the capital generated by our businesses in excess of their organic growth needs left us with available on-balance sheet capital capacity of over $5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we consider readily deployable. Our $500 million of share repurchases in the first half of the year, including $250 million in the second quarter, completed the $1 billion of repurchases authorized under the program that ended on June 30 of this year. As you know, we announced a new $1 billion repurchase authorization in June, which extends through June 30 of next year.","Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to $4.1 billion as of the end of the second quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy, over time, for strategic and capital management purposes.","Now I'll turn it back over to John","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Rob. And we would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citi.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was hoping that you could provide some more details on the economics of the BT longevity swap transaction. And how should we think about the earnings contribution? Also, how do returns for longevity swaps compare to those for pension closeouts?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Erik, this is Steve. I'd be glad to address that. The returns on both longevity transactions and funded transactions are very much consistent with our corporate ROE objectives. In regard to looking at longevity deals, vis-\u00e0-vis funded deals, I'd point to 2 key distinctions. First would be the relative capital intensivity [ph] of these transactions. Obviously, every deal is different, and you need to account for that. But if you were going to use a general rule of thumb that said that longevity deals are about 1\/5 as capital intensive per dollar of notional amount as funded deals, that would be pretty accurate. The key distinction there obviously being that, in longevity reinsurance, we're not taking on the assets and therefore, not taking on the credit risk that characterizes funded deals. The second point I would make is the emergence of earnings. The longevity reinsurance and funded transactions are highly complementary in this regard. So from both a strategic and a financial aspect, being active in both sides of the market in that regard is very attractive to us. Funded deals, the earnings level -- the annual earnings level gradually decreases over time. In longevity reinsurance transactions, the earnings emergence gradually increases over time. So those are the 2 key distinctions I would make.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. So I guess, is the right way to think about then kind of a ballpark, maybe 1% to 2% of the amount swapped is a reasonable estimate for kind of the required capital?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Yes, I think that would be fair.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess one follow-up is that we've seen a number of longevity swap transactions in the U.K. but very little activity in the U.S. And what do you think is driving this? And is there any reason that longevity swaps wouldn't become more prevalent in the U.S. over time?","Stephen P. Pelletier","I think the longevity market may well develop in the U.S. Certainly, the U.K. has been the leader in that. We also look for potential emergence of the longevity market in Canada, and the U.S. may well follow. But no question that, for us and for the market, in general, the U.K. has been the main leader in longevity reinsurance activity.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the earnings overall. Obviously, the $2.49 number was pretty strong. You mentioned in the release the DAC unlocking in Individual Annuity, also the Hartford Life integration costs. But wondering if you could just highlight some of the other items, whether they were seasonal or related to mortality, morbidity or non-coupon income that might have inflated the reported earnings numbers. And how do we think about earnings going from third -- second quarter to the third quarter? And I think, Mark, you mentioned some of those in your remarks, but if you could just highlight those. And then, secondly, on the Life Planner business. The Life Planner count was down this quarter, and it slowed -- the growth in that has slowed over the last few years. Can you still grow sales in the Life Planner business in Japan if your Life Planner count growth remains sluggish and remains in the sort of low-single-digit range?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure. Jimmy, let me -- this is Charlie. Let me take the second one first, and then we'll get back to you on the first one. Let me go through the Life Planner count in Japan, and then I might just comment on the rest of the Life Planner count as well. But in Japan, when you think about Life Planners, there are really 3 ins and outs to the business, and you really have to peel back the onion and look at them. So first, there are the recruits and the terminations, how many people do you actually recruit during a quarter and how many people leave for a variety of reasons. And that was about normal. The second is, as you know, we take Life Planners and some Life Planners choose to become sales managers. And the sales manager's job is to recruit, develop and retain Life Planners. And so over time and in different quarters, you'll get a number of different Life Planners who choose to become sales managers. In this particular quarter, we had more Life Planners who want to become sales managers. That is actually a good thing for the future because we expect the increase in sales managers, over time, to help with Life Planner recruiting in the future. So that actually bodes well in the long term. The third area is when Life Planners go to the bank channel. And here, these are the secondies [ph] we actually introduce into the bank channel. And here, what we do is we take lower-performing LPs, or Life Planners, and give them the opportunity to become secondies [ph] in the bank channel. And as you know, we only hire 2 or 3 applicants out of every 100. We're extremely finicky about who we actually choose to become a Life Planner. And we train them incredibly well to perform 3 different tasks, and that's to prospect, present and to close. But if an LP fails, an LP usually fails because he or she can't prospect. That's the toughest part of the job. But in banks, they don't need to prospect. So as secondies [ph] to the bank, they can perform really well over time. And that's what's happened in this particular quarter as well, is we had more LPs go to become secondies [ph] in the bank channel. So as a result, Japan was down some. If these folks hadn't transferred, the growth rate would have been about the long-term average that POJ has, which is sort of 1% to 2%. But the growth rate isn't unlikely to materially accelerate in terms of hiring LPs because of the number of LPs we have and also our maniacal focus on quality. We're not going to change the quality of our hiring. But I think the long-term average has been sort of 1% to 2%. It'll probably be that way in the future as we go forward. And that's really Japan. In Brazil, it's a slightly different story. You have -- Brazil's up a lot, about 25%. So we have over 800 Life Planners. And there, we expect, in some of our other markets, we would grow Life Planners at a more rapid rate.","Eric Durant","Jimmy, it's Eric. Let me just take...","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And actually, just one follow-up on that. The sales have exceeded -- sales growth has done better than the Life Planner count has done recently. So can you keep that up? And do you see further improvements in that business, especially in Japan?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","I think you may see some improvement, probably not on the productivity side, because Life Planners already are at a very high level of productivity. On the premium side, over time, what we've seen is that there has been a sort of constant -- and this is over time. It'll vary from year to year, quarter to quarter. But there has been an increase in premium over time. Not going to be huge, but it will add to the growth rate that you would expect on the Life Planner side.","Eric Durant","Jimmy, it's Eric. Let me have at your first question. We had a number of favorable items in the second quarter that may not be trend-able, and that amounted to about $100 million altogether pretax. They would include, in the Retirement segment, non-coupon investment income about $10 million higher than our average expectation. We had favorable mortality in Individual Life, in the Life Planner businesses and in Gibraltar, again with experience being more favorable than our average expectation. The amounts there are $15 million, $10 million and $11 million, respectively. We had favorable seasonality at Gibraltar, as Mark mentioned, that we estimate was about $30 million in comparison to the first quarter and all else the same in comparison to the third quarter. And we had a favorable level of net expenses in Gibraltar of about $20 million. So again, all else the same, you would expect the expenses to be about $20 million higher in the third quarter than in the second quarter. Again, the sum of all these items is about $100 million. It's actually $96 million or about $0.12 a share.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just, first, a quick one on the Retirement business. Just given the visibility that John mentioned to open the call on the deals that have been booked so far in 3Q, in terms of the PRT and the longevity deal, do you have visibility that flows will be meaningfully positive in 3Q? That was my first question.","John Robert Strangfeld","I wouldn't look to characterize our overall Retirement flows in the third quarter, Tom, the way that, for example, the longevity reinsurance deal for BT will show up, as it will show up in our flows and in our account values, but it won't show up on our balance sheet, given the fact that we're not holding assets vis-\u00e0-vis that deal. I would also point out that while we're very pleased about the kind of multiple transaction count in the month of July, we think it reflects a good pace of activity and good pace of our profile in that industry. The other 2 transactions, while we're very happy about them, they were significantly smaller. One was a longevity deal for about $1.7 billion, and the other was a funded deal for approximately $350 million.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And also just to follow up on the Full Service side. Just given some of the items you laid out on the large cases that went away this quarter or lapsed this quarter, would you expect some improvement there? Or is it just hard to tell, given the lumpiness of that business?","John Robert Strangfeld","I think it is, as you say, Tom, inherently lumpy. The -- what we saw in this quarter was actually, on the Full Service side, some pretty good flow in terms of transaction count and number of deals we closed. However, only one of them was above the $100 million mark that we use to characterize large transactions and that one just barely, while we had 4 lapses that we'd characterize as large and a significant portion of that was driven by M&A activity, in other words, our clients being acquired and the business being merged away from us to the other provider. And that's obviously inherently difficult to predict. But we're -- while we still see this as a very, very competitive business and we do not see that there's any near-term change in the -- in those competitive dynamics, we're pleased with the degree of activity that we see in this business. We're pleased with the condition of our pipeline. I think that's reflective of the investments we've made in the business, so that is encouraging.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one for me, if I could shift gears to Japan. The -- just, I guess, more of a broad industry question. We're seeing this with peers, too, that the sales environment seems to be becoming more challenging. I'm not sure if that's a function of the currency-related products that were sold and now those have become less attractive or has the competition just intensified. Can you give a bit more color with what's going on, whether it's on the sales front or the recruiting side?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure. I'll take the recruiting first. We don't see in -- we don't see a lot greater competition there because we recruit a very different kind of individual. So what we look for are generally people who haven't been in the insurance industry before but have sales experience that want to do something different, that want to be more in charge of their own compensation structure. And as a result, we continue to recruit a fair number of people. By a fair number of people, meaning the level that we want. So on the recruitment side, we don't see a lot of competition in the vein in which we operate. In terms of products, I would almost say the same thing. There is a fair amount of competition. There's a lot of competition for individual products in the third sector. And in the first sector, if you say just life insurance and savings, we concentrate on Death Protection. That is the core of what we do, and we see less and less people in the death protection market. In other words, a lot of people are moving over into savings products, and savings products are more competitive in terms of pricing. But in terms of traditional life insurance, in which we operate, we -- first of all, we compete as much on service as we do on pricing. And second of all, we are able to hold our prices. So we still feel pretty good about the margins we're getting and the products that we're selling. We have tapped the brake on certain products, as Mark talked about, whether it's the yen retirement income product or in the bank channel, the single-premium yen-denominated whole life. We obviously slammed on the brakes there, but that was our doing for specific purposes. Much have had to do with business mix as opposed to profitability. So on the profitability side, we still feel very good about what we offer, but more importantly, how we offer it. We -- it's a very different kind of sale. We have a needs-based selling process that we started in Japan 25 years ago, and we still adhere to that. So our core is Death Protection. Our core is leads-based [ph] selling, and our core is quality recruits. And we're continuing with that strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A question on Gibraltar, and I know upfront in the prepared remarks you talked about, over time, the life consultant count there starting to stabilize. But as you've implemented these higher production standards, particularly for the Edison and Star consultants, are -- where in the ballgame are you? Are you in the late innings there in terms of stabilizing that agent count? Should we expect that to fall significantly from here still or no?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Yes. I think you will still see it fall a little bit. I'd say we're in late innings, but we may have some extended innings. So let me just expand on that. In terms of the life consultant count, the rate of decreasing is decreasing, if you will. So we're down 11% this quarter. We were down 14% last quarter, 18% the previous quarter and 20% the quarter before that, so 20%, 18%, 14%, 11%. You can do the math. It's going to continue to come down, and we'll bottom out at some point probably late this year, first half of next year. But it's going exactly as we thought. But interestingly, in terms of the metrics, we're doing well. So in other words, the things that we hoped would happen and expected to happen, frankly, are. So John talked about productivity. Productivity has gone back to the pre-acquisition levels, as we had expected it would. 13-month persistency has increased from 89 -- sort of 89.5% back up to 91%. That's not quite up to the level we had before pre-acquisition, but we're getting back to that level. And finally, the policy -- policies are increasing in size. In other words, the in-force face amount has stayed relatively constant, but the number of policies has decreased slightly. And what that means, it gets back to my previous comment, which is this really makes sense, given the focus on Death Protection, as opposed to Star\/Edison, which was really pushing more savings products. So our focus is Death Protection. You're seeing that in the metrics coming out, and you're seeing us, again, focus on quality of life consultants. So numbers will continue to come down for a little while, but they are, as you can see, in the bottoming-out phase. And again, that will probably happen in the next -- by the end of the year, first half of next year, something like that. But this is going all -- along exactly as we planned.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, Charlie. And then, a question on the Annuities segment. On a core basis, excluding some of these discrete items, it looks like the pretax ROA for that segment continues to run right around 100 basis points. Maybe it's slightly higher than that. So other than equity market performance, is there any reason why that level of ROA for the business should shift from current levels? Would the shift over time, for instance, toward the PDI product, alter this return profile?","Stephen P. Pelletier","John, it's Steve. Equity markets will continue to be the major impact on the ROA going forward, the equity markets, in relation to our expectations. The business is at scale. The business is able to add business flows and account values without significant increase in expenses, so the ROA will continue to benefit from that. The -- in regard to the differentiation between PDI and HDI, those would not make a hugely significant impact on the ROA. There is a differentiation in fee basis between the 2 types of business, but if you're looking at the overall book of business, the -- that would not have a material impact on ROA.","Mark B. Grier","Yes. John, also remember the mix of the in-force. Yes, remember the mix of the in-force. PDI is still small.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, understood. And then, if I could sneak one last one in for you. Maybe a little bit more philosophical for you on capital management. I know you've talked in the past about wanting to be a consistent buyer of your shares over time. And clearly, since you reintroduced the buyback, $250 million quarter has been right on. I'm wondering how you square that with the fact that your first half results are arguably the best first half -- best 6-month period Prudential has ever had, yet your stock is down 6% year-to-date against the overall market, which is up 4%, and you're underperforming most of your peers. So I'm just curious why you wouldn't advance the pace of your buybacks when your stock is underperforming the way it is.","Robert Michael Falzon","John, it's Rob. I think the simple answer to that question is that we do not use stock buybacks to express a view on the relevant value of [indiscernible]. Rather, what we do is we look at buybacks as a deployment of excess capital that we generate on an annual basis, and we had sort of a waterfall that we've described and how we like to redeploy that. Obviously, it's, first, to finance the internal growth of our businesses; secondly, to provide for inorganic growth, like our PRT business, for M&A; and also, to provide a return to our shareholders. And we do that through the combination of the dividend and the stock buybacks. So not influenced by perception of relevant value of the stock in terms of the priority of how we would distribute that capital.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, I guess, I'd just -- I'd ask you guys to consider it. There are times when investors will be more interested in building positions in your stock than at other times, and I think this would be one of those times.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, can you update us on what you view as the prospects for passage in the House of the bill to create a separate capital standard for the non-bank SIFI insurers?","Mark B. Grier","Well, handicapping the political process is not my cup of tea. I will point out that there's a lot of momentum, significant sponsorship from both sides of the aisle and endorsements of the idea from a lot of different places, not just confined to Congress. But I can't tell you what's involved in making this happen and how that might play out.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. On a related issue, the treatment of corporate bond investments for life insurers without the ability to apply ratings from the rating agency seems to be something that needs to be addressed over time. Do you have any ideas on how that could be taken care of?","Mark B. Grier","Well, let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Rob. There are approaches to this credit evaluation and link of solvency and capital that reflect the things that we think are important, particularly the probability of default and loss given default. And I'll let Rob add some comments to that.","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes. So first and foremost, we expect that credit quality-sensitive capital construct for insurers would have to evolve. It would be imprudent for something other than that to manifest itself in sort of whatever regulatory outcome occurs here. With respect to the reliance on the rating agencies, there is a number of ways to do a workaround around that. Specifically within our own organization, we have internal ratings for all of our privates, including both the corporate bonds and the mortgages that we underwrite. And on the public side, we have mechanisms for being able to back into equivalent ratings without having to have to rely on the rating agency ratings themselves. And I suspect other institutions can get to the same place as well. So we don't view the lack of our reliance -- or the lack of the ability to rely specifically on the rating agencies to be -- as being an impediment to having a credit-sensitive metric ultimately put in place.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that should be able to have a workaround related to -- for the regulators treating all bond investments the same, regardless of rating, at least from an external rating standpoint?","Robert Michael Falzon","We certainly would think so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions going back to the BP [ph] pension -- longevity deal, excuse me. First, I'm flashing [ph] on Met's [ph] Investor Day and former CEO talking about problems in the U.K. with regards to regulation in that marketplace. It has become -- it had become significantly more difficult, significantly more conservative. Is that something that has not occurred on the longevity side?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Steven, it's Steve Pelletier. I'd make a couple of comments. First of all, remember that in longevity, we are focusing purely on just that, on longevity reinsurance and not taking on the assets. Second, I'd emphasize the point that in these transactions, both the BT deal and the other longevity deal that I mentioned, we are operating strictly on an offshore basis. And that is a key distinction there. The regulatory picture is very different for us given that posture.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then, just one more quick one on the accounting for the longevity deal. I think you said that it was going to be in your flows, but -- the $27 billion I assume, but not on the -- not in your balance sheet. How will this be reflected in the earnings statement? Is it a premium and an associated loss? Or any ideas?","Robert Michael Falzon","It's Rob. Essentially, you'll see a net fee coming through each quarter, representing the -- sort of the risk premium fee being applied.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Plus whatever the payments are, I guess. Or is that netted out?","Robert Michael Falzon","Well, the payments will be in exchange of the premium payments and then any benefit payment outflows that we need to make in accordance with fulfilling our obligation.","Operator","We'll take our final question from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just had one question that I'm hoping you can elaborate on, something that perhaps we've touched on in the past in this forum, which is the changing mortality tables, or the changing lifespan tables that are coming in the pension area. While I realize that, that's not going to affect company's cash immediately as they restate their liabilities upward, it's going to have the effect of, all else the same, increasing underfunded-ness as the Society of Actuaries table is instituted, I guess, at the end of this year. My question is, what's your best sense of how plan sponsors will respond? Will they adjust to this change by just putting more cash into their plan? Or will they say, \"We've had enough of this underfunded-ness,\" and they'll do more pension risk transfers? How will the typical CFO or Treasurer respond to this change in mortality table?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Eric, it's Steve. I assume there will be some degree of response that covers both the bases you mentioned. But we certainly do look for the new mortality tables to, across -- pretty much on an overall basis, increase propensity to transactions. We think that aside from funding levels, there are a couple of -- as we highlighted on Investor Day, there are a couple of fundamental things going on in the marketplace in terms of how plan sponsors look at this liability. One is the new mortality tables, and the other is PBGC premium. And so we think that the ongoing trends on both those fronts will increase propensity to transact.","Mark B. Grier","And this highlights longevity risk, and one of the big motives for transacting is the pure risk dimension. And this kind of puts it right in front of everybody again.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. today until midnight August 14.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter results were a little lighter than the other quarters of the year partly due to seasonality. But overall, we feel very good about 2014. More specifically, operating -- adjusted operating income, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was $9.84 per share for the full year 2014, which is an increase of 10% over 2013 and exceeded the expectation we established in guidance. Likewise, our ROE for the year exceeded our 13% to 14% long-term target range. Results benefited from tailwinds such as strong non-coupon investment income, favorable equity markets and better-than-expected underwriting experience. Nonetheless, we are pleased with the positioning of our businesses and the prospects going forward, and would like to highlight just a few. Our annuity business benefited from favorable equity markets that contributed to 15% adjusted operating income growth, excluding market-driven and discrete items in 2014. Additionally, we are pleased that our newer products like Prudential Defined Income, which isn't equity-centric, are gaining traction and collectively represent over 20% of total annuity sales in the second half of 2014. Retirement had a record earnings year, with strong momentum in pension risk transfer. We originated over $37 billion in total buyout and longevity account values in 2014, including the landmark $27 billion British Telecom longevity transaction. Asset Management reported $5.4 billion in positive unaffiliated third-party net flows in 2014. And assets under management grew 8% over year end 2013. While net flows in the second half of the year were less robust, solid underlying investment performance and business momentum keeps us optimistic that this will continue to be a good story going forward. Individual Life sales improved sequentially in the fourth quarter following selective product repricing in August, and we like our competitive positioning and business mix. We've also benefited from favorable mortality in 9 out of the last 10 quarters. The Group Insurance business continues to benefit from repricing actions, better underwriting discipline and improved claim handling processes. And while we're not ready to declare victory yet, our underwriting trends are certainly moving in the right direction. Our International businesses continue to perform well. Life Planner net premiums policy charges and fees grew a little over 6% on a constant-currency basis in 2014, and we continue to grow our Life Planner count while maintaining high standards. Gibraltar Life Consultant productivity has returned to levels last seen prior to the Star\/Edison acquisition. We are also now showing signs of stabilization in the Life Consultant count after raising productivity standards. Additionally, we have shown progress in growing our independent agency channel and improving our mix of businesses in the bank channel.","Capital management was also a key theme in 2014. We paid $1 billion in common stock dividends and repurchased $1 billion of our shares. We also look forward to the closing of our transaction with ILC to acquire an ownership stake in AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement services provider, following our signing of the memorandum of understanding in late 2014. In addition, our restructuring of the Closed Block business to repurchase the Class B shares and redeem the IHC debt simplifies our operating structure and added financial flexibility. And while the size of our below-the-line charges during the year was disappointing, we maintained a strong capital level and good balance sheet flexibility. Rob Falzon will discuss our capital strength in more detail in a few minutes.","As we look forward, we cannot assume the same tailwinds that we benefited from in 2014 will recur, and we're mindful of the need to navigate more challenging headwinds like the weaker yen, and if early 2015 is any indication, potentially lower-than-expected interest rates, as examples. Nonetheless, our diversified portfolio of high-quality businesses, our strategic positioning and the quality of our talent keeps us optimistic that we will maintain a top-tier return on equity and create strong value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll hand it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier","Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Thank you all for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. Before I discuss our results, though, I would like to provide some context around the comments that Rob will make about capital. First, I want to make the point that total debt in the company has been coming down, as we have intended. However, lower interest rates have resulted in an increase in the amount of debt that we characterize as capital. This is a familiar concept to those of you who have followed us closely over time. Second, our stated capital capacity of $2 billion reflects the impact on capital of repaying about $2 billion in capital debt, which we haven't done. In the past, we would not have earmarked a portion of capital to repay debt. And compared to the way in which we would have portrayed capital capacity in the past, our current number would be about $4 billion. We believe that this is a responsible way to describe capital capacity, understanding that any capital statements necessarily are influenced by underlying assumptions. Third, the gain on our yen capital hedges of $2.4 billion is not reflected in our capital numbers and represents a substantial offset to other market-driven effects. We also generate a lot of capital in our businesses, 60% of operating earnings over time. And we are very comfortable with our financial strength, capital position and our capital plans.","Turning now to operating results. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter, shown on Slide 2. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.12 for the fourth quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $2.20 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 5%, amounting to $2.33 compared to $2.22.","Looking across our businesses, here are some key drivers of this comparison. We benefited from higher fees reflecting growth in account values in our Annuities business, greater assets under management in our asset management business and the contribution of recent longevity reinsurance transactions in Retirement. And our international insurance businesses benefited from continued business growth and more favorable policy benefits experience, including mortality and currency-driven surrenders of fixed annuities. These benefits were partly offset by a lower contribution in Asset Management from incentive, transaction and strategic investing activities, in comparison to strong year-ago quarter results, driven largely by changing valuations and the timing of performance-based fees, higher expenses, including technology costs in several of our businesses, and less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in international insurance. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $1.2 billion for the current quarter. This reflects the impact of a $2.4 billion pretax loss or about $1.6 billion on an after-tax basis from foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement driven by the weakening of the Japanese yen. This remeasurement impact was largely offset by corresponding adjustments to asset values that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, which is outside of net income or loss.","As we mentioned in our earnings guidance call in December, we've implemented a new reporting structure in Japan that will largely mitigate the impact of these currency exchange rate changes on net income or loss, beginning with the first quarter 2015 reporting. Also commencing this year, we are moving up our annual actuarial assumption review to the second quarter.","Slide 3 shows our full year results. Earnings per share for the year, based on after-tax adjusted operating income, amounted to $9.84 after adjusting for market-driven and discrete items. This represents an increase of 10% from 2013, driven by solid underlying performance across our businesses, with tailwinds from equity markets, non-coupon investment returns and underwriting experience. These earnings produced an ROE of 15.8% for the year, after adjusting for foreign currency remeasurement, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of foreign currency remeasurement, amounted to $64.75 at year end, up $4.76 from a year ago after the payment of 4 quarterly dividends totaling $2.17 per share.","Turning to Slide 4. Slide 4 shows a rundown of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter. In the Annuities business, the decline in market interest rates and less favorable performance of separate account funds relative to our expectations caused us to strengthen reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and adjust DAC, resulting in a net charge of $0.10 per share. Reserve refinements in Retirement, Individual Life and International Insurance resulted in a net charge of $0.10 per share. The most significant items in the current quarter were reserve increases in International Insurance, mainly driven by a calculation update relating to higher premium-rated underwriting classes, and a reserve release in Retirement based on updated census data on annuitants in a legacy group annuity contract. In addition, in Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to the Hartford Life acquisition. In total, the items I just mentioned had a net unfavorable impact of $0.21 per share on fourth quarter results. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net charge of $0.02 per share.","Moving to Slide 5. On a GAAP basis, our net loss of $1.2 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $2.7 billion on a pretax basis, comprised of the items you see on this slide. Foreign currency remeasurement resulted in a pretax loss of $2.4 billion for the current quarter, as I mentioned earlier. Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activity had a negative impact of $799 million, largely driven by the decline in interest rates during the quarter. This was partly offset by $479 million of positive mark-to-market on derivatives mainly related to the management of asset and liability durations, also largely driven by interest rates. Impairments and credit losses on investments were $16 million for the quarter, and general portfolio activities resulted in net pretax gains of $66 million.","Moving to our business results, starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Slide 6 shows our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses. Slide 7 highlights Individual Annuities. Annuities results were $390 million for the quarter, up $6 million from a year ago. Slide 8 gives a view of growth in account values, fees and earnings. Most of our operating earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. Policy charges and fee income increased 5% from a year ago, essentially keeping pace with the increase in average account values. However, lower spreads on general account balances and slightly higher expenses in the current quarter partly offset the benefit of growth in fees. As a result, return on assets, or ROA, slipped a few basis points from the year-ago quarter.","Slide 9 covers our Annuities sales. Our gross Annuities sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Our Annuities sales have been fairly consistent over the past year, both on a gross and net basis. We've taken steps to diversify the risk exposures associated with our product guarantees to maintain appropriate pricing and return expectations under changing market conditions and to more broadly meet the needs of the retirement market. Taking a look at our annual gross sales, you can see how product diversification has affected our mix. A year ago, 84% of our overall sales represented our highest daily, or HDI, guaranteed lifetime income withdrawal product. The remainder of our sales consisted mainly of variable annuities where the customer did not elect the living benefit rider. We updated our HDI product in February 2014. A key feature of the updated product allows us to change key pricing elements as often as monthly for new business. Our most recent pricing reset was a few weeks ago, with a lower payout rate for certain key age bands. The 70% contribution to 2014 sales from HDI reflects our product diversification. Our Prudential Defined Income, or PDI, product contributed about 20% of our 2014 sales compared to less than 10% of sales a year earlier. PDI directs a client's entire investment to a separate account fixed income portfolio that we manage. The product provides a guaranteed lifetime income based on the client's age at the time of purchase and the premium paid with a roll-up provision. Similarly to our current HDI product, the design of PDI allows us to adjust key pricing features as often as monthly for new business. The remainder of our 2014 sales represents annuities without living benefit guarantee. This includes about $130 million of sales of our recently introduced Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuity, which does not offer living benefit guarantees and unbundles guaranteed minimum death benefits as an optional add-on. We've begun to gain shelf space for this product, and we believe it offers an appealing value proposition to those clients mainly focused on tax-deferred asset growth potential.","Slide 10 highlights the Retirement business. Earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $294 million for the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from higher fees, reflecting the longevity reinsurance transactions that we closed in the second half of the year. The benefit was largely offset by a lower contribution from net investment results. Current quarter results benefited from about $30 million of income, above our average expectations on non-coupon investments, and about $40 million of mortgage loan prepayment income, which is well above our average expectations. These 2 contributors totaled about $70 million, roughly $20 million more than our non-coupon income above average expectations a year ago. However, the net positive variance was more than offset by lower fixed income returns.","Turning to Slide 11. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $14.2 billion for the current quarter compared to $9.9 billion a year ago. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were about $8.5 billion in the current quarter compared to roughly $4 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included 2 significant funded pension risk transfer transactions totaling $4.6 billion and 2 longevity reinsurance transactions totaling $2.7 billion. Excluding these pension risk transfer cases, institutional stand-alone sales were about $1 billion for the current quarter, compared to roughly $4 billion a year ago, mainly reflecting lower sales of stable value wrap products. Institutional stand-alone net flows for the quarter were $3.7 billion. Outflows of about $2.7 billion of stable value wrap business and roughly $1 billion of ongoing attrition of our jumbo pension risk transfer and longevity reinsurance cases together with runoff of other legacy business partly offset our new sales during the quarter. Full Service gross deposits and sales, shown in the dark blue bars, were $5.6 billion for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Net outflows of about $700 million for the quarter reflected a lapse of a lower fee administrative services-only case of $950 million. Total Retirement account values amounted to $364 billion at year end, up $41 billion from a year earlier.","Slide 12 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $192 million for the current quarter compared to $209 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results came from asset management fees, the decrease from a year ago was driven by a $32 million lower contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. This contribution, which amounted to $25 million for the current quarter, is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuations and the timing of transactions. Excluding results from other related revenues, Asset Management earnings were up by $15 million from a year ago, largely as a result of higher asset management fees, driven by growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management amounted to $934 billion at year end, including $450 billion managed for unaffiliated institutional and retail clients. Third-party assets under management increased $35 billion from a year ago, driven by market appreciation along with about $5 billion of net flows over the past year. Net institutional outflows of $2.5 billion in the current quarter were driven by equities and included some client rebalancing of portfolios to reduce the weighting of some domestic equity product classes. These outflows were essentially offset by net retail inflows of $2.6 billion.","Slide 13 shows the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses. Slide 14 highlights Individual Life. Individual Life earnings were $135 million for the current quarter compared to $165 million a year ago. The decrease reflected higher net charges in the current quarter for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and related items, driven by the ongoing impact of our annual actuarial review in the third quarter and by financial market performance in relation to our assumptions, including the interest rate decline in the current quarter. In addition, current quarter expenses were above the level of a year ago, reflecting nonlinear items such as distribution costs and consulting. Claims experience was favorable both in the current quarter and the year-ago quarter. Putting it all together, we estimate that in comparison to our average expectations, claims experience, expenses and amortization had a net favorable impact of about $5 million on current quarter results. Slide 15 shows Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $130 million for the current quarter. This compares to sales of $166 million a year ago. The $36 million decrease was driven by lower sales of guaranteed universal life insurance products, shown in the dark blue bars. This decline reflects actions we've taken to limit concentration in these products and maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases, which contributed to the significant drop in sales that you see in the early part of the year. In August, we implemented pricing changes on several of our guaranteed universal life and term insurance products, enhancing our competitive position where we see opportunities to offer attractive value propositions with appropriate expected returns. These pricing changes contributed to a sequential quarter increase in sales of these products, which contributed a total of $92 million to current quarter sales compared to $74 million in the third quarter of this year.","Slide 16 highlights the Group Insurance business. Group Insurance earnings amounted to $44 million in the current quarter compared to $58 million a year ago. While we would consider our underwriting experience to be favorable in the current period, we had particularly favorable group life experience last year and high recurring period expenses that drove the negative year-over-year variance.","Slide 17 presents our earnings trend for Group Insurance and benefit ratios for Group Life and Group Disability. In Group Disability, favorable current quarter experience, driven by claims resolution and fewer new claims, produced a 79.1% benefits ratio, the lowest of the past 5 years. While we've taken steps to improve results, we continue to expect that claims experience will vary from one quarter to another. The Group Life benefits ratio, while less favorable than a year ago, was at the low end of our expected range.","Moving to International Insurance on Slide 18. This slide shows the results of our International Insurance businesses. Slide 19 highlights our Life Planner operations. Our Life Planner business reported earnings of $382 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Mortality was more favorable than a year ago, and we estimate that the contribution to current quarter results was about $25 million greater than our average expectations. Results also benefited from continued business growth with insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, up 8% from a year ago on a constant-dollar basis. The benefits to results from more favorable mortality and continued business growth were essentially offset by higher expenses driven by a range of items, including nondeferrable distribution costs reflecting higher sales, technology costs and sundry items such as annual true-ups of employee benefit plan liabilities. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 82 in 2014 versus JPY 80 a year earlier, had a negative impact of $3 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago.","Slide 20 highlights Gibraltar Life and other operations. Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $385 million for the current quarter compared to $378 million a year ago. The current quarter benefited from a greater contribution from net investment results than a year ago, which was largely driven by portfolio growth. Results from non-coupon investments were roughly in line with the year-ago quarter. Policy benefits experience, including mortality and gains on surrenders, was also more favorable than a year ago. We estimate that the contribution of this experience to current quarter results was about $20 million greater than our average expectation. The greater contributions to earnings from net investment results and policy benefits experience were partly offset by higher expenses in the current quarter. Like the Life Planner operations, the higher expense level was also driven by a variety of items, including technology costs. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $9 million in the comparison of results to a year ago.","Turning to Slide 21. Overall, International Insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $724 million for the current quarter, up $20 million from a year ago. Slide 21 is a product view of our sales. As you can see in the dark blue bars, Death Protection products remain our major emphasis and contributed about 60% of current quarter sales, with an increase of $47 million from the year-ago quarter driven by products such as term insurance. This was partly offset by lower sales of Retirement products, which comprised less than 20% of current quarter sales.","Slide 22 breaks out Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $311 million in the current quarter, up $13 million or 4% from a year ago. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan were $189 million in the current quarter compared to $196 million a year ago. As shown in the gold bars, sales of Retirement products decreased by $36 million to $56 million for the current quarter, reflecting a change in commission rates. This decrease was largely offset by an increase of Death Protection product sales, shown in the dark blue bars, including term insurance, which also reflected a change in commission rates. Sales outside of Japan, in the brown bars, were up by $20 million from a year ago, mainly driven by increases in Korea and Brazil.","Slide 23 shows Gibraltar Life sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $413 million in the current quarter compared to $406 million a year ago. Sales by Life Consultants, in the dark blue bars, amounted to $179 million for the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Our Life Consultant count stood at about 8,700 at year end, down about 600 or 7% from a year earlier, reflecting our active management of the sales force that came to us with the acquisitions of Star and Edison, including minimum production requirements. The decline in count was offset in the quarterly sales comparison by greater productivity, measured by policies sold per agent per month, which has returned to the level that we achieved prior to the acquisitions. The Life Consultant count has begun to stabilize, as you can see in the sequential quarter trend. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gold bars, amounted to $166 million for the current quarter, down $7 million from a year ago. This decrease reflects $22 million of residual sales in the year-ago quarter of a yen-based, single-premium whole life product that we discontinued. Sales of other products in the bank channel were up $15 million or 10%, with the growth mainly driven by sales of fixed annuities. About 2\/3 of our current quarter sales in the bank channel are the Death Protection products we emphasize, mainly recurring premium whole life. Sales through independent agents, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $68 million in the current quarter, up $11 million from a year ago. While Death Protection and Retirement products comprise the majority of sales through this channel, the year-over-year increase was driven mainly by greater sales of fixed annuities.","Slide 24 shows the results of Corporate and Other operations. Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $326 million for the current quarter compared to a $397 million loss a year ago. The reduction in the loss reflects lower expenses in the current quarter, driven by a variety of nonlinear items such as employee compensation and benefit costs and charitable contributions.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility, starting on Slide 25. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we manage to a 400% RBC ratio. While statutory results for 2014 are not yet final, we estimate that RBC for Prudential Insurance as of year end 2014 will be above 400%, consistent with the estimate that we provided in December. This year-end RBC position reflects a $2 billion dividend from Prudential Insurance to the parent company in December, which we applied toward the redemption of our IHC debt and the Class B Stock. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 858% and 931%, as of their most recent reporting date, September 30, 2014. These are comfortably above our 600% to 700% targets. And we expect that our Japanese companies will continue to report strong solvency margins relative to their targets as of their end of current fiscal years, which ends in March 31, 2015.","Looking at our overall capital position on Slide 26. We calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target, and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries. A year ago, our on-balance sheet capital capacity was roughly $3.5 billion, of which $1.5 billion was considered readily deployable. During the year, we declared 4 common stock dividends amounting to about $1 billion in total, including a dividend of $0.58 per share in the fourth quarter that represented a 9% increase and repurchased $1 billion of common stock, totaling about $2 billion of returns of capital. These capital uses were offset by capital generated within our businesses, primarily from operating earnings. In addition, our restructuring of the Closed Block business had the effect of reducing our total capital capacity, while increasing the amount we consider readily deployable by releasing trapped capital. As the available on-balance sheet capital capacity and readily deployable capital balances have now converged, providing 2 distinct capital figures has become less meaningful. Therefore, we will be providing a single capital capacity figure going forward. At year end 2014, we estimate our available on balance sheet capital capacity at $2 billion, with the vast majority of that amount considered readily deployable based on how we have defined that figure in the past. As described by Mark, our stated capital capacity is net of capital we anticipate using to pay down debt, calibrated to arrive at our long-term targeted financial leverage ratio of 25%. Absent such an assumption, our total capital capacity would be approximately $4 billion. Our on-balance sheet capital capacity is lower than the estimate for the year end 2014 that we provided in our 2015 guidance call in December. The variance is mainly due to the decline in interest rates that occurred in the fourth quarter, which had 2 primary impacts. First, we manage a portion of our variable annuity interest rate risk through a broader capital protection framework, which includes an underhedge position. As interest rates declined, a negative impact on the underhedge triggered a change in the required capital, causing a funding need that we satisfied with holding company resources. Secondly, the decline in interest rates through the quarter caused a higher statutory provision based on year-end asset adequacy testing. We evaluate our on-balance sheet capital amounts to set points in time. And therefore, it is not explicitly reduced by further capital commitments like our Chilean acquisition or increased for expected capital generation. However, based on what we know today, we expect to be able to fund our known or anticipated capital commitments with the capital we would expect to generate in our ongoing businesses. This includes generating deployable capital equal to about 60% of our operating earnings over time as well as other positive capital items, including settlements to PFI's -- settlements to PFI in 2015 on the $2.4 billion fair value of our Japan capital hedge.","Turning to the cash position at the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $4.2 billion as of year end. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy, over time, for strategic and capital management purposes. Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. I'd like to now open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citi.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First just wanted to touch on the capital topics a little bit more. On -- I guess, if interest rates, given the decline we've seen post year end, should we expect further pressure from kind of the interest rate underhedge? And also, could you elaborate a little bit more on the comments you made about the year-end asset adequacy test strengthening and where that was?","Robert Michael Falzon","Okay. So let me address first the sensitivity to further future declines. To state the obvious, further declines in interest rates are not helpful, but I would be careful not to extrapolate the fourth quarter sensitivities. There are a number of moving pieces beyond just rates that affect those items. And capital sensitivity is not by any means linear. Our assets and liabilities have convexity, and they are -- and the capital is significantly influenced by management actions that we take. Hence, it's why we actually don't provide sensitivities on capital in the same way that we did for you on AOI. We are continually evaluating our overall sensitivity to markets generally and to interest rates' movements both up and down specifically to assess our exposure. We modulate shocks to the current environment. We look at the accounting, capital and economic exposures to both moderate and severe shocks, up and down. And we assess the accuracy of our capital protection framework, including available capital capacity, on and off balance sheet, and our hedges including the annuities interest rate underhedge that I discussed. I'd also note that with respect to the annuities interest rate underhedge as well as AAT, in a rising interest rate environment, capital is released from each of these and restored to our capital capacity. With respect to the other part of your question, Erik, in terms of -- are you seeking further elaboration on the change in year end?","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Where you saw the kind of statutory -- asset adequacy test strengthening?","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes, so we strengthened the reserves for AT by about $1 billion year-over-year.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Was that in specific products? Or...","Robert Michael Falzon","Well we haven't filed our statutory filings yet. And so we're not really able to provide any further insight or detail on that. So it did hit across a number of businesses and products, not specifically generated as a result of any one particular product.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just ask one follow-up. Under what scenarios would you begin to monetize and redeploy the $2.4 billion of the yen hedge gains? And as these settle, is there any reason they wouldn't be available capital capacity?","Robert Michael Falzon","No. So if you look at the $2.4 billion that we have in fair value as of year end, the ordinary core settlements on that are about 30% of it during the course of 2015. When we articulate our capital capacity, we do not include in that capacity that fair value amount. What we do include are the settlements as they occur and work their way in. So there is nothing -- absent further changes in the level of the FX rate, which would then affect that fair value amount, there's nothing that would impede the natural order of settlements in the way that I quantified them coming into our capital capacity during the course of 2015. And then, obviously, to the extent that we accelerated any of the settlements, that would provide additional capital capacity out of that $2.4 billion.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I apologize, maybe I'm sleep deprived, but I'm confused in terms of this whole capital capacity thing. Because I thought in Mark's prepared comments, he had said that the delta between what you told us in December and what you're telling us now was what I would characterize as a definitional item, which is you're kind of earmarking some money for debt repayment, which you hadn't done back then. But then in Rob's comments, it seems like there was actually an increase in capital requirements related -- that caused the change. So again, I apologize, but I just was wondering if you can just walk us through very simply, like you told us $3.5 billion in December, and now you're telling us $2 billion. Like, can you just walk us through how we got from one to the other?","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes. So let me sort of keep it very high level and try to walk you through that, Suneet. So if you take the range we gave you before, because remember we've migrated to a single definition, so we've provided a range of $3.5 billion. And then of that, $3 billion of readily deployable, that number, the 2 of those converged into what we've articulated as the $2 billion. So the delta between where we were and where we are today, as Mark described, is that we're taking some of our capacity in order to reduce the leverage. What happened during the course of the fourth quarter is that our capital leverage ratio went up by a greater amount than we would have otherwise anticipated, as a result primarily of the 2 things that I highlighted. So the interest rate underhedge and the AAT provision being greater than what we had originally expected when we set our guidance caused that -- the leverage ratio to elevate. And so if we were to reduce the leverage back down to 25%, and we think that's a prudent thing to do in light of recent levels of interest rates and the increased volatility that we have in interest rates, that requires taking that capital capacity that otherwise would've been $4 billion down to $2 billion. So there's a component of it that's a result of an elevated level of capital leverage caused primarily by those 2 events. And then, secondly, as you characterized it, a change in methodology to deduct from our capital capacity any leverage that we have in excess of that targeted 25%. Is that helpful?","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So when Mark -- yes, I think we're getting there, but -- so when Mark said $4 billion is sort of the pro forma number had you not changed the definition, does that reflect the underhedged and the AAT?","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes, so -- I'm sorry, Mark?","Mark B. Grier","Yes, think about the $4 billion as if we didn't change leverage.","Robert Michael Falzon","So the leverage at end of the year, absent any changes, would have been 29.6% or something in that order of magnitude that we'll wind up printing. And that would then reflect both the underhedge and AAT. And bringing that number down to 25% is what reduces us from having a notional capital capacity of $4 billion or a real capital capacity of $4 billion down to a notional amount net of the earmark for debt reduction of $2 billion.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I'll noodle that. My second question was just on these pension risk transfer deals that you've done. I know when you price these things, I'm assuming you're fully matched on the assets and the liabilities. And so the direction of interest rates post closing the deal really shouldn't change the economic terms of the deal. I just want to confirm that that's the case because, obviously, you've done a lot of these deals, and we've continued to see interest rates decline. So if I'm right, is it fair to assume that the decline in interest rates that we've seen is not going to impact the profitability of the business that you've written?","Stephen P. Pelletier","Suneet, this is Steve. You are absolutely correct. The pension risk transfer deals, remember that in these transactions we're dealing in all cases with retirees, people have already made their elections. So the cash flows are already firmly established. Therefore, at closing, we're able to match assets and liabilities in a very robust fashion. I'd go one step further, going back in the timeline a little bit to the way you asked your questions, and that is to emphasize that between pricing and signing and closing, we have contractual provisions that protect us from changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates between pricing and closing.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. But there's not even a dynamic of you have surplus backing this business and that surplus is presumably invested in something that's earning a yield. But there's not even a dynamic of spread compression on the surplus that's backing these transactions?","Stephen P. Pelletier","No, there really isn't. As I say, we're able to match assets and liabilities very robustly given the nature of the liability.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I had another follow-up on the capital. I guess, just -- I guess, maybe just to confirm. So is the way to think about it that you had 2 capital impacts from Variable Annuity relating to interest rates and cash flow testing and that you funded those amounts with additional capital debt? Is that the right way to think about it?","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes. But just to be clear, Ryan, the AAT amounts affect the entire enterprise. That's not specific to Annuities, by any means. So yes, you had from Annuities the interest rate underhedge, and then you had the enterprise-wide AAT testing, some component of which we'd obviously anticipated. It's just with the decline in the fourth quarter, it was greater than what we anticipated. Those -- the \"funding\" of those 2 came from operating debt that we had sitting on our balance sheet. We used the proceeds associated with that operating debt to fund that, and that we reclassified operating debt to capital debt. Important to note there, and I think Mark highlighted upfront, our total leverage has gone down. We've actually reduced the amount of debt that we have outstanding. This was an issue of how we label that debt.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. You already had the debt. You're now using it for a different purpose, and you reclassified it.","Robert Michael Falzon","Correct.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, second question. I know you guys don't tend to like to comment on your EPS guidance after you give it. But you haven't -- we haven't had a quarter in 2015 yet, and your earnings, I think, were generally lower than most of us expected. So I was just hoping if you could confirm that the $9.60 to $10.10 EPS guidance you gave in December is still a valid range.","Robert Michael Falzon","So Ryan, a confirmation would be an update. So I can't actually do that. But let me offer a couple of thoughts that perhaps can help. One, if you -- the nature of your question really is expressing concern about what's the impact of the -- of this capital capacity reduction that we've articulated in the fourth quarter, and then looking at the high level of expenses that we have in the fourth quarter. Those are the 2 things, I guess, if you're thinking about how they might impact our -- the guidance that we otherwise gave and with respect to both those, what I would note is on the capital side, our guidance reflected a range of deployment including leverage reduction. So the fact that we're using a portion of our capital to reduce debt is not something that would be any different than we would've factored into a range when we put that together. With regard to expenses, recall the fourth quarter has seasonality both in -- actually both in revenues and expenses. It's international, but it's across the entire enterprise in part due to compensation and benefit true-ups in the fourth quarter. So while I'm not updating guidance, I would say there was nothing structural that changed versus our expectations for the fourth quarter.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Can you just give us some quantification of the type of seasonality you saw in the fourth quarter to what -- relative to what you'd expect in other quarters?","Robert Michael Falzon","No. I'm actually -- I'm not prepared to give you that off the top of my head, Ryan. I'd have to give that thought. I think if you looked back at our fourth quarter over the last several years, you would see a pronounced seasonality there on an enterprise basis more accentuated in our international business, obviously.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Ryan, this is Charlie. Let me just sort of give you a quick overview of the sort of expenses in the fourth quarter. Because the fourth quarter does tend to have higher expenses, as Rob said, in our International businesses, and that's a trend we've seen over the years. So I think what we would say is for total expenses, there's sort of 27%, 28% of the -- of annual expenses occur in the fourth quarter, and we see this both in Life Planner and the Gibraltar businesses for really 3 factors. First, fourth quarter always includes some nonlinear expenses. And we had some of those, as we did last year and probably always will in the fourth quarter, and those related, as Rob said, to pension-related costs and whatnot. We then have some external factors that have been there such as consumption tax and other things, and that's sort of a constant. And then there are also some internal factors. And those internal factors can be as mundane as administrative costs such as annual mailings to customers. And those occur in the fourth quarter in Japan. And so you're going to get some seasonality. There are some systems initiatives, and the costs are incurred later in the year, that usually is the case, and some end-of-life systems. So these sorts of costs will be with us going forward and have been anticipated. So in sum, on the international side, expenses were structurally not different than we would've otherwise expected for the fourth quarter, but are seasonally a bit higher.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Wanted to come back to the capital situation as well. Mark, I just wanted to be clear on what you said about the yen hedge. Did you say that was $2.4 billion?","Mark B. Grier","Yes, $2.4 billion pretax.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And is that -- how is that factored into your overall view of capital adequacy? Is that included somehow in the $2 billion figure?","Mark B. Grier","It's not reflected in the capital ratios or dollar numbers that we've discussed. And as Rob said in answer to an earlier question, this will flow into available capital as the cash is realized. And about 30% of it comes in this year. And we would have options to accelerate if we chose to. So this is, I guess, sort of shadow strength that's not reflected in the headline numbers, but represents, as I said, a substantial offset to other market-related sensitivities.","Robert Michael Falzon","And maybe to follow up on that, Tom, and following up on a question that was asked earlier, when we think about post year end, things that have happened, the -- and the commitments that we have -- capital commitments we have for the upcoming year both in the form of the expected closing of the Chilean AFORE [ph] business in the middle of the year as well as the further decline in interest rates post year end, we have confidence around the capital capacity that we stated as of year end because we look at those outflows of capital, but we're also looking at the inflows we have of capital during the course of 2015. They come from our free cash flow, but they also come from this monetization of the equity -- the yen equity hedge.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, Tom, we've each expressed confidence in our financial strength and our capital position and our ability to implement our capital plans. And the value of that yen hedge is a source of comfort in that context.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And then -- and just a related question, I guess. The -- if we -- I just want to really get my arms around how to think about the below-the-line VA losses we've seen. And I get the AAT year-end true-ups. But more importantly, thinking about your 2Q review, and now you're changing the actuarial review from 3Q to 2Q, if we remain in a sustained low rate environment, is it fair to say that there's risk to that $2 billion as we think about rates where they are today, if there is another sizable VA below-the-line charge? Wouldn't it consume more of that $2 billion figure today?","Robert Michael Falzon","Okay, so let me sort of take that in pieces. First, with respect to sustained low interest rates, the impact in capital comes primarily as a result of a decline in interest rates. And so the position that we're articulating as to where we are today reflects the level that we're at today. Should rates prevail at this level, that does not give rise to a further need to absorb the capital capacity we have in the way that we described it occurring in the fourth quarter. Should rates decline further, then we would have some of those consequences. With respect to the VA business and the actuarial assumption updates, I guess what I would describe on that, Tom, is that we have updates to our assumptions, particularly with respect to the Annuities business. We believe we've taken appropriate steps relevant to the experience that we've reserved in Annuities and across our other businesses. And so based on what we know today, we feel comfortable with the reserves that we've put up.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, sorry, if I could squeeze one last one in, does it -- the way I'm thinking about this whole thing, and correct me if I'm wrong, has to do -- because prior to now, I think most of the charges that have been recognized in VA have been funded by -- you had enough resources in PRU global funding within that enterprise or within that entity. And is it -- have we gotten to the point now where you now need to fund all potential VA charges going forward, given what's gone on within that entity? Or if you can help me better understand that.","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes, Tom. So we've always articulated how much needed to be topped up in the VA entity. And just to be clear, that's not PRU global funding. That's a separate entity through which we do -- we enter into our swaps and derivative transactions to the benefit of the entire enterprise. It would be PrucoRe, which is our captive. And then within that entity, yes, we had surplus capacity that in prior quarters absorbed some of the top-up that we need to undertake as a result of some of the below-the-line charges that you've described. In this quarter, we had to take proceeds from operating debt and then advance it to PrucoRe in order to fund the incremental losses. And that would be the case on a go-forward basis. Oh, yes, and actually just -- let me add another point on that, Tom, which I think is -- helps put some of this in perspective because I think it's important for people to understand. Our total reserves now, the hedge target at PrucoRe is approximately $8 billion today. That is the equivalent of the statutory reserves that we hold for that entity. The -- if we were to do this, the calculation of statutory reserves for the living benefit rider at the ceding companies, that number would be less than half the $8 billion. So we have a very conservative level of reserves established for our living benefit rider that results from the way in which we account and hedge for that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Colin Devine with Jefferies.","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right. Let's -- if we can come back to this capital issue one more time. First, well, I'm trying to reconcile the debt as it's spread out -- split out on Page 10 with what's shown on the balance sheet, specifically the short-term debt figure that's given of what, $3.8 billion. And yet on the balance sheet, it's $1.746 billion. It's always reconciled before. So maybe just to understand what's gone on here. And then as you're doing that, I'm also trying to reconcile how on December 11, when you put out the capital numbers, I get -- how that -- are the numbers you're giving us today for excess capital cushion based on where rates are today? Or are they based on where they were at year end? Because that's, I think, what some of us are having trouble understanding what you guys are saying, because some of your comments have been if rates just stay where they are, then it's $2 billion. Or was it $2 billion based on where rates were at the end of last year? And if it was that, then how is this cushion not sort of gone right now?","Robert Michael Falzon","Sure. So Colin, let me answer the second part first, then I'll come back to the borrowing numbers and hopefully reconcile them for you. So if you -- the statement we made is at -- rates as of year end gave rise to the earmarking of $2 billion of our capital capacity to bring that from the $4 billion to the $2 billion. The comment that we made with respect to what's happened since year end was that we do have -- we've -- as of today, we have identified additional capital commitments in the form of what we would have to do to mark the additional hit associated primarily with the underhedge through this -- as a result of where rates are further declined this year as well as the commitment we have should we be successful at closing on our Chilean acquisition. So when we think about those commitments that we have during the course of 2015, and there are others obviously, we line that up against the capacity we have to meet those commitments in 2015 as well, and we're comfortable that the combination of our free cash flow and other sources of capital, including, as we've mentioned, the $2.4 billion of yen equity hedge gains or fair value that will be monetized, portions of which will be monetized during the course of 2015, that those sources of capital can meet what might additionally be required as a result of the subsequent decline in interest rates and the other capital commitments that we have. Is that helpful?","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It is, and it's not. So let's say you just decided after this call and looking at where the stock's going today, let's monetize all the yen hedges, okay? That's fine, but then we should all be -- is it fair to say we should all be taking our estimates down because those Japanese earnings are going to come across then at current exchange rates, not the 91? Is that fair?","Robert Michael Falzon","No, it's not. So when we look -- when we're describing the equity hedge, that is separate and distinct from the income hedge, Colin. So the income hedges remain in place. This is in addition to those income hedges. Income hedges are in place, as we've described before, in a rolling 3-year basis.","Mark B. Grier","Yes, Colin, the translation hedge that's applied as we earn yen and then report in dollars in AOI is a different hedge. And as Rob said, that stays in place. The yen capital hedge that we're referring to is a structural short yen position on the balance sheet that includes a monetization mechanism that lets us realize cash at the holding company. So they're actually 2 discrete things, and there would not be a translation hedge impact related to things that we do and as the capital hedge matures, for example.","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe to cut to the chase which is, I think, on a lot of people's minds. Given where rates sit today, right here, right now, is it still your expectation that PRU will do $1 billion in buybacks this year?","Robert Michael Falzon","So, Colin, I think as you well know, I can't answer the question with respect to what we would do on a prospective basis with regard to stock buybacks. If that's a question about our capacity and our ability to do that, I think we've addressed that capacity issue, and what we said is that we feel very comfortable with the quantification of our notional capital capacity being that $2 billion again net of what we would need to reduce our leverage ratio down to 25%. That capital capacity is available in the way that we've always articulated it. Our current authorization for buybacks runs through June. We've got about $0.5 billion left on that authorization through that period of time. And as I said, our philosophy really hasn't changed. We're managing to our leverage -- our targeted leverage ratios. We've articulated that. We've shown you a number for capital capacity that is net of that amount. We financed the growth including the extra organic growth particularly associated with PRT. We have some acquisition funding, and that's the Chilean business, and we've described that and our comfort with our ability to finance that. And importantly, we have shareholder distributions in the form of both dividends and stock buybacks. And our philosophy with regard to any and all of that has not changed.","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Now if we can go back to what happened in the stats up with the debt, and just put that to bed.","Robert Michael Falzon","Sure. So the -- I'm not sure I understand what your question is. I'm looking at the -- I presume you're talking about...","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm looking at Page 10. I'm looking at Page 10 QFS under short-term debt, and that does not reconcile to your balance sheet on Page 6, and it always has in the past. So -- and it does at the end of year end '13. So is there a typo there? Or...","Robert Michael Falzon","Well, I can't speak to whether there's a typo or not because I don't have the 10-K sitting in front of me. What I will tell you is...","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It's not the 10-K, Rob. It's in your stats out. And there's -- it's a question of there's, I don't know, $2 billion of debt which seems to have moved somewhere.","Robert Michael Falzon","The total debt at -- described as of December 31, 2014, is $23.7 billion.","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Where do I find that on Page 6, just to make it easy? Because I don't get that what's on Page 6.","Robert Michael Falzon","Well, Colin, maybe what I would suggest is if you have specific questions with respect to the QFS and you want to tick and tie this, that's probably a good use of time after the call as opposed to before the call.","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. The balance sheet shows 21. That's the question, Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon","I'm sorry.","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, I'll let you guys come back. But the balance sheet shows 21. That's the issue, and that became the question, is this $2 billion worth of capital that went from December 11 to now, has that just been reclassified somewhere? That's what I was getting at because the balance sheet does not show the $23 billion.","Robert Michael Falzon","Yes, if you take the totals of our long-term debt and our short-term debt, that should aggregate to the total of the $23 billion, if you include -- if you exclude from that the commercial paper, which is outside of that number.","Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'll let you go look at the balance sheet because that's not what it totals to.","Operator","And that will be from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, if I could just put the final nail in this capital coffin, if you will. The question I have is when you articulated the $3.5 billion, which, I guess, would have assumed a 25% debt to cap, and maybe it didn't, but this incremental requirement for lower rates by year end, at least as of the date of your outlook call through year end, rates really barely moved. I'm assuming you did that math some time before your outlook was provided. I'm just trying to get a gauge as to how much rates actually did move to eat -- to take the $3.5 billion, which, I guess, would've risen actually and been $4 billion down to $2 billion?","Robert Michael Falzon","Sure, John. So -- excuse me, Nigel.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, it is John.","Robert Michael Falzon","Oh, it's John, I'm sorry. Got mixed up on my ordering. So John, the guidance was established on the basis of our forecast. Our forecast looks at an average of forward yield curves at the point at which we put it together. That forecast implied a year-end rate of around 2.6%, and that then drove the view of what capital may or may not be available as of -- or be required as of year end. At the point at which we did our earnings call, obviously, rates were around 2, 2-ish or somewhere in that order of magnitude. The volatility in interest rates is extreme, I think, as you well know. We have seen virtually every week movements in interest rates that have been up to 20 and 30 basis points. And so the delta between where we were forecasting to go year end and where we were as of the day we provided guidance was well within a range of kind of typical standard deviations over that period of time. And frankly, when we look at setting together our forecast, we don't alter it to reflect changes in the day-to-day movements of rates or equities. When we gave guidance, equities were above the number that we had anticipated coming into year end, and interest rates were below. We didn't adjust for either with the knowledge that neither of those numbers would be where they were on the day that we provided guidance, just as they were not on the day where we put together the forecast.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Understood. So -- but, I mean, at the end of the day here and I recognize, I fully recognize the commentary you made earlier about capital action -- I mean, sorry, management actions and other things that are at play here. It's not just a rate discussion. But essentially what you're saying is a roughly 40-basis-point drop in rates cost you $2 billion.","Robert Michael Falzon","Again, I wouldn't extrapolate that. There are a number of moving parts to that. Not to mention that when we gave guidance, we did anticipate that a certain amount of our capital would be used, as you said, to get our leverage down to 25% when we gave that guidance. And so the delta between the guidance and our number is the $3 billion to $3.5 billion down to $2 billion, not the $4 billion down to $2 billion.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful, too. And then just -- I mean, just a quick housekeeping item. Tax rate, just since I've got you guys, tax rate was, I guess, a little bit under 26% for the full year. I think your guide has been around 27%, give or take. Is there anything sort of that we should be just structurally looking at that tax rate being somewhat lower on an ongoing basis than the 27%?","Robert Michael Falzon","So the -- yes, the provision for taxes and guidance was actually a bit under 27%. I know we rounded it to 27% when we gave the guidance. And when you look at the impact to the tax rate this year, one of the large drivers to that was a reduction in our foreign taxes, largely driven by the fact that Japan lowered its tax rate down to 32%. So we will get some ongoing benefit from that going forward as well.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. today until midnight, February 12.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide some high-level observations on the quarter and the fundamental trends in our businesses. I will then briefly discuss actions we've taken to improve our capital flexibility and reduce volatility, which directly led to last evenings announcement of a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for 2016.","In closing, I will comment on the regulatory environment and then hand it over to Mark and Rob.","We continue to successfully navigate a challenging environment. We benefit from a collection of businesses that fit well together and provide diverse sources of earnings and cash flows. We are therefore able to generate solid results despite market volatility and broader macro uncertainties.","At the same time, we're also generating considerable excess capital. We are reinvesting in our operations to capitalize on longer-term growth opportunities as well as returning substantial amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 alone.","Now, specific to the quarter, reported earnings were impacted by several significant items. This includes the outcome of our annual review of actuarial assumptions and other reserve refinements. Although this annual review had a positive impact on our overall results, it had an adverse effect on adjusted operating income.","This is largely due to a change we took in our Individual Life business related to a recent interpretation of accounting guidance. Mark will discuss this and other factors influencing reported earnings in more detail.","If you exclude the impact of our annual review and other market-driven and discrete items, adjusted operating earnings per share would have been $2.46, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Annualized return on equity, on the same basis for the quarter, at just over 13%, was also consistent with our longer-term target.","In terms of growth drivers, we produced good sales and flows across our domestic and international businesses in the quarter. This is while continuing to take actions to adjust our product offering and pricing to reflect a lower and in some cases negative interest rate environment.","Turning to the fundamentals in our businesses, our international operations produced solid results. We reported solid core growth and underwriting margins in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses.","While the level of interest rates in Japan is a real challenge, and has necessitated aggressive product and pricing actions, including the suspending the sales of certain yen-based products, we still produced 7% constant currency sales growth in our overall international operations in the quarter.","This was led by our U.S. dollar product sales in Japan, which increased 53% over the prior year. And for the first time in our history, our Japanese operations sold more U.S. dollar products than yen-based products. This shows the benefit of our broad suite of protection-based products and their distribution strength.","Our domestic businesses also produced solid results and generally good sales and net flow trends. PGIM, our Asset Management business, had strong results reporting very good earnings and robust net inflows of $3.6 billion. PGIM, again, exceeded $1 trillion in total AUM. And we're particularly pleased that third-party unaffiliated institutional and retail assets under management crossed the $500 billion threshold for the first time. We continue to be optimistic about PGIM's prospects and are investing in expanding capabilities and distribution.","Our Retirement and Individual Annuity businesses performed largely in line with our expectations. Retirement closed on two significant UK longevity pension risk transfer cases in the quarter and produced overall positive net flows. As we've mentioned in the past, the timing of PRT transactions can be lumpy but we continue to believe this is a good long-term growth business and expect to benefit from our best-in-class platform.","I would also highlight that Retirement earnings again reflected pension risk transfer case experience more favorable than our average expectations. While we may have quarters in the future in which this isn't the case, the underwriting experience of the PRT block has well exceeded our expectations.","Our U.S. protection trends are mixed. Group Insurance produced very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter modestly more favorable than our target range. Group Insurance is also showing improved top line growth, following a multiyear effort focused on improving underlying results. Conversely, while Individual Life Insurance produced good sales growth, we did experience adverse mortality that dampened earnings. Mortality results have clearly disappointed in the first half of 2016, though this will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. And the longer-term mortality trend has been very good.","Now I'll briefly cover the structural changes we made in managing the risks of our variable annuity business. But before doing so, I want to provide some perspective on how this project fits into our broader strategic focus as a company. Over the last couple of years, we have focused intently and intensely on simplifying our business, improving our transparency and reducing volatility. We believe that over time a clear line of sight to our business fundamentals should contribute to a more valuable franchise. In this regard, you've seen us take a number of actions.","As a result of the substantial completion of our variable annuity restructuring, we expect a meaningful reduction in our capital volatility in our Individual Annuities business and increased stability and certainty of cash flows generated from the business. We believe that Individual Annuities should become a significant source of free cash flow in the future.","And at the same time, we continue to manage the business to robust standards focused on the economics of the risk. And we're particularly pleased that the economic synergies achieved from this action has led to a release of capital and facilitated last evening's announced increase in our share repurchase authorization by the board. Rob Falzon will have more to say on this topic.","Finally, on the regulatory front, we are preparing a response to the Federal Reserve on the recently issued advance notice of proposed rulemaking or ANPR that addresses capital requirements for supervised insurance entities. And the NPR focused on corporate governance, risk management and liquidity standards. While these proposals still have a ways to go until they reach the finish line, we are encouraged by the dialogue and the focus by the Fed on seeking to appropriately reflect the unique characteristics of insurance companies into a properly designed set of standards.","With that, I'll hand it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you all for joining the call today. I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights.","Starting on slide 2, after-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.84 per share for the quarter compared to $2.91 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS of $2.46 was down $0.16 from year ago. Underlying business performance remained solid through the challenging macro environment.","The decrease reflected a number of moving parts, but I would highlight a greater loss from corporate and other operations driven by negative fluctuations in expenses and investment income and less favorable claims experience in comparison to the outperformance we called out in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that these two items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.25 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago.","Current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations for mortality in Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience and returns on non-coupon investments were largely offsetting. Favorable revenue seasonality in International Insurance contributed about $0.04 per share to earnings.","After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $4.72 for the first half of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. This includes a modest net negative impact from variances compared to average expectations for the items I mentioned, together with favorable International Insurance revenue seasonality.","On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses, and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $921 million for the current quarter, about $90 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. GAAP net income included a net favorable impact from our annual actuarial review for items we account for outside of AOI, which I will discuss further.","Turning to slide 3, this year's annual actuarial review including reserve updates and refinements for our ongoing businesses, resulted in a net favorable pre-tax impact of $590 million, including a benefit of about $1 billion outside of AOI, partly offset by net charges in AOI totaling $444 million. The non-AOI benefit to earnings was mainly driven by an update of our utilization assumptions related to the amount of income payouts taken under our annuities living benefit guarantees based on emerging experience.","While we reduced our long-term interest rate assumptions as part of the annual review, this did not have a meaningful impact on the outcome. The charge that was included in AOI came mainly from Individual Life, driven by a recent interpretation of accounting guidance relating to the expected pattern of earnings on the Universal Life block of business that we acquired from Hartford. Under this guidance, we are recording a reserve now to reflect the period of losses that we expect to emerge about 15 years in the future after our expected returns have been largely realized. It's worth noting that the majority of these losses were assumed in our original forecast at the time of the Hartford acquisition.","Turning to slide 4. The remainder of market-driven and discrete items for the quarter consists of a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the annuities business driven mainly by performance of equities in our customer accounts and a charge in Corporate and Other for cost of our $500 million debt tender offer in June.","Moving on to slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $921 million for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $360 million. And divested business results and other items outside of AOI amounting to net pre-tax losses of $68 million. Of note, product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $574 million. This includes the favorable impact of the annual actuarial review on annuities living benefits that I mentioned, partly offset by an increase in the gross GAAP liability balance for these living benefits which was driven by the decline in interest rates in the quarter.","The loss from other risk management activities was mainly driven by true-ups reflecting our annual review. Impairments and credit losses of $51 million were the lowest of the past four quarters and about half the level of the first quarter.","Moving to our business results and starting on slide 6, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Annuities earnings were $375 million for the quarter, down $48 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees reflecting a roughly similar decline in average account values. Higher expenses also contributed to the earnings decline and the decrease in return on assets or ROA. ROA was modestly below 100 basis point range of the past few quarters.","Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total sales are largely unchanged from a year ago. However, our mix of sales has changed dramatically over the past year reflecting our diversification strategy. Sales of our fixed income based PDI product reached a record high of over $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting market demand and the success of our product diversification efforts. In addition, we're externally re-ensuring about half of the living benefit guaranty on new business related to the Highest Daily or HD product under an agreement which extends through this year. As a result, less than one third of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees.","Turning to slide 8, Retirement earnings were $230 million for the quarter, down $7 million from a year ago. The decrease reflects the lower contribution from case experience which was about $20 million more favorable than our average quarterly expectations, but below the level of the year-ago quarter. In addition, lower fees in our Full Service business were largely offset by a modestly greater contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $30 million below our average expectations in the quarter.","Turning to slide 9, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago which included three significant pension risk transfer transactions totaling about $7 billion. Standalone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter including about $2 billion from two new longevity reinsurance cases. Net flows for the quarter were positive both in Full Service and Institutional Investment Products totaling about $500 million.","Turning to slide 10, Asset Management earnings were $207 million for the quarter compared to $196 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was mainly driven by a $9 million greater contribution from other related revenues, reflecting more favorable strategic investment results and higher real estate transaction fees. Earnings driven by Asset Management fees were essentially unchanged from a year ago. Higher fees for management of fixed income assets were largely offset by lower fees tied to equities. The Asset Management business reported $3.6 billion of net positive, third-party flows in the quarter with contributions from institutional and retail businesses each driven by fixed income flows.","Turning to slide 11, Individual Life earnings were $130 million for the quarter, compared to $177 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience with the current quarter contribution to earnings about $20 million below our average expectations compared to a strong year ago quarter. While mortality experience can vary from one quarter to another, it has been more favorable than our average expectations for each of the full years 2013, 2014 and 2015. In addition, in Individual Insurance, expenses were slightly higher in the current quarter than a year ago.","Turning to slide 12, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $29 million or 22% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales contributed just under half of the increase reflecting current-quarter sales resulting from an accelerated flow of policy applications in advance of recently implemented price increases. The remainder of the increase came mainly from variable life where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy.","Turning to slide 13, Group Insurance earnings were $48 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. The current quarter total benefits ratio was consistent with the year-ago quarter and modestly more favorable than our targeted range of 87% to 91% with current-quarter disability underwriting results at the strongest level of the past four quarters.","Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 14, earnings for our Life Planner business were $381 million for the quarter compared to $392 million a year ago. Excluding a $22 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $11 million from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses including costs supporting business growth and a lower contribution from investment results driven by declining fixed income returns.","Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially unchanged from a year ago and about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. The concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business that results in an earnings pattern favoring the first quarter drove the sequential quarter earnings decline.","Turning to slide 15, Gibraltar Life earnings were $494 million for the quarter compared to $471 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $36 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $59 million from a year ago. Current quarter results include a benefit of about $40 million from the sale of a home office property that came to us with the acquisition of Star and Edison. This sale substantially completes the realization of synergies from integration of the business infrastructure.","The remainder of the earnings increase was driven by business growth, largely reflecting the first full quarter contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile which was essentially in line with our expectations and also reflecting a greater contribution from net investment results. Net investment results for the quarter included returns on non-coupon investments, about $35 million more favorable than our average expectations driven by real estate sale within an investment fund. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues favors second-quarter results for Gibraltar Life. We would estimate that the benefit to current-quarter earnings in relation to a quarterly average was about $30 million.","Turning to slide 16, International Insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $747 million for the current quarter, up by $50 million or 7% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by a 53% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan which more than offset lower Yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprised more than half of our current-quarter sales in Japan compared to roughly one third of sales a year ago. Our exposure to declining interest rates in Japan is mitigated by our emphasis on protection products with the returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins and by strong asset liability management for our in-force business.","We've taken significant actions to maintain appropriate expected returns for new business in the current environment in Japan, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases sales suspensions for yen products that are most affected by interest rates. These are generally those with the greatest cash value accumulation features including certain single premium products.","Our success in continuing to grow sales in Japan while adapting the product portfolio reflects the skills of our life planners and life consultants and matching our products with client needs and the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 19% from a year ago reflecting an 8% increase in agent count together with higher productivity and higher average premium size.","Gibraltar sales were up by 6% from a year ago including a 15% increase from our life consultants. Bank channel sales were consistent with a year ago, reflecting a $27 million increase in U.S. dollar sales, essentially offsetting a decrease in yen-based sales.","Turning to slide 17, the Corporate and Other loss was $376 million for the current quarter compared to a $305 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are; lower investment income reflecting a charge of about $40 million from the declining value of a tax-advantaged investment that we account for under the equity method. Higher expenses including items such as fixed asset disposals, legal costs and employee benefit costs all of which can fluctuate. And lower income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year-end.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to cover an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest starting on slide 18. You'll notice a change in how we present the comparison of RBC to our target. As of April 1, we recaptured the living benefit risk from our reinsurance captive. Most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts now reside in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of a substantial portion of our in-force annuity business.","As a result, a meaningful portion of our statutory capital has migrated to PALAC and is no longer rolling up to the RBC of Prudential Insurance under statutory accounting. We now view composite RBC, which includes our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis, as a more meaningful measure of our statutory financial strength in relation to our benchmark. On this basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the second quarter.","In Japan, Prudential Japan and Gibraltar reported strong solvency margins of 801% and 928%, respectively, as of March 31 their fiscal year-end. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets.","Let me provide a few additional points on the variable annuity recapture. As of August 1, all of the risks of our annuities contracts are managed within the annuities business. As a result, the historic management of a portion of the interest rate risk of our annuities guarantees at the holding company has been closed out. We are now managing all of the product risks by holding derivatives and other financial assets in our statutory entities. In addition, we will continue to manage the product risks of our annuities businesses as we have done historically on an economic basis. This includes the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold in moderate stress scenarios, consistent with how we manage risks across our businesses, standards that we believe are consistent with AA financial strength.","Further, due to synergies that occur when all the product risks are managed together, we're able to release about $1 billion of capital from our annuities business. The outcome of this restructuring substantially simplifies our annuities operation, reduces our capital volatility and increases the certainty around cash flows from the annuities business.","Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on slide 19, our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4 billion at the end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from March 31. This reflects the impact of cash inflows including the $1 billion related to the annuities restructuring that I mentioned, in addition to a dividend from PICA. It is net of the return of about $700 million to shareholders including $370 million of share repurchases and the repayment of about $1 billion of debt including $500 million under our tender offer in June.","Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of June 30 remained within our targets. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital management and deployment, the capital released as a result of our annuities actions supported a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for the second half of this year, bringing the authorization for 2016 to $2 billion, of which $750 million has been executed through June 30. Those of you who have followed our historical dividend pattern are accustomed to seeing a review of our dividend level in the fourth quarter. While we evaluate shareholder distributions with the board in every quarter, we expect to move the routine dividend evaluation process to the first quarter in order to better align with our capital planning cycle.","Now I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And let's open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And first we're going to the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about the annuity ROA; it dipped down a bit to 98 bps in the quarter from kind of 105 basis point range it's been running at. Can you give an update on how we should think about that going forward?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Ryan, this is Steve. We've long encouraged people to think in terms of 100 basis points as being the longer-term run rate of ROA for the annuities business. The recent change in this quarter reflected a couple of things. First of all, it reflected some one-time expenses, and it also reflected something of a shift in our product mix gradually over time towards the PDI product, which is lower risk but also on a marginal basis lower fees as well. So given all of that, we'd still encourage people to think very much in terms of 100 bps as the ROA for the annuities business.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great, thanks. And then do you just have an update on the fair value of the yen capital hedge?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ryan, it's Rob. Yeah, so we've \u2013 the hedge at the end of the first quarter was a negative $520 million.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then does that \u2013 would you expect that to have an impact on \u2013 I guess if things stay unchanged, should we think of that as having any impact on free cash flow generation over time as it gets realized?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, let me sort of step back. First, if you sort of bring it up a level, Ryan, the hedge was actually doing exactly what it was designed to do. It's protecting our ROE regardless of the direction of the yen. Our (30:34) settlements in the program have actually been sufficient to complete the offset any depreciation that's occurred in the yen to its current level. And recall that we actually started this program back when the yen was at 77.","Specifically, to your question, we have had periods in the past where the hedges worked in the other direction and cash would be flowing back to the international businesses as those settled. They are staged over time, and so they settle over periods of time. They've been orchestrated in a way such that the improved earnings on a yen basis \u2013 or the yen earnings that we have in Japan on a dollar basis are going up as a result of that appreciation in the yen, and therefore, the dividends that we're getting out of that business will offset over time the cash that goes on the settlement of the hedges.","So we sort of think of it as, there could be on a year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter basis a little bit of cash mismatch, but overall, these things will settle out.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Nigel Dally. Please go ahead. Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Good morning. So, Mark, you mentioned that you've reduced the interest rate assumptions as part of the actuarial review. Could you elaborate on that? How much was it changed and what was it changed to? And also, did you recalibrate the separate account return assumptions?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Nigel, it's Rob. Actually, I'll jump in on this. The \u2013 we took the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year down from 4.25% to 4%. In Japan, we took the similar 10-year benchmark down from 2% down to 1.9%. The impact of that, if you think about the returns expected from the variable annuity accounts, which I think is what you're asking, is that the return over the what we call the near- to intermediate term, so call it the next 0 to 10 years, averages about 4.8%. And then after 10 years, as a result of migrating up to those reversion rates that I mentioned, it's about 6.5%","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Then just on the buybacks, are the higher plans purely a reflection of the capital release from this VA restructuring that you completed, or does the restructure also improve the free cash flow which could possibly impact the pace of future buybacks?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the immediate increase in the buyback is tied to the $1 billion that came up as a result of the recapture initiative that we have underway in our variable annuities business. But to the point that you've made, I would emphasize that while we'll continue to evaluate our buybacks and are not forecasting anything in the way of an increase at this point. We are encouraged by the increased cash flow profile that comes out of our annuities business.","It's really driven by two things, Nigel. First is the fact that as this block matures, the sales relative to the existing block lead it to throw off more cash. The second is this construct that we've put in place. It is a more stable long-term contract, subject to less volatility, and therefore gives us more degrees of freedom in terms of how we think about taking the cash out of the annuities business as earnings are generated annually.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Jimmy Bhullar. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. The first question is just on your \u2013 just following-up on the rate assumption. I just wanted to make sure I got the numbers right. So you took the rate assumption down to 4%, or was it down to 2% from 4%?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the U.S. rate 10-year benchmark, Jimmy, was brought from 4.25% down to 4%. The JGB 10-year benchmark was brought from 2% down to 1.9%.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But considering current rates, those still seem relatively high level, so just wondering what the justification was for not reducing them further? And maybe if you could give us any sort of sensitivity to what the impact would have been to your results had you brought it down by another 50 basis points or 100 basis points in each market? Or is it 50 basis points in Japan, 100 basis points in the U.S.?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So a couple of thoughts. First, Jimmy, with respect to the process that we go through, understand it is a well-established and well-controlled actuarial review process that we undertake and come up with these rates. We look at historical rates, we look at forward rates, we survey both internal and external experts to get their views of rates on a go-forward basis. And we use a central estimate that's derived from looking at all of those data points. So that's consistent with what we've done in the past, and we continue to apply on a go-forward basis.","With respect to the interest rate sensitivity, if you look at our assumption updates, what I would tell you is that they were not materially affected by the decline in that long-term reversion rate. We had some interest rate impact; not particularly material. Most of it was driven by the current level of interest rates as opposed to a change in that long-term assumption.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Yeah, that's important. Remember that we grade up to the long-term assumption but current rates are in the books.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And it takes about a 10-year period of time for that grade up, so we start at current levels and then follow the forward curve for a couple of years and then do a linear grade up to that long-term reversion rate by year 10.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Yeah, so today's very low rates are in our balance sheet.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Basically, you're following the forward curve for maybe the next year, two years but then you're assuming a relatively steep increase to get to that 4%, right?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You can do the math; it's a linear extrapolation from third year on to year 10.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And secondly just in Japan, what's your view of the bank channel in Japan? It's about I think close to 20% of your sales. Several companies have been pulling back from the channel, especially with the further drop in rates? So maybe if you could talk about your long-term view of that channel and profitability of the business that you're selling through the channel?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Sure. Let me take a little bit of a step back and talk about our position with regard to the bank channel. So we believe that we have a differentiated strategy within the bank channel. When we first acquired Star\/Edison there were about 100 bank partners in total. And consistent with what we've done both in both independent agency and the LC channels, we reduced the number of relationships focusing on the quality of products, the service and the fit with the bank partners that we've chose to do business with. So we reduced that to about 60 bank partners that currently offer our products and we sell through about 80% of those bank partners in any given quarter.","But there are three points of differentiation that really affect our profitability in the bank channel. The first is that we provide exceptional service to our banking partners. We have about 240 secondees. Those are life planners that we've seconded to the banks and they provide exceptional service to the bank clients. So we don't have to be the lowest price. We compete on service; we don't compete via spreadsheets.","The second is that we focus on death protection. The majority of our sales include mortality and expense margins, obviously. And the other point here is that we have a very high proportion of recurring premium in current products as opposed to just savings products.","So over 80% of our sales in banks are recurring premiums and that's something we've been working really hard on and have changed the banks mentality, at least our partners' mentality, toward the kind of products that are sold.","And the third is that the relatively little single premium fixed annuity products that we do sell through the channel are re-priced twice a month for new business and they all have market value adjustment or MVA features. And now we really sell only U.S. dollar products, because we've been making that shift that John and Mark talked about.","So we feel very good about the differentiated strategy we employ, the mix of products we sell and the resultant profitability of the business.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Mike Kovac, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. We've seen a couple of other life companies in the U.S. provide some increased disclosure on a lower for longer scenario in terms of the impact on both the life and annuity blocks. I'm wondering if you can give us an update in terms of how you see it impacting the balance sheet if we were in say, 1% for a prolonged of time?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Mike, it's Rob. Let me try to take a crack at that. First, it's important to point out that we've had a significant reduction in our interest rate sensitivity, post the completion of the VA captive initiative. You've seen that in both the first quarter and the second quarter, driven by the fact that, as I indicated earlier, we've migrated over to a more stable statutory framework and it reflects the long-term nature of the risks.","Importantly we eliminated the internal corporate hedge, under hedge, excuse me, as I indicated in my opening comments. And we're managing all of the VA risks within those same legal entities.","I'd also note that we manage our balance sheet so that we can maintain our AA targets through cyclical stress scenarios. So that includes 100 basis point further decline in interest rates from where we are today. So from a balance sheet standpoint, we would not expect to have any degradation in our credit quality as a result of a sustained low rate of a significant quantum from where we are today.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So do you have a sense or can you provide us a sense of \u2013 I know this was part of an answer to an earlier question \u2013 in terms of taking the long-term interest rate assumption down by 25 basis points. I believe you mentioned it wasn't that material. But can you give us a sense of the scale of what that sort of immaterial means?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, in terms of the first 25 down, it was not material so I don't have the numbers to put around it because it wasn't something that rises to a level where we thought it was important to provide a disclosure.","With regard to an additional 25 basis points, we have not done the calculation in terms of what the \u2013 if you run that through all the assumption updates with another 25 basis points down, I'd go back to the comment that I made about a capital position which is that we've run stress scenarios significantly more severe than that and are comfortable that we're holding capital on a basis that would allow us to continue to maintain our AA rating and write business.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe one for John here on regulation. Appreciate the comments and the statement that the rules still have a ways to go until they get to the finish line. Any sort of early thoughts in terms of strategy, either an impact on the overall bond portfolio shifts now to Closed Block will be managed given the commentary we saw come out from that side earlier in the year?","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","No. This is Mark. That's very much still work in process and we're not ready to talk about or take any actions in anticipation of what comes out. I think the main message around the work on capital standards is that all of the signals are clearly consistent with the right approach to insurance.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Seth Weiss, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just a question on the VA recapture. Last quarter I think you mentioned that there were still some steps around ALM that needed to be completed throughout the remainder of the year. Is what you announced today basically finish those steps and put to bed any other remaining actions on the VA recapture?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it's Rob, Seth. As of August 1, the recapture initiative was substantially completed. There is obviously fine tuning of both accounting and ALM as we proceed forward in order to optimize the structure that we have in place. But yes, we are completed as of August 1.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. And all around it seems like the recapture was a homerun; it reduces the volatility and increased the capacity by about $1 billion. I think if we go back to the fourth quarter last year, you commented that you were really able to make this change because of the updated regulatory environment allowing this discussion with the regulator. Was that the only thing that prevented you from doing this in the past, or are there any cost consequences that we should consider about? I guess I'm just wondering why it wasn't done in the past and want to make sure we're thinking about any kind of knock-on effects going forward.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The reason we set up the captive to begin with wasn't driven by a desire to manage capital down or otherwise optimize the way we're managing capital but rather in order to optimize the way in which we were managing the risk. And the way in which the statutory construct worked in the past was such that \u2013 the primary shortcoming of it was such that the use of derivatives which we thought was important to manage this risk was not fully incorporated or adequately incorporated into that construct. And where the statutory construct is migrating toward is one which gives a much fuller and robust recognition of derivatives, both their use, their mission, modeling of the derivatives and the accounting for the derivatives.","And that was really the primary reason why we went to captive and the motivation for being able to recapture from the captive. There are economic benefits in the recapture that I've described before that led to, as you know, to the reduced volatility and the free up of capital. So all things being equal, we'd rather manage this thing holistically. It was the shortcomings of the construct before that prevented us from doing so.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Yeah, I think maybe just to emphasize part of what you might be asking. Because we never used the captive to arbitrage either reserves or admitted assets or capital, we didn't go into the recapture in a hole. We actually, as you see, went into the recapture from a position of strength. So there are things out there that would have been an advantage in the captive structure that we're going to lose as a result of the recapture.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I actually have a follow-up on Seth's line of questions. I just want to make sure that I understand the impact or the mechanics of the recapture here. So ultimately, does it mean that you have added to the hedging this variable annuity hedging, or is it just that the accounting for the same hedges is now different?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yaron, the GAAP accounting has not changed, just to be clear on that. What has changed is we've taken business that resided in five different legal entities and consolidated it down to two and substantially just in one. We have a New York and non-New York set of entities. All of the risks of the business are now being managed within those two statutory entities and we're managing them through a combination of derivatives and on-balance-sheet financial assets.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And why would that new construct ultimately lead to a meaningful reduction in capital volatility and to the increased stability and cash flow uncertainty?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, think about it this way, as I had mentioned before, we hold to CTE 97, and we do so including under modeled stress scenarios. When you're doing that calculation in five different entities, now imagine doing that consolidated across a single entity largely or the two entities. You get efficiencies, as you might expect, both in the reduction in risks that result in the offsetting of risks that go in different directions from the writer than they do the host contract. And you get efficiencies associated with the capital management because you don't have the friction of having to move capital and hedges between the different legal entities. So both from a capital standpoint in terms of how the calculation works and then from our ability to then manage the risk and then you lay on top of that the statutory construct being one that is more stable, less volatile, all three of those combine to the reduced volatility that you're seeing and will see going forward and the free-up of the capital.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","Yeah, maybe a big-picture way to think about it is that the profitability of the host contract mitigates the risk of the living benefit standalone, and when the living benefit guarantee was in a standalone entity we had to manage all the volatility that went with it. But when it's combined with the host, there are substantial positive cash flows and very stable cash flows from the host contract","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, I also have a question on the recapture, sorry to belabor this. But my impression at one point was that while everything you've said about the recapture is true and I think, as Seth and Yaron said, it was a home run. But doesn't it create a reporting or an accounting potential for volatility in tail scenarios now that you've moved from that modified GAAP to the statutory accounting now? If I'm wrong, please explain why. I thought the catch in this was that it might not report as well under tail scenarios under this construct versus the old one?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Randy, very clearly there can be noneconomic volatility in GAAP outcomes. We've seen that in the past and we expect we'll continue to see that. If you look at our results, however, a large portion of this was due to the, quote, \"corporate under-hedge\" of the interest rate risk, which has now been eliminated. There is a residual misalignment between statutory and economic view of the liability and how it gets expressed in GAAP. You saw that in what we called the risk margin, which was the delta between the GAAP liability and the hedge target before. And you will continue to see that volatility between the full GAAP liability and our economic target of that liability, so that has not gone away for us. Having said that, we expect to manage the outcome in a way that helps to mitigate that reported volatility going forward.","The other thing I think is important to highlight is that, as I mentioned earlier, the annuities business going forward we think in addition to the stability coming out of it is going to be a source of strong cash flow for the two reasons that I highlighted. And so the wins associated with this construct far outweigh what we view to be the potential for GAAP volatility, which frankly, we've been dealing with for our historical period already.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So basically, for all intents and purposes, you're saying that whatever that GAAP volatility is that's non-economic, really, it won't change that much in the structure versus what you had before?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that's fair to say. Our expectation is, relative to interest rates we'll have less GAAP volatility than we had before, and our volatility in response to equity market movements will be roughly what it was before.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Eric Berg, RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. With respect to the interest rate that you have now lowered \u2013 your long-term interest rate assumptions that you've lowered. Are we referencing here the rates for the appreciation in the separate accounts or are we talking about discount rates that is used to discount the cash flows underlying the liability calculation?","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So this is the \u2013 Randy, it's Rob. This is the -","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Eric.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh I'm sorry. Eric.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No problem. No problem at all. Go right ahead.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Eric, it's Rob. I'm on the last question. That is the long-term rate that's used in our actuarial assumptions as they affect the different liabilities that we have on our balance sheet, so that includes the account values and the rate at which they grow, but it also includes the host of other liabilities that we have for which we have to do actuarial computations.","Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman","It's not just the variable annuity piece.","Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. And maybe, John, you could address it \u2013 and my second and final question relates to the Asset Management business in general. As is widely known, it has proven to be a historic year in a negative sense for the asset management industry. It looks like we're on track to have a record amount of equity outflows from equity funds in North America. What is Prudential's strategy? You've talked now for two quarters about outflows in equities. What is your strategy for Asset Management given this very challenging context?","John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Eric, so let me take a couple of minutes on how we think about Asset Management because I think our view on this reflects both the uniqueness of our approach and our circumstances. So for us, Asset Management is a hybrid business model, one that we're very proud of, one that works well for our clients and ourselves. By that what I mean is, it's not a holding in which we have a passive ownership stake as some do and nor is it a department that's serving one client. What it is is a business and has a capability with critical interconnectivity to Prudential and its strategies. And its market-facing strength enables us to attract and retain topflight investment talent which in turn produces consistent investment results that are very favorable.","At this point it's got over $1 trillion in AUM and as we commented today, it's over $0.5 trillion of third-party unaffiliated assets. And actually in terms of Asset Management fees, roughly 80% of them are derived from managing third-party assets. So it's a very significant third-party asset manager and business but it does exceedingly well. I think last year's flows were around $20 billion. Keep in mind we have more fixed income assets than we have equities, so we sort of benefit from that pace of the cycle. But it's also a major contributor as well as beneficiary of its interrelationship with other parts of PRU.","And you see that manifest within a lot of ways which in turn enables us to be more competitive and gives us an edge in various areas whether it's PRT and the role asset management plays there or whether it's the role it plays in investing assets on behalf of our activities in Japan or the role the private placements and mortgages play to our various activities in our spread-related activities. So to us it's very distinctive in relation to others. It's not a holding in which we have a passive stake. It's not a department. It's a hybrid and it's doing very, very well. It's doing very well in part because of the consistency of our investment performance and the consistency and the stability and the quality of our investment professionals as well.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Eric, it's Steve. Let me take the strategic points that John mentioned and make them a bit more granular. You referenced equity outflows in the industry and we've seen that as well. In our case it's very much the shift from active to passive that is driving that. That's particularly visible in our traditional U.S. style box strategies. I want to point out however that those strategies only represent about 10% to 15% of the total PGIM to AUM. Nonetheless we're addressing that on two levels. First within the equities business itself. We're continuing to invest in growth in areas that have shown relatively greater resilience in the active to passive trend.","Among those I would count global, international, income-oriented and the factor-based enhanced indexing that we do in our quantitative management business. So we're maintaining that commitment to alpha generation but diversifying our approach to how we make that happen.","Second, and perhaps even more significant, the basic nature of our multi-manager structure provides sustainability and strength. We've seen equity outflows, as you mentioned, but we've also seen robust inflows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages.","That multi-manager structure has been one of the principal drivers of 13 straight years of positive third-party institutional net flows and it continues to give us confidence in our prospects going forward.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks both of you.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Don, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Suneet Kamath, UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start with the annuities business. I guess we've kind of been in breakeven flows now for several quarters. And given its one of your largest earnings contributors, I'm trying to get a sense of, do you have some initiatives in place around product innovation, et cetera, that can start to turn the flows positive at some point over the next several quarters?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","Suneet, this is Steve. First of all, we very much want to make sure at all times in the annuities business, that we're operating it on a sustainable basis.","So while obviously we seek to be competitive, we also want to make sure that we're maintaining a pricing discipline. In PDI for example, we recently announced a 25 basis point decrease in both the rollup rate and the payout rate and we think that's appropriate under the circumstance.","But I'd say that we look at this, Suneet, on both a tactical and a strategic level. First of all, on a tactical level, we'll continue to make the adjustments necessary, as I say, to make sure we're tailoring our product design and pricing it on a sustainable basis. But on a more strategic basis, I think it's going to be very much a story of product diversification, including getting more and more into areas of streamlined and simplified product design.","I think our recent track record on how we've managed product in the annuities business and how we've managed our diversification strategy gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to continue this. We've taken PDI from a standing start basically from launch two years ago, only two years ago, to now representing over half of our sales in this quarter; half of our sales even before you account for HDI reinsurance. So that type of success and diversification up to this point gives us, as I say, a lot of confidence in believing that we can take that further in product design along the lines that I mentioned.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just a little while ago, Lincoln talked about on its call, moving to more passive options within the VA, presumably to lower cost to the consumer. Is that something that you guys are looking at as well?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","I think there will be a lot of different elements where we're looking to, as I say to have a streamlined and simplified product design and some that may be lower cost as well. In a sense, PDI represents already a step in that regard but we'll continue that path.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just one quick one for Rob. You may have covered this before, so I apologize, but on the Life Insurance charge and the change in accounting interpretation that was referenced earlier, is there any ongoing impact to earnings that we should expect from that change, or is it purely a one-time phenomenon?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit","It is a one-time charge, however, recall that the way it works in any business, the present value of a number that we have to accrete to over time, some 15 plus years out. And so therefore, there is an ongoing impact as you establish a number that on a PV basis now needs to grow to that future value. So our belief is net of all our assumption updates that'll get washed out. But on an isolated basis it has a small, modest drag going forward.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. today through 11:59 p.m. August 11, 2016.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","And I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you, Leah. Good morning. On behalf of my Prudential colleagues, John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Rich Carbone, Chief Financial Officer; Charlie Lowrey, Head of U.S. Businesses; Ed Baird, Head of International Businesses; and Peter Sayre, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer, we thank you for joining our call.","We'll start today with prepared comments from John, Rich, and Mark, and then we'll have at your questions. Before we begin, in order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled, Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures, of our earnings press release for the second quarter of 2012, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, in managing our businesses, we use a non-GAAP measurement we call, adjusted operating income, to measure the performance of our Financial Services businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses as adjusted and related charges and adjustments, as well as results from divested businesses. Adjusted operating income also excludes recorded changes in asset values that are expected to ultimately accrue to contract holders and recorded changes in contract holder liabilities resulting from changes in related asset values.","Our earnings press release contains information about our definition of adjusted operating income. The comparable GAAP presentation and the reconciliation between the 2 for the quarter are set out in our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website.","Now let's get started. Here is John Strangfeld, CEO.","John Robert Strangfeld","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin by headlining what Rich and Mark will be describing to you more specifically regarding our second quarter.","Our drivers continued strong, and in fact, in some cases, very strong, and our underlying financial performance improved from the first quarter. Rich will take you through the market driven and discrete items included in this quarter's earnings. Stripping these items from each second quarter, our earnings per share amount to $1.67 this year versus $1.64 in the second quarter of 2011. This quarter's results includes the effect of significant improvement in the benefit ratios of our group life business, confirming, we believe, that last quarter's elevated ratio was an aberration.","On the other hand, this quarter's result also includes a drag of significantly worse-than-expected mortality in Individual Life, stemming from several large claims on seasoned policies. This unfavorable result, the largest in relation to our expectations since the fourth quarter of 2003, is also in our judgment, a random event.","ROE this quarter amounts to an annualized return over 11%, again, based on adjusted operating income, excluding the small number of market driven and discrete items that Rich will describe in a moment. Keep in mind that this 11% return -- 11-plus percent return, reflects the earnings drag from significant capital capacity, and that we intend to deploy approximately $3 billion of this capacity in the next 4 quarters. A portion of that deployment is slated for the GM pension buyout transaction we expect to close by year end. And in addition our board has authorized $1 billion in share repurchases in the 12 months ending June 30, 2013.","Through business expansion, synergy realization and capital deployment, we expect our ROE to improve. And we continue to believe our stated ROE objective for 2013 of 13% to 14% is achievable, and achievable in a variety of economic and market environments.","We are focused on execution and realization of this ROE objective. Additional expense synergies related to Star and Edison and the broader financial impact of the strong momentum in international will continue to be important drivers of performance. The successful deployment of capital with an accretive impact on ROE is critical as is the improvement of our operating performance in our U.S. businesses.","Fundamentals are exceptional in international and strong in most of our U.S. businesses. This is what gives us the confidence in our ability to distinguish ourselves with distinctive returns and high-quality businesses. Our strong drivers demonstrate our commercial momentum and support our ability to improve our earnings and returns. In annuities, sales for the quarter amounted to just over $5 billion, roughly in line with their levels since early last year. Our new living benefit product will be launched later this month.","In Retirement, flows in institutional investment products remain strong largely because of our growth in investment only wrap products. In addition, we believe the pension risk transfer business holds great promise. We look forward to the fourth quarter closing of the GM transaction, and we believe our agreement with GM may kindle interest among other planned sponsors.","In Full Service retirement, we experienced our first quarterly net inflow from case activities since 2010, driven by a single large sale. Nevertheless, we're maintaining pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment. Asset Management, once again, recorded excellent retail flows, but Institutional flows were flat for the first time in a long time as equity outflows essentially offset positive flows into our fixed income businesses.","Individual Life also delivered a healthy increase in sales as competitors have raised prices, bringing them closer to ours or have withdrawn products. Finally, International Insurance is benefiting from exceptional business growth even while we continue to integrate Star and Edison into Gibraltar. As for the Star\/Edison integration, cost savings are on track, and integration expenses are running below our original expectations. More broadly in Japan, sales are strong in all distribution channels, captive agency, banks and independent agencies.","To sum it up, Prudential is doing well, and we expect to do better. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Rich and Mark. So, Rich?","Richard J. Carbone","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we recorded common stock earnings per share of $1.34 for the second quarter, and that's based on adjusted operating income for the Financial Services businesses. This compares to $1.57 per share in the year ago quarter. We have a short, but not insignificant list of items related to markets and other discrete items, events, affecting the quarter's results.","In the Annuities business, the equity market dropped in the quarter, causing us to strengthen reserves to guaranteed minimum debt and income benefits and at an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, resulting in charges totaling $0.17 per share.","In the Asset Management business, we recorded a charge of $0.10 per share for an impairment related to our investments in our real estate funds. In International Insurance, Gibraltar absorbed integration costs of $0.05 per share relating to the Star\/Edison acquisition. And in Retirement, we recorded a charge of about $0.01 a share on the transfer of bank deposits to third parties, in connection with our decision to convert our savings and loan association to a trust-only organization. In total, the items I just mentioned had an unfavorable impact of about $0.33 per share on the quarter.","Our results in the year ago quarter included net charges of about $0.07 per share for a number of items, including claims costs and expenses from the earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan, and again, on the partial sale of a seed investment in the asset management business. Taking these items out of both the current and year ago quarters, the EPS comparison would be $1.67 for the current quarter versus $1.64 a year ago.","Now this comparison reflects an adverse fluctuation in Individual Life mortality for the current quarter and higher expenses in our U.S. businesses, which largely offset the benefit of continued organic growth on our International Insurance business as well as the realization of cost savings from the Star\/Edison integration. Mark will discuss the details in a few moments.","Moving to GAAP results of our Financial Services business. We reported net income of $2.2 billion or $4.64 per share for the second quarter, compared to $779 million or $1.58 a share a year ago. GAAP net income for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net pretax realized investment gains of $2 billion. The main driver of the $2 billion in current quarter gains was a $1.9 billion of asset liability value changes driven by currency fluctuations. These current quarter gains effectively reversed similar currency-driven losses that were incurred in our first quarter.","As I mentioned in discussing first quarter results, we regard this as noneconomic accounting driven mainly by revaluation of dollar and other non-Yen liabilities on the books of the Japanese companies, whose functional currency is Yen. For example, we have significant U.S. dollar-denominated products in our Japanese businesses. When the Yen weakens in relation to the U.S. dollar, as it did in the first quarter, we record a loss in the income statement for the increase of the U.S. dollar liabilities when measured in Yen on the Yen books, because it will take more Yen to pay them off. When the Yen strengthens, as it did in the second quarter, we record a gain in the income statement for the reduction of the liability, because it will take less Yen to pay them off. We consider this noneconomic because the liability is in U.S. dollars and is matched with U.S. dollar assets. This income statement impact is offset by adjustments made in AOCI, a component of equity, but not through the income statement.","The end result is that our GAAP equity, including AOCI, is essentially neutral despite the volatility running through the income statement. The remainder of the $2 billion of realized gains in the quarter of roughly $170 million, came from net gains of $259 million and product-related hedging activities and modest gains from general portfolio activities, partially offset by $117 million of impairments in credit losses. Book value per share on a GAAP basis amounted to $78.07 at the end of the second quarter, and this compares to $69.07 at year end.","At the end of the second quarter, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturities stood at $3.1 billion, and we were in a net unrealized gain position of roughly $15 billion. Excluding AOCI, book value per share amounted to $60.77 as of the end of the second quarter, up from $58.02 at year end. This increase of $2.75 reflects the benefit of 500 million of shares purchased at an average cost below book value under the $1.5 billion authorization, which ended in June of this year. Over the past 12 months, we've returned $2.2 billion to shareholders in the form of current stock dividends and share repurchases.","Turning to our capital position. First, I'll focus on our insurance companies. We continue to manage these companies to levels consistent with what we believe are AA standards. We managed Prudential Insurance to a 400 RBC. We began the year with an RBC of 491. During the second quarter, Prudential Insurance paid a dividend of 600. While this dividend had no impact on our overall capital position, it did reduce the statutory capital for Prudential Insurance, essentially moving the excess capital to the parent company, which enhanced our capital flexibility. While we do not perform a quarterly bottoms-up calculation of RBC, we remain above our 400 threshold after giving the effect of the dividend and statutory results for the first quarter.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported solvency margins of 721 and 810, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year end and under the new calculation method that became effective this year. The reported solvency margins are strong in relation to our targets and supported the position of our Japanese companies as well capitalized and financially strong insurers.","Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services business, we calculate on balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance through our 400 RBC threshold and then add capital capacity at the parent and the other subsidiaries.","Now as you saw on Investor Day in May, our estimate of balance sheet capital capacity is in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2011, with about half of this capital capacity considered readily deployable, meaning that it was held in cash or monetizable assets and available for share repurchases and strategic uses that would call for the external deployment or actual use of cash. Factoring in the net impact of our year-to-date results, the capital we've deployed in our businesses and the $500 million of share repurchases during the first half of the year, our capital position has not changed materially since year end in total or in the mix -- that is, the amount we consider redeployable.","I won't be more specific than that today, because many of the influences to our statutory capital are based on annual calculations. Also, as Mark explained a couple of months ago on Investor Day, we plan to deploy approximately $3 billion of capital over the next 4 quarters beginning on July 1 of this year. As you know, we announced a new $1 billion repurchase authorization in June, which extends through June 30 of next year. Investment in our businesses in the form of outsized organic growth based on market opportunities, is also part of our capital deployment plans. Pension risk transfer agreement with General Motors, which is scheduled to close by year end, is an example of such an opportunity and will allow us to deploy a significant amount of capital within Prudential Insurance for appropriate returns in a business we know well.","Turning to the cash position at the parent company. Cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper and other short-term borrowings amounted to about $4 billion at the end of the second quarter. The excess of our cash position over our currently targeted $1.2 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing debt, fund operating needs and to be redeployed over time.","Now, Mark will provide a more detailed view of our business results.","Mark B. Grier","Thank you, John and Rich. And good morning, good afternoon, good evening or good night, depending on where you are. Thanks for joining us. I'll start with our U.S. businesses.","Our annuity business reported adjusted operating income of $107 million for the second quarter compared to $207 million a year ago. The reserve true-ups and DAC unlocking that Rich mentioned had a net unfavorable impact of $124 million on current quarter results. This included a charge of $90 million to strengthen our reserves for guaranteed minimum debt and income benefits and a charge of $34 million from increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs; in both cases, reflecting unfavorable market performance in the quarter in comparison to our assumptions.","Results for the year ago quarter included a net charge of $35 million from an unfavorable DAC unlocking and reserve true-ups, also largely driven by market performance. Stripping out the unlockings and true-ups, annuity results were $231 million for the current quarter compared to $242 million a year ago or an $11 million decline. This decrease reflects the impact of a higher level of base DAC amortization and higher expenses in the current quarter, which together, more than offset the benefit of growth in our fees. Policy charges and fee income in the quarter increased $31 million from a year ago reflecting an increase of $7.5 billion in average variable annuity separate account values. The increase was driven by $11.6 billion in net flows over the past 12 months. While we have benefited from improvements in our amortization factors since our negative unlocking in the third quarter of last year, we are still amortizing DAC at a more rapid pace than a year ago. As a result, our base level of DAC amortization increased more than proportionally with the increase in our fees.","In addition, current quarter expenses were higher than a year ago, partly as a result of business development costs. Our gross variable annuity sales for the quarter were $5.3 billion, up from $4.5 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales benefited from actions taken by several key competitors that made our products relatively more attractive to clients and their advisors. We are comfortable with our sales level, which is roughly in line with our average of about $5 billion per quarter since we introduced our HDI product early last year.","As we mentioned at our Investor Day in May, we expect to launch the next generation of our variable annuity product, HDI 2.0, in the coming weeks. The new product will increase our rider fee to 100 basis points on individual contracts and 110 basis points on spousal contracts and 95 basis points under our current HDI product. In addition, the new product will increase the minimum issue age by 5 years to age 50, and will reduce the payout rate from 5% to 4% for the age 59.5 to 65 band.","The new product continues our successful highest daily value proposition backed by auto-rebalancing tailored to the risk profile of each contract while adapting the product economics to our views of market conditions and drivers of profitability and returns.","In addition, we discontinued sales of our x shares or bonus products in July based on our view that other share classes we offer will continue to provide broad market appeal across our distribution channels while offering more favorable return prospects in the current environment. The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $147 million for the current quarter, compared to $171 million a year ago. Current quarter results include a $9 million onetime charge resulting from our transfer of bank deposits to third parties, as Rich mentioned. Excluding this charge, retirement results were down $15 million from a year ago. The decrease came mainly from a lower contribution from net investment results. The impact of lower reinvestment yields over the course of the past year was partly offset by crediting rate reductions we implemented on our Full Service stable value business in mid-2011 and in January of this year. On July 1 of this year, we implemented further crediting rate reductions averaging about 15 basis points on roughly $15 billion of semiannual reset business.","Lower net investment contribution also reflected the loss of about $7 million in spread income from bank deposits that we transferred during the second quarter to third parties in connection with our decision to restructure our savings and loan to a trust-only organization.","Total retirement gross deposits in sales were $12.8 billion for the quarter compared to $9.7 billion a year ago. Full Service retirement gross deposits in sales were $4.4 billion for the quarter, up from $4.1 billion a year ago. While we continue to see limited activity in the mid- to large-case market, which is our major focus, current quarter sales included a major case win of about $850 million, which contributed to positive Full Service net flows of about $700 million for the quarter. Stand-alone institutional gross sales amounted to $8.5 billion in the current quarter compared to $5.6 billion a year ago. We are continuing to experience exceptionally strong flows of stable value wrap products, sold to plan sponsors and fund managers on a stand-alone basis which contributed $8 billion of gross sales in the current quarter versus $4.8 billion a year ago.","Current quarter sales included several large cases and benefited from the exit of a major provider of these products from the market. Overall, net additions for the retirement business were $6.3 billion for the quarter, and account value stood at $245 billion at the end of the quarter, up 11% from a year ago. The asset management business reported adjusted operating income of $48 million for the current quarter, compared to $227 million a year ago.","While the segment's basic earnings come from asset management fees, the decline in results in relation to the year ago quarter was mainly driven by a decrease of $175 million in the contribution from what we now call Other Related Revenues. This bucket encompasses results from incentives, transactions, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, which are variable in nature and partly driven by changing valuations and the timing of transactions.","In total, these activities produced a loss of $57 million in the current quarter and pretax income of $118 million in the year ago quarter. As Rich mentioned, current quarter results from these activities include a $75 million charge for an impairment related to our investment in a real estate fund. The investment dates back several years to our formation of the fund, which focuses on international properties and has experienced significant declines in value. And the impairments stem from our completion of an analysis concerning our ability to recover our investment. Results for the year ago quarter included a $61 million gain from the sale of part of our interest in a real estate seed investment. In addition, results from our real estate co-investments and interim loan portfolio were more favorable in the year ago quarter than in the current quarter.","Stripping out results from activities that come under the heading of Other Related Revenues, the Asset Management business produced adjusted operating income of $105 million in the current quarter compared to $109 million a year ago. The benefit of higher Asset Management fees driven by growth in assets under management was more than offset by higher expenses in the quarter, including fund start-up costs that are charged to expenses when incurred. The segment's assets under management stood at $650 billion as of the end of the quarter, up $67 billion or 11% from a year earlier.","Adjusted operating income for our Individual Life Insurance business was $61 million for the current quarter compared to $135 million a year ago. An adverse fluctuation in mortality experience, driven mainly by several large claims from business written in the late 1990s and early 2000s, drove nearly all of the earnings decline. While mortality experience fluctuates from one quarter to another, cumulative experience, looking back over several years, has been essentially in line with our expectations. Mortality in the current quarter was about $50 million less favorable than our average expectations representing the most adverse variance from expected levels since late 2003.","Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $91 million for the current quarter, up from $68 million a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by third-party sales and reflects our improved relative competitive position, especially in the universal life market where some key competitors have recently raised rates, bringing them more in line with our pricing, or even withdrawn products from the market.","The Group Insurance business reported adjusted operating income of $46 million in the current quarter, essentially unchanged from $49 million a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from a more favorable group life claims experience than that of the year ago quarter. I would also note that the current quarter group life benefits ratio of 88.6% is well in line with our historical range, in contrast to the 95.4% ratio for the first quarter of this year, which represented our most unfavorable experience in the last 5 years.","Going the other way, expenses were higher in the current quarter than a year ago. The higher level of expenses was mainly driven by updates of our premium tax estimates, which produced a charge of about $10 million in the current quarter and a modest benefit a year ago. Group Insurance sales for the quarter were $65 million compared to $52 million a year ago. Most of our Group Insurance sales are reported in the first quarter based on the effective date of the business.","Turning now to our international businesses. Gibraltar Life's adjusted operating income was $307 million in the current quarter compared to $185 million a year ago. As Rich mentioned, Gibraltar's current quarter results absorbed $38 million of integration costs for the Star and Edison acquisition. As we noted in our Investor Day, we now expect about $450 million of total integration costs, down $50 million from our original estimate. We have incurred about $270 million of these costs through the end of the second quarter and expect roughly $70 million more over the remainder of this year.","Results for the year ago quarter included charges of $56 million, representing our estimate of claims and expenses from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which was a second quarter event for Gibraltar due to its 1-month reporting lag. Year ago quarter results also absorbed $29 million of integration costs. Excluding the integration costs and the year ago impact of the earthquake and tsunami, Gibraltar's adjusted operating income was up $75 million from a year ago. This increase reflects business growth and cost savings from business integration synergies. We are benefiting from business growth across all of our channels, captive agents, banks and independent agencies. The benefit from business growth includes a contribution from margins on higher sales of cancer whole life products in the current quarter.","Since these products -- since these policies typically have annual premium payments, the profit contribution mainly occurs in the quarter of sale and at anniversary rather than pro rata over the year. Current quarter results reflect about $40 million of cost savings achieved thus far as a result of the business integration, compared to about $5 million of early saves that benefited the year ago quarter. Our cost saves are driven largely by consolidation of field offices, integration of systems platforms and reduction of support staff. We are well on track to achieve our targeted annual cost savings of about $250 million after the business integration is completed. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of our hedging program, contributed $12 million to the increase in earnings from a year ago.","Our life planner business reported adjusted operating income of $374 million for the current quarter compared to $315 million a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues including premiums, policy charges and fees were up 13% from a year ago. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates contributed $15 million to the increase in earnings from a year ago.","International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis amounted to $1.1 billion for the second quarter, an increase of $356 million from a year ago. The current quarter reflects accelerated sales of several products due to market developments and the updating of our product portfolio, as well as the continuing benefit from expanding distribution and the broad appeal of our protection and retirement solutions. Current quarter sales of our cancer whole life product, which is popular in the business market in Japan, amounted to $212 million, up $150 million from a year ago with the increase reflecting purchases in anticipation of a tax law change that became effective in late April of this year.","Current quarter sales of our U.S. dollar retirement income in whole life products amounted to $351 million, up $171 million from a year ago, reflecting purchases in advance of crediting rate reductions that we implemented during the current quarter at both Gibraltar and Prudential of Japan. Gibraltar Life sales were $735 million in the current quarter, up $211 million from a year ago, accounting for close to 2\/3 of the overall increase in International Insurance sales.","Bank channel sales contributed $112 million of the increase, driven primarily by our Yen-based single premium whole life products. These products, which have been popular in the bank channel, gained momentum as competitors limited sales of Yen-based single premium whole life products through banks.","Sales from the life consultant channel increased $47 million from a year ago mainly driven by greater sales of our U.S. dollar retirement income products. The remainder of the increase or $52 million came from the independent agency channel, mainly driven by strong current quarter sales of our cancer whole life product in the business market.","Life planner sales were $392 million in the current quarter, up $145 million from a year ago. Sales by life planners in Japan were up $136 million, including increases of $82 million from U.S. dollar retirement income and whole life products and $19 million from our cancer whole life products. Life planner sales outside of Japan were up $9 million or 12% from a year ago.","Corporate and other operations reported a loss of $261 million for the current quarter compared to $237 million loss a year ago. The greater loss in the current quarter was mainly a result of higher interest costs net of investment income, mainly reflecting our deployment of capital debt in our businesses and less favorable results from non-coupon investments.","To sum up, I would say that while our current quarter headline results were negatively affected by market driven and discrete items, our underlying earnings power remains solid. Our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Asset Management businesses are continuing to build a strong base of fee-generating account values and assets under management benefiting from strong competitive positions in our selected markets, including pension risk transfer where we see a major opportunity. The benefits of growth were offset in current quarter results by higher expenses, including business development costs. While results from our U.S. protection businesses were negatively affected in the quarterly comparison by an adverse fluctuation in individual life mortality, group life underwriting experience for the quarter returned to well within our historical range, following an adverse fluctuation in the first quarter. And our International businesses had an exceptionally strong quarter benefiting from growth across multiple distribution channels and cost savings from business integration synergies on track with our targets.","Thank you for your interest in Prudential. Now, we look forward to hearing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First, we'll go to the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question just on the VA pricing and product feature changes. And I guess we should prepare for an acceleration of sales here in 3Q ahead of the changes. But once the new product is in force, what sort of a pace of VA sales you'd be comfortable with on a quarterly basis given the refinement in the product?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Okay, well, I think, Chris, there are a couple of questions there. First, let me deal with flows. I think this quarter what we'd say is, flows were slightly higher than we wanted, but not higher than we expected. I think, as Mark said, we -- we're nothing if not consistent. And if you look at last year, we had flows of about $20 billion. So we've averaged about $5 billion a quarter. This quarter, they were slightly higher, I think because of the new product launch that's being made. But we try to manage any acceleration in sales as carefully as we can. Having said that, I think we'd expect sales to trend down somewhat over time, and that's what we hope for.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess trying to think a little bit about Mark's comments in Investor Day about expectations to deploy more than $3 billion of capital over the course of the next 4 quarters. So -- and I guess with the GM transaction, the $1 billion buyback authorization and your common stock dividend, you get pretty close to $3 billion. So you kind of have that earmarked already. So I guess, how much more is more? And then how do we think about the outsized growth opportunities, like GM, as potentially more of those could be layered on as we go forward?","Mark B. Grier","Chris, it's Mark. You can hear from the portrayal of the capital position that we still have capacity, and we still have the theme of being opportunistic with respect to finding things that make sense for us strategically and financially. And making sense financially right now, by the way, is very heavily influenced by the contribution that any capital deployment can make to the realization of our ROE objective. In terms of pension risk transfer, those deals will be lumpy. They're hard to forecast. The market has certainly taken notice of the transaction that we're doing with General Motors, and there is interest. And we believe that over time, this can be a very attractive deployment of capital for us, but it's hard to predict the timing. So I guess the net headline is that we have capacity, we'll be careful with respect to the way in which that capacity's used, we do see both business opportunities with respect to things like pension transfer, as well as other deployment opportunities, and we're going to do everything that's pointed in the direction of the realization of the ROE target.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just as a quick follow-up on that. If there is another large transaction, would that offset the buyback authorization, so you wouldn't move ahead with the buyback? Or are you fully committed to deploying the $1 billion to share repurchases?","Mark B. Grier","I wouldn't make an unqualified statement about the commitment to share repurchases. We'll be making the right economic decision. Having said that, pension risk transfer deals are very capital friendly. And so even a fairly substantial pension risk transfer deal may not put a lot of pressure on the availability of capital for share repurchases. We like the picture that's in front of us in terms of capital friendly deployment opportunities.","John Robert Strangfeld","And keep in mind, Chris, that capital deployment means capital deployment of the non-monetizable capital that's in PICA. And these pension risk transfer businesses are done within PICA. That's a noncash requirement, right? It's a noncash use of capital.","Operator","And next we go to the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I actually want to go back to Chris's question for just one clarification. I think we've all been, kind of been operating under the assumption that the $3 billion between the dividend, between the buyback and the GM transaction is -- kind of gets you at or near that $3 billion. I just want to confirm that. Is that the right assumption to be making, or are there any other transactions that we should be thinking about that actually get us to that $3 billion or above, if there's upside?","Mark B. Grier","We haven't parsed it with too sharp a pencil in terms of the pension risk transfer deal. But having said that, the answer to your question, is yes, that's the ballpark.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I wanted to talk a little bit about Gibraltar earnings. And I understand that there was kind of an anomaly that hopefully recurs at this quarter annually relating to the cancer whole life sales. And when you kind of put a margin on that, I mean, should we really be thinking of a normalized earning closer to that $310 million level? Or how should we think about that $340 million plus, if you back off the Star\/Edison integration costs?","Edward P. Baird","Sure, let me talk a little -- this is Ed Baird speaking. Let me talk a little bit about the product profitability and the sales and the factors that are driving them. As you observed correctly, the -- one of the drivers for the bump in earnings in Gibraltar was the increased sales in the cancer whole life product. And as Mark explained, there is a particular accounting treatment of that, such that you recognize it in the quarter in which the annual premium is received. That's not particularly unique, that's part of the seasonality that influences certain sales. So yes, you will see that in this quarter. You'll see it recur in the same quarter next year and the years thereafter. What you can't be able to predict, however, is what these other sales are going to do to earnings. Let me give you a few examples of this. There are elements this quarter that are advancing, as Mark accurately described them, future sales. So, for instance, the change in the tax treatment from the cancer, the change in the crediting rates on the dollar-denominated products. So those things are advancing some future sales. The flip side of that, however, is that we're just starting to see the emergence of factors that will strengthen sales. What I have in mind here, for example, within Gibraltar specifically, is the growth in the number of banks. We're up to about 60 banks that we're now active with. As you know, we've reported that we inherited almost 100 in total when we combined what we got from Star and Edison with what we had. And we've just been slowly going through those relationships to see which ones we want to add and how much we want to commit to it. So there's a positive trend there that is yet still emerging. Another factor is that one of the things we have done in the independent agent channel, which again gets reported through Gibraltar, is we have just introduced in this past quarter what has long been our leading product in Japan. And that is the very profitable dollar-denominated retirement income product. That's just been introduced during the second quarter. So there are some aspects of the sales in this quarter, and thus, in the profitability that are advancing future things, but on the other -- and those should not be sort of linearly extrapolated into the future. But on the other hand, there are still some emerging very strong positive trends that will net against that. So consequently, it makes it very difficult to say exactly how you should normalize the quarter.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Firstly with interest rates. 10 years, clearly meaningfully below where it was when you provided guidance. So hoping to get some color as to how this may impact fundamentals if rates remain unchanged at the current level? On a related topic, rates have also declined since you announced the GM transaction. Does that change your return expectation for that transaction? Then lastly with international, clearly very strong sales. But given a significant portion was kind of buy or sell in nature, ahead of the crediting rate reductions, can you discuss the profitability of those sales?","Mark B. Grier","This is Mark, I'll start with the interest rate question, and then Charlie can discuss the GM question, and Ed can discuss the international question. But with respect to interest rates, I think the low rate scenario that we had contemplated when we were responding to questions 2 years ago about low rate scenarios is coming through. And the impact on us is unfolding pretty much as we had described at that time. If you look at GAAP earnings, we do see a negative impact from lower reinvestment rates either because absolute returns on some of our assets are lower or because there is spread compression with respect to some of the particular products that we sell. But as we have reinforced our belief in the earnings power of the company and the achievability of our ROE target, obviously now, we're in the middle of the low-rate scenario. And we still believe that, that ROE objective is a fair representation of our earnings power in a range of outcomes that includes continued low rates.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Okay, Nigel, in terms of the GM transaction -- this is Charlie. We can't say too much about it because obviously it hasn't closed yet, it's supposed to close in the fourth quarter, but I'll make a couple of comments here. One, we think GM did a very good job in terms of managing its pension fund. So we started the process from a very good place. In particular, it's not surprisingly that the -- but not surprising, the assets and the liabilities were relatively well matched, so that helps. More to your point, there's a true-up mechanism at the end of the process that takes into account a variety of different market factors. That's built in. But I'd conclude by saying that we and GM tried to put together, what I call, a very durable agreement that contemplated a lot of market movements. So I think we're feeling very good about our partner, and we're feeling very good about the business itself.","John Robert Strangfeld","Regarding our product profitability, Nigel, let me offer you a couple of comments. First, I would bring your attention to the fact that the biggest increase in product was actually in the cancer-related products. And as you know, both for us and for others, those are among some of the highest margin products out there. Secondly, the single premium whole life, probably that's at the lower end of our targeted range of profitability given the current interest rate environment. But again, that represented only about 13% of our sales. Quite a bit higher is the increase taking place in our dollar-denominated retirement income. So if you actually look at our product breakdown, what you see is our #1 product is retirement income. Again, that's been our lead product for half a dozen years. Number 2, for this quarter, which is unusually high, would be the cancer product. Number 3, is our normal whole life. And you only get to single premium with sort of the number 4 product in our portfolio for this particular quarter. So when you look at the total mix, we're actually very comfortable with the profitability of the portfolio that was sold during this quarter.","Operator","Next we move to the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Nigel -- the Japanese question's the one that I want to go over. But I do want to address kind of a throw-away line from Mark. Mark, you mentioned the start-up costs in asset management. I believe you guys did quite a large closed-end fund during the quarter. I was wondering if that's what you were referring to. And maybe you could put a number on those costs?","Mark B. Grier","Yes. Charlie can answer that.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure. Well, we did do a closed-end fund. It was a very successful fund. It was about $700 million for a high yield strategy. And obviously, with closed in funds, you have an initial kind of IPO cost, if you will, and that was roughly $12 million. So that was a big part of the expense gain for the quarter. But we're really pleased with, obviously, the execution of this business and the start of a new sort of strategic direction for us.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, Charlie, while I have you, the mention of outflows in equities, would you term that to be the program related? Maybe your clients changing what they want to do, going from something to something else? Or would you equate that more to performance related?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","No, I think it's very much the former. It's not performance related. We actually had good performance across all the asset classes this quarter. I'll divide the flows into a couple of ways. But if you look at the institutional flows, as John said, they were reasonably balanced between, obviously, the inflows and the outflows. We've had very good inflows in the fixed income. The outflows were from equity. About half of it was from our quantitative side, QMA, and about half of it was from Jennison. But within the QMA, the interesting thing is there was one passive mandate for which we virtually got very, very little fees. And that was just a client moving out of that particular strategy. The others were more rebalancing, either from equities into fixed income or from domestic into global. So it was not performance related; it was really rebalancing of client assets.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Ed Spehar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. First, a follow-up on the single premium whole life product in Japan. Ed, should we interpret your comments to mean that perhaps there will be some price increases in that product line and some impact on sales? Because I think we're all thinking about the AFLAC commentary on -- and I don't know if it's the same product, but I'm wondering if we should be expecting some changes there? And then, Mark, question on your comments about closeouts being capital light. I think after the GM deal was announced, there was at least one rating agency that came out with maybe less favorable commentary on the risk profile of that business -- or perhaps, you could just sort of discuss how the agencies -- with your interaction with the agencies, how they think about this stuff?","Mark B. Grier","I'll let Ed go first, and then I'll talk about the capital issue.","Edward P. Baird","Sure, Ed. Let me talk a little bit about some of the marketplace dynamics. I wouldn't want to reference any one competitor, but I will talk a little bit about the performance of some of the competitors, both foreign and domestic and the influence it had on our sales and the relative profitability that you could expect. You will have noted that some of the companies who were very strong in their sales over the past year in some of these heavily investment oriented products have indeed retrenched, either by putting in place some kind of cap, lowering crediting rates, redesigning their product, or in the case of some of them, actually withdrawing the product. You will note that we've not done those things, because our view, frankly, is that if it is necessary to do that, that means that one was overreaching probably to begin with. So we have abstained from that kind of approach because we put less emphasis, as you know, on chasing market share that we do on chasing profitability. Secondly, the single premium product that we sell is Yen-based, and that, of course, is a currency that has been living at the low end of returns for a very long time, although in fairness even there, the JGBs have dropped as well. So even Yen-based products need to be evaluated as we continue to evaluate all products, but not with the urgency that the dollar-based products have had to be because they've not experienced that same degree of precipitous drop. So we're actually pretty comfortable with the range of these products, and we will continue to monitor. And if we think the returns don't hit ours, then we will make adjustments. But in general, the reason you saw the sales go up here on this product had not to do with the actions we took but rather the actions that the competitors took in pulling back to a position more comparable to ours. I would cite just one very simplistic example. In some cases, some of the competitors have pulled back the discount they were giving for advanced premium from 1% to say, 50 basis points. We were already at 50 basis points. So you could go through a whole litany of product features and find that there's a comparable movement that has made our product more attractive, not because of actions we have taken, but because of the relative rebalancing that some of the competitors have.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, Ed, would it be fair to say that, prior to this quarter, over the past 12 months -- let's say, the prior 12 months, that you had lost some share in that type of product relative to these other players and now you're regaining it back? Is that reasonable?","Edward P. Baird","I don't think -- I think it's very interesting; I don't know that we could say we lost it because we didn't have it to begin with. Could we have had more, had they not taken those actions? Possibly. As you know, we're still in the early growth mode with this channel. So that even though sales are up 80%, I believe, yes, in the bank channel for the quarter, and that's over a comparative quarter that was up 60%. So I can't complain that we're not getting growth. It's really just a matter of what's available on the shelf. And at the moment, I think we're seeing that our position on the shelf is looking relatively more attractive, because obviously, I think, both because of the pressure of the solvency margin rules, the new rules that I think are forcing some competitors to maybe take a more cautious approach, more conservative approach to their investment portfolio, and therefore, not be able to support maybe some of the higher yields they were providing on these kinds of products. So I think the trends there are to our favor.","John Robert Strangfeld","All right, and then on the capital question. The expression that I've used on this is \"capital friendly\", and not necessarily \"capital light\". But this is a very efficient deal because of the way in which it goes on the statutory books. This is a good home for this kind of a transaction because of the way in which we recognize the liabilities and because of the way in which we can manage the cash flows on the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet. In terms of issues, the concentration question is the one that's been raised and it has sort of 2 branches to it. One branch is around the notion of a very large deal going on the books all at once. And as you might imagine, we have very carefully considered the impact on our balance sheet of this transaction, very carefully understanding the assets that we'll be receiving as part of the payment of the premium, as well as the investments that we'll have to make ourselves to properly manage against this liability. We believe also in the context, by the way, of total Prudential that although this General Motors transaction is large, it's not out of proportion. When you look at the kind of risk that we want to take and the skill sets that we have in both sides of the balance sheet managing this liability as well as managing the asset. The other branch of the concentration question relates to having all of the underlying lives covered by this annuity coming from 1 employer. And I guess you'd have to argue that there may be some unusual correlation or some unusual longevity outcome related to that population. We haven't seen it, so I think net, we are very comfortable with the capital efficiency, with the skill sets that we have to manage this asset liability and with the fit of this deal in the context of the risk we want to take and the things that we're good at.","Operator","Next we go to the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So I've got 2 questions. One, I wanted to ask a little bit about the regulatory environment. In particular, more recent commentary in Washington around SIFI, around insurance companies versus banks as it relates to Prudential standards. And then the second question that I had was a bit more, well, I guess it's -- I hate to ask a question that focuses on the corporate segment. But the volatility in the results in that segment are so significant that I think it would be really helpful if you could give us some sense of how to think about your outlook for that segment for the remainder of the year and maybe as part of your 2013 ROE objective as well. I mean, I feel like we have all kinds of data and information to make some informed modeling assumptions for your other business segments. But for this one, I feel like in any given quarter, it could come in $100 million above or below the previous quarter and I'm not sure exactly why.","John Robert Strangfeld","Yes, so we'll start with the regulatory environment, Mark?","Mark B. Grier","Yes, I think your references to recent both published, as well as oral comments about Prudential standards and the capital and solvency regime view of companies that are thrift-holding companies, but also predominantly engaged in insurance and other aspects, so the consideration of capital and solvency standards for insurance companies has kind of been on the front burner. I guess I'd start off by saying the same thing we've been saying for a long time around the SIFI issue, which is, it's a lot more important than we get it right than which label we wind up stuck with. And I think that gets right at the point you're making, which is, are the capital and solvency standards that are being contemplated appropriately consistent with our business models in the way in which risk is realized by a company like Prudential. And then from there you would go to the SIFI question and think about how to apply the right framework. But with respect to SIFI designation, it's very, very much up in the air. The process is underway. I would say it's uncertain with respect to how or where we may come out of that. With respect to the contemplation of capital and solvency standards for us, we're actively engaged in discussions around our interpretation of what's been put out there. We'll be considering either an individual or collective comment letter for the Fed on the solvency standards proposed for thrift holding companies. And we'll be making many of the same points that we've made for a long time, which is that the bank framework doesn't work very well. And that it's appropriate to think very differently about volatility and the way in which risk is realized and the cash consequences of different environments for insurance companies versus banks. And that's an ongoing process in which we're actively engaged.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And, Mark, just as a quick follow-up to that. Have you guys internally attempted to conduct your own stress test using the bank, C Card [ph] standards?","Mark B. Grier","We look at a lot of implications of different solvency regimes. The Basel frameworks that have come out, as well as other things that we do internally with our own capital management processes. I'm not going to comment on the specific outcomes related to any particular stress tests, except to tell you that we turn it over a lot of different ways and pay a lot of attention to what these things might mean for us. And that it informs us as we comment on the way in which the framework is shaping up.","Richard J. Carbone","And, John, this is Rich. We share your frustration on the corporate account. But let me give you a little bit of background on what's in there. There are legacy businesses in there that react to markets up and down. There are employee benefit plans, and there are many of them, several of them that react to the markets going up and down. And there's a whole bunch of corporate activities. So to go through each one of the activities and try to model what they're going to do, we're all going to be precisely wrong. What I should -- the way I think you can think about this is, we had about $40 million or $50 million worth of things that came out of those -- that stuff, that were bad guys in the first quarter. We had $40 million or $50 million that came out of that stuff that were good guys in the second quarter. If you average them out, or if you took them out, you'd probably come up with 310. 310 is more likely the run rate, typical run rate in 2012. And if you use that to model 2013, you won't get too much indigestion.","John Robert Strangfeld","And this is John, I'd like to add a point. But I wanted to add a point, partly to something, John, you raised and something that Nigel raised a little bit earlier, which is related to both the environment and our conviction around our achieving a 13% goal. And just a couple of thoughts about that. Obviously, from our figures here, you can see a run rate of a bit more than 11%. And our -- so the real question is, how do we get from the 11% plus to the 13%? And from our point of view, what we're thinking about is the things that most principally are going to affect that, that are going to drive us from where we are to obtaining it, is the continuing momentum of the international businesses, which you're hearing a lot about, which you're seeing tangible evidence of; the realizations, number 2, the realization of the Star\/Edison synergies -- and you heard comments about being on track with that; the improvement we expect to see from our U.S. businesses, the run rate impact; the GM transaction and active capital management. Those are really the 5 things that are the big drivers that take us from the mid-11% range to the 13%. And frankly, based on where we are and what it takes, we like our prospects for achieving it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have run out of time for questions on today's call.

I will provide you some higher level observations on our results for the fourth quarter and full year, the underlying fundamental trends in our businesses, capital deployment, and regulation. I'll then hand it over to Mark and Rob to go through the specifics.","Fourth quarter operating earnings of $2.43 per share, which excludes a $0.03 benefit from market driven and discrete items, exceeded the $2.07 we reported a year ago. Recall that we typically experience elevated expenses in the fourth quarter, which we estimate to be $0.21 per share in this year's quarter. Otherwise, results for the current quarter benefited from solid core growth across our businesses, good underwriting experience, and favorable spread income, including higher than expected non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income.","Net income was $0.65 per share in the quarter or about $1.80 per share below core operating income. A closer alignment of our operating and net income and reducing overall volatility have been key strategic focuses for us over the last couple of years. With the election, we experienced significant movements in Treasury rates, credit spreads, and currencies, which resulted in mark-to-market accounting net losses for the quarter.","However, the vast majority of these losses were driven by the component of our variable annuity reserve that we don't deem economic and therefore don't hedge. The net impact to earnings from other derivatives was fairly modest.","I will now briefly discuss full-year results. Operating earnings, excluding market driven and discrete items was $9.65 per share for the year, or slightly below the 2016 guidance range which we established in December of 2015. ROE for the full year was 12.7%. While our segment core operating results were consistent with guidance, we did experience higher corporate expenses than we had anticipated, in part due to a number of inherently variable or episodic items. Examples of this include higher long-term and deferred compensation expenses related to stronger than expected equity returns, including our share price, higher legal costs, and losses on a tax-advantaged investment.","Net income for the year was $9.71 per share, which is in line with adjusted operating income excluding market driven and discrete items. While there are moving parts from quarter to quarter, we are pleased to see the consistency of these two measures on a full year basis. Adjusted book value per share growth was a solid 7.3% for the year, which is after paying $2.80 in dividends.","I will now touch on key fundamental trends in our businesses, starting with our International businesses. Our International operations experienced strong sales growth in 2016. Constant dollar sales grew 8% for the full year and 5% for the fourth quarter, despite a challenging interest rate environment, most notably in Japan, our largest overseas market. We have been able to leverage a broad U.S. dollar product portfolio that more than mitigated pricing and product actions taken on yen-based products in response to the lower interest rate environment.","For the year, our U.S. dollar product sales in Japan increased 53%, which contrasts with a 12% decline in yen-based products. In addition, we saw growth in both our Life Planner and Life Consultant field forces while maintaining strong productivity levels. The environment is challenging. However, we continue to expect solid core growth, earnings and cash flow out of our International businesses.","Moving on to our Domestic Businesses. While growth in earnings trends differ across our Asset","Management, Retirement, and protection businesses, at an overall level, we continue to see good momentum. Asset Management has been a particular highlight, generating positive net flows from unaffiliated third parties of $5.7 billion for 2016, including $900 million in the fourth quarter. Our net flows are benefiting from our initiatives to expand distribution and product offerings and our solid overall investment performance. And while we are not immune to the industry net flow challenges affecting active equity strategies, we benefit from our diversified platform and scale with over $1 trillion of Assets Under Management. 2016 also marks our 14th consecutive year of positive institutional flows.","Retirement also had a strong year with net flows of $5.8 billion and 5% account value growth over the year-end 2015, and we continue to see favorable long-term growth prospects. We are also pleased with the strong underwriting performance we have experienced, particularly in our pension risk transfer business.","Annuity sales and net flows are showing pressure as evidenced by lower sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our product diversification efforts enable us to show smaller year-over-year variable annuity sales declines than peers in 2016, but we're not immune to broader industry pressures, including the impact of regulatory uncertainty. Having said that, we continue to believe in the long-term value proposition and return potential of annuities, and believe the actions we are taking to restructure our annuities business during 2016 will substantially reduce the capital volatility and improve the earnings and cash flow prospects for this business.","And to round out our businesses, our Individual Life and Group Insurance protection businesses are showing positive sales and top-line growth trends. We are pleased to see favorable mortality in our Individual Life business in the fourth quarter following adverse experiences in the first three quarters. As we commented, mortality experience can fluctuate over shorter time periods, but our overall underwriting experience has been positive over a multi-year period. Group Insurance had a good year, producing benefit ratios at the lower end of our expected range, and has started to show top-line momentum after a period of declines which followed pricing and underwriting actions.","I will now turn to capital deployment. We returned over $900 million of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which brings our full year shareholder return to $3.2 billion. This is on top of the roughly $530 million spent on our investment in AFP Habitat, a Chilean retirement services provider. 2016 was a particularly strong year for share repurchases, benefiting from capital freed up from our annuity restructuring, as well as gains from our Japan capital hedge to supplement the strong cash generation in our businesses. We believe in a balanced approach to capital deployment, including returning capital to shareholders and investing in our businesses.","For 2017, the board has authorized $1.25 billion of share repurchases, and yesterday we announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend. Our annualized dividend has nearly doubled over the last five years, growing at an annual rate of 13%, reflecting our stronger and more consistent cash generation.","And finally, it's been an eventful couple of weeks in respect to regulation, with directives from President Trump requesting the DOL to examine the fiduciary rule and the Department of Treasury to review their current regulatory oversight of the financial system more broadly. We strongly support an effective regulatory environment and the protections it provides; however, we also believe a reevaluation of both standards is appropriate in order to address among other factors any unintended consequences, and therefore we support these actions taken by the new administration. And in the meantime, there is considerable uncertainty on where both of those directives will ultimately land, and as a consequence, we continue to manage our business following the current framework.","With that, I'll hand it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover liquidity, leverage, and capital highlights.","I'll start on slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.46 per share for the quarter compared to $1.94 a year ago. After adjusting for a $0.03 per share discrete item, EPS amounted to $2.43 for the quarter, up from $2.07 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses was solid in the quarter, with results benefiting from higher fees in our Asset Management and Annuities businesses, greater spread margins, and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis.","Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $65 million above our average expectations in the quarter. We estimate that this tailwind, along with the net impact of favorable underwriting results relative to expectations in our Retirement and Life Insurance Protection businesses and updates of reserves and related items in Individual Life benefited current quarter results by about $0.12 per share. In the comparison of results to a year ago, the contribution of these variable items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates had a net favorable impact of about $0.08 per share.","In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses for items such as technology and business development, annual policy holder communications, advertising, and other variable costs were about $140 million or $0.21 per share above our quarterly average for the year, consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses, and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $284 million for the current quarter, about $800 million below our after-tax adjusted operating income. This was mainly driven by a negative impact from product derivatives which I will discuss shortly.","Slide 3 shows financial highlights for the year. EPS for the year amounted to $9.65, after adjusting for market driven and discrete items, which implies an ROE of 12.7%. As we mentioned in our outlook call in December, we are not immune to the multiyear impact of low interest rates in our two primary markets, the U.S. and Japan, and we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses that have longer term paybacks. As a consequence, in December we moderated our ROE expectations to a 12% to 13% range in the near to intermediate term.","The full-year EPS comparison reflects less favorable currency exchange rates in 2016, along with a greater tailwind benefit in 2015 from underwriting experience that was more favorable than our average expectations. Underwriting results, plus the net impact of other variable items we called out, had a negative impact of about $0.55 per share on the comparison of results year-over-year.","Moving to Slide 4, results for the quarter include a single market driven and discrete item from the settlement of legal matters in the Retirement business. Our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business was insignificant.","Moving to Slide 5, our GAAP net income of $284 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment losses of $824 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pre-tax losses of $313 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $1.3 billion. The largest single driver was the impact on non-performance risk or NPR from applying tighter credit spreads to a smaller gross GAAP liability for Annuities living benefit, which decreased due to rising interest rates in the quarter. Essentially, the reduction in NPR was greater than the decrease in the GAAP gross reserve that we consider non-economic and don't hedge, driving the loss.","We did also see some modest net hedge breakage of roughly $200 million in the quarter due to the volatility in the post election period. Our hedging program was 95% effective in the quarter. The current quarter pre-tax loss from divested businesses was mainly a result of negative mark-to-market on duration management derivatives in long-term care.","Moving to our business results and starting on slide 6, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market driven and discrete items I've mentioned. Annuities earnings were $422 million for the quarter, up by $19 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $10 million above our average expectations.","In addition, results benefited from a greater net fee contribution due to our recent risk management refinements. Higher expenses, including business development costs were a partial offset. The sequential quarter decline in earnings was mainly driven by seasonally higher expenses, which for Annuities were about $10 million greater in the fourth quarter than the quarterly average for the year and by lower fees, mainly driven by lower average account values. The increase in return on assets or ROA from a year ago to 107 basis points reflects the benefit of our changes in risk management strategy. Quarterly return on assets can vary from a baseline, and as we had noted in the third quarter, benefited from some items that were stronger than we would expect as a base case.","Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total sales in the quarter are down roughly $400 million from a year ago, mainly from HDI, which represented about half of current quarter sales. The decline is directionally consistent with the lower levels of variable annuity sales across the industry, and we believe the continuing uncertainty associated with distributors adapting to the new DOL regulations was a contributor. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product are also down from a year ago and sequentially, reflecting a repricing action in September.","For the year, more than two-thirds of our gross sales represented new business without retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees, reflecting our successful product diversification efforts and external reinsurance for new business through the end of 2016 sharing HDI rider risks.","Turning to slide 8, Retirement earnings were $298 million for the quarter, up $130 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by a greater contribution from net investment results, more favorable case experience and lower expenses. The contribution from net investment results was up $98 million from a year ago. Current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $30 million above our average expectations compared to a contribution of about $20 million below expectations a year ago. Higher spread based account values and our ALM strategies also contributed to the stronger net investment results. Current quarter case experience was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectation.","Our pension risk transfer business continues to perform well, and we've benefited from over $100 million of favorable case experience over the past two years. The sequential quarter increase in earnings included the contribution from about $3 billion of new funded pension risk transfer business that closed late in the third quarter.","Turning to slide 9, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.9 billion for the current quarter, compared to $8.3 billion a year ago. Gross sales of institutional investment products in the current quarter amounted to about $4 billion, including roughly $2 billion of mainly funded new pension risk transfer cases and $1 billion of stable value wraps. The modest negative net flows in the quarter reflect the episodic nature of the large case business, both in pension risk transfer and full service, as you can see looking over the full year results.","Net flows for the year were about $6 billion, including about $4 billion for standalone institutional products and $2 billion in full service. The institutional net flows included about $5 billion of new funded pension risk transfer cases which more than offset our runoff of the in-force business.","Turning to slide 10, Asset Management earnings were $224 million for the quarter, compared to $198 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher asset management fees, partially offset by a $15 million lower contribution from Other Related Revenues, which included a $10 million gain in the year-ago quarter from a legacy portfolio disposition. The increase in asset management fees reflected greater fees from management of fixed income assets driven by growth in Average Assets Under Management and also reflected the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate in mid-2016, both partially offset by lower fees tied to equities.","The Asset Management business reported about $900 million of net positive unaffiliated third party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity. Net institutional flows of $2.5 billion driven by fixed income strategies were partly offset by retail outflows driven by equities. For the year, we reported $5.7 billion of positive unaffiliated third party net flows, another strong year for our important Asset Management business.","Turning to slide 11, Individual Life earnings were $138 million for the quarter, compared to $119 million a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by a greater contribution from net investment results and more favorable claims experience, which together had a favorable impact of about $50 million on the comparison of results. Earnings for the current quarter included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $15 million above our average expectations, and a contribution from claims experience, also about $15 million more favorable than average expectations.","Going the other way, current quarter results included a negative impact of about $25 million from updates of reserves and related items, including an unusually large impact from periodic true-ups such as actual to expected in-force business. Expenses were also modestly higher in the current quarter than a year ago.","Turning to slide 12, individual life sales based on annualized new business premiums were essentially unchanged from a year ago but up by $40 million from the third quarter. The sequential quarter increase came mainly from Guaranteed Universal Life and Other Universal Life, including tax and estate planning sales that tend to peak in the fourth quarter. In addition, the current quarter reflected accelerated purchases in advance of price increases and face amount limits we recently implemented for our Guaranteed Universal Life products.","Turning to slide 13, Group Insurance earnings were $43 million for the quarter, up by $16 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from lower expenses, including the impact of nonlinear items such as premium taxes, and a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, slightly more favorable than our average expectations. Underwriting results were solid but less favorable than a year ago. The total benefits ratio remained at the favorable end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%.","Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 14, earnings for our Life Planner business were $395 million for the quarter, compared to $367 million a year ago. Excluding a $22 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $50 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth, with constant dollar insurance revenues up 6% from a year ago, lower expenses and more favorable policy benefits experience with mortality about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations.","Turning to slide 15, Gibraltar Life earnings were $360 million for the quarter compared to $371 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $26 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are up by $15 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth, including the contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile and stronger net investment results driven mainly by increased portfolio size. Mortality in the quarter was roughly consistent with our average expectations versus about $15 million more favorable than expected a year ago.","Turning to slide 16, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $727 million for the current quarter, up $35 million or 5% from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 41% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprised more than half of our sales in Japan for each of the past three quarters and the year, compared to just over one-third of our sales in 2015. This change in mix reflects our adaptation of the product portfolio to the current environment, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases, sale suspensions for yen products that are most affected by interest rates.","We are continuing to benefit from our longstanding competitive advantage in distribution of U.S.-dollar products in Japan, emphasizing recurring premium death protection products with returns mainly based on mortality and expense margins. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 15% from a year ago, reflecting an 8% increase in agent count driven mainly by recent sales manager appointments together with higher average premium size. Gibraltar sales were essentially unchanged from a year ago, an 8% sales increase from our Life Consultants, driven mainly by higher average premium size was offset by lower bank channel sales. The decline in bank channel sales included the effects of terminating sales of single premium yen-based products. Sales outside Japan are up 3% from a year ago, driven by continued growth in Brazil.","Turning to slide 17, the corporate and other loss was $441 million for the current quarter, compared to a $378 million loss a year ago. The increased loss was driven by higher expenses, including variable items such as initiative costs and compensation programs that are linked to equity returns, including our share price. Lower interest expense, reflecting our pay downs of debt over the past year was a partial offset. Higher expenses drove the sequential quarter increase in the loss. Of the company's $140 million overall excess to fourth quarter expenses in relation to the quarterly average for the year that I mentioned earlier, about $80 million resides in Corporate & Other.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon.","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures starting on slide 18. While statutory results are not yet final, we estimate that our composite RBC for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries on a comprehensive basis will be well above our 400% target as of year-end. Following the recapture of our living benefit risks and the refinements we made to our risk management strategies, most of the contract risks and supporting capital for annuities reside in our PALAC statutory entity. Therefore, we view this composite RBC position as a primary measure of our financial strength. We expect both PALAC and Prudential Insurance to separately report strong RBC positions in relation to our target as well.","In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 858% and 975% respectively as of September 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets.","Looking at liquidity, leverage, and capital deployment highlights on slide 19, cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of about $1 billion from September 30. This reflects cash inflows during the quarter, net of the impact of about $900 million returned to shareholders including dividends and $625 million of share repurchases. Capital flows to the parent company in the quarter included roughly $1 billion from PALAC, driven by earnings from the Annuities business over the past year.","We are continuing to manage the product risks on an economic basis, including the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold through moderate stress scenarios and we are benefiting from greater certainty of cash flows and reduced capital volatility as outcomes of the risk management refinements we implemented. We expect the more stable earnings and capital in our Annuities business to support ongoing distributions. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of year-end remained within our targets. And as John noted, we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders during the year through dividends and share repurchases and announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday.","Now, I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. We'd like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thank you. John, just a question for you. You've talked about the steps to reduce reported volatility including the changes to yen accounting and the VA captive. I think with the market moves this past quarter, below the line noise has re-emerged as a concern for some insurance investors. So are there any other initiatives you are contemplating to kind of further reduce some of the non-economic noise in PRU's results?","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So I think I'm going to suggest, Erik, that Rob take that question. Rob?","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, Erik, this is an ongoing initiative for us. When we look back over the last four, five, six years, we identified that the two primary sources of breakage for us between our reported GAAP results and the operating earnings that we share with you came from the FX remeasurement issue that you alluded to and then from our Annuities business. And so we have undertaken initiatives to solve for the, I'll say the 80% to 85% of the noise that's been created over the last couple of years. Within our Annuities business, we haven't finished, but we've gotten substantially there. So we are continuing to do some work in order to take out some of the remaining volatility, some of which you saw this quarter.","And then there's the remaining 15% to 20%, and yes we have identified initiatives there that we think may help to eliminate that. So, we care a lot about cash flow. We also recognize that GAAP matters to investors and it matters to the creation of book value growth, and so we continue to stay on that.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you. And then I think you have also recently made some pricing changes for both the PDI product and VAs and then some Individual Life products. With interest rates now moving somewhat higher, how do you think about the trade-off between higher new business margins and adjusting pricing to make the products more attractive to consumers and drive more sales?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Erik, it's Steve. I'll take that part of your question. We're always looking to strike the right balance between the factors that you mentioned. For example, our \u2013 this quarter's sales in Annuities reflected the fact that Mark spoke about. At the end of the third quarter, we had a trimming of the benefit in our PDI product, and that resulted from reduced sales throughout the quarter.","However, we have a highly distinctive capability, distinctive in the industry in our Annuities business to reprice both PDI and HDI as often as monthly, and so we do have the ability to respond to market developments and to act nimbly in our balancing of the factors you mentioned. In fact, on PDI, we already took a modest step in that direction at the very end of the year, increasing some of the payout rates. And as and when market conditions allow us to continue that path, we will do so. We're always looking to write business on a sustainable and profitable basis.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, everybody. I guess a broad question, but with the move higher in rates \u2013 and I realize we're sort of flat year-over-year, but certainly higher since the election. As you think about where \u2013 how much more do we need to go I guess globally to get to sort of a blended stability on your portfolio yield?","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, John, it's Rob. Let me take a stab at that. The way I would think about it is, I'd look at the comparison of our portfolio yield to new money rates and then use that as sort of a metric for \u2013 we want to get to the point where the roll-off in the portfolio is not creating further drag on the overall yield by virtue of where we can invest. In the U.S., our new money rates are around 3.5%. The portfolio roll-off in the course of the next couple years is going to be 4% to 4.25%, somewhere in that order of magnitude.","So we got about another, call it another 75 basis points of interest rate rise between a combination of underlying Treasuries and credit spreads in order to close the gap between where we're putting new investments on the books and where old investments are rolling off the books. If you look at the Japan portfolio, recognizing that that is a mix of both U.S. and yen liabilities, the portfolio yield there is around 3% and our new money rates are around 2.5%. So we've got a little over 50 basis points of negative yield there that we have to make up. That would come from a combination of both rising rates in the U.S. and rising rates in Japan.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's really helpful. Thank you. And then I guess my follow-up question is \u2013 and focusing on a couple of the below the line items, the impact from the divested businesses this quarter, would you characterize that impact running through net income as also largely non-economic? And if so, what drove that?","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so \u2013 yeah, we would think of that being entirely noneconomic. The divested businesses, the primary drivers are going to be two things. One, our Closed Block Business, and that is entirely non-economic in that the result of that business over time are passed through to the policy holders. So it has no economic impact to the shareholders of the company. The second item in there is our long-term care business, and what you saw in there was actually \u2013 from an operating standpoint, it's generating modest profits as you would expect, given when we wrote down the book. It's generating profits that from \u2013 from an underwriting standpoint and from the earnings that we get off our surplus that we have in that business.","But you have the \u2013 there are a certain number of derivatives that are managing \u2013 that are helping us to manage the portfolio there, because it's a very long liability and you've got a mark-to-market on those derivatives as interest rates rose. So the entire loss you saw within long-term care in fact is more than attributed to the mark on that derivative offsetting the modest level of profits we are otherwise getting out of it. So we would consider that to be non-economic therefore as well.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, with no corresponding mark on the liabilities.","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yes, sorry. Thanks, Mark.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, understood. And, I mean, I understand that there's some work going on at FASB around that. Is that your understanding as well? And if so, I mean, any guess on how long it takes to get to the point where we get a little bit closer to matching up the impact on the left versus the right side of the balance sheet?","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Well, FASB has a proposal out which would go in the right direction. So the initial proposal out by FASB would now include a mark-to-market concept on both the left and the right-hand side of the balance sheet, which I think would be helpful and as I said, a step in the right direction. The concern that we have is that the details matter on how you go about doing that. And so, you don't want to solve for that problem and then create other volatility and non-economic outcomes by virtue of getting the discount rates wrong that you're using on the asset side and the liability side. So there are a number of issues that we have with the FASB proposal, so we think it's generally headed in the right direction. We think it needs some fine-tuning in order to get it quite right so that \u2013 so in fact the new proposal is a net good as opposed to trading one level of noise for a different level of noise.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Karnath at Citigroup. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start with the ROE. Going back to the outlook call, where you took the guidance for the near-term down from 13% to 14% to 12% to 13%. I think you had said that the primary driver of that was rates, although there were some other factors. But I'm trying to reconcile that 100 basis point reduction in ROE guidance to the interest rate sensitivity that you show in the same deck where I think you said a 100 basis point increase or swing in ten-year Treasuries is only a $0.15 to $0.20, and that's a pretty modest impact on ROE. So I'm just trying to reconcile the two.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So let me take a stab at that, Suneet. The effect of interest rates is a compounding effect, and so when we first established our 13% to 14% outlook for ROE, it was a point in time where interest rates were about 100 basis \u2013 our outlook for interest rates were about a 100 basis points higher than they are today. We've had several years now of rates being below that expectation, and it's the compounding effect of that every year as the portfolio rolls and as we're putting on new business and making new investments, that leads \u2013 that created the drag on the ROE. And so, by contrast it will then, therefore, take us a couple of years of interest rates being back up at 100 basis points in order to build back to what we think is that longer term sustainable ROE of 13% to 14 %. Does that help?","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, that does. I just was wondering, is another factor in there this recurring premium products that you sell in Japan just given that rates have had such a big move to the downside in that country?","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Let me take one stab at that, and then if Charlie wants to add any commentary, he can. Obviously the impact on our returns are felt both in the U.S. and in Japan. So, yes, we are seeing lower rates in Japan across our products. So those products where we were more rate sensitive, we view the \u2013 done pricing adjustment or we've discontinued sales of that \u2013 of those products. I would note, however, that our returns in Japan are actually quite competitive, and so we have a very high ROE out of our Japan business, and therefore the compression that we felt with \u2013 as a result of lower rates in Japan, while it's had a negative impact, we still produce very attractive returns there. Charlie, I don't know if you wanted to elaborate on that.","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","No, I think you do \u2013 I guess the only thing I would \u2013 I'd kind of add two points to this. I think the real driver of our ROE is our business mix. And there are some factors, interest rates, et cetera, that have some effect over time, but you've seen us when we came out of the financial crisis articulating 13% to 14% and then exceeding that when we had the wind at our backs, but we also \u2013 we never raised that goal because we knew we were benefiting from tailwinds. We didn't want to chase returns, so we want to preserve our ability to invest in our business in ways that didn't always have an immediate positive effect on ROE.","We have continued to think exactly the same way, and if we find the interest rate environment is a sustainably more favorable one, our business mix is going to drive stronger outcomes. And in the meantime, actually our biggest focus around this also is relative performance. We think our business mix should drive superior performance in relationship to our peers, and that's been historically reflected and we would expect that would continue on from today.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful, John. Just second question, just a follow up I think on Erik Bass's line of questioning in terms of the below the line noise. Was there any impact from those items on your statutory performance in the quarter, or was it all GAAP?","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So the mark-to-market on derivatives will affect both GAAP and statutory. For us, that derivative impact was relatively modest. I'm talking about the portfolio management derivatives. The noise that got created as a result of the Annuities business, the non-economic component of the liability and the NPR that offsets that non-economic component are outside of our statutory construct. So our statutory construct isn't identical to, but largely mirrors the economic construct that we have put together from a GAAP standpoint. So that portion of the noise which dominated the delta between reported operating earnings and GAAP is entirely non-economic in both a GAAP and a statutory context.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. How big was that marked number that you just referenced that will affect stat?","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","The derivatives piece, I don't know that we have disclosed that, but it was not a particularly material number. Our net derivatives are relatively modest from a duration standpoint. The notional amount we have outstanding there has been substantially decreased over the course of the last several years. In fact, it's like half what it used to be a handful of years ago. We've been encouraging our portfolios as they do their ALM to increasingly utilize cash instruments over derivative instruments, so was not a particularly material impact.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question for Charlie. Can you talk about the potential impact to Japan sales ahead of and following the April discount rate reduction?","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure. So as you know, in July of last year, the standard valuation interest rate for the yen single premium whole life products decreased to 25 basis points, and we think potentially in April of this year, the discount rate for reserves for recurring premium product will decrease from 1% down to 25 basis points. Our view is that we have adapted in the past in terms of pricing and products and we'll continue to do so in the future. So, we don't anticipate a meaningful impact on our capital levels or solvency margins.","For example, we have already discontinued all our Japanese yen single premium whole life offerings through all our channels. We did that last year. And don't forget that this new change in discount rates will only apply to new business. So we should be able to manage the efforts of the new rules. It may involve some repricing of products as we go forward, but we'll take that as it comes.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And then somewhat related, have you seen any domestic competitors start to offer more U.S. dollar denominated products, or is it more isolated to the international competitors that operate in Japan?","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","We have seen \u2013 we have seen some \u2013 or we have heard a fair amount of talk about it, and we're beginning to see a little of it. But the way \u2013 where we have seen it has been primarily in the bank channel. So we think there will be more competition in the future, but let's \u2013 let's review the bank channel for a minute, because I think it's quite interesting. So for us, the bank channel is about \u2013 it's less than a quarter of what we sell. Obviously most of what we sell is through our tied agency systems with Life Planners and life plan consultants, and most of what we sell is death protection.","So two-thirds of what we sell is death protection. And where we're seeing the competition come in is not so much on the recurring premium product, especially recurring premium U.S. dollar product. We really haven't seen any competition from anyone there yet. We have seen a little bit on the single premium U.S. dollar product, and we have seen some on the recurring premium yen denominated dollar product. But \u2013 and we don't sell any more single premium yen denominated products. So we have seen some come in and will probably see a little bit more, but we also think we have a competitive advantage when it comes to selling death protection, either through the bank channel or through our tied agency system.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. First, just a follow-up question to Rob. I think you mentioned new money yields related to the Japan portfolio is running at around 2.5%. Is that \u2013 can you split that up between how much of your cash flows you're \u2013 being invested to back the U.S. dollar portfolio versus how much is being \u2013 is backing the yen portfolio? That just seems like a high number relative to at least yen cash flows.","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","It's a good question, Tom. I don't have those numbers off the top of my head, so it's something we'd have to follow up with you on. I think we do provide that. I just don't have it immediately at my fingertips.","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Let me just \u2013 let me throw out a couple of numbers. And so if you look at our whole portfolio, about 45% is JGBs, and then there's about another 25% that's probably Japanese corporates, and then you have \u2013 then you have U.S. product as well. So when you look at our overall portfolio, it's really high quality. So you have 45% that's JGBs, you have 85% that's fixed income, you have 97% of that is investment grade, and of the other 15%, it's really investment grade surrogates, right. So that's where you get some other U.S. dollar product; you get private placements, you get mortgages, you get other things. So in general, it's \u2013 one, it's a very high quality stable portfolio; and two, you have a fair proportion of U.S. dollar product in there. And that's what raises the yield.","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, well, Charlie bought me some time. I was able look up the \u2013 look up some numbers for you. So if you look at the total international portfolio, call it around a $175 billion, about $100 billion of that would be in yen products and about $75 billion of that would be in other currencies, primarily in U.S. and Aussie dollar.","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","But at the margin, more U.S. dollar business is coming in.","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. That's a good point.","Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","You heard the numbers I quoted on the mix of sales, and U.S. dollar sales are now the majority. So we've \u2013 you've got like \u2013 I think the non-yen denominated sales in the last quarter were over 60% of our sales, and so when you think about the incremental dollar flow it's going to be more heavily influenced by sales because we've got a fairly modest turnover in the existing portfolio, given the very long duration of those liabilities.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then how much of the yen cash flows that are coming in are you pivoting more into U.S. dollar investments, like \u2013 I don't need precise numbers, but are you \u2013 if you've been investing 20%, 50% of yen cash flows into U.S. dollar or non-yen type investments, or is it something much smaller than that?","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","We have a relatively small portfolio, Tom, that's invested in \u2013 where we have taken yen liabilities, invested in dollars, and then swapped back to yen, which I think is the strategy that you're talking about. The aggregate of that portfolio is about $5.5 billion. When we first started that, it was a very attractive trade. We were earning 2%, 2.25% in premium over what we could earn if we invested in Japan. Today, that's more like 1.5%. So we continue to selectively pursue it. But it's a \u2013 I think our CIO has referred to it as getting to be a little bit of a crowded trade. So we have some of that, but relatively modest.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then just final question. Rob, in response to, I think it was Eric Bass's question, you were talking about an effort to eliminate the below the line noise and strategies. Can you just expand a bit on that? Would it be significant altering of economics, or are we talking about accounting, legal entity type restructuring where you think you can actually optimize the accounting better without changing the underlying economics much?","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, Tom, we seek to do this without compromising on economics. I think what we did with FX remeasurement is a perfect example of that. What we did is we \u2013 we created a divisional structure within Japan in order to create three functional currencies which then allowed us to eliminate the FX remeasurement issue that was giving rise to \u2013 was occurring as a result of having a single yen denominated functional currency there. So when we look at eliminating that noise, what we're trying to do is look at uneconomic noise and pair that \u2013 and figure out \u2013 or uneconomic ways \u2013 non-economic ways of reducing that noise such that we don't impair the underlying fundamentals of \u2013 and economics of our business. And we think there are levers that allow us to do that.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Seth M. Weiss - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. A question on the Retirement and the Asset Management businesses. If you strip out what you consider trend adjustments, Retirement's quarterly run rate appears right around $260 million. There's a significant step-up than where you've been. You commented on some of the fund flow dynamics earlier in the call. Just curious if you could speak to what you think is a sustainable level of run rate quarterly earnings.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Seth, it's Steve. I'll address your question and talk about how we view trends in core earnings in both of those businesses. First of all, in both businesses, particularly in Retirement, earnings benefited from some items that aren't necessarily trendable as Mark addressed in his review of business results.","However, we have seen core progress in the Retirement business, I would say that that core progress very much reflects higher account values in both PRT and Full Service arising from a variety of factors: our sales, our flows, persistency of our business, and in some cases market appreciation. We have seen it reflecting a effective expense management over the course of the year, and we have seen \u2013 we have seen it reflect the benefit of portfolio rotation as we onboard PRT transactions.","And what I mean by that is, for example, as we onboard these transactions, we're taking in large amounts of public fixed income assets and we're able to rotate some of those to private fixed income, picking up some yield while still matching the liability very well and not increasing any risk.","In the Asset Management business, I would say our core growth in earnings reflects two very basic trends. One, obviously the strength of our flows; and, two, our ability to sustain our fee level on an average basis across the entire platform. Now, that's fairly distinctive, and it's encouraging to us in the sense that even while we're in a period where there's secular pressure on asset management fees, the strength and the diversity of our multi-manager structure and our ability to draw flows in some higher yielding parts of the business, higher fee basis parts of the business has on an average basis enabled us to hold our average fee levels pretty steady. So I would say we are encouraged by the trends in core earnings in both of these businesses. At the same time though, I would say that that progress is reflected in the guidance that we issued in December.","Seth M. Weiss - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. And on Asset Management you specifically commented on fee rate modifications for certain real estate funds. Does that have a notable improvement in the run rate?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","It's \u2013 it has a double digits impact over the \u2013 double digits of dollars over the course of the \u2013 over the full year.","Seth M. Weiss - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on Annuities. The flows deteriorated a fair amount and you highlighted the reasons why. If that continues, I'm guessing the capital strain will be lighter. Would be that be meaningful enough to add to your available capital? Any color on implications to capital would be helpful.","Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Nigel, it's Rob. I'll take a stab at that. As a result of \u2013 you know what? Let me actually \u2013 let me step back a little further. Because I think what this really relates to is the success we had with our restructuring of the Annuities business, and maybe it's worth just going through that real quickly and then it leads to sort of the results that I'll describe to you that will answer your question directly. So remember, we did four things when we undertook this restructuring of our Annuities business.","First, we took all of the operations that we had and we consolidated them into a more limited number of legal entities primarily, one being PALAC. Two, we eliminated the corporate underhedge. Three, we migrated toward a statutory construct that we think is more reflective of the long-term nature of the risks, and consistent with where the NAIC is going, consistent with our methodology for managing to the CTE 97 that we \u2013 through the cycle that we've historically had in place and consistent with our desire to have AA ratings. And then the fourth thing that we did is we used a combination of derivatives and financial assets to defease the liability, whereas before we were using primarily if not exclusively, derivatives.","The immediate results of that were that we have reduced our capital sensitivity to interest rate risk, which has resulted in a stable and higher level of free cash flow \u2013 getting to the question you're asking \u2013 that enables us to have more confidence around our ability to pay dividends and hence what you saw in the fourth quarter was a $1 billion dividend coming out of our Annuities business.","We think that going forward, we have \u2013 that is a high cash flow business, and when we have reduced the volatility around the business we have more comfort then in distributing that cash flow out to the parent company and ultimately making it part of our re-deployable capital. That was on top incidentally of, just to remind you, releasing about $1 billion as a result of the combination, $0.5 billion of which we distributed out to shareholders as a special authorization last year. We used the other $0.5 billion to reduce our debt and our leverage.","Incidentally, its also led to lower costs. So we have lower risk, lower costs. That's improved AOI coming out of the business as well. So that volatility reduction and capital release and increased earnings all facilitated by the efficiencies coming out of the restructuring, we think enables us to take advantage of what we believe are the very attractive economics in that business, which is high return, high cash flow. The introduction of stability then allows us to translate that into cash flows to the parent company, and as I said, ultimately to shareholders as well.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Nigel, this is Steve. I'd kind of amplify Rob's remarks and speak to your comment about \u2013 kind of implied in your question about how we see future sales. First of all \u2013 and I'd address it on a product basis. First of all, as I mentioned, our current products, we have the ability to be very nimble on how we keep those competitive. In terms of our forward-looking product plans, these really stem from our business strategy and not from any particular outcome one way or the other on the DOL rule.","Our product plans in 2017 and 2018 are simply a continuation of that strategy that's already been successful in 2015 and 2016. We look to operate broader range of solutions to client needs. For example, in the first half of this year we'll enhance our death benefit in a way that will make us more competitive in legacy planning. We're exploring new fixed index annuity solutions, and we're looking to develop and introduce a highly innovative and simplified income solution into the Group benefits market that will enable us to address a broader market segment. And again, all of these are grounded in our business strategy and aren't sensitive to outcomes one way or the other on the DOL fiduciary rule.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Cynthia, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. And that will be from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. I had a question around the U.S. dollar denominated product sales in Japan. How much room do you have to continue to grow that, or is kind of this roughly 60% of overall product sold where you want to be?","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","No, I don't think \u2013 I'll answer that in a couple of ways. The first is, I don't think we have a set goal as to where we want to be. And we try and \u2013 just as Steve articulated, in the U.S., we try to provide solutions to our clients, whatever they may be. And that may be in yen product, it may be in dollar product. And also, as Steve said in the very beginning, you look at a balance; you look at a balance between product mix, pricing, and what the consumer wants. So we don't have a goal per se. And the answer is different for the different companies we have there. So in the Life Planner, as an example, U.S. dollar sales increased from 38% this quarter from 27% a year ago. So there's a lot of room to move there.","In Gibraltar, we're a little bit higher. So overall, Gibraltar, the U.S. dollar sales are 67% versus 50% a year ago. In Life Consultants, they were 55% so there's room \u2013 there's certainly room there. The bank channel, we are higher; we sell mostly U.S. dollar product because we have eliminated the single premium yen denominated product. And so there isn't as much product on the yen side to sell, and that had to do with the profitability and frankly the efficacy of that product. So U.S. dollar product there was in the 80s; so not quite as much room to grow there, although a little bit.","And then in the IA channel, we're at about 50%, which is up from about 30% a year ago. So by giving you these numbers, you see a couple of things; one is our ability to pivot products, and two is the creation of new products because one of the reasons why we were able to sell more dollar denominated product is because we created some new products, especially on retirement income and some whole life products. So I think you'll see we have the ability to do more as we go forward through either product creation or just through the absolute percentages.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. And do you know what percentage \u2013 or do you have handy what percentage of your U.S. dollar denominated products are single premium?","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Oh, single premium? I don't offhand. I will tell you that overall in Japan, 86% of our product is recurring premium. Of the other 14%, 11% is the fixed annuities business, and the fixed annuities business is almost all U.S. dollar. So I would say \u2013 I'll give you those two percentages. We can get back to you with the actual percentage. But I'll leave it at that.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared remarks by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. ","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements.

","With that, I'll hand it over to Charlie.","Charles Lowrey","Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. While equity market movements affected our fourth quarter results, our fundamentals remained strong across our businesses, as did our earnings, adjusted for the notable items that Ken will address later. We feel good about our outlook for our business and our ability to continue building the momentum in our business by helping our customers with their financial needs, especially through turbulent times. And we're going to dive into this subject in a little more detail today. ","For the full year, 2018 marked another important chapter for Prudential as we continued to generate meaningful value for our customers and to grow our business in a sustainable way. As a result, we grew operating earnings and adjusted book value per share, produced a double-digit return on equity and returned more than $3 billion via dividends and share repurchases. We also maintained a solid balance sheet even amid the large equity market movements in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we are excited about the opportunities to create more value for our existing customers and forge relationships with new customers. Our market-leading businesses, complementary capabilities and global reach allow us to expand markets and grow in a way that few others can. ","At the highest level, we're bringing more financial opportunity to more customers. We accomplish this through our U.S. Financial Wellness businesses; PGIM, our asset management business; and our International business. We are also working with institutional clients and distributors around the world to help individuals adopt behaviors that enable financial security. By addressing evolving societal needs for financial advice, services and solutions, we seek a unique opportunity to reach new market segments across different income brackets, ages and other demographic groups and to deepen our relationships with existing customers. ","PGIM enables the success of our businesses through its investment capabilities, including proprietary private asset classes. This provides a competitive advantage for Prudential, which allows us to innovate new products and services, such as pension risk transfer, to support our customers. At the same time, PGIM benefits from continued growth in affiliate flows and assets under management, which supports its position as the top 10 global asset manager.","Our businesses have an established, trusted presence in more than 40 countries, engaging in relationships with approximately 50 million individuals. In addition to this wide reach, our businesses create earnings and capital diversification for our shareholders. ","Turning to Slide 3. I'll provide some additional financial highlights on the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter earnings declined from a year-ago period primarily due to equity market impacts. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased by 11% to $11.69. We generated an adjusted return on operating equity for the full year 2018 of 12.7%, at the high end of our near to intermediate target of 12% to 13%. And our book -- our adjusted book value per share grew by 8.3%. We deploy our capital in growing our business, repurchasing shares and paying dividends. And we achieved all of this while maintaining a robust capital position consistent with our AA standard. As we look to 2019, our share repurchase authorization is $2 billion, and we increased the quarterly dividend by 11%. ","This year's performance was supported by strong drivers across our businesses, including significant milestones. Within our U.S. Financial Wellness businesses, we achieved record account values in Institutional Investment products, supported by our pension risk transfer capabilities. We also had record full-service retirement sales. Within PGIM, we achieved our 16th consecutive year of positive institutional net flows. Within International, we reached a record level of Life Planners, our highly productive distributors of protection and retirement solutions. ","Maintaining this growth and executing on our strategy starts from within. We focus on culture and talent, enabled by technology, to achieve a meaningful purpose, which is a point I'd like to close with as we turn to Slide 4. ","There's a growing body of evidence that purpose-driven companies outperform their competition in recruiting and retaining top talent, in strengthening customer loyalty and in driving business performance, all of which are core elements of our strategy. At the start of this year, we unveiled a new purpose statement to our employees that reflects their collective feedback of our vision for the future, which is we make clients better by solving the financial challenges of a changing world. We recognize this is a bold and highly aspirational statement, but it reflects who we are and what we do through our U.S. Financial Wellness and global businesses. ","And to that effect, I'm proud to note that we continue to be recognized for our purpose-driven work. Prudential was, once again, ranked as #1 on Fortune Magazine's 2019 World's Most Admired Companies list for the fourth consecutive year in our sector, with high marks in areas such as innovation and people management. Additionally, as we noted last quarter, Prudential was named to Fortune's Global Change the World list, where we are the only company in our sector to be recognized. Finally, we were cited as one of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity by DiversityInc in 2018 for the 17th year in a row. These distinctions serve as a strong endorsement for the culture we cultivate at Prudential every single day and which we will continue to build on to drive shareholder value and make a positive contribution to society. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob, who will provide an update on how our businesses are executing on their key priorities. Rob?","Robert Falzon","Thank you, Charlie. I'll begin on Slide 5. Consistent with our aspiration to solve the financial challenges of our customers, which Charlie described, we are already advancing our purpose through our Financial Wellness initiative in the U.S. and through our needs-based selling approach in our International business. Our resiliency to the equity market fluctuations in the fourth quarter was the result of what we believe are the hallmarks of Prudential: thoughtful strategy and quality execution that build strong fundamentals and produce attractive financial outcomes. Our objective is to apply these strengths in ways that produce similar outcomes for our customers, who can benefit from our integrated solutions, market access and enduring financial strength. ","In the U.S., we do this through Financial Wellness. We engage with individuals and, in particular, the employees of our workplace clients to identify and solve their unique financial challenges through multiple channels and with simplified solutions. This also benefits our employer clients by enhancing the effectiveness and engagement of their employees. Our value proposition is resonating as we generate outcomes such as reduced financial stress, improved understanding and utilization of company benefit programs and increased productivity. ","As shown on Slide 6, U.S. Financial Wellness represents our Workplace and Individual Solutions businesses and produces a diversified source of earnings, including fees, net investment spread and underwriting income delivered through our Retirement, Group Insurance, Individual Annuities and Individual Life platforms. Workplace Solutions covers 20 million people, and Individual Solutions serves over 5 million people. The capabilities we have in this platform enable us to engage with our clients through a continuum of channels, including with third-party distributors, directly with our in-person or phone-based financial advisers and with our digital tools. Our goal is to meet individuals' needs where, how and when they want.","I'll highlight three of our key priorities for growth. First, we continue to develop solutions to address customers' financial needs. As an example, we recently launched emergency savings feature for our retirement plan clients. This solution allows individuals to access funds for short-term needs while maintaining their contributions toward their long-term goals. Second, as we continue to provide our Financial Wellness solutions to our existing workplace clients, these solutions are also contributing to new client acquisition efforts. Since the launch of our Financial Wellness capabilities in 2015, we have generated about $9 billion of full-service retirement plan sales and over $100 million in Group Insurance case wins that we can attribute to this initiative. Third, we are working to deepen individual relationships in the workplace. We activate these relationships through our Prudential Pathways program, our digital Financial Wellness platform and LINK by Prudential. ","Our Prudential Pathways program has been adopted by nearly 500 of our workplace clients. In this program, employees of our workplace clients can participate in work site financial seminars on a wide range of topics delivered by Prudential's financial advisers. Employees can also request a personal consultation, which has helped drive new retail clients for Prudential advisers. ","Our digital Financial Wellness platform has been adopted by over 3,000 clients, representing over 5 million individuals. This platform provides a digital venue to address a variety of individuals' needs, including education on financial wellness topics, assessment of financial needs and tools to take action.","We launched LINK by Prudential in the second half of 2018. Our workplace clients can make LINK available to their employees as part of our digital Financial Wellness platform. This is a highly personalized online experience that helps those employees customize financial goals; connect with advisers digitally or via phone; and obtain savings, investment, protection and income solutions. ","As we continue to help employers and individuals, we ultimately believe our solutions can significantly expand our addressable market and enhance our long-term growth potential.","Turning to Slide 7, which highlights our global asset management business, PGIM. PGIM continues to leverage its scale of over $1 trillion of assets under management via a distinctive, multi-manager model with broad asset class capabilities. 2018 marks the 16th consecutive year of positive institutional third-party net flows for PGIM. These positive net flows from third parties are in part driven by our strong long-term investment performance. I would specifically highlight the 5-year performance and note that 97% of the assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over that period.","In the current quarter, we experienced net third-party outflows of $3 billion, including a $9 billion fixed-income withdrawal by a single institutional client. This was a client-specific decision and was not based on our investment performance. We serve many of the world's largest pension funds and other institutional investors and, as a result, will experience large idiosyncratic flows from time to time. These flows are generally to the benefit of PGIM's AUM. ","Our third-party retail flows were affected by trends consistent with the industry during the quarter. Retail investors reduced credit exposure, held more cash and sold investments for tax purposes. Our total net inflows, including affiliate inflows, were positive $9 billion in the quarter. These flows included significant assets from pension risk transfer, where PGIM's origination and differentiated asset management capabilities provide a competitive advantage. The positive flows helped to keep PGIM's total assets under management fairly stable through the quarter despite the market decline and in contrast to significant declines experienced by other asset managers. Despite industry-wide fee compression, our overall asset management fee yield remained stable at 22 basis points as we continue to diversify our product suite into higher-yielding strategies. ","I'll highlight three other key priorities to grow PGIM's earnings. First, with respect to expanding our global footprint. As of year-end 2018, 29% of PGIM's assets under management were sourced from outside the U.S. We continue to grow organically, driven in part by our strong international private origination capabilities. In fact, PGIM had a record year for non-U.S. private credit originations. In addition, PGIM's European mutual fund platform has grown to include 28 funds, with assets under management in excess of $3 billion. ","Second, we have also made disciplined bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our global presence and complement our capabilities. For example, we recently announced the acquisition of a London-based quantitative investment manager that will expand our alternative investment solutions. The manager will have significantly greater growth potential by tapping into PGIM's global distribution network. ","Third, with respect to products, we launched our first actively managed, exchange-traded fund last year. And by year-end, the ETF platform has grown to 6 strategies across both equity and fixed income. In addition, we continue to grow our market-leading alternatives capabilities and have established a dedicated group in our leading private client franchise focused on mezzanine financing, energy finance and direct lending.","Now turning to Slide 8. Our International business includes our world-class Japanese life insurance operation as well as other businesses, including in high-growth markets with large populations such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and Africa. Our differentiated business models and proven ability to execute our strategy have led to steady growth, attractive returns and significant capital generation. In addition, we continue to make strategic investments in digital, mobile and data capabilities to enhance our long-term growth prospects. ","I will highlight a few operating metrics that reflect our strong fundamentals and continued growth during the fourth quarter. Life Planner sales, which were about half of total International sales in the current quarter, increased by 12% compared to the year-ago quarter. This was driven by higher U.S. dollar sales and the number of Life Planners in Japan increasing by 6% to a record level of 4,183. ","Gibraltar sales were lower than a year ago as growth in Life Consultant and independent agency sales were offset by a reduction in bank channel sales. Bank channel sales reflect our discipline on pricing and underwriting in response to a more competitive market. Life Consultant channel sales were 5% higher than the year-ago quarter, even as Life Consultant count was 4% lower, consistent with our continued focus on high-quality distribution. And independent agency channel sales increased by 10%, driven by an increase in U.S. dollar sales, including a new term life insurance product rolled out earlier in the year. ","In summary, our momentum remains positive across all of our businesses: U.S. Financial Wellness, PGIM and International. We have thoughtful strategies and quality execution that continue to build strong fundamentals as we serve our customers well. And we are monetizing those fundamentals to generate profitable growth at attractive returns.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.","Kenneth Tanji","Okay. Thanks, Rob. Slide 9 includes the notable items which had an impact on adjusted operating results in the current quarter. We highlight these items because they may not be indicative of future performance. There were 3 primary drivers of the notable items. First, the equity market movements resulted in a $109 million adjustment for the recognition of certain benefits and costs associated with variable annuities and variable life policies. In addition, non-coupon investment income and prepayment fees were about $140 million below our long-term expectations, driven primarily by hedge fund returns. Second, underwriting experience was generally in line with our average expectations, which highlights our complementary mortality and longevity profile, as presented on Page 22 in the appendix. And third, we recorded a provision of $30 million for legal matters. In total, these notable items reduced pretax earnings by $289 million or $0.54 per share. Excluding the notable items, earnings per share would be $2.98, up 14% from the year-ago quarter. And in thinking about quarterly earnings patterns, we -- please note that we've included a summary of seasonal items in the appendix.","Now turning to Slide 10. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. As Charlie noted, we returned more than $3 billion to shareholders during the year through dividends and share repurchases. And for 2019, we increased our share repurchase authorization by 33% to $2 billion, and yesterday, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. ","Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter. The sequential quarter increase of $300 million was driven by cash flows from our businesses that exceeded shareholder distributions. Shareholder distributions of $752 million in the quarter were roughly evenly split between dividends and share repurchases.","We also maintained a strong balance sheet. Our hedging programs were highly effective in mitigating the large equity movements in the quarter. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targeted levels, and our financial leverage ratio as of year-end 2018 remains better than our target. Also, as credit remains a topic of investor interest, we provided details of our high-quality CLO portfolio in the appendix. ","In summary and turning to Slide 11, our market-leading global businesses with complementary capabilities are providing integrated financial wellness solutions to more customers. For the year, we generated a strong adjusted operating return on equity, along with significant growth in adjusted operating earnings and book value per share and also delivered solid shares and net flows across our businesses. And we distributed more than $3 billion to shareholders and sustained a robust capital position with capital flexibility. ","Now I'll turn it to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Regarding PGIM's net outflows, I mean, the $9 billion outflow from single client, I was wondering if you can elaborate in terms of the reason for the redemption. Was it related to hedging costs for being foreign investors or maybe the client taking the investment in-house? I was just hoping if you can share a little bit more color. And then also, do you still have any more exposure to this particular client?","Stephen Pelletier","Humphrey, this is Steve. I will take your question. Thank you very much for it. I would say that the reason for this outflow was the client looking to consolidate managers, and that was really the main driving factor. It was not due to our performance, either on a relative or an absolute basis. So that's the story there. If you don't mind, even on a no-names basis, I don't think I'll talk too much about -- at the granular level, of our dealings with an individual client. I will just emphasize, Humphrey, that, as Charlie talked about, our PGIM business represents a top 10 global asset manager. In particular, I'd highlight that on the institutional front, we truly have a world-class client franchise. We do business with 23 of the largest 25 corporate U.S. pension plans. We do business with 8 of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies. We do business with over half of the 300 largest global pension funds. We're very proud of and grateful for that client franchise, but it also means that business gets done in large blocks. And on occasion, on rare occasion, on a quarterly basis, we may have more outflows than inflows due to something like this, a single large case. However, on an annual basis, as mentioned earlier, we have had 16 positive years of institutional net flows. And also, I'd like to point out that on the quarterly basis, despite that one large outflow of $9 billion, we almost thought institutional net flows to withdraw, which signifies that gross sales were actually very strong for the quarter. And that gives us confidence, as we begin 2019, in our ability to attract robust flows, both gross and net, and at a good and sustainable average fee level, as Rob mentioned in his comments.","Humphrey Lee","Understood. And I agree, the $8.5 billion of other net inflows definitely speak volume to your -- the demand for your product. My second question is related to the weak non-coupon investment income in the quarter. My understanding is that most of your hedge fund exposure has no reporting lag, and the underperformance in the fourth quarter was fully reflected in the numbers in the quarter, so that included the weaker December results. And then on that note, of the $140 million of below-plan non-coupon investment income, how much of that was related to hedge fund underperformance? And how should we think about the first quarter expectation? Like, obviously, private equity will be weaker, but I guess your hedge fund results could be an offset.","Robert Falzon","So, Humphrey, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So first, yes, our hedge funds are not lagged. So the full effect of the market performance in the fourth quarter is reflected in our hedge fund performance and, therefore, our overall alternatives performance. And if you look at the performance vis-a-vis our long-term expectations, the vast majority of that would be attributable to that hedge fund performance in the quarter. There were small pieces from other components, but I would say, again, the vast majority of it was related to the hedge funds. Hedge funds are about 25% or so of the overall alternatives portfolio, Humphrey. And if you look at the performance in the quarter, just helpful to put some context around that, the performance in the quarter for our hedge fund portfolio overall was down around 2.5%. I would compare that to the overall market being down 14%, both the S&P and the MSCI World Index. If you look over a little longer time frame, look at the full fiscal year, our hedge funds actually had positive performance for the year. They're up about 0.5% or so. And again, contrasting that to the S&P, which was down around 6% for the year, and the MSCI World Index, which was down over 10% for the year, I think it speaks to the diversification and quality of the hedge fund performance that we had and the portfolio that we've got. It's a well-diversified portfolio.","We're in about 40 or so different funds, and it's diversified by strategy and its sources of alpha, including things like the asset class, geography, sector and time horizons. Bigger picture, if you look at our alternatives performance, I think it's also helpful to keep in mind that, that performance, over a long period of time, has actually been quite strong. So if we go back to the inception of the program, which was back in the fourth quarter of 2012, and you look at that performance versus our long-term expectations, we've actually exceeded it by around $550 million or about 20% of the total returns over that period of time. So again, speaks to the discipline that we have around the management of that alternatives portfolio. With respect to the first quarter of 2019 and PEs, as you sort of specifically asked, most of our PE funds are lagged, and they are also about 25% of the overall alternatives portfolio. And our private equity or PE has some positive correlations with the market, but it's less direct than what you would see in the hedge funds because it's influenced by things like realizations. And there were a number of those in the fourth quarter. And also, a number of the private equity funds are mark-to-model versus mark-to-market, and you come up with different results as a result of that as well. ","So more broadly, if we look at the performance over the long term, we have the statistics that I mentioned before, and we think that that's the appropriate emphasis of this as opposed to kind of looking at a quarter-by-quarter kind of analysis. If I can just sort of head off a follow-on question, which I know is coming from -- either from you or from some caller or another, let me just sort of hit it because I think as you're talking about the outlook for the first quarter on alternatives, there's sort of the broader issue of the 2019 outlook versus the guidance that we've provided. As you know, we don't provide forward-looking statements in the context of guidance, but I can make some observations about our current conditions. First, fundamentals, as you heard in our opening remarks, for the fourth quarter are actually quite strong across our businesses, and they're demonstrating good momentum as we head into 2019. And adjusting for the impact of the December market decline, our fourth quarter financial results actually reflect that very strong performance. With respect to the markets, we've provided the assumptions that underlie our guidance in our guidance deck that we went through at the end of last year. And while the markets swooned in December, the current levels are actually pretty consistent with the assumptions that underlie the guidance that we provided. So I'll then leave you and others to draw your own conclusions from those observations, but I thought that, that might be helpful additional context.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Dally","Broader question on the investment portfolio. Can you discuss your views as to where we are within the credit cycle and what positioning you're looking at making? In light of escalating concern about a turn in the cycle, also in light of that, now just given the performance metric that you highlighted for your non-coupon, would it be fair to say that they're performing as you originally intended, and if so, you're not looking to change any of the allocation to hedge funds looking forward?","Robert Falzon","Nigel, it's Rob again. So let me take the second part of your question first, which is, yes, our performance is consistent with expectations given where we are in the cycle. And our discipline around that portfolio construction is consistent, and we're not looking to make any significant changes in that either with regard to sort of the ultimate size of the portfolio or the component parts of the portfolio and the relevant weightings that we have in there. Obviously, there's variability quarter to quarter or year to year, depending on drawdowns that we get, particularly from private equity and in real estate. But largely, no strategic changes in that. With respect to your first point in terms of the portfolio and positioning for the credit cycle, I'll start with 2 points.","One, portfolio is really well diversified, and we manage it within credit limit exposures for things like individual names, sectors, asset types and credit ratings. So a lot of discipline around making sure that the diversification goes deep into the portfolio. Second, the positioning of the portfolio for a downturn is actually not new for us. We started this over the last year or two. And as we've gotten further into the cycle, we've been further taking risk off the table. A couple of examples of that. First, we've been diversifying our corporate exposure, particularly in longer durations. So I think as we've noted multiple times in the past, we hold a larger-than-typical portfolio of government bonds. It's about 36% of the general account and almost half of our fixed maturities. We've been adding to munis in lieu of corporates. And we've been rotating out of bonds that have been at risk of credit migration ahead of the downgrades. And as we've also noted before, we're underweight in energy, finance and telecom, and we're overweight in consumer noncyclical utilities and transportation. We've also been selling our high-yield public exposure and shortening the duration of that portfolio. ","And where we've had appetite, we've been replacing it with privates, which now account for about 60% of our below-investment-grade portfolio and about 16% of our overall privates portfolio. Our history or experience with our privates in below investment grade and, actually, investment grade as well is that they have significantly lower defaults and higher recoveries. Combination of that leads to loss experience, which is substantially in excess of the benchmarks on a credit quality equivalent basis that we find in the public marketplace. In aggregate, our below-investment-grade portfolio is only about 4% of the general account. Our commercial mortgages are underweight multi-family and industrial -- I'm sorry, overweight at multi-family and industrial, and we've under-weighted the more cyclically sensitive property types like office and retail. And like our private placements, it's directly originated, so it's a very high-quality portfolio with structural protections built into it by virtue of that direct private origination. And as Ken noted in his opening remarks and you see in the exhibit to our deck, with regard to our structured investments and particularly CLOs, we are focused on the highest-quality tranches with significant structural enhancement in those investments. I think the broader point is that portfolio management is one of our core strengths.","The portfolio is defensively positioned, as I just articulated. It's managed the concentration limits that I spoke to. And we're also very discipline around ALM, asset-liability matching, which is sort of key to this as well. We've highlighted in the past different issues that have come up. So we talked about asset leverage during our guidance call, and we provided an exhibit on that. And what we showed is that, properly adjusted, our asset leverage is actually very comparable to our peers. And more importantly, our credit leverage is actually at the very low end of the range of our peers. In this deck, as I just noted, we've included something on CLOs. And you can see that our exposure is entirely comprised not just of NAIC 1 but of AAA tranches, so even more high-quality within the range of NAIC 1 that are well underwritten and benefit from significant subordination levels. And then, I guess, the thing that's come up more recently that we haven't actually spoken to, so I'll take the opportunity to do it, is we're seeing some research around credit impairment history. Our own experience on that has been well below our benchmarks. It's below what we've been embedding in our pricing. ","And all of that includes our experience with the financial crisis, including the experience that we and others went through with subprime. If we replicate our portfolio for the calculation that's being produced out there, and that calculation is looking at after-tax impairments and we've assumed that those impairments also include credit loss sales, and comparing that to average total investment assets for the period from, I think, the statistics that are out there from January of 2008 through September of 2018, our actual losses, excluding the Closed Block, are 0.73%, so 73 basis points in aggregate across that period. If we roll that forward to the end of the year, it only moves by 2 or 3 basis points. So again, I think what you would find is that's at the very low end of the performance of our peers -- or very high end from a performance standpoint, low end from a loss standpoint. None of this is to imply that we will be immune to a credit cycle, but we would expect, consistent with our historical experience through prior cycles, to weather it well. That's due to defensive posturing of the portfolio, as I've gone through, and the investment advantages we derive from PGIM that Charlie spoke about in his opening remarks, specifically its ability to directly originate privates, which are now 11% to the general account and actually almost 1\/3 of our corporates, and its ability to originate mortgages that I spoke to before as well as its strong track record of investment performance in publics. ","And that's evidenced by the size of our operation and by the 16 consecutive years of positive third-party institutional flows coming into it. And due to the broader financial strength we have, as in the last cycle, we would expect to have the flexibility to be opportunistic in taking advantage of the more attractive investment environment and the more attractive acquisition environment that typically accompanies those sorts of downturns. So with that, hopefully, I fully answered your question.","Nigel Dally","Absolutely. My second question was just on the escalation of the competition in the bank channel in Japan. Just wondering whether that's new entrants or is that existing players in the marketplace. Just a little more color as to what's going on there.","Scott Sleyster","This is Scott, Nigel. I would say a couple of things about that. No, I don't think it's necessarily new entrants to the market, but it is new product offerings that they may be bringing to market. In particular, a number of people have been bringing in single premium and recurring premium to that marketplace. I think, perhaps, on a broader basis, I should say -- or talk about our approach to the bank channel. Out of all the channels that we have in Japan, it really is the more opportunistic. Our core Life Planner and Life Consultant models are really needs-based selling channels. They very much focus on protection-based life insurance. When you move into the bank channel, that's traditionally the most competitive. Various participants will come in throughout the cycle with aggressive pricing for one reason or another for various objectives that they might be achieving. Our model, I think, is highly disciplined. We're traditionally still selling protection insurance. We've got a lot of pricing discipline. And as we stick to that, we would expect to see quarter-to-quarter volatility in that channel.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of John Nadel with UBS.","John Nadel","Just a question on pension risk transfer for the year. Could you just tell us what the net flows specifically for PRT were? I think you mentioned $16 billion gross sales.","Stephen Pelletier","John, this is Steve. Our annual runoff on PRT is consistent with what we've communicated before, which is about $4 billion total, $3 billion on the funded side and $1 billion on the longevity risk transfer side. So that gets you to the flows. I would say that in terms of looking at the year that we're in now, we still see a very, very robust pipeline. I'm sure that some people may be thinking that the market volatility in the fourth quarter and what that did to funding levels in the aggregate across all pension funds may have an impact. And I would just point out that while that observation about some pullback in funding levels in the aggregate is true, virtually all the companies in the visible pipeline, first of all, are fully funded and, second of all, have taken steps to hedge their risk and to mitigate any capital markets impact. So we still see a very robust pipeline. We are still very confident in our ability to transact within the pipeline. I think that's borne out by our fourth quarter experience, where we had very strong flows of $7.5 billion in PRT total, $5.5 billion funded and the others -- the other longevity risk transfer. And I would also say that we see an opportunity, given the strength and given the kind of configuration of the pipeline for this year's experience, to possibly be less backloaded than the past several years have been.","John Nadel","Okay. And then just a question for, I guess, Rob or Ken. Just specific to the fourth quarter results, could you just quantify for us how much was the seasonally higher expenses up relative to the average of the first 3 quarters? And then how much was offsetting that in the form of lower compensation-related expenses driven by your share price and the market decline? I think that runs through corporate.","Kenneth Tanji","Yes. John, it's Ken. We had given guidance that, typically, our fourth quarter expenses are seasonally higher and range from about $125 million to $175 million. And we thought they would come in at the high end of that range, and they did, and about half of that occurred in corporate. And then in terms of the impact of our compensation expense from our long-term and deferred comp plans that are either linked to our share price or other market indexes, that had a benefit of about $90 million in the quarter, and about $70 million of that was in corporate and other.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","I guess ahead of the statutory statement being filed, I wanted to get your perspective on what your target RBC ratio will be, I guess, going forward versus the historical 400% post tax reform.","Kenneth Tanji","Yes. So Ryan, it's Ken. We did adjust our RBC target, and we provided that with our guidance for 2019. Just a little bit of a reminder that with tax reform, we have a lower tax rate, and that improves our earnings today and in the future and strengthens the value of our deferred profits that reside in our reserves. So overall, the impact of tax reform is positive for us. It does lead to higher regulatory capital requirements. And so when we put that all together, our improved financial strength along with higher regulatory capital requirements, we did think an adjustment to our RBC ratio to 375% was -- made a lot of sense, and we've done that. And we would expect to -- and we'll file our statutory financials at the end of the month, and we would expect our RBC ratio for PICA to be above our objective.","Ryan Krueger","And then on PGIM, I don't know if you can give us any perspective on January flows, if you've seen a rebound relative to the fourth quarter.","Stephen Pelletier","Ryan, this is Steve. Without commenting on results in a given month, I would just say that we entered the year with a strong sense of confidence about our ability to continue to generate flows, as Rob touched upon. We operate across a range of asset classes: equity, public and private fixed income, real estate and mortgages and other sources of alternatives. So we feel -- and through our -- also, based on our strong investment performance, we feel very confident in our ability to generate flows this year.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Taylor Scott","The first one I had was just on the comments made earlier on the call around being well positioned for potential M&A opportunities. I mean, the holding company cash is quite strong. It sounds like you're probably above your RBC target, so that'll make sense. I'd just be interested on any color you'd have on what kind of M&A opportunities you'd be interested in. I mean, is it things that would target building out distribution and increasing volume growth? Would it be about expanding geographically further or maybe something with cost synergies? I mean, is it -- where would your focus be?","Charles Lowrey","Sure. This is Charlie. Let me take a step back, if I may, and just talk about the stages of development of the company. And this will put your question into perspective, and we'll answer it along the way. But I'd characterize our development over the course of the past 20 years as having kind of 4 stages. And the first is the elimination of the financial supermarket. And we spent a couple of decades clearing out the underbrush, if you will. And during that process, we sold about 40 businesses for about $10 billion, and we discontinued several others. And we still are critically examining our businesses. So in the past number of years, we've sold the wealth management services business, retail real estate, global commodities and, most recently, our insurance business in Poland. So we've honed our business lines down to 3 specific areas, right, protection, asset management and retirement. That's what we're focused on. Which brings us to the second stage, which is in each of those businesses, we wanted to build world-class businesses, right? So we focused on performance of each of those individual businesses and increased, over time, the ROE significantly of each business. We made about $16 billion of acquisitions to augment the businesses we had, both domestically and internationally. ","And we'll continue to look for acquisitions as we go forward to augment these three lines of businesses, whether that's internationally or domestically. We were also opportunistic in acquiring talent during this period, especially during the Great Recession, both in terms of individuals and lift-outs of teams, and we continue to do that as we go forward. So then the third stage is once we had developed those businesses and they were at scale, we considered the diversification benefits of an operation -- of operational efficiencies between the different businesses. This can be capital diversification, which there's a great deal. It can be mortality or longevity balance. And as Steve talked about, we have a very, very good pipeline of longevity business. We're glad to have our insurance businesses because that can balance the longevity, which allows us to do the PRT business we do. And then we focus on efficiencies such as shared services between the businesses that create better customer experience and also cost savings.","So we consider ideas that make us far more efficient in terms of operations and in terms of the use of capital by our businesses and the deployment of our capital to our stakeholders. And you've seen that through the increase in buybacks and dividend increases. And that really leads to the fourth stage. And that's the one we're in now, where we're fully integrating the entire business system to expand significantly our addressable market by completely focusing on our customer needs and reaching more of those customers through fully integrated workplace and digital channels. Hence, our focus on and increased discussion about financial wellness, which stems from our belief that we're uniquely positioned with our sets of complementary businesses to solve the changing needs of our clients as they consider insurance, savings and retirement. But to integrate the services we provide by combining elements from different businesses requires what I'd call real and selfless teamwork, which gets to the core of the success of this company, which is its culture. And it's our culture that enables us to work across businesses to provide relevant and timely solutions to our clients' most pressing financial needs and also to the communities in which we work, which is so -- which is such an important part of who we are, in other words, giving back. ","So it's this fourth stage that we're in and beginning to communicate to you about. And given that this is -- we're in this fourth stage, the kind of acquisitions we look at would be ones that would augment these 3 lines of business, either by bringing additional capabilities to those businesses or additional distribution over time. Internationally, you've seen us grow in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, higher-growth markets to balance off the -- our presence in Northern Asia. And in the U.S., you would see us continue to consider transactions that would either, again, increase distribution or increase our capabilities in certain areas related to the U.S. Financial Wellness program.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe how has the market volatility and the government shutdown changed the nature of conversations for your Workplace Solutions business over the last, call it, 6 weeks to a quarter?","Stephen Pelletier","John, it's Steve. I'll answer your question. We do not see a significant impact of market volatility and the government shutdown, as you mentioned, in the group benefits business. Our engagement with corporate clients on that front continues to be very much around the strength of our value proposition and, in particular, the Financial Wellness value proposition. On the Retirement side, the other part of Workplace Solutions, I would not say there's a -- there's been a particular impact either, except to say that for those companies that are well funded and that are well positioned from an ALM standpoint and hedging their risk as it relates to capital markets movements, those -- frankly, the movements are a reminder that the time to transact may be here and take risk off the table in terms of any further capital markets movements.","I would say that overall, though, the real engagement on the full-service Retirement front and on the Group Insurance front has been around the strength of our Financial Wellness proposition. Rob mentioned some of the numbers, $100 million of annualized group premium that stems directly from our Financial Wellness proposition and now $9 billion -- previously, the number we were citing to you last year was $6 billion. Now $9 billion of full-service sales directly attributed to the strength of that proposition. This is very much as we anticipated. As we developed this Financial Wellness strategy, we anticipated that the impact of it would -- in terms of our results would first be visible at the top of the funnel, if you will, at our work at the employer level with companies in their provision of retirement plans and benefit packages.","As we continue to develop the customer engagement funnel, we are seeing very, very strong levels of engagement with that value proposition. It's interesting. If you compare our experience, for example, to a lot of the start-ups that have entered the space, our customer engagement levels and our client acquisition costs are a fraction of some of those start-ups, and frankly, client acquisition costs are the issue that a lot of those start-ups run into. And the reason is that the people we're seeking to engage know that they're already doing business with Prudential. They're already part of a retirement plan or a group benefits plan that is administered by Prudential. So we're confident that the engagement levels that we're seeing will lead to greater revenues from our engagement with individuals and our providing them the solutions that address their financial needs. In fact, we're already seeing some flow of retail revenues. It's just the beginning of that process, but we're already somewhat ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point. So all in all, we're feeling very, very strong about the ability to advance the Financial Wellness proposition and to differentiate ourselves in the market based on that proposition.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Can you provide some more detail on your variable annuity hedging performance this quarter and, in particular, in December?","Kenneth Tanji","Yes. Erik, it's Ken. We were quite happy with our hedging programs, particularly in overall. They performed very well. Our variable annuity living benefit hedge program gained $3 billion in value during the quarter, most of that in December, with a hedge effectiveness of 98%. And we also have a capital hedge program that was also very effective at offsetting the overall increase in our net GAAP liabilities due to equity markets. And that's reported in our nonoperating earnings, and that gained over $600 million in value and more than offset the overall increase in our net GAAP liabilities due to equity markets. So we thought our hedge programs did a solid job at protecting our balance sheet and capital position, and we think it demonstrates the resilience of our financial profile amidst difficult markets.","Erik Bass","And you've highlighted the consistent cash flows from your annuity business, which, I think, for the year, were above 60% of operating earnings. As your sales growth picks up there, will that cash flow ratio come down? Or is the bigger impact the runoff of the older block of policies that you're seeing?","Kenneth Tanji","Yes. So our capital position in annuities is very solid. We've designed our hedging program and our capital framework to withstand market moves. And as I mentioned, the hedging program performed quite well. We hold capital in excess of our own standard and regulatory standards, and that enables cash flow to continue. You cited 60%. That would, I think, be more on a pretax basis. We think of it more on an after-tax basis, and it would be more like 80%, and it was $1.2 billion for the year. That's reflective of the solid fee stream that we have coming from that business that is both well hedged and well capitalized and profitable, and we find that attractive. If we are able to pick up sales in more profitable business and earn the returns that we've -- that we target, that we would think that would be a good use of capital, and we would deploy capital towards that.","Operator","And now for closing remarks, I'll turn it back over to Charlie Lowrey. Please go ahead.","Charles Lowrey","Thank you. Let me add just a few final thoughts.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead.","Darin Arita - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Tawny. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, Chairman and CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions.","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com.","Also as a reminder, we will be hosting our 2019 Financial Outlook call on December 6th at 11:00 a.m. Eastern. In the call, we plan to provide our 2019 EPS guidance range. We hope that you will be able to join us.","And with that I will hand it over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the continued momentum our businesses. During the quarter, we rolled out and expanded initiatives to deliver financial opportunity to more and more people around the world. We produced sustainable returns and strong business growth and maintained a solid capital position while distributing $755 million to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. In addition, we announced leadership succession plans that reflected a thoughtful, multi-year process by our board and our organization's emphasis on talent and culture. I'm confident that our next generation of leadership led by Charlie and Rob alongside our seasoned management team will continue our momentum for many years to come.","We also welcome the Financial Stability Oversight Council's decision earlier last month to rescind Prudential's designation as a systemically important financial institution. We believe this outcome reflects Prudential sustainable business model, capital strength, and comprehensive risk management framework, which have and continue to enable us to fulfill our promises to our customers to deliver consistent performance and to meet regulatory obligations.","Turning to slide 3. I will provide some additional financial highlights on the third quarter. We produced an annualized operating return on equity of 13.5%, above our near-to-intermediate term objective of 12% to 13%. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.15, up 5% from $3.01 last year, driven by business growth, tax reform, and capital management.","Net income was higher in the year-ago period, reflecting gains on derivatives. Our adjusted book value per share of $95.20 is up 12% over the prior year. This reflects the earnings we generated, as well as the impact of tax reform and accounting changes implemented at the start of 2018. These items were partially offset by the payment of $3.45 per share of common stock dividends totaling $1.1 billion and about $1.4 billion of share repurchases over the past year.","Our performance for the third quarter was driven by momentum across our businesses, which worked together to serve the needs of our individual customers, distribution partners, and institutional clients.","Here are a few highlights from the quarter. PGIM, which is our global investment management business continued to produce positive net flows, this time of $8.7 billion for the quarter. Our Retirement business had record account values of $447 billion, including net flows of 6 billion driven by our pension risk transfer and full service sales. Our Individual Annuities business produced sales of $2.2 billion, which were 69% higher than a year-ago quarter, and up 8% sequentially. And we also continued to generate steady growth across our International businesses.","Now turning to slide 4, I'd like to provide an update on Prudential's financial wellness initiatives, which are helping us build deeper relationships that address the changing financial needs of our customers. We're using technology to deliver the full breadth and depth of our collective businesses, so that we can enter new market segments and address an increasingly diverse range of customer needs and financial challenges.","One recent example is the launch of LINK by Prudential, an online experience that helps individuals visualize their financial goals. LINK connects individuals with solutions and financial professionals to help them with their unique goals from investment and retirement, to safeguarding the future of loved ones. One can access LINK via our Prudential.com website or through an employer where LINK is enabled through our digital financial wellness platform.","I'm pleased to note, our digital financial wellness platform available to new and existing workplace clients is growing rapidly. The platform enables individuals to engage in a wide range of financial topics, access multimedia content personalized for their needs, and utilize tools to better manage their financial lives. In addition, employers can better understand the financial wellbeing of their overall workforce.","Today, our digital wellness platform is used by approximately 1,300 organizations covering more than 1.7 million employees. Our goal is to deploy this by early next year to more than 2,500 organizations covering more than 4 million individuals.","And our customers aren't the only ones taking notice. We were honored to be included in Fortune magazine's 2018 Change the World list, which highlights companies making a positive social impact through their core business strategies.","And we continue to build upon our leadership position and commitment to financial wellness through the launch of programs like our State of US brand campaign. This campaign, informed by individual stories and intended to highlight the financial issues faced by everyday Americans, is currently airing across broadcast, social media and other channels.","To summarize, we are very excited about what our businesses can collectively deliver to make a meaningful difference in people's financial lives, helping them achieve their fullest potential, as we unlock new opportunities to grow our business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide an update on how our businesses are executing on key priorities. Mark?","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. Before I touch on strategic and tactical highlights in individual businesses, I want to step up to the higher level of strategy, execution, fundamentals and financial results.","I've often commented that as a company overall and in a number of our individual businesses, we're a great story around the way these things have come together to drive successful business initiatives. And sometimes, they come together in individual businesses or business-by-business, focused on specific things. And we've highlighted there, for example, success in Japan, success in pension risk transfer, the strategy execution and fundamental story in PGIM, all of which play out very well for us.","We're also now emphasizing strategies that leverage and exploit our whole franchise value. And this adds the dimension of cross-business collaborative and unique strategies and unique execution opportunities for us.","So in that context, thinking about strategy, execution and fundamentals, we're pursuing compelling objectives. And I want to highlight four things that run through many of the aspects of the individual businesses that I'll touch on in a minute.","First of all, we're enhancing how we help customers meet their needs. Remember Bring Your Challenges. The language of the company is solutions and outcomes. That's how we talk about our products now. We're focused on new distribution, making it easier for us to access clients and for clients to access us. Headlines there include the wellness platform and the digital initiatives. And we're growing in our existing distribution channels.","Secondly, we're implementing process efficiencies that positively impact clients and their experiences with us. The results reflecting these two aspects of strategy and execution include good growth momentum, as evidenced by sales and flows over time across all of our businesses.","But completing the story, profitable growth at attractive returns, reflecting financial and risk discipline and thoughtful pricing strategies.","So as I go through the individual businesses, think about the way they tie back to meeting client needs, to improving processes and to building growth momentum, as we translate strategy into execution.","I'll start now with PGIM, and this is beginning with slide 5 in the deck. The PGIM strategy is defined by meeting client needs as a strategic partner and across a broad range of asset classes and investment vehicles. And now engagement and dialogue with clients and partners have never been stronger.","It's an interesting time though. Interest rates are higher, equity markets are more volatile, and there is a positive return on cash. And so we would anticipate that this environment will have an impact on client decisions. And the way in which they think about things may result in more variability in the flows that we see. But with the underpinning of very successful execution in the context of thoughtful strategy, we're maintaining very strong business momentum in PGIM.","On slide 5, I want to highlight a couple of things. Under Key Priorities, strong investment performance, ultimately in a way, drives everything. And I want to highlight the five-year performance of AUM versus benchmark. And note that 90% of the assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over five years.","Shifting to the lower left picture, that investment performance fundamental translates in a nearly linear way into the very strong flows that we realize. And this is the fundamental that we talk about all the time. We had a very strong quarter for Institutional flows. We had record International flows. And we've commented before on 15 consecutive years of positive flows in Institutional businesses and 13 consecutive years of positive flows in Retail businesses.","Just to touch on a couple of the other key priorities to grow earnings: With respect to expanding our global footprint, as I just mentioned, we had a record International flows in the quarter. We also have a record percent of our sales and investment professionals outside the U.S. in PGIM now.","With respect to products, we now have two active fixed income ETFs; launching the second one just about as I speak, and we have established a new alternatives group that will focus on mezzanine finance and direct lending. So, the elements that execute in the context of strategy and strong fundamentals remain very much in place with respect to PGIM.","Let me turn to Retirement now on the next page. And I really just want to highlight the two bottom charts. We are emphasizing flows in Full Service on the right-hand side. Year-to-date $26 billion of sales and deposits in Full Service across a good mix of clients, between large clients and core clients and that's translated into $6 billion of net flows year-to-date in Full Service.","We're also doing very well in PRT on the Institutional Investment side. In the quarter, $5 billion were funded with reinsurance PRT transactions and we announced another $1.6 billion transaction shortly after the quarter ended and we have a very strong and good pipeline in pension risk transfer as we've mentioned often on these calls.","As I bridge from Retirement to Group, let me highlight again the importance of the wellness opportunity, but specifically as it relates to these two businesses, wellness amplifies our opportunities; it strengthens our sponsor relationships and it provides a meaningful retail potential for us through our Institutional channels. And so as we move into a couple of comments on Group, the first comment, deepening employer and participant relationships with financial wellness programs remains the centerpiece of a lot of what's going on in Group and we've talked about proof points there demonstrating success.","I do want to add, with respect to process efficiencies and making us easier to do business with, that in Group we did launch additional digital capabilities in Disability and these digital capabilities enhance and improve our claim submission and management results.","Let me turn to Individual Annuities. Two quick highlights here. The first is another dividend; and you see in the bottom right-hand chart, $285 million in the quarter. We have been highlighting free cash flow and attractive returns; that continues to be visible as we pay dividends from our Annuity Business. And then I also want to comment on the increase in sales. John mentioned it. The editorial on this is that sales in Annuities are broader and deeper, reflecting growth in different products, diversification of products and also strength in our traditional channels.","Before I leave Individual Annuities, just one additional comment, which is, remember, the wellness opportunity for secure retirement income. The Individual Annuity business, as are all of our businesses, has a role in our wellness initiative and the opportunity to put secure retirement income products on our wellness platform is something that we think is very important for us.","Let me move to Individual Life on Page 9. And I want to highlight two things here. I spent some time in the last call discussing a streamlined underwriting process that facilitates binding policies in as fast as 48 hours, and during the quarter we rolled that streamlined underwriting process out to third parties; again, a substantial process improvement for us and something that we believe is a material benefit to our partners and our direct distributors in our Individual Life business.","On the product side, during the quarter we re-launched and improved VUL Protector product in September, continuing our emphasis on matching the right products with the right opportunities and channels. And so we are optimistic about product enhancements as well as process enhancements in Individual Life.","Let me turn to Life Planner and Gibraltar. But before I do, I want to briefly recap messages from our Tokyo Investor Day. We emphasized in our International businesses differentiated business models with superior execution. And you should think of that as distinctive sales capability that drives high return protection solutions in the market for us.","We also talked about sustained growth with strong returns and steady capital generation. And you should be thinking there that part of that growth opportunity is meeting evolving client needs. And then finally, we talked about strategic investments that enhance our long-term prospects.","And so those are the themes that run over both Life Planner and Gibraltar, and so I'm going to highlight a couple of more tactical aspects of where we are there. With respect to Life Planner, very good quarter for sales. Life Planner sales were up 11%. Sales in Prudential of Japan were up 17% and the Life Planner count in Japan and in Brazil has grown to an all-time record level. We had LP growth of about 5% in Japan. So, great dynamics there and I guess I'd emphasize the term we often use in International, which is that the vital signs look absolutely terrific.","Turning to Gibraltar. I want to touch on the three distribution channels here because we have different things going on in each. With respect to the bank channel, our sales were down and this reflects the chronic discipline that we impose with respect to both pricing and product and the fact that we don't chase this market when it's moving in a direction in which we don't want to go. We will see declines in our product sales and so we've seen it recently in the bank channel.","On the other hand, the Independent Agency Channel is up about 9% and we are strategically expanding in the Independent Agency Channel and so that's a gratifying result for us.","And then with respect to Life Consultants, we have been imposing higher standards, and so the emphasis on quality and productivity does result in a decrease in our Life Consultant count. We are down about 4%, but again on the gratifying side, Life Consultant sales are just about flat. So, different stories reflecting the way in which we are approaching different channels in Gibraltar, but overall a very good, consistent strategic and execution story with respect to what's happening in Gibraltar.","And I will stop there and hand it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. I'll begin on slide 12 by highlighting the notable items which have impacted the current quarter adjusted operating results. As we introduced last quarter, in addition to the impact on results from the quarterly updated estimate of Individual Annuities profitability driven by market performance, notable items include the impact attributable to variances from our expectations for selected revenues and expenses. We highlight these latter items because while their contributions to the current quarter results are economic, they may not be indicative of future performance.","The current quarter unfavorable impact of the market and experience unlockings in the Annuities business was $36 million. The current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $35 million below our long-term expectations. And the current quarter underwriting experience was approximately $65 million better than our average expectations, primarily driven by more favorable mortality experience in Individual Life, reflecting lower than expected large case claims. As an aside, while less favorable than our average expectations, our Retirement business continued to demonstrate positive case experience in the quarter.","In total, these notable items reduced pre-tax earnings by about $6 million or $0.01 per share. Excluding notable items, earnings per share would be $3.16, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.","And speaking about our earnings pattern, I would also note that we have historically experienced higher than average expenses in the fourth quarter. This includes the impact of seasonal items such as annual policyholder communications, employee onboarding and severance, as well as business development, advertising and other variable costs.","Looking back over the past three years, this pattern has produced expenses on average about $125 million to $175 million higher in the fourth quarter than the average quarterly level for the respective year. In addition, we have completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings in our International business for 2019, and our hedging rate for the next year will be 105 yen per U.S. dollar as compared to the $111 for 2018.","Turning to slide 13. I'll provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures.","Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $5.2 billion at the end of the quarter. The sequential quarter increase of about $500 million was driven by proceeds from our $1.6 billion of junior subordinated notes issue this quarter, partially offset by senior debt maturities of about $700 million and a capital contribution to PICA to address the impacts of the Tax Act as we discussed on previous calls.","I would also note that we have established a targeted operating range of cash and liquid assets at the parent company of $3 billion to $5 billion with the low end of the range equal to approximately two times our annual fixed charges.","Cash inflows from the businesses during the quarter supported the $755 million of shareholder distributions, which were roughly evenly split between dividends of $380 million and share repurchases of $375 million. And our share repurchases authorization for the remainder of the year is $375 million as of September 30th.","Our domestic and international regulatory capital ratios are above our AA financial strength targeted levels. Further, we do not expect material impacts to target capital levels from the proposed Variable Annuities statutory framework that has been adopted by the NAIC Variable Annuities Issues Working Group. And finally, our financial leverage and total leverage ratios remain within our targets as of the end of the third quarter.","In summary, during the quarter we generated a strong return on adjusted operating equity, double-digit growth in adjusted book value per share and solid sales and net flows across our businesses while maintaining a robust capital position.","Our complementary mix of businesses with leading market positions and integrated solutions for customers are executing on our strategies and producing attractive returns for our stakeholders.","Now we'll turn it over to the operator for questions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. If I look at your year-to-date run rate EPS and adjust for tax reform, the growth has been on the high end of the 6% to 11% guidance range that you gave last year and your ROE has been above the 12% to 13%. Can you help us think about if there \u2013 have there been any major, I guess themes that would have impacted results this year that you wouldn't think would be sustainable going forward? 1Or is that a reasonable way to think about the kind of growth and ROE power of the company at this point?","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, Ryan, I think when we think about our ROE, the guidance that we gave was that in the intermediate term we would continue to expect that to be in the 12% to 13% range, given that we have gone through a fairly long period of sustained low interest rates.","Obviously, interest rates have been moving up. And we've had very favorable equity markets. And the combination of those, plus very strong fundamental performance out of our businesses has resulted in our return on equity being \u2013 operating at a range that is at the very high end of that guidance that we provided.","At this point in time, given where we are in the cycle, that's probably to be expected. And we talk about that 12% to 13% as being a return over a cycle.","Over time, we're seeing that the headwinds associated with sustained low interest rates are abating. And we continue to see good fundamental performance in our businesses. So over a longer period of time we would expect that to allow us to sort of return to that more normal long term range of 13% to 14%. But at this point in time, we're not ready to modify that guidance.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then on PRT, you had pretty good activity in the quarter. You've already announced one deal in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how the pipeline and the outlook looks there?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Ryan, it's, Steve. I'll take that question. I think the pipeline looks very, very robust. Frankly, it looks as robust or even more so than we've seen in recent years.","I think that's a combination of a couple of factors. First of all, the increase in interest rates and what that means in terms of higher funding levels for defined benefit pensions, means that more and more companies are in a position to transact. And propensity to transact continues to be powered by a growing awareness on the part of these companies of the longevity risk inherent in their plans.","So the combination of those two things makes the pipeline look very, very strong. And we also feel very good about our ability to compete in the context of this pipeline. I say that in particular, because we have visibility on a strong pipeline in the large case market, call it $1 billion plus or minus and above, in which we are particularly well-suited to compete due to the capabilities that we built in the business around ability to bring transactions, to bring large transactions swiftly to an effective close. And the ability to onboard large numbers of participants and give them the type of customer experience that their plan sponsors expect and that the participants deserve.","So again, strong pipeline, and we feel good about our position to compete in it.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Do you tend to see a desire by corporations to get things done before year end?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","There does tend to be a tendency that we've seen for the third and the fourth quarters to be particularly strong in pension risk transfer activity. That's been the case for the past few years now.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I had a couple \u2013 a few questions just on the International business. First, could you give some color on, your other country sales I think were flat. So which countries are you doing well in? And where might \u2013 have sales been weak? And then I have a couple more.","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure, Jimmy, it's Charlie. Sales in Brazil continue to go up. As Mark said, we have a record Life Planner count and so \u2013 and they have a high degree of productivity there. And so we see sales going up there.","Sales in Korea and Taiwan were flat as we continue with our back to the basics strategy. And the number of Life Planners have been decreasing. Interestingly, and one really good thing that's happening in Korea, is that we have shifted a number of Life Planners, in fact a significant number of Life Planners, over to be sales managers. And as you've seen in Japan when we have done that in Prudential of Japan, our Life Planner business there, what happens is, you have about a year lag, but then you start increasing the number of Life Planners. And so I think our transition of Life Planners to sales managers in Korea bodes well for sales in the future.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then do you expect an impact on your Japanese business from sort of the expected increase in the consumption tax in 2019?","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Not as much. So much of the business we do isn't affected by the consumption tax. Some of it is in, say, the bank channel, but a lot of it is not.","The consumption tax has to do with both where the business is done and also the size of the business. And so it may have a marginal impact. But when the consumption tax went up a number of years ago, we didn't see a significant effect from it.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just lastly, I think you mentioned that Life Planner expenses were lower because of either timing of costs or other things. Can you quantify roughly how much that was?","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Not really. What happened in the POJ was there were a number of, let's call it, dominoes that all fell in the right direction. And this was throughout actually the businesses in Japan. So it happened with Gibraltar too.","And that was some of the businesses just had sort of ones and twos fall on our direction. And then we had some expense timing things, which will probably fall into the fourth quarter. So we're not going to give you a number. But there were both those factors that led to what we would say an elevated income level this quarter.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks, good morning. So, on the annuity space, somewhat surprising to see the core earning sequentially decline, given the strength of equity markets that you saw last quarter. So, hoping you can provide some color on what drove that and what we should expect for the return on assets, how we should expect that to trend.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Nigel, it's Steve. I'll take your questions. Thanks very much. This quarter's ROA of 118 basis points reflects a couple of things that we'd mentioned. First of all, why we didn't call them out in our release or anything like that, we did have some one-time costs associated with the systems migration. That reflected about two basis points.","Second, we also had higher variable selling costs which were included in that ROA calculation and that comes with the higher sales that we saw in the business in the quarter. That again, reflected for about another two basis points.","So, if you build those things into the equation, we still see an ROA in the Annuities business that is very consistent with the guidance that we have given before of 120 basis point range give or take.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful, thanks. Second question is just on losing the SIFI designation. I know you saw group supervisor in New Jersey but are there going to be some expense saves that you are likely to realize from losing that designation?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Nigel, it's Rob. So what we've expressed before and I think still holds is that as we \u2013 if you look last year, our enhanced supervision costs were about $120 million for the full year. As we think about the \u2013 no longer being a SIFI, our expectation is that about a third of those costs go away very rapidly and almost instantaneously, which is a combination of the fees that we are paying for Fed supervision and some consulting expenses that we would no longer need to incur. About a third of those costs are associated with projects that were in the process of completing and so they will sunset or go away in the course of sort of 12 months to 18 months; and then the remaining third probably represent ongoing costs of group supervision that we expect to incur both in response to the group supervision in New Jersey as well as the engagement that we have on an international basis as well.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Nigel, this is Steve. I'd like to jump back in and just expand a bit on the question you asked about Annuities ROA; because in my response to that I mentioned the variable selling costs. And I think I'd like to put overall expense profile of the U.S. businesses year-over-year into context. In the overnight calls a few different people inquired about the increases in expenses in the U.S. businesses and I think the numbers that you were looking at very much included those variable selling costs. We look at our operating expenses exclusive of those costs, because those costs naturally go up and down with our sales levels and in a robust sales quarter, which we hope to continue, they were elevated this quarter.","Year-over-year, the operating expenses in the U.S. businesses exclusive of variable selling costs were up 3%. That 3% includes normal inflationary adjustments. It also includes substantial investments that we are making in the current and future growth of our businesses and growth of their earnings.","You're going to hear more about these investments in our guidance call next month, but suffice it to say for right now, we already see these investments paying off. I just call out a couple of examples. In PGIM, the investments we made in our distribution capabilities and in our product range have continued to drive flows and profitability in the business; and in Group Insurance the investments we made for example in disability claims management has been a big part of the earnings progress of that business.","We also are making significant investments in our financial wellness value proposition and advancing that into the marketplace. And we're continuing to see a favorable impact, especially at the employer level. Since we embarked on this, call it a year-and-a-half plus ago, the financial wellness initiative has accounted for about $100 million in group premiums, which we consider to be an early indication of the success of this. But, like I say, these investments are already included in that 3% growth. The reason we're able to make these types of investments and still show very \u2013 a moderate and well-controlled expense growth is that we continue to \u2013 as Mark mentioned in his comments, we continue to find opportunities to create cost effectiveness and cost savings in the kind of call it, business as usual platforms for our businesses. It's not been our usual practice to make big announcements about finding these cost savings and to call them out with major cost \u2013 with major charges taken in association. This is part of our DNA; this is what we do year in, year out; quarter in, quarter out. And so again, we're able to make significant investments while showing well-controlled expense growth.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning everybody. I have two questions on PGIM. The first is, if we think about the base asset management fees, it looks like that's trending very nicely and sort of in line with your expectations. Other revenues are maybe \u2013 what we used to think of as the incentive and transaction sort of revenues, were pretty low this quarter, frankly lowest we have seen in several years. I'm just curious whether that's more of a function of a mix shift where we ought to expect that that contribution is going to be lower on a go forward basis or is there just timing issue here?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","John, it's Steve. I'll address that question. We don't really think in terms of the run rate on the other related revenue because of the inherent variability of it. We have observed \u2013 just to be helpful, we have observed in the recent past that the mathematical average of that over the past few years has been right around the $50 million range, but I think we've also been careful to caution against looking at that as a run rate. What drove the lower number this quarter was a couple of things. Lower agency production, which is again going to be inherently variable quarter-to-quarter, but where we continue to see solid growth year in year out in our agency production. And the second is strategic investing. Strategic investing for us is very much associated with the extension of our product design and the launch of new product and the investment of seed money in those products. This quarter we put some seed money and did some strategic investing in some global and emerging market strategies, and emerging markets had a tough quarter. So that is just kind of associated with the extension of the product design.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Understood, that's helpful. And then just a bit broader question but \u2013 obviously PGIM runs a general account. I'm just wondering what the investment side of the house is thinking in terms of where we are in the credit cycle, how close to a turn and what if anything you're doing with the general account, maybe reposition to get a bit more defensive as we get later and later in the cycle.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So John, it's Rob. Let me take a whack at that. So first, we look at credit management investing as one of our core strengths. We have a very strong investment portfolio. We carefully manage that to concentration limits and we're really disciplined about ALM; it is one of the core strengths of the organization and I think as \u2013 you've seen the manifestation of that in how we perform cycle in and cycle out.","Our standard portfolio frankly is more defensive than you will find if you look at the industry benchmarks. We hold a larger-than-typical portfolio of government bonds, driven in part by our business in Japan, but it's in excess of a third of the portfolio in the general account and in excess of 40%, 45% of the \u2013 of our fixed maturities are actually in U.S. or JGBs or other government bonds. The below investment grade portion of our portfolio is only around 4%; and within that some 60% to two-thirds of that is actually in private placements which is of a significantly higher caliber than what you're going to find if you look at below investment grade publicly traded securities. We are underweight energy, finance and telecom; and by contrast we overweight things like consumer noncyclical utilities and transportation. And then when you look at the mortgages that we hold, the real estate portfolio, we are overweight in multifamily and industrial and we are underweight in office and retail; and so that would play itself well to, if you sort of think about how cycles play out.","So we don't really manage the portfolio up and down in anticipation of the cycle. We do, do things on the margin obviously and \u2013 but if you look at how the portfolio was managed sort of throughout the cycle, what you would find is, it is conservative vis-\u00e0-vis our peers. Two other things I'd probably want to throw on to that to think about, John. We leverage PGIM. So, PGIM is one of the ten largest global investment managers with a real franchise in fixed income and our general account benefits by that both in terms of their overall expertise and then very specifically with regard to their ability to generate private placements and privately originated commercial mortgages for the portfolio.","These are much higher quality than we find, again in the public marketplaces or that might be agented and underwritten by brokers. And those securities have a really attractive risk return profile that's associated with them. And all of that produces \u2013 if you look at our Kenya loss experience, what you're going to find is, it's below our benchmarks, it's below what we embedded in our pricing and all of that includes having gone through the financial crisis when you sort of look at those statistics.","The second thing I want to mention \u2013 since you brought the topic up, if you don't mind is that I've seen a number of research reports that try to look at credit exposure for us and others in the industry by looking at kind of a leverage ratio, looking at the assets on the balance sheet as contrasted or measured against the equity on the balance sheet.","And I think that's an interesting and potentially helpful way to look at exposure to credit, but ought to be sort of more nuanced ones than what I've seen to-date. And particularly, when I look at our ratio on that, on a superficial basis we would look to be on the higher end of our peers, but when you look at it on sort of the actual underlying credit leverage that we have, we're actually at the very low end of the peer group. And there is a couple things that are particularly noteworthy there that drive that. The first is, we have $80 billion of general account assets where we actually don't bear the credit exposure; it's passed through to the participating policies, like for instance our closed block which is some $60 billion of that in assets. And incidentally, when you look at the leverage ratio on a GAAP basis that actually has negative GAAP equity to the tune of about $1.7 billion.","So, it throws those ratios off when you include something like that. As I mentioned before, we hold a significantly larger than typical portfolio of government bonds in around a third or so of the general account. So, our credit leverage, when you pull out both the \u2013 when you adjust for the government holdings and you adjust for the participating assets, the participating liabilities that we have is significantly lower. And then, there are some other adjustments that sort of feed into that, that are worth thinking about as well, like our foreign exchange re-measurement adjustment that we make when we calculate our return on equity. That's about $2.5 billion of incremental equity that is temporarily hung up in AOCI and really belongs in retained earnings. And we have very little goodwill; so when we look at those measures, our goodwill is like $850 million on the balance sheet.","So probably adjusted, when you think about our credit leverage ratio using the construct that I've seeing in a number of reports. what you would see is that we are very, very low on that ratio, reflecting all the conservative management of the portfolio that I was articulating in the first part to your question.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Point very well taken, thank you. If I can sneak one last in; I'm sorry. Just \u2013 Steve, you had mentioned that expenses were a bit higher maybe to the tune of something like two basis points to four basis points on the ROA and annuity. Charlie, I know you don't necessarily want to talk about the ones and twos in International overall, but is it fair for us to think about the lower level of expense in International being largely offset by the higher in Annuities?","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","I'm looking at Steve with that one because I'd...","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","I guess that's how it works out kind of mathematically, John, but I don't see \u2013 we don't see any particular correlation between the two.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","No, no, no, I'm not looking for \u2013 I'm not saying there is a correlation.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Okay.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","I'm just wondering if they're roughly similar, that's all.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, well, that's another way of getting at the question that was asked before, which is, how big is the number in International? So we're not really giving out a number. We're just saying that there were some expenses that were probably deferred to the fourth quarter. And then there were some good guys that fell our way. And those were in the $1 million here, $2 million there, $3 million there, but they added up to a material number.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, John, its Rob. Let me just add one last comment onto that is \u2013 and I think it perhaps is what you are getting at. As we look at the quarter holistically, there were puts and takes. And so \u2013 and that's what you're articulating.","And so when we look that result on an overall basis, what you're seeing is the benefit of having a diversified portfolio of businesses that are all high quality in and of themselves. But at any given point in time may produce results that are above or below what we would normally expect or see in a given quarter.","And what you saw in this quarter is, International outperformed and some of our domestic businesses underperformed for the very specific reasons that we mentioned. And those things offset. So when we look at the holistic results for the quarter, we think you can look at that as representative of the totality of our businesses.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. A few questions on capital. If I look at your year-to-date capital return measured against your AOI, I think you're tracking less than the 65% sort of free cash flow guidance. So any reason why maybe you're below that? And is there the potential to maybe accelerate buybacks, drawing down some of the holding company cash, which is at the high-end of your $3 billion to $5 billion range?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Suneet, it's Rob. So as we've articulated, and you've floated this, we think that about 65% of our operating earnings do translate into free cash flow. We've typically thought about redeploying that. And we redeploy it in a combination of dividends, so typically without being mathematical about it, within a range. We think about half that working its way back in the form of dividends to shareholders. And the other half of it we think about as redeploying either in the form of returns to shareholders, or we have the opportunity to deploy it into investments, which can grow our businesses inorganically.","And so as we think about that, there is no reason to believe that our philosophy in that has changed at all. The mathematics of that can vary in any given quarter or within the year or for the year. But we have a very disciplined approach and a very thoughtful approach.","And as we look at establishing our expectations for buybacks in a given year and our dividend policy in a given year, we refer back to \u2013 just the way you articulated it. And we've got 65% and that's available to either return to shareholders or to redeploy otherwise or to grow growth on behalf of \u2013 grow earnings on behalf of shareholder returns as well.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then I guess my follow-up question. If I think about Lincoln's earnings call from last week, they brought up this idea of kind of using some of the legacy blocks in reinsurance transactions, bring capital to \u2013 even do more on the share repurchase side.","Just given where your valuation is, and it's reasonably similar to where Lincoln's is, is that something that you guys have in the tool kit around capital. I really haven't heard you guys talk about that much.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Suneet, Rob again. So, yeah, we are always reviewing opportunities to optimize capital management. And we're engaging with market participants to understand the range of opportunities that might be out there.","I would note with respect to the specific Lincoln example that we generally have very well underwritten books. And we are not a distressed seller. And so any transaction would need to be economically compelling to us in light of what we think are the highly attractive economics associated with the portfolio that we've got. But I'll end with where I started, which is we are absolutely always reviewing those opportunities and seeking to optimize our capital management.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then if I could just sneak one more in on a related topic. Just on Long-Term Care. I mean we've heard on different calls that private equity is kind of sniffing around Long-Term Care blocks. Are you guys hearing anything in that regard with respect to your block?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","I wouldn't change the answer that I gave you to the prior question, Suneet, which is Long-Term Care would be included in that evaluation that we do in the things that we evaluate.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, thank you. Your group margins continue to be favorable relative to your guidance at the beginning of the year. And I think this has been a consistent trend we've seen across the industry and others have talked about expecting this to continue near-term. So I guess as you look at your experience, is there any reason to think that you couldn't continue to turn the \u2013 kind of the favorable end of your guidance range?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Erik, this is Steve. I'll address your question. I think you're quite right in observing that we've been at the positive end of the range, the low end of the range or below. And that's for certain kind of fundamental reasons that we've spoken about, including well underwritten business and effective claims management.","We do think that these trends that we've created in the business are for solid fundamental reasons and that that bodes well for their sustainability. We're not prepared right now to offer any change in the guidance we've previously given. But you're quite right in noting where we are and in the fact that favorable positioning is driven by fundamentals.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you. And then maybe if I could ask a bigger picture question just around your M&A interest. I'm curious if there's any change in your areas of focus, I guess particularly given the wellness initiatives and your belief in the ability to cross-sell and leverage employee relationships. Does this change your level of interest in Group or Retirement businesses or other platforms that would bring on kind of more employer-employee relationships?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Erik, this is Steve again. We are quite interested in various opportunities as they may arise. We feel very good about our ability to kind of build the customer engagement funnel that we have in our financial wellness offering. Obviously the top of that funnel starts with the employer business \u2013 businesses as you mentioned of Group and Full Service Retirement and we're very alert to opportunities as they exist in addition to the organic growth that we've been able to sustain and in fact accelerate in various of our lines of business as witnessed by our strong Group sales earlier in the year and our strong Full Service sales throughout this year, including in particular this quarter.","As we assess those opportunities, we will very much look at them in the context of the lifetime value of the customer because we feel we have built a capability to engage with customers throughout that engagement funnel in ways that will enable us to offer solutions to those customers that help them achieve their financial objectives and help us achieve that lifetime value.","Having said that we will continue our longstanding approach of being a disciplined acquirer. And as we previously noted, some of the Group transactions that have taken place in the marketplace have taken place at multiples that let's just say have been highly elevated. But that's not to say that we don't continue to look for those opportunities, even as we continue to build momentum in our organic ability to expand that top of the funnel.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, first question I have is just a follow-up on the Annuities ROA. I think in the past you guys have talked about a 115 basis points sort of long-term ROA target. Could you talk about, are you seeing any of the drivers that would drive you down towards the 115 basis points from sort of the 120s plus that you have seen previously? I mean, are hedging costs ticking up and is there any offset from interest rates that might allow that long term target to be higher?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, Alex, its Rob. Let me take part of that and then I'll turn it over to Steve to talk about sort of the longer term trends and specifically around the hedging piece of it. So, let just sort of provide a little bit of a backdrop and then talk about hedging costs specifically. But if you look at our hedge effectiveness during the course of the quarter, it was 97% effectiveness; and then if you roll that forward and look at the month of October, given there was significantly higher volatility in October, we were still in excess of 90% hedge effectiveness. So, on a year-to-date basis through the end of October we actually had 99% hedge effectiveness.","When we talk about hedge effectiveness, that includes the cost of hedging in that effectiveness and that cost of hedging is included in the AOI results that you're seeing in the current quarter and prior quarters. So there has been \u2013 when you look year-over-year, we called out in our release the increase in hedging costs; but that was really just \u2013 that wasn't sequential, that was year-over-year, because when you look at the third quarter of last year, that was before we put into place the refinements in the hedging strategy that we introduced in the fourth quarter which allowed us to sort of reduce the level of variability and outcomes, given the very high economic results that we are getting out of the Annuities business by adjusting the equity hedges that we had in the portfolio. So, that was in place both in last quarter and this quarter; it just wasn't in place a year ago.","So when we look at the hedging costs, there isn't a bias toward that producing pressure on our ROAs on a go forward basis. The cost we're incurring from hedging are within a range of our expectations. So with that let me turn it over to Steve to sort of talk about longer-term prospects.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Alex, I spoke earlier about a couple of specific costs that are affecting this quarter's ROA. In addition to that as we previously pointed out, there was one factor that will produce very, very gradually over a multi-year period some pressure on the ROA, and that is the emergence of more of our business \u2013 the maturation of more of our business and its emergence into lower fee tiers. This is a very common pricing practice in the Annuities industry that the fee tiers lower some time at or after the end of the surrender charge period.","And the facts are simple: we wrote a lot of highly profitable business in Annuities in the 2009, 2010, 2011 years when equity markets were suppressed and it was a good time to take on this risk. We were writing that business even as many participants in the market were pulling way back. So we do have a meaningful amount of business now emerging beyond the surrender charge period and into these lower fee tiers. But the emergence of that impact I will emphasize again is very, very gradual and occurs over a multi-year period.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Full Service. Can you quantify at all like how much of the positive flow experience and volume growth you've been getting is from sort of the initiatives that you've been undertaking with LINK in expanding your platform?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Alex, Steve again. We feel that over the past several quarters, as we've advanced the financial wellness value proposition into the marketplace that that financial wellness offering has been accountable for, let me call it some $5 billion of our Full Service sales. So a healthy contribution to our momentum in the business.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to John Strangfeld for closing remarks.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you very much. I'd just like to bring this back and close it with a few final thoughts. It's been a privilege to lead our company over the last 11 years and parenthetically 44 earnings calls during which we've significantly evolved and grown our business and delivered innovative solutions to our customers. And I'd like to personally thank all of our employees for their dedication and support as they are at the cornerstone of the company's success; success in delivering value to our customers, our community, and our stakeholders.","And I'd also like to recognize the extraordinary partnership I have had enjoyed with Mark over the last 11 years, which is highly productive, personally enriching and an incredible and unforgettable example of the power of partnership, one that's based on mutual respect, complementary skills, and trust.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead.","Darin Arita","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Steve Pelletier, Head of U.S. Businesses; along with Andy Sullivan, our next Head of U.S. Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.","We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures.","For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com.","I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie.","Charlie Lowrey","Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on this call. Yesterday we reported third quarter earnings per share of $3.22. We also reported a year-to-date ROE of 13%. I\u2019ll begin by discussing our progress in executing our financial wellness strategy.","We are committed to delivering a broader set of financial wellness solutions to more people in new ways, leveraging our scale across multiple distribution channels and drawing on our expertise, including product development and asset management. During the quarter, we took steps to expand our digital distribution capabilities through the announced acquisition of Assurance IQ, a fee-based and capital-light growth engine. Assurance is a leading direct-to-consumer platform for financial wellness solutions that enables us to serve a different demographic segment, including the mass and middle markets. Over time, we believe we can expand these capabilities internationally.","The Assurance acquisition, which closed in October, also provides attractive financial benefits and significant upside potential. Assurance shares our purpose of solving the financial challenges of a changing world, which is at the core of who we are. In that vein, I\u2019m pleased to note that Fortune has named Prudential to its prestigious Change the World list for a second consecutive year.","We also made progress in the quarter towards our margin expansion goals by evolving and transforming the way we do business across the organization. Along these lines, we launched a voluntary separation program in October for segments of our U.S. workforce. These efforts are intended to better position us to meet the needs of our customers while driving greater speed and efficiency. Finally, we continue to advance our efforts to reduce the impact of market fluctuations and add transparency to our quarterly financial performance. As a result, beginning in the fourth quarter, our corporate and other results will be less affected by changes in the equity market and our own stock price.","Looking ahead, we are taking a very disciplined approach to pricing to help offset the impact of rates on new business profitability, which will have an obvious effect on some of our sales. We are encouraged by our progress and are moving quickly and with conviction, to implement the plans we have set forward to deliver meaningful solutions and long-term value to our customers and shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter. Rob?","Rob Falzon","Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an update on how we\u2019re executing on our strategy to leverage our multi-channel distribution product and asset management expertise, and scale to deliver financial opportunity to a wider demographic within our U.S. Financial Wellness, PGIM and International businesses.","As shown on Slide 4, U.S. Financial Wellness currently represents our workplace and individual solutions divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from these investment spread and underwriting income. Beginning in the fourth quarter, it will also include fee-based earnings from the Assurance business, earnings which are not correlated to equity markets, interest rates or credit. We continue to execute our strategy to expand our addressable market.","Our Financial Wellness proposition is resonating with our workplace customers and with the employees of those customers, driving higher participation rates in the employer benefit programs and increased engagement with our advice platform. The number of people who have activated our digital financial wellness platform has increased to 9 million as of September 30. This platform provides a digital venue to address a variety of needs, including education on financial wellness topics and assessment of financial health.","We\u2019re also growing individual relationships and expect to provide additional solutions to the employees of our workplace customers as well as other retail customers. One way we deliver these solutions is through LINK by Prudential, which is our highly interactive personalized online resource that enables people to create a path toward achieving their financial goals. Earlier this year we began to deploy LINK on our workplace platform and we have already made it available to roughly 2.3 million people. We are on track to meet our goal of 2.5 million people by the end of the year.","And notably, with the October closing of our acquisition of Assurance, we have significantly expanded our addressable market with approximately 19 million individuals, who are actively seeking insurance solutions. Assurance\u2019s direct-to-consumer platform and end-to-end engagement model, which includes over 3000 agents, enables us to serve more people along the socioeconomic spectrum. In addition, this platform will enable us to expand our range of available solutions for our workplace customers by adding third-party provided health and property and casualty insurance as well as Medicare coverage.","We\u2019re also making progress streamlining our operations to increase agility while driving efficiencies and enhancing the customer experience. We\u2019re on track to achieve $50 million in run rate margin expansion by the end of 2019, and expect this to increase to $500 million by the end of 2022. This is being accomplished through a number of programs that we have underway. In the current quarter, we incurred about $20 million of implementation costs to support these programs.","Shifting to a discussion of third quarter trends and the underlying fundamentals of our businesses, I\u2019ll start with flows in the U.S. Financial Wellness this quarter, focusing on our retirement and annuities businesses. Our retirement business had net outflows of $2.7 billion driven by a single large client lapse in our full service business. This was partially offset by strong sales in the quarter as the market continues to be active, including episodic large client activity.","The Institutional Investments business had net inflows of $600 million, including $3.6 billion of longevity risk transfer transactions. Year-to-date we have closed $17 billion of longevity reinsurance transactions and we have a strong pipeline. This elevated deal activity is driven by our strong competitive positioning and innovation as well as by UK pension funds de-risking ahead of Brexit. While we did not close any funded PRT transactions in the third quarter and recent declines in interest rates have impacted the funding levels of these plans, the fourth quarter has started well and we have a solid pipeline of pending transactions.","Our annuities business experienced $1.1 billion of net outflows driven by normal account withdrawals as well as by elevated lapses as certain contracts move out of the surrender period. We expect this elevated level of lapses to persist through 2020. This was partially offset by an increase in sales including the impact of launching our proved secure fixed indexed annuity last year and expanding into the IMO channel this quarter. However, we expect the current low interest rate environment to continue to pressure sales.","Turning to Slide 5, our strategy in PGIM, our asset management business is to combine our multi-manager model with global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value added strategies that serves investors globally. PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager with $1.3 billion of assets under management. It ranks as the fifth largest investor in fixed income and the third largest investor in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms.","As the investment engine of Prudential, it benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. financial wellness and International Insurance businesses. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers, both retail and institutional. And our businesses, in turn, provide a differentiated source of growth for PGIM through affiliated AUM flows that complement its successful third-party track record of performance and growth, generated $800 million of net third-party flows during the third quarter. Our third-party net retail flows were $3 billion. Strong investment performance in our growing ETFs and UCITS platforms and record mutual fund sales delivered solid fixed income flows, partially offset by equity outflows.","And our third-party institutional outflows were $2.2 billion, mainly driven by a single institutional fixed income client withdrawal of $2.9 billion due to manager consolidation. We serve many of the world\u2019s largest Institutional investors and as a result, will experience large idiosyncratic inflows and outflows from time-to-time. Our asset management fees benefited from record assets under management due to market appreciation and continued robust fixed income flows.","Strong investment performance and expertise across a broad range of asset classes has allowed us to continue to attract flows into higher-return strategies. Approximately 80% or more of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last three, five and 10 year periods. We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investments, expanding in retail and international markets. Our multi-manager model, strong track record of private originations and demonstrated investment performance, as well as the investments we were making in our distribution capabilities, will position us to generate positive flows over time and to grow our earnings even absent the Wells Fargo fee arrangement which ends this year.","Turning to Slide 6. Our international business includes our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as other operations in high-growth margins like Brazil. Our Life Planner strategy is to grow our high quality distribution with a focus on needs-based sales. Emerging markets we look to combine Prudential strengths with global expertise to serve customers in a non-traditional way.","Life Planner sales, which are about half of the total International sales in the current quarter, increased by 8% compared to the year-ago quarter. This was driven by record Life Planner account and higher U.S. dollar sales in Japan as well as by continued growth in our Brazil operations. Sales for Gibraltar, which represents the other half of International, were 11% lower than a year ago. This primarily reflects lower single pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our Life Consultants channel as we continue to focus on recurring pay Protection products.","In addition, the recent decline in U.S. interest rates resulted in lower crediting rates, which also affected sales of U.S. dollar-denominated products. We also experienced lower production in our independent agency channel and lower bank channel sales due to continued heightened competitive conditions. We\u2019ll continue to innovate new products and consider pricing actions while focusing on maintaining our target level of profitability to improve sales over time.","Summary, in order to generate profitable growth and attractive returns, we\u2019re expanding our distribution of product solutions, leveraging our asset management expertise and focused on engaging more deeply with our customers.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken.","Ken Tanji","Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 7, which provides additional insight into our fourth quarter earnings relative to our third quarter results. We begin with our third quarter pretax adjusted operating income, which was $1.7 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.22 on an after tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items. First, we adjust a variable investment income to a normalized level, which is worth at $65 million. Second, the fourth quarter will include seasonal expenses and implementation costs related to the acceleration of our financial wellness strategy. We expect this will lower results in the fourth quarter by approximately $280 million resulting in an expected loss in the corporate and other segment of $475 million to $500 million inclusive of the cost of our financial wellness initiatives.","There will also be additional costs in the fourth quarter related to the voluntary separation program that Charlie mentioned. This is all part of the $600 million to $700 million of implementation costs to accelerate our financial wellness strategy as we discussed on Investor Day. Third, there are other considerations that we expect will result \u2013 will increase results by approximately $25 million on a net basis in the fourth quarter, and fourth, we anticipate a $10 million reduction in the quarterly net investment income from portfolio reinvestment. Assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the third quarter.","Absent a change in interest rates, the $00.2 per share for one quarter would compound $0.30 per share over the five quarter period ending December, 2020. This assumes a 7% annual turnover on $370 billion fixed income portfolio with new money yields 65 basis points below disposition yields on average. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.50 per share for the fourth quarter, before including the impact of future share purchases, business growth and market impacts.","This baseline includes a few items that puts it below our typical earnings level. First, we have seasonal expenses in the fourth quarter. We expect those expenses to be similar to prior years at about $125 million to $175 million. Second, we expect about $95 million of financial wellness implementation costs in the fourth quarter. And third, we expect $55 million of higher typical expenses \u2013 higher than typical expenses in Life Planner. These three items total about $0.58 per share and explained elevated level expense expected in the fourth quarter baseline.","While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect fourth quarter earnings per share. A few additional items to note. First, we issued 5.5 million shares in the fourth quarter for the assurance acquisition. Second, as Charlie mentioned in his remarks, we have taken further action to reduce fluctuation of quarterly earnings by reducing the impact of movement in Prudential\u2019s stock and equity \u2013 in the equity markets on long-term deferred compensation expenses.","Also on Slide 17, we have provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. We hope that you continue to find our new disclosures including our baseline earnings per share information helpful in understanding the earnings power of our businesses. We have indicated over the past few years, we are considering alternatives to how we approach guidance with the new disclosures now in place and provided on a regular basis. We have decided not to provide annual EPS guidance or host an outlook call in December. We believe our enhanced disclosures and processes provide insightful information on a more frequent basis.","Turning to Slide 8. I\u2019ll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders during the current quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization for the remainder of the year is $500 million as of September 30. And over the last five years, we\u2019ve increased our dividend per share by 16% per year on average. Our current quarterly dividend of $1 represents a 4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continued to maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength target levels and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target.","Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company was $6.2 billion at the end of the quarter and that was above our top end of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. As shown on the slide, we\u2019ve provided a pro forma of the highly liquid asset balance that reflects the amount that funded the acquisition of Assurance in early October and brings the balance within our target range. We will look to continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders.","Turning to Slide 9 and in summary, we are accelerating our strategy and positioning our businesses to deliver long-term growth. We remain on track to achieve $50 million in run rate margin expansion by the end of 2019 and $500 million by the end of 2022. We\u2019ve generated a record high adjusted book value per share and continue to generate strong cash flows that support consistent growth in dividends and other distributions to shareholders, and we maintain a robust capital and liquidity position with financial flexibility.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Hey, good morning. So first question I had is on variable annuities. And I guess, we\u2019re seeing the ROA, it really starting to come down. And I just wanted to see if you could dimension for us, what\u2019s impacting that? Is it sort of the spread you\u2019re making on the riders? Is it just the fee levels coming down? I think previously you talked about 115 bps or 116 bps or so, we\u2019re already below that. I mean, should we expect a significantly lower long-term sort of trendable level at this point?","Ken Tanji","Yes. Hey, this is Ken, I\u2019ll take that. First, our variable annuity business continues to be very profitable and that\u2019s, although, it\u2019s a bit lower, it\u2019s still has a high ROA and a strong ROE. We\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we\u2019d expect the ROA to trend over, over time as policies both move into lower fee tiers and as we continue to diversify our product mix to solutions with less equity market sensitivity. So that continues to play out.","And while the ROA is a general \u2013 generally a good benchmark for profitability, it will adjust when markets move significantly. And interest rates have declined pretty significantly in 2019 down by about \u2013 over 100 basis points year-to-date. So while the decline in rates increases the account value, it affects earnings by the combination of higher benefit ratios and higher DAC amortization. So despite the decline in rates, again, the business continues to be very profitable and generating quarterly cash flow, we still like the profitability albeit at a lower ROA.","Alex Scott","Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up question is I guess more broadly on expenses. There\u2019s some acceleration in Life Planner, a little bit more next quarter. You\u2019ve got the digital expenses going on. But I guess you\u2019ve also got Assurance IQ coming on, which I think there were some synergies with some of the things you\u2019re doing on digital capabilities. So just wondering if you could provide more detailed thoughts on how much you\u2019d be looking to spend over the next year or so. And what of offset there is from Assurance coming online? And if we have any more like big accelerations like there was in Life Planner for other segments, like once you get past whatever you\u2019re focusing on in Life Planner?","Charlie Lowrey","Let me just \u2013 this is Charlie. Let me start in and then others can join in. So we said with Assurance that there would be a certain amount of expense synergies. I think we said $25 million to $50 million next year and then additional after that. So you can expect those to come in over time. Those are separate and distinct from some of the other expenditures that we\u2019re making or some of the other savings we\u2019re seeing in the margin improvements.","Ken Tanji","And then the other area for the quarter was International, where we did see a shift of some expenses and a higher level of expenses in the quarter.","Alex Scott","And so, is that really onetime or are you going through any kind of process, where you might be assessing needs for other segments that are outside of the digital initiative that\u2019s in corporate?","Scott Sleyster","Hi, Alex. This is Scott. I think, Darin, gave some guidance on what will be recurring and non-recurring, but there\u2019s a couple of big things going on. First of all to the specific quarters, as I mentioned before, we see evolving regulatory oversight and we\u2019re trying to put the infrastructure in place to continue to be at industry best practices. And some of that\u2019s rolling out actually not just in Japan, but around the world.","As I mentioned at Investor Day, we also have been following some of the technology upgrades and the digital upgrades that occurred in the U.S. We kind of follow what worked well and we\u2019re rolling some of those out across the Board. And then this quarter, we actually had some additional litigation and other reserves. And finally, some things we\u2019re doing on process improvement and automation.","So, I would say it really falls into those two big buckets. We were playing a bit of catch-up on the \u2013 improving regulatory best practices. And then we had some significant initiative rollouts that we were doing in International, that I would say lag the U.S. by about a year. We\u2019re most of the way through that. And so I think if you look at the adjustments, we have, call it, $55 million in accelerated additional spending in the fourth quarter that will disappear as we hit our run rate going into 2020. I think we would say that\u2019s largely our new baseline.","Alex Scott","Got it. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you.","Ken Tanji","And I\u2019ll just add for the quarter, keep in mind, corporate was lower and there was sort of a couple of pieces there. We had lower long-term compensation expense related to the change in our share price. That as we mentioned will no longer occur going forward as we\u2019ve modified our long-term compensation program to no longer need to have that stock price flowing through our expense. And then corporate expenses were also a little bit lower. So if you look at corporate and international, they were somewhat offsetting.","Alex Scott","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. So you\u2019ve talked about the outlook for EPS in the fourth quarter, but it sounds like that includes a number of one-off expenses in addition to the normal seasonal impacts. So it\u2019s not, I guess, a real reflection of your earnings power. Therefore, can you help us think about a more reasonable earnings baseline for 2020? And is it really adding back the $0.54 of items, so thinking of something in kind of the low $3 range before buybacks and growth?","Ken Tanji","Yes. Hi, Erik, it\u2019s Ken. There\u2019s actually a number of ways that you can think about this and look at this. So I\u2019ll first \u2013 I\u2019ll start with the baseline that we gave at the end of the second quarter going into third quarter, which was about $3. So that was sort of where we thought in the middle of the year our earnings power was. The third quarter results came in at $3.22 and that was a little bit above that because we had favorable variable investment income and a favorable underwriting expense across our businesses. And as I mentioned in our last comments, the expense is kind of offset between corporate and other international. So if you adjusted that, you\u2019ve got to a number that was a little better than $3.","Now, in the fourth quarter baseline, you do have a number of items, like I said in my opening remarks that make it a little bit below our typical earnings level. The first is our seasonal expenses that nothing unique going on this year, typical to what we see in the fourth quarter. We have the Financial Wellness implementation costs, again, very consistent with what we articulated at Investor Day. And then third, we have an expectation of little higher expenses in our international businesses. If you put those items altogether and you adjusted for that, you\u2019d be back at earnings level a little bit over $3. So I think that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about our earnings power over those timeframes.","Rob Falzon","Erik, it\u2019s Rob. Let me just sort of pick up on that, sort of looking ahead off that baseline. Ken mentioned in his commentary that we do have interest rate sensitivity going forward and we\u2019ve given some guidance on that. So that\u2019s sort of updated and will be a headwind as contrary to what would otherwise have underlying business growth. And then obviously, the very significant increase we have in growth is a result of capital deployment from shares. The other piece to think about with interest rates is that we\u2019ll have lower sales that come out of that in a lower interest rate environment as well, or at least that\u2019s what we\u2019re anticipating.","Recognizing all that, we are being very proactive. We\u2019re managing sales through product pricing, design and mix. We\u2019re managing costs. So that includes implementing the previously announced financial wellness initiatives that that Ken covered as well. And we\u2019ve been actively deploying capital for growth. That was evidenced very clearly in the Assurance IQ acquisition, which is not sensitive to rates or equity markets. But also the things that we\u2019ve done in PGIM and its investment capabilities and its distribution capabilities and the other global technology and distribution initiatives that we have, all of which we think will contribute to fundamental growth, and then obviously, as I mentioned, the share repurchases.","So deploying capital for growth, all of that we believe gives us the ability in combination with what\u2019s happening on international in terms of our continued ability to grow the inforce that gives us confidence that we can continue to show a differentiated level or we can show going forward a differentiated level of growth and ROE vis-\u00e0-vis industry in light of the sort of the macro headwinds that we outlined.","Erik Bass","Thank you. That\u2019s a helpful detail. Maybe going on the interest rate comment, it seems like your interest rates sensitivity has increased versus the $0.30 impact for 100 basis point move that you gave on last year\u2019s outlook call. Just hoping you could give a little bit more color on why that\u2019s the case.","Ken Tanji","Yes, sure. I\u2019ll cover that. Again, a year ago when we issued guidance, interest rates were in a different zone and our guidance a year ago assumed 2019 would have interest rates above 3% if you use the 10-year U.S. treasury as a benchmark. We were at rate levels that are now over 100 basis points below that. And when we gave that guidance last year, we mentioned that our sensitivity to 100 basis point decline would be $0.30 per share. And that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve experienced as we\u2019ve gone through the year and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve experienced in our financial results as well.","So the impact that we\u2019ve experienced in 2019 is very consistent with what we provided as sensitivities again a year ago. But for me, here, the rates are at a lower start point and we also have more U.S. dollar business in Japan. We have more business that\u2019s crediting rate minimums. So there is, and it\u2019s not linear as well, and we do have a greater impact. And you also have to consider there\u2019s an impact on the present value of claims at a lower discount rate. So those are the reasons that we have more interest rate sensitivity now, and it all has to do with the lower rate environment.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Just to follow-up on that, Ken. Just as we think about this rate pressure, potentially compounding over time, the $0.02 is eventually becoming a much bigger number. If rates don\u2019t move up, isn\u2019t this going to pretty much offset some of the margin expansion that you are targeting as associated with the Financial Wellness initiative?","Ken Tanji","The interest rate impact, again, assuming rates don\u2019t change, does build over time, eventually it does dissipate as the portfolio more fully turns over. And this is exactly the experience that we had. If you go back a number of years as we shifted from the then rate environment to what was the more recent rate environment, now we\u2019re going through that again. So that phenomenon is not new. It\u2019s how it plays out. And so I think it will work its way through in multiples waves as you go out, but again, dissipates eventually over time as the portfolio turns over.","Rob Falzon","So they just call out in the deck \u2013 it\u2019s Rob, in the deck that we provided, we gave you the sort of a sensitivity of rates based on the delta between our third quarter new money rates and the yield on the portfolio that\u2019d be turning over on a go forward basis. That\u2019s about 65 basis points. So vis-\u00e0-vis where we are today, if rates modestly rise to something that\u2019s sort of in the mid-2s, not very different from where we were just a little while ago, this phenomena begins to wear off.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. Okay. And then just on the decision to not host an outlook call, I guess, for next year. Typically, it would be on that call that we would get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about capital return for the upcoming year and a view or an outlook on year-end AAT reserves. So since we\u2019re not having that call, just wondering if you could provide some commentary on how you\u2019re thinking about these two things at this point?","Ken Tanji","Yes. So first, I\u2019ll start with ATT, given lower rates, we would have a rise in asset adequacy testing reserves. But we do have derivative, interest rate derivative hedges that would have gains as well to offset that. So we still feel very good about the RBC level of our \u2013 of Prudential Insurance Company of America.","In terms of our capital returns, that\u2019s a decision that the Board will make in December. And we\u2019ll get that information out once the Board makes that decision and does its authorization. Our free cash flow profile has been very consistent and our capital management approach has also been very consistent. So for now you can factor that into your thinking.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Ken, just going through the slide that discusses the corporate loss, if I take the $475 million for the 4Q guide and then I strip out the $150 million sort of the midpoint of higher seasonal 4Q expenses and the $95 million of onetime restructuring expenses, that gets me to a corporate loss of about $230 million. I think the guidance you guys have provided has been over $300 million a quarter as more of a normalized corporate loss. I just want to know, are you implying that you would expect the corporate loss to be lower on a go-forward basis? Or is there \u2013 is a little over $300 million still a decent quarterly loss expectation?","Ken Tanji","Tom, the one thing I think, that I think you have a little bit off there is the $150 million of seasonal doesn\u2019t all occur in corporate and other, only about half of it does. So I think if you make that consideration you\u2019re more in line with where our corporate and other run rate has been.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks for that clarification. The other question I had is on the \u2013 just a follow-up on capital return cash flow. I think based on \u2013 I understand there\u2019s been some GAAP earnings pressure here, but can you talk about how cash flow visibility is playing out as you head into 2020? Would you still expect a similar, call it, 65% conversion ratio? Or will that be changing based on where interest rates are in both Japan and the U.S.?","Ken Tanji","Yes. Tom, our cash flow engines are still very much intact. So, first for the businesses that have been providing quarterly dividends, PGIM and our annuities business, as you can see those have been very consistent and regular and paid quarterly. And Japan paid a dividend this quarter and the third quarter as well. And we\u2019ll be filing for a dividend from PICA in the fourth quarter. So, yes, rates will decrease net investment income and have some modest impact as we talked about with our sensitivities. But in general, our cash flow picture is quite strong and quite consistent.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And then just one final follow-up, if I could. The market related experience adjustment factor, which was I think around negative $300 million to net income this quarter. Was that just a onetime adjustment outside of the actuarial review to reflect macro? Or can you just provide some color on that? Thanks.","Ken Tanji","Yes, sure. No, that wasn\u2019t a onetime adjustment. So that adjustment occurs to update our discount rates related to our best estimates of insurance liabilities and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. And it didn\u2019t lead to a charge for the quarter. Having said that, we had other gains as well. And if you looked at a GAAP net income, it was actually above operating income. So overall, our GAAP profile was pretty in line with our operating profile.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with UBS. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Good morning, everybody. Maybe a question for Rob or Ken. It sounds like this is more macro driven. And maybe you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it sounds like your expectations are that sort of given in particular sustained low rates. Some insurance products are simply less attractive to customers. And as a result your expectation is that sales in such an environment would be somewhat pressured, maybe down.","First question is, do I have that right or is there something else to that story? And then the second or related question is, should we expect that at least in the short-term, as a result of that environment, your free cash flow could actually be better. And maybe we ought to consider potentially at least some incremental capital deployments or capital return to shareholders?","Charlie Lowrey","Yes. John, this is Charlie. Let me start and then some others will jump into it. Let me just start philosophically about sales. So the answer is as interest rates decrease, absolutely, sales will \u2013 may well decrease as we change pricing, and as certain products become much less profitable for us and we\u2019ve always talked about a sustained level of profitability over time. And so what we have to calibrate between is making sure that our products meet our hurdle rates on the one hand, and two, sustaining distribution on the other hand.","And we\u2019re always calibrating between that, but we will \u2013 we have already and will continue to raise pricing, lower crediting rates to do whatever it takes in order to maintain a level of profitability that makes sense for the company and shareholders. And at the same time, look at what a minimum level of sales would be in order to maintain, what is a world-class distribution system as we go forward. That\u2019s what we\u2019re toggling, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re toggling on those two issues. And you will see that as we go through. But we have already raised pricing and taken multiple pricing actions both domestically and internationally.","Steve Pelletier","John, its Steve. Maybe I\u2019ll amplify Charlie\u2019s comments and get a little bit more specific on what I think is a primary example of it, which is in the annuities business. Recently with the decline in interest rates, we have been active in making product changes that reduce the level of product benefits and effectively increased pricing. But that relates to over the past couple of months reducing payout rates by 40 points to 45 points in some of \u2013 in our products by reducing a roll-up rate on HDI by 50 basis points. This is something that we do as Charlie\u2019s mentioned in the normal course of business, in order to manage the business for sustainable, profitable growth. Well, certainly looking to maintain relevance with distribution partners and a competitive value proposition for customers.","We\u2019ve seen some competitors take some actions, but frankly, we\u2019ve made more changes than most. And as a result it\u2019s possible that we could see our sales trajectory decline in the near term and we simply see that as an outcome of how we manage the business. And I would mention, as how we\u2019ve managed that business for an extended period of time. If you look over a multiyear period in the annuities business, we\u2019ve certainly been active in the marketplace throughout, but we\u2019ve been significantly more active during periods where capital market conditions were more supportive of product features and at issue returns. And we\u2019d been relatively less active in periods where capital market conditions were not so supportive, if that over an extended period of time that is built the in-force block in that business that has the characteristics, pardon me, Ken mentioned earlier of strong profitability, robust returns and solid cash flow.","John Nadel","Yes. Listen, I appreciate the need to balance, right, maintenance \u2013 or maintaining distribution versus profitability of sales. And I was just wondering if there was \u2013 if you\u2019d expect that sales would be down sufficiently such that, maybe it has a near term or a short-term impact on free cash flow. But we can take that offline.","Charlie Lowrey","Well, that\u2019s \u2013 John, I can cover that real quickly. When sales come down, yes, naturally, you would expect that cash flow would improve because we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t need to hold capital associated with new business. So that the direction is, is as you described.","John Nadel","Thank you. And Ken, I\u2019ve got one quick housekeeping one and this is in light of really no outlook for 2020 call, but any reason why your tax rate given the business mix, et cetera, should be any \u2013 it should be meaningfully different next year than it is this year.","Ken Tanji","No. I think our tax rate has been very, very consistent.","John Nadel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Looking at PGIM, the fee rate seems to be a little more pressure this quarter, especially in retail and general account assets. I was just wondering if you can talk about just kind of your overall fee rate expectation in the near-term and especially the fees of the assets that have left and versus those that came in.","Steve Pelletier","Humphrey, it\u2019s Steve, I\u2019ll take your question. While Rob called out a specific fixed income institutional outflow this quarter, the general story throughout 2019 has been a pretty strong inflows into fixed income and some other asset classes, and a pressure on equity flows, so negative flows in the equity space. Really experienced across the industry as I would say, the active to passive headwinds picked up again this year. Given the relative fee rates across asset classes that migration of assets from asset mix from equities to fixed income has that impact that you noted on our average fee levels. Now I should emphasize we\u2019ve been able to significantly mitigate that by drawing a lot of our flows and including our fixed income flows into specific strategy \u2013 strategies that have a solid fee levels.","But nonetheless, the cumulative impact is, as you as you pointed out. I would say though that this gradual migration of assets from equity to fixed income of asset mix from equity to fixed income, especially fueled by fixed income appreciation in recent quarters due to the declining interest rate environment. While that might be a source of pressure on fees, it\u2019s also highly supportive of margin in the business. Fixed \u2013 and we have scale economies throughout our asset management complex. But the fixed income businesses where those scale economies are most attractive and flows \u2013 increasing contribution of fixed income to our asset mix will be supportive of margin expansion in the business.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. I appreciate the color. Just for clarification on the expenses in international. I think in response to Alex\u2019s question earlier, you talked about the $55 million in the fourth quarter in terms of the elevated expenses is kind of where you think would drop off. But I think from last quarter\u2019s call you talk about in Gibraltar, you expect some high expenses to continue throughout 2020. And then especially given, it seems like Gibraltar was a little bit lighter expenses in the third quarter. Should we still expect \u2013 elevated expenses in international throughout 2020 and then kind of coming off of that, so how should we think about that in general?","Scott Sleyster","Hi, Humphrey, this is Scott. I\u2019ll take that. The $55 million really related to the Life Planner business, as you pointed out, we had a \u2013 we actually had a kind of overshot on what we thought our expenses might be in Gibraltar this quarter. We do still expect in Gibraltar a modest level of elevated expenses. I think where we guided you last quarter that would continue to about mid year. The really sizable amounts of that were picked up in 2019. So I\u2019d say those are relatively de minimis, and I think in the guidance on expenses that were given on the overnight we\u2019ve captured that bleed in. And I would say it\u2019s not really very significant in Gibraltar.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. So first a question for Ken, on the interest rate impact, I\u2019m assuming that if you don\u2019t \u2013 if rates do not change then that at least for the next one or two or three years compounds at a much faster rate than your normal earnings growth, so it becomes a bigger and bigger headwind in 2021 versus what you\u2019ve outlined for potentially the next 12 months. Right?","Ken Tanji","Yes, I think you should think of it as for \u2013 we said $0.30 for five quarters, call it $0.28 for four. And that\u2019s sort of the annual drag.","Jimmy Bhullar","Yes. But then beyond that, it should be a considerably higher than the $0.28 in the next four quarters, just at the base that it\u2019s building up. Correct?","Ken Tanji","Yes. Yes. That\u2019s the way the math works. And over time it dissipates.","Jimmy Bhullar","Yes. But that\u2019s a few years out as you roll the portfolio over, assuming no change in rates again. Right?","Ken Tanji","That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then on your Japan sales at Prudential of Japan you \u2013 there\u2019s a tax law change, you withdrew a term product. Should we assume that at least in the near-term that sales will remain muted or, and if you could just give us color on what drove the weakness, that there\u2019s something besides that drove the weak sales this quarter and just some idea on sort of trends in that market and what your expectations are for sales?","Scott Sleyster","Hi, Jimmy. This is Scott. Let me take that a couple of ways. One, the corporate tax law change did in fact impact everybody in the industry, but it touched us in both POJ and in the Life Planner business. So there was the national tax authority was reviewing the rules and there was a four or five month period where you didn\u2019t know what they were going to look like and then an implementation period after that. In the case of case of POJ, I would say the effect was more modest because of the clientele being business owners and high net worth and some of the products that are coming back. There we\u2019ll continue to sell some of the new corporate products. But more importantly, the Life Planner growth across our channel has been strong really across the board, so that that\u2019s favorable.","I would say in the case of \u2013 in Gibraltar it\u2019s really a more significant challenge. We\u2019ve been seeing more competitive. We had the corporate product. We\u2019ve also continued to see pretty intense competition in the bank channel market. And we\u2019ve also imposed some pricing discipline where we\u2019ve favored kind of recurring premium, mortality-based products versus some of the more income oriented products as rates came down. So when you combine those three effects, I would say, in the case of Gibraltar, the issues are more challenging. In the case of POJ and Life Planner generally, they\u2019re more transitory in nature.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just lastly, any comments on what\u2019s going on in the Chilean market, just with all the political instability and the potential for pension reform at some point?","Scott Sleyster","Yes. A couple of comments. Our business there with Habitat actually has performed very, very well year-to-date and we actually had very, very favorable and [indiscernible] performance based on the underlying markets this quarter. That being said, I would say we\u2019ve been in touch fairly frequently with what\u2019s going on there, and I wouldn\u2019t really downplay what\u2019s going on there, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s relatively serious. I think the people there are concerned about the unrest. That being said, one of the \u2013 one of the responses and one of the request if you will, the demands that are out there and the factors impacting insecurity relates to people being nervous about old age retirement and so there is actually proposals to materially increase the deposits and then call it the generosity of some of the systems, we may or may not benefit that much from that because sometimes when they increase the deposits, they don\u2019t allow fees on them and what have you.","But in general, I would say, I think it\u2019s a serious situation down there. That being said, we\u2019re actually quite well positioned and we\u2019re in a space in the market, where the demands of those that are feeling disadvantaged are looking for government actions that would be supportive of our sector.","Ken Tanji","And also don\u2019t forget, we have the \u2013 we have the lowest fees and some of the best investment performance in the business and therefore within the pension sector, we\u2019re very well positioned as well.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","John Barnidge","Thanks. Another life insurer had a large write-down in the quarter on private equity position. Can you walk us through how many different private equity or venture capital positions you have, average investment size and largest on carrying value, please?","Rob Falzon","John, it\u2019s Rob. In our \u2013 if you look at our alternatives portfolio, a couple of things to note, one is it\u2019s extraordinarily well diversified. There in excess of 2000 underlying companies invested through somewhere around 300 funds in that portfolio. So we do not have any particular concentration. To the extent that we have direct investments in companies in that portfolio, which come about as they do in these kinds of strategies by co-investment rights. They are primarily, if not exclusively in private equity, not in venture capital, and therefore tend to have significantly less volatility. And any of those underlying investments are relatively small.","So, we obviously in the context of our alternatives portfolio, we have out in underperformance that\u2019s a reflection of markets and overall segment performance. We tend to have a little less of the idiosyncratic performance as a result of single investments. We\u2019re not entirely immune from it, but nothing to particularly call out there, well-diversified and relatively conservatively positioned.","John Barnidge","Great. My follow-up, most of them have been answered, but are you seeing any signs of early activity in flu season? It seems like everyone here is sick earlier.","Steve Pelletier","John, this is Steve. I\u2019ll answer your question. I think I don\u2019t know about the immediately present the state of the flu season, but I think that we did see in this quarter our life mortality in the individual life business have some experience that was a counter to what we normally see as the seasonal trends. Normally, the third quarter is a \u2013 tends to be a positive experience in life mortality. It didn\u2019t play out that way this quarter. We saw the unfavorable experience in this quarter in blocks that have really generally trended quite favorably over time. And as a result, we believe that this quarter\u2019s result is more of a random fluctuation rather than indicative of any underlying issues or trends.","I would say also in relation to the third quarter mortality experience being different from normal seasonal patterns in life, we saw exact the similar phenomenon play out in the retirement business. A business that normally has in the third quarter less favorable reserve experience and in this quarter because of a similar mortality trends the business was able to realize outsized reserve gains, again, kind of pushing away from the normal seasonal patterns. And I think this speaks to our complimentary business mix working out as we\u2019ve intended to and as we\u2019ve designed it to.","John Barnidge","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, so I recognize you guys aren\u2019t hosting an outlook call any more, but I guess is there a way that you can give us some kind of baseline EPS growth or maybe where you come in within your ROE band in 2022 just so we get a sense of kind of the forward days beyond just, I guess, thinking about some of the items you called out in the slides as well as, right, the higher corporate expenses that do recur every fourth quarter?","Charlie Lowrey","Yes, sure. I\u2019ll just sort of echo some of the things that Rob mentioned earlier. And I sort of described how you can think about whether the baseline that we described coming out of the second quarter or our results for the third quarter adjusted for the things that were a bit favorable or the fourth quarter baseline we provided adjusted for the elevated level of expenses. All kind of gets you to an EPS number that\u2019s a little bit better than $3.","And then, our businesses are growing. We articulated some of our growth thoughts at Investor Day. And now we do have a lower interest rate environment so that eats into that a little bit as we described and given sensitivities to. But then on top of that, we have the margin improvement that we have underway, which again, we\u2019ve articulated and given measures for as well as the impact of Assurance IQ acquisition, which we expect to be accretive in 2020. So I think those are all the components that we think about as we look to 2020 and would encourage you to think about for yourself.","Rob Falzon","Elyse, it\u2019s Rob. Let me just sort of jump in on the ROE portion of your question. First, I\u2019d note that in the third quarter we had an ROE of \u2013 in excess of 13%. So, while we had headwinds associated with equity markets, we did have positive impacts \u2013 headwinds associated with interest rates. We had positive impacts with the movement in equity markets. And if you think about the little better than $3 quarterly baseline number that Ken triangulated around, that would still represent an ROE that would be about 13%.","And so, when we provided our outlook of 12% to 14% ROE, it was obviously in an environment where interest rates were much higher. But the expectation was that absent those interest rates, we would be in the midpoint of that, 13% is the midpoint between 12% and 14% was more sort of a baseline expectation as opposed to the high-end of our range. With the headwind in interest rates, it could put a little bit of pressure on that, but I think that the statements we made with regard to that range of 12% to 14% have not changed materially by virtue of anything that\u2019s occurred since the point in time where we\u2019ve gave out that guidance, absent the recalibration for interest rates.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thanks. And then in terms of Assurance, that deal is now closed. Is there anything in terms of modeling that you want to point out in terms of the seasonality as we put that into our models? I believe you guys had previously said it was more weighted towards the fourth quarter. Just anything that stands out as we think about getting that into 2020 on a quarterly basis?","Andy Sullivan","Yes, sure. Elyse, this is Andy. I\u2019ll take your question and thank you for the question. There will be seasonal variability quarter-to-quarter and right now a good portion of the revenue is driven by the Medicare advantage product, and the individual age 65 products that are really driven by the open enrollment period. It\u2019s in the fourth quarter. So when you think about earnings pattern with the current mix of business that we have with Assurance and prior to us executing on adding additional products to the platform, the fourth quarter will likely be our heaviest from both the revenue and earnings perspective.","Charlie Lowrey","Yes. But keep in mind, again, this is a young company and a growing company and we didn\u2019t expect it to be material to the fourth quarter. But we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making and the outlook for 2020 and 2021.","Andy Sullivan","And maybe just two add-ons, obviously, in this fourth quarter we\u2019ll experience the transaction and transaction and financing costs. Also the core results are going to be net of the amortization of the intangible assets that are \u2013 that went on the books.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Charlie Lowrey for any closing comments.","Charlie Lowrey","Thank you. So as you heard, we\u2019re committed to delivering on our purpose of providing financial opportunity to more people and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in the months ahead. But before wrapping up, I\u2019d like to take a moment to recognize Steve Pelletier, who is retiring next month following an extraordinary 27-year career at the company. Thank you, Steve, for your many contributions to Prudential throughout your career. And for those of you who are not in the room here, but on the telephone, I wish you could see his grin, which is from ear to ear, as he participates in his last earnings call.","And with that, I\u2019d like to thank you again for joining us today and we look forward to more conversations in the future. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect."],"17436":["Prudential Financial, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Mark Finkelstein. Please go ahead, sir.","Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Brad. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer, and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today.","In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures of our earnings press release, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And with that, I will hand it over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We had a good start to the year. Earnings were solid and the underlying momentum across our businesses remained strong. In my remarks, I will cover three main topics. I'll provide a high-level perspective on earnings, discuss our business fundamentals, and then cover capital deployment. And after that, I'll hand it over to Mark and Rob to go through the specifics.","I'll start my comments on the results for the first quarter. Adjusted operating earnings of $3.05, which excludes a $0.03 benefit from market-driven and discrete items, exceeds the $2.76 we reported in the prior year quarter. Annualized return on equity on the same basis was very good, in the mid-13% range, which is above our near to intermediate term target of 12% to 13%. There were a number of moving parts at the segment level that Mark will walk through, but at a high level, earnings are benefiting from solid core growth in our asset-based businesses, including Investment Management, Retirement and Individual Annuities. We also saw improved margins in our Group Insurance business and steady underlying results in our international operations.","In addition, tax reform is an incremental positive to results and we experienced lower than normal corporate expenses in the quarter, which we know will vary. Partially offsetting these items, investment returns and spread income were lower than the prior year and below our normal expectations, due mainly to less favorable non-coupon and prepayment investment results. In addition, year-over-year comparisons are impacted by lower expectations in Individual Life Insurance as a result of last year's second quarter actuarial updates.","I would also highlight that we experienced mixed underwriting results across the segments, which is not uncommon to see in the first quarter. However, the positive and negatives largely offset and the net impact on results was relatively modest. In particular, the adverse mortality experienced in Individual Life Insurance and to a lesser extent our Life Planner business was largely offset by favorable case experience in our Retirement business and good Group Life and Disability experience. While we don't expect this to match precisely every quarter, we manage our mix of mortality and longevity businesses such that they will work well together and contributed to dampening earnings volatility.","Before turning to business fundamentals, I'd also like to observe that net income for the quarter was fairly consistent with operating earnings. Credit losses were muted and a number of the recent actions to reduce earnings volatility are having their intended impact. In addition, our variable annuities hedging program showed good results in a particularly volatile quarter for capital markets. Strong net income is also contributing to solid growth in adjusted book value per share, which is up 15% over the prior quarter. While this increase reflects the impacts of tax reform and accounting changes at the start of 2018, it also reflects strong bottom line results.","I'll now turn to business fundamentals. At a high level, we continue to see solid momentum. While first quarter sales inflows were influenced by the timing of transactions and other episodic factors, looking through those we are pleased with the overall production trends in our operations. In our domestic businesses, we're seeing increasing sales momentum in our Individual Annuities business, with sales up 20% over the prior year and 7% sequentially. Likewise, we're seeing strong sales in our Group Insurance business, which reported growth of 27% over the prior year. This includes the benefits of our financial wellness value proposition as well as success expanding our presence in the premier market or accounts with 100 to 5,000 lives.","Investment Management also had a good growth quarter, although the extent of the strength is not reflected in the published net flow number. Results were distorted by an institutional outflow relating to a very low fee legacy index account. And this large $6 billion outflow was more than offset by about $7 billion of higher value new assets. And given the excellent investment performance of our funds, we remain upbeat that net flow story will continue to be a positive one.","We did experience net outflows in our Retirement business. While full service had solid sales in net flows, we did not close any pension risk transfers in the quarter. Pension risk transfer transactions are episodic, and we have seen a recent trend where activity builds throughout the year. So, having said that, we have a healthy pipeline and believe our leading market position and strong execution track record will lead to continued strength in this business.","Our international businesses continue to show good overall momentum. Although sales were down from the prior year, this is mainly due to challenging comparisons, as the first quarter of 2017 benefited from a sales surge in Japan ahead of our repricing of yen-based products. Looking through that impact, sales were solid, led by good Life Planner and Life Consultant productivity, and we continue to see particularly strong sales results in our U.S. dollar products in Japan.","With regard to capital deployment, we returned $760 million to shareholders, about equally split between dividends and share repurchases. This reflects the quarterly impact of the 20% increase in both our share repurchase authorization and dividend level for 2018. We continue to generate a considerable amount of free cash flow in our businesses and thoughtfully allocate our excess capital between investing in our businesses and returning capital to our shareholders all the while maintaining a strong financial position.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. I'll take through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover liquidity leverage and capital highlights.","I'm starting on slide 2. After tax adjusted operating income amounted to $3.08 per share for the quarter compared to $2.79 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items of $0.03 per share, which consist of our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the Annuities business, EPS amounted to $3.05 for this quarter, up from $2.76 a year ago, and implying an ROE of 13.6% on an annualized basis.","Core performance of our businesses overall was solid in the quarter, with year-over-year comparisons benefiting from higher fees in our Annuities and Investment Management businesses, and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis, including the impact of seasonally higher earnings from the elimination of Gibraltar Life's one-month reporting lag. In addition, a lower effective tax rate benefited earnings in the quarter as compared to prior year results.","While underlying business performance was solid, I would highlight that current quarter results included a couple of items that we refer to as trend considerations or items that varied from our average expectations. This includes non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income which were about $50 million below our average expectations in the quarter. In addition, our Individual Life Insurance business had about $20 million of reserve true-ups in the quarter. As John mentioned, overall mortality experience was in line with our expectations, as positives and negatives largely offset across segments. The net impact of these items resulted in a negative impact to current quarter earnings of approximately $0.14 per share. GAAP net income, which included amounts categorized as realized investment gains and losses and results from divested businesses was $1.4 billion in the quarter and was relatively consistent with our after tax adjusted operating income despite significant market volatility.","Moving to slide 3, which shows the items affecting pre-tax net income that are not included in adjusted operating income. Our current quarter GAAP net income includes pre-tax net realized investment gains of $64 million and a pre-tax loss on divested business results and other items of $66 million. Three items to note. Product-related embedded derivatives and associated hedging had a positive impact of $340 million, largely driven by the noneconomic impact of applying wider credit spreads in the calculation of our non-performance risk related to the annuities living benefits.","The loss of $269 million from risk management activities was primarily driven by currency hedges, as the U.S. dollar weakened compared to certain other currencies, as well as by losses on derivatives used for asset and liability management and other risk mitigation activities. The $81 million loss from divested businesses primarily relates to the impact of higher rates on our derivatives used for asset and liability duration management in our Long-Term Care business. Underwriting results were largely as expected.","Moving to our business results and starting on slide 4, I will discuss the comparative results for each segment, excluding market-driven and discrete items. Annuities earnings were $503 million for the quarter, up by $54 million from a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income, reflecting a 6% increase in our variable annuity average separate account values and lower risk management costs. Partially offsetting this increase was a lower contribution from net investment spread results as returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were approximately $5 million below expectations in the current quarter compared to $15 million above expectations a year ago.","Annuities return on assets, or ROA, of 121 basis points is down modestly from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees in the quarter. As we have previously stated, our long-term ROA target is about 115 basis points and we expect to exceed this level in the short to medium term. Over time, we expect that higher risk management costs and the aging of our business will cause our ROA to migrate to the long-term target level. I would also highlight that our variable annuity hedging program was well over 90% effective in what was a very volatile quarter.","Slide 5 presents our Annuity sales. Total Annuity sales in the quarter of $1.7 billion were 20% higher than the year-ago quarter and 7% above the prior sequential quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher HDI sales as the current interest rate environment enabled us to increase the attractiveness of our products.","Turning to slide 6, Individual Life had a soft quarter as earnings of $36 million were $82 million lower than the year-ago quarter and well below our expectations. I'll focus my comments on items in the quarter that deviated from what we would ordinarily expect. There were three items I will highlight, each having a negative impact on current quarter results.","First, our claims experience, inclusive of reinsurance, associated reserve updates and amortization was approximately $45 million less favorable than expected. While we typically experience higher claims in the first quarter, claims this quarter were higher than typical seasonality. Notably, we experienced a higher frequency of claims in older age bands. Second, we experienced adverse impacts from reserve true-ups of $20 million. In any given quarter, we could make modest positive and negative adjustments as we reconcile actual experience to actuarial models. The adjustments this quarter were larger than normal and skewed to the negative side. And finally, returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $10 million below expectations. We believe that after adjusting for these items results would be representative of our quarterly earnings power.","Turning to slide 7, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums of $125 million, were $21 million lower than the year-ago quarter. As expected, guaranteed universal life sales declined and were partially offset by higher variable life and other universal life sales. This reflects our product diversification strategy and specific distribution, service, and product actions that we have taken.","Turning to slide 8, Retirement earnings were $317 million for the current quarter compared to $397 million a year ago. The decrease reflects a lower contribution from net investment spread results and higher expenses, partially offset by more favorable case experience. The contribution from net investment spread results was $80 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $20 million below expectations compared to $65 million above expectations a year ago.","In addition, while we continue to experience some spread compression, this was mitigated by an increase in the average spread-based asset balances. Current quarter results also reflect particularly strong case experience, which was about $55 million more favorable than our expectations. This modestly exceeded the prior year, which also benefited from very good case experience.","Turning to slide 9, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $10.6 billion for the current quarter, relatively consistent with the year ago. Results reflect solid full service plan sales offset by light institutional investment product sales. Net outflows for the current quarter of $2.4 billion reflect a few items I will highlight. First, there were no pension risk transfer transactions that closed in the quarter. As we've mentioned, these transactions can be lumpy, particularly given our focus on larger cases. However, we have a robust pipeline. Second, we experienced net outflows in our investment-only stable value business, driven by higher net participant withdrawals. Finally, these two items were partially offset by positive net flows in full service with good planned sales activity in the quarter, as noted previously. Total Retirement account values were $428 billion, up by 8% from a year earlier. This increase reflects the benefit from market appreciation as well as about $7 billion of positive net flows over the past year.","Turning to slide 10. Group Insurance earnings were $55 million for the quarter as compared to $34 million a year ago. The increase primarily reflects more favorable underwriting results, partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment spread results and higher expenses. The current quarter total benefits ratio of 85.6% was slightly better than our long-term target range of 86% to 90%, reflecting more favorable Group Life experience, partially offset by modestly less favorable Disability experience. We continue to be pleased with the underwriting results in our Group Insurance business.","Turning to slide 11, most of our Group Insurance sales occur in the first quarter, reflecting calendar year effective dates. Current quarter sales based on annualized new business premiums of $383 million were 27% higher than the year-ago quarter. This increase reflects higher sales in both Group Life and Disability.","Turning to slide 12. Investment Management earnings were $232 million for the quarter, compared to $196 million a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by higher asset management fees, net of related expenses, which reflects a 9% increase in average assets under management, driven by fixed income net inflows and equity market appreciation. Fee rates on our assets under management have remained very consistent.","In addition, results reflect a $16 million higher contribution from other related revenues, which totaled $45 million in the quarter as a result of stronger strategic investing earnings and higher transaction fees. This is about $12 million above the quarterly average over the last three years. I would also highlight that earnings, excluding other related revenue, were below the prior sequential quarter. This is mainly due to the seasonality of certain revenue and expense items, including first quarter cost associated with our long-term incentive plan.","The Investment Management business reported about $800 million of net positive unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity. Net retail inflows of $1 billion, driven by fixed income strategies, were slightly offset by institutional net outflows of $200 million. As John mentioned, we had a large client withdrawal of about $6 billion tied to a very low-fee index strategy that is inconsequential to earnings.","Moving now to International Insurance and turning to slide 13. Earnings from our Life Planner business were $416 million for the quarter compared to $408 million a year ago. The increase was driven by continued business growth with constant dollar insurance revenues up by 8% from a year ago, partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment spread results and higher expenses. The current quarter contribution from net investment spread results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees approximately $5 million below our average expectations, in comparison to $10 million above expectations in the year-ago quarter. Claims experience was approximately $15 million less favorable than expected in both the current and prior period.","I would also highlight that a concentration of annual mode revenues results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $25 million in relation to the quarterly average.","Turning to slide 14, Gibraltar Life earnings were $440 million for the quarter, compared to $391 million a year ago. This increase reflects seasonally higher earnings, which were previously reported in the second quarter, now reflected in the first quarter due to the elimination of the one-month reporting lag. We would estimate that the benefit to current quarter earnings from a shift in the concentration of annual mode revenues was about $25 million.","In addition, current quarter results benefited from more favorable policy benefits experience and business growth, primarily from strong U.S. dollar product sales in all channels. These increases were partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment spread results with returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, approximately $10 million below expectations, in comparison to $5 million above expectations in the year ago quarter.","Turning to slide 15, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $745 million for the current quarter, down by $149 million or 17% from a year ago. This decrease primarily reflects lower sales in Japan and is largely tied to the elevated level of sales that occurred in the year ago quarter. You may recall that we experienced a sales acceleration in advance of the repricing of recurring premium yen products a year ago. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in U.S. dollar-denominated sales in Japan, driven by the continued attractiveness of U.S. dollar products in the current environment and the introduction of new U.S. dollar products last year. 79% of sales in Japan were U.S. dollar denominated in the quarter. Sales outside of Japan were lower. This reflects lower sales in Korea as the year ago quarter had large Annuity sales in advance of tax revisions on savings products. This was partially offset by growth in Brazil where business drivers remain strong.","Turning to slide 16, the Corporate & Other loss was $294 million for the current quarter compared to a $352 million loss a year ago. The decrease was primarily driven by lower expenses, in particular non-linear items, which can fluctuate including lower cost for employee benefit and compensation plans which are tied to equity market returns. In addition, higher income from the qualified pension plan following our assumption updates at year-end last year was partially offset by lower net investment income. As we've seen in the past, Corporate & Other results can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of expense items. We would consider the loss this quarter to be smaller than what we would typically expect.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Now turning to slide 17, I'll provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures.","Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The increase of about $700 million from year-end was driven primarily by proceeds from our $1 billion senior debt issuance in March, partially offset by operating needs within our businesses. Cash inflows from the businesses during the quarter supported approximately $760 million of shareholder distributions. This was about evenly split between dividends of $387 million and share repurchases of $375 million done under our $1.5 billion board authorization for the year. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios remained within our targets as of the end of the first quarter.","The year-end 2017 RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance or PICA and PALAC as well as the composite RBC are also shown here. As we have highlighted previously, we manage our Annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding total assets to a CTE 97 level with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time we may see some significant variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC ratio over our target ratio. At December 31, 2017, our domestic and international regulatory capital ratios were above our AA financial strengths targeted levels and we continued to be well positioned relative to these objectives as of March 31, 2018.","I would also remind investors of two items we communicated in our guidance and during our fourth quarter earnings call that had a positive impact on adjusted book value in the first quarter of 2018 of roughly $1 billion. First, we implemented the new accounting standard, which impacts the treatment of equity investments and resulted in a reclass of net unrealized gains of approximately $900 million from AOCI to retained earnings. In addition, we eliminated the one-month reporting lag in our Gibraltar operations, so that Gibraltar's first quarter results reflect January through March activity. This did not result in an extra month of Gibraltar earnings, but instead resulted in an adjustment to opening equity of approximately $170 million.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to John.","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Rob, thanks, Mark. We would like to now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. First question in queue will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi, good morning. Thank you. I guess first, given the renewed concerns on Long-Term Care in the industry, can you just comment on the reserve levels and assumptions in your legacy block and the recent claims trends that you've seen?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure, Erik, it's Rob. So, a couple of thoughts. One let me sort of just sort of set the stage with the characterization of our block. It is a relatively small block. We've got about 214,000 policies. Our reserves, to the point of your question, are $6.2 billion statutory, and that's about 7% of our overall statutory reserves. The nature of our book is a relatively recent vintage, and therefore, it benefits from more conservative plan designs than what we've seen in across the industry. Also notable is that two-thirds of our book are group issued, which also tend to have more conservative plan designs, for instance, lower percentages of things like lifetime benefits and inflation benefits. So, when we look at the reserving of that, it's a relatively small book. We feel pretty comfortable with the level of that reserve. And given that our assumptions are consistent with industry peers and generally on the more conservative side. Now, we recognize that only about 2% of our book is in payout, and the industry is also relatively nascent in terms of its experience and the emergence of that experience. So, obviously, as data emerges we and others will have to reflect that data vis-\u00e0-vis the assumptions that we're making.","And period results as a result of that as well, any given period you're going to see volatility in that, which we think you saw in 2017 versus what we experienced in 2018. So, our results for 2017 were negative with regard to our underwriting results, but in 2018 in the first quarter, as Mark indicated in his opening remarks, were largely in-line with our expectations. We update our assumptions every year in the second quarter, so we'll be moving into that process. As I mentioned in the last call, we have about $0.5 billion of margins in our reserves in that Long-Term Care block. So, given the size of the block, given the composition of the block, given the margin we have, we believe that we're very well-positioned going into the second quarter process to absorb changes, if any, that might come out of our review of assumptions in that period of time.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you. That's helpful. And just don't know if you can provide any further drilling down into the assumptions, which you characterized as conservative relative to peers. But any detail you can provide there in terms of whether it's mortality, morbidity, or interest rate assumptions?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, we haven't provided any details on that and sort of breaking that out separately, and the way those assumptions work, Erik, calling out any individual assumption without the context of the overall assessment of those assumptions is sort of a very difficult thing to do, but we benefit from industry studies. We look at those studies and we look at our own experience and I think it's very safe to say that we're across each and every one of those dimensions we would consider ourselves to be on the mid to more conservative end of the spectrum of how others have estimated those things.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Got it, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks, good morning. Somewhat similar but not specific to Long-Term Care, but just as we approach the second quarter actuarial assumption review, anything we should be thinking about in terms of key model updates or anything of that nature that you can help us think about as we move into that?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, Ryan, obviously, can't really comment on what's coming into the second quarter, given that that process is just kicking off. The only observations I would make is that we have \u2013 as we indicated last year, when we talked about, we did have significant impacts as a result of model changes that we were implementing as a result of what we called our actuarial transformation process that we were undertaking. And that modeling, with respect to valuations, was largely completed during the course of last year. So, we don't have an issue where we're looking at significant outcomes as a result of having done major revamps to modeling. That's probably the only insight I could offer at this point.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","No, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just on the PRT pipeline, I think you mentioned looks pretty good. But can you provide some additional color as we move through the year on PRT?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Ryan, it's Steve Pelletier, I'll answer that question. As Mark mentioned in his opening comments, it's not unusual to see transaction activity build over the course of the year. That's especially true in the very large case market, in which we specialize in that segment of the market, seeing companies develop their approaches and their transaction plans over the course of a fiscal year is not at all unusual, and it's in fact what we've seen over the past few years. But I would echo some of the comments I've made in the immediate past. We see a very robust visible pipeline. That pipeline continues to be driven by some of the considerations we've spoken about. A rising interest rate environment helps improve funding status. And so, across the board, ability of plan sponsors to transact is enhanced. And propensity to transact still remains very strong, driven by considerations like rising PBGC premiums and increased awareness of the longevity risk inherent in their plans.","So, we like what we see in terms of the visible pipeline and we think that we also like our ability to compete within that pipeline and as that pipeline emerges, really driven again by the same considerations that have driven our business in the past. The quality of our overall effort, the ability to bring large and complex transactions to a successful close, and the ability to onboard large populations of annuitants in a very seamless fashion.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Okay. And we will go to the line of John Nadel with UBS. Please go ahead.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Hey, good morning, everybody. Two questions. One on PALAC, and the risk-based capital ratio there, Rob, is it fair for us to think that a roughly 1,000% RBC ratio is equivalent to CTE 97? Or would that just be a poor relationship to try to draw?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Well, I get the direction you're going. And what I'd modify on what you said, John, is that the way we manage that block is not just to a CTE 97, but the phrase we've used is through the cycle.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Understood, yeah.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So it's our ability to maintain that not only today but through an adverse economic cycle, equity markets being down like 17%, interest rates popping up. So, if you think about that, it's that CTE 97 under a level of duress.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Okay. So, in a more benign environment, it's above CTE 97?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yep, absolutely.","John M. Nadel - UBS","And, so again, around 1,000%, is that the place to think about or is it something below this level?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","No, part of the challenge you have with it, John, is that that is a very volatile measure because, without getting into sort of the inside baseball of how this all works, there's a lot of volatility between capital and reserves because they're calculated differently. And the way that ratio works is that it tends to mute the volatility when you're down around 350-ish (35:11) or so, but when you're above 350 (35:15), depending on what's happening in the market, it affects capital differently than it affects reserves. And so you get lots of volatility above that level. So, it's really hard to read too much into the ratio when it's that high. It's much cleaner to look at it when it's actually closer to the sort of the targeted level.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","And the concept is more a total asset requirement, which combines both capital and reserves. And the way the liability side changes in terms of the mix is still supported by the asset position.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Okay. I appreciate that color. Thanks. And then I think I have one more for Charlie. I understand the fact that Life Planner sales in Japan in the year-ago period certainly benefited from some accelerated sales ahead of some pricing changes. I was curious about the Life Planner sales outside of Japan or rest of world that were down 12% year-over-year. Was there a similar impact anywhere that affected that comparison?","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","There was actually in Korea, there was a similar effect in terms after a surge in anticipation of a tax rate change on variable products. So, you had the same thing happen there. Other than that you had goo sales in Brazil and other places, but there was a similar factor outside and that's what caused the decrease.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Just a few follow-up questions on Long-Term Care. Rob, the 8% margin on Long-Term Care, is that for GAAP or stat?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","The 8% margin...","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","The $500 million on....","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, the $500 million.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Oh I'm sorry...","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","$500 million is what he is...","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So I'm sorry, that's a GAAP cushion, the statutory cushion is in excess of Tom.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. And do you have the stats about differential between GAAP and stat reserves I think you said $6.2 billion was stat?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yes, the statutory reserves are $6.2 billion, GAAP reserves are about $5 billion. But recall on the GAAP side you're holding equity in addition to the reserves, so the way that works, if we look at our statutory reserves, we look at the GAAP and the dealt delta has to be filled by equity. So, you've got $2.5 billion of equity in addition to reserves sitting in GAAP where you have a lower level of equity in your statutory statements.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. And then can you provide a little bit of color around the increase in incurred Long-Term Care claims in 2017? I know you described it as adverse. It was a fairly big delta, just if you could give some color on what drove it.","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sure, so a couple of thoughts. I've mentioned before about the size of the book. And so as a result of the size of the book, the size of the claims that you get in any given period in a year are going to be relatively small and therefore volatile as well, Tom, so we had like 1,800, 1,900 claims during the entire year, which represents well less than 1% of our policies outstanding. So, you take underwriting results which can be volatile in and of themselves and then you take a small sample size which can be volatile and you just had a compounding volatility. And so specifically, what we saw last year is that the claims had a disproportionate representation of lifetime benefits or sort of a more generous benefit packages vis-\u00e0-vis our book.","So, our book has got less than 10% lifetime benefits. But the claims last year were like 1.5% ex that. So, it's sort of not proportional to what the book would otherwise be. And so if you just think about our incidents, our claim was only up about 7%. That's kind of natural given as the book matures, claims are going to climb over time, but the severity vis-\u00e0-vis of prior year was up like \u2013 in excess of 20% and that represents that nicks that came through which we don't think is anything systemic. We think that's just \u2013 it's just small sampling and volatility just given the profile of our book. And in fact if you look at the first quarter, part of what drove the operating results being profitable in the Long-Term Care book was in fact a movement back toward a reversion to closer to the average that we have in the book as opposed to what we saw last year.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. That's really helpful. Yeah. Because, when you looked at the incurred claims I think they were up over 50% but the actual incidents was up only 7%. So is the right way to interpret that the way those filings work it's the expectation of ultimate claims so that would be like a claim duration issue because of the lifetime benefit connection, that's what really drove that?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely. So, an estimate would be based on the characteristics of the policy and to the extent it's a more generous policy, it's going to have a larger reserve associated with it.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, and then one final one. Long-Term Care riders on life insurance policies, is that driving any of the weakness you're seeing on the life insurance reserving and\/or claims experience there?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Tom, this is Steve. No, that has no impact on what you saw this quarter with the reserves. Those are true-ups that as Mark said in his opening comments, they all tended to go against us, so a bunch of relatively small items, but in the aggregate we felt it was worth calling them out. Those are items that as recently as last quarter, several of them went in our favor, so they can vary from quarter-to-quarter, but they don't have anything to do with the rider characteristics on our Life business.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. First just a question on your variable annuity sales. The sales have been picking up a little bit, but withdrawals have increased as well. And just wondering if that's because of the aging of the book or if there's something else going on and how that affects your views of net flows in the Annuity business over the next couple of years?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Jimmy, it's Steve. I'll address your question first addressing sales. We did have a solid pickup in sales year-over-year. I'd say that's characterized by a couple of things. First of all, there's generally improving sentiment in the distribution markets around Department of Labor fiduciary rule outcomes and that certainly helps on an overall basis. In our particular case, we were also able to make some judicious and measured enhancements to the competitiveness of our products in ways that \u2013 especially HDI and PDI, in ways that contributed to first quarter sales.","You will recall that we are pretty unique in our ability to make pricing changes in any direction on a monthly basis. And so, when we saw a rising rate environment over the cusp of the year and we saw the positive impact that that was having on our at-issue returns, we were able to move nimbly. And, like I say, make some measured enhancement to our product competitiveness while still writing the business at very attractive returns. So, that's on the sales side.","In the aspect of the withdrawals, I think part of that is natural to the aging of the book as more of the business moves into payout phase and there's more active utilization of the benefit. I'd also say that we saw increased lapsation in this quarter. And again, that is something that is very much contemplated and anticipated in the way we manage risk in the business, in particular in our dynamic lapse function that we spoke to you about a couple of years ago. We expect to see \u2013 and Mark touched upon this in his opening comments, we expect to see rising lapses in a rising rate environment. However, I will point out we're talking about a couple of quarters now that we've seen increased lapsation. It's way too early to call some type of a trend, given the duration of the liability, but the pick-up in lapsation is not inconsistent with the way we approach the business from a risk management standpoint.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I had a question for Charlie, as well. On sales in Japan, they've been pressured by the shift in the product portfolio towards non-yen products. Where are you in the whole process of sort of pivoting your product mix? And I guess as you lap through the difficult comps and I'm assuming that sales will begin to recover in the second half, but what's your view on that?","Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, Jimmy, as was said, sales were down 17%, but what we were able to do was to pivot to U.S. dollar product, right. So, sales were down, partly because of the surge that took place and partly because of the repricing of our recurring premium yen-denominated product. So, as you know, we don't really sell \u2013 we sell virtually no single-premium yen-denominated product anymore in Japan in any channel. But we do sell some recurring premium product, but we've repriced that significantly. And so, we did see a decrease in sales there, but because of the sophistication of our sales force and the channels in which we sell through, we were able to pivot such that now the U.S. dollar sales are almost 80% of total sales.","So I think Steve used the word nimble before in his answer, I will use the same thing here. We have been able to pivot, both in terms of new product innovation, in terms of new dollar-denominated product, and in terms of the sophistication of the sales force in selling that product. So, we're most of the way through this, I would say, but there will be some continuing decrease in the yen-denominated product that we have. So, I think what you'll see going forward is a continued increase in U.S. dollar sales, but a leveling off of the recurring premium yen-denominated sales as well.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to the next question in queue will come from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. I have a question about an item from the press release about an $81 million derivative loss linked to the LTC business. Can you give some color on what that was exactly?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Sean, it's Rob. Yeah. So, the nature of the liability within Long-Term Care is very long, it's got a very long duration. And therefore, in order for us to do proper ALM, we have to use a combination of cash instruments, treasuries, and corporates and complement that with derivatives in order to be able to extend out the duration. So, we are long interest rate swaps in the \u2013 so a net receiver interest rate swaps in that Long-Term Care portfolio. Obviously, as interest rates rise, as they did during the course of the quarter, the mark-to-market on that swap is negative. And that's the number that you're referring to. So, it's a negative mark on the duration swaps, which theoretically are being offset by a positive mark on the liability, if you sort of think about the conceptual construct there, right, any change in the value of the asset is going to be reflected in the change in the present value of that liability as well. So, that's the whole idea between ALM and doing good duration matching. Is that clear or did you have a follow up to that?","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, I think that's clear. Just sticking with hedging, with increased volatility returning, it seems like the hedge breakage was not material on the VA side in the first quarter. Just wondering if you have any qualitative comments about how you viewed slippage in the quarter?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So, just the remark that you made was sort of on point, which is that it was a very volatile quarter. We had lots of days where volatility was in excess of 1%, which was an anomaly in the quarter vis-\u00e0-vis prior periods of time. So, I think it was in excess of 20 days where we had volatility in excess of 1% and that compares to having less than 10 of those days in all of 2017. So, lots of volatility there. We have a very rigorous hedging program.","The implication of that volatility is that they were trading probably twice the level of trades that they do during the day, we'd usually trade a couple of times, rebalance a couple of times during the day. They are probably rebalancing four, five, six times during the course of the day as a result of that volatility. But the end result of that was a high level of hedge efficiency. So, as Mark indicated, it was in excess of 90% and we feel good about that outcome. And so while we had negative hedge breakage, the gross number was around $149 million for the quarter. We've seen some reversion of that, as well, on actually a significantly lower level of hedge breakage on a cumulative basis from where we sit today. So, we think that program is robust. We think that protects us, not only from volatility but also from a declining equity market. So, we feel good about both the quality and earnings prospects of our Annuities book, given the number of things that we've done over the course of the years to de-risk that book of business.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Yeah, Sean, it's Mark. Just one additional comment. We have substantial technology and human resources dedicated to this hedging process. And so, when Rob talks about the capabilities that we have to rebalance within a day several times, for example, that reflects a big investment in getting this right.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Regarding to your Group sales in the quarter, it was really strong. I was just wondering, what were the drivers and are you taking market share in a certain part of the market?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Humphrey, this is Steve. I would say that the strength of our Group sales is very much attributable to the strength of our financial wellness value proposition and how we see that really resonating in the marketplace. You recall we spoke about this extensively at Investor Day last year and our financial wellness effort is really about taking the capabilities that exist across all of our businesses and the digital and data analytics capabilities that we've been investing in significantly over the past few years and using those to deepen and individualize our relationships with people, individuals who come to us via the workplace channels, via our Group business and our Retirement full service business. And we see real progress in the strength of that value proposition.","I'll give you an example. Again, harkening back to Investor Day, last year, we spoke about the Pathways program. You'll recall this is the program by which some of our top Prudential advisors offer financial planning and financial education seminars to individuals who are employees of our Group and Retirement clients. I think the numbers we cited for you last year were that that program was being taken up by 250 companies, who collectively employ 3 million people plus. Today, those numbers are 350 companies who collectively employ 4 million people plus. And so that type of tangible benefit that we're able to offer to individuals and their employers is really resonating in the marketplace. And I'd say that was the major driver of our pickup in Group sales. And we're pleased not just by the overall quantum of that pickup, 27%, but by the composition of it as well, as Mark mentioned. About 40% of our sales growth occurred in the premier market, 100 to 5,000 lives, where we're really trying to build our presence. So, we feel very good about Group results in the quarter.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","This is Mark, just to add on. When we've talked about this in investor meetings, we've said that the first proof point on the wellness initiative will show up in Group sales. And I think from Steve you're hearing good early returns on that proof point.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. And then shifting gear to Investment Management. You talked about you have $7 billion of high fee gross inflows coming in, but offset by the $6.2 billion low fee index product. If we were to think about the fee differential between the inflows and the outflows, like how would you describe that in the current quarter?","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","I would say the differential couldn't be wider, Humphrey, quite frankly given the fact that the fee basis on the single large outflow was absolutely de minimis. This was a legacy, a passive strategy, which we don't do much of at all, that was part of a larger long-standing relationship. But the fee basis on this part of the business was absolutely inconsequential. And as it relates to our inflows, they continue to come from areas such as certain components of our fixed income business and our real estate business where we are able to continually \u2013 continue to attract very reasonable fees. All of this put together means that, even in an age where there's secular pressure on the fees inherent in active asset management, we've been able to keep our average fee basis across our entire book of business very, very constant in that 22 basis point range that we've cited to you before.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question here will come from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. The first question I had was just going back to the Annuities and the total asset requirement. Could you just describe, I guess, given the net outflows and given sort of some of the stuff that's running off might be a little bit more capital intensive, how quickly is that total asset requirement declining and how much would you expect that to contribute to capital deployment?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","So, Alex, it's Rob. I think about it less in terms of sort of that capital ratio and more in terms of the operating earnings that are coming off that business and because we're as well capitalized as we are, our ability to be fairly aggressive about dividending out our earnings in the form of free cash flow out of the business. So, if you look at PALAC in our Annuities business last year, we actually took out over $1 billion worth of dividends \u2013 or dividends and returns of capital from the business. And in the first quarter we took out in excess of $300 million in dividends from that business as well. And if you sort of look at the run rate of the business on an after-tax basis, that $300 million compares to around $400 million or so of earnings that we would report in the quarter. So, we feel very good about the dynamic that occurs on the capital side allowing us to be very aggressive about dividending out earnings.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And do you have flexibility to be sort of proactive and accelerate any of that to repurchase stock at more attractive share prices?","Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Well, so that's a different issue, which is how we feel about stock repurchase, so I'll belabor the question by simply saying recall that we increased both our dividend and our stock prices \u2013 our stock repurchases by 20% this year, to get us to the $0.90 quarterly rate on dividends and the $1.5 billion of stock buybacks. Obviously, we revisit this all the time. As we thought about that, that level of stock buybacks and dividends is sort of calibrated to our free cash flow ratio. We've brought that free cash flow ratio up to around 65% from where it was at 60% before. If you look at the dividends and the buybacks, it represents just under 60% of our earnings in the first quarter. So, you can sort of see we've got some flexibility against where we are, but we like to keep some room in that in order to be opportunistic to deploy some of our free cash flow towards growing the businesses, either organically or inorganically.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then can I sneak one last one in? On the International segment, can you give an update on how much of a headwind you'd expect low rates to be there? I mean it didn't appear to be having much of an impact this quarter. Will we start to see that later in the year?","John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.","No, I don't think so. Recall in Japan that we hedged the currency. And in terms of interest rates, we don't think it's going to be a headwind. The interest rates have been low, they remain low. We've been operating in a low environment for a long period of time. And so, I think we're comfortable with where we are.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","Brad, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead, sir.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. Given where evaluations have fallen this year in life insurance, as well as asset managers, can you talk about your interest in acquiring blocks, whole businesses, or even a traditional asset manager? Thank you for your answer.","Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.","John, this is Steve. I'll address your question as it relates to \u2013 as it relates to asset management. We certainly have been very successful in growing our business organically. The business that you see today is virtually entirely the product of organic growth. However, as we've mentioned before, we are open to opportunities for inorganic growth. However, in looking at those opportunities, we're very mindful of the importance of avoiding undue social disruption in the asset management business. And so, I think what you'll see or what we have a greater interest in is opportunities that might fit neatly into our multi-manager model, not necessarily opportunities that call for broad-based integration efforts across multiple asset classes, but rather things that can slot neatly into the overall architecture of our multi-manager model. Matters like this will probably naturally tend to be relatively smaller in size rather than deals of very, very large size, but nonetheless, we feel we can attractively utilize the capabilities that such efforts might bring us.","On the Life basis, we are always looking for ways to continue to bolster the mortality side of the mortality longevity equation that John mentioned in his opening comments. Certainly, our pretty strong sales levels are one way of doing that, but we also look at opportunities on the inorganic front, as well.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Great, thank you for your time.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website. John?","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Prudential. I'll be brief in order to leave time for Mark and Rob's more expansive comments, as well as for your questions.","To sum things up, regarding Q3, and in fact, year-to-date as well, Prudential has never performed better. In comparison to the third quarter of last year, EPS on an adjusted operating income increased 85% this quarter. Excluding the effect of market-driven and discrete items such as DAC unlocking from the result of each period, earnings per share increased by 32% from $1.81 in the third quarter of 2012, to $2.39 in the third quarter of 2013. And on the same basis, our earnings per share for the year-to-date amounted to $6.76. This is an increase of 37% from $4.95 in the first 3 quarters of 2012.","Our results thus far this year reflect the step-function increase in both the level of earnings and of ROE. Our focus on the productive deployment of capital, which was contemplated in our ROE objective first articulated 3 years ago, is clearly paying off. The successful execution of the Star and Edison acquisitions in Japan, the emerging success of the Hartford Life purchase and the addition of the large pension deals we've closed late last year are all contributing meaningfully to this year's results.","We've also realized strong organic growth across our businesses, consistent with our strong execution. Pricing discipline, expense and risk management and focus have all served us well in building both current results and future opportunities. Importantly, we've also balanced investments in our business with distribution of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","That said, our results also reflect certain items that, while very real, do tend to fluctuate. As we said last quarter, the things that tend to fluctuate have generally been fluctuating in a positive direction this year. In particular, we benefited from higher-than-expected income from non-component investments, especially in Gibraltar, and from favorable mortality, especially in Individual Life. All in all then, our businesses are performing exceedingly well and we've been helped by fairly strong tailwinds.","We're on a pace to achieve an ROE for the full year that meets or exceeds the top end of our stated ROE objective of 13% to 14% for 2013. We have a quarter to go to close the books on this year, but even then, we've never viewed our goal as a 1-year, once-and-done objective. As we've said, our goal is to achieve the 13% to 14% ROE in a way that's convincingly sustainable and then prove it out over a cycle.","To us, ROE is an outcome, not only a number. And our goal is to achieve and sustain superior performance. Doing so will be the financial manifestation of our unique business mix, the quality of our individual businesses, the talent of our people and really good teamwork and execution. And I have to say that in all of these areas, we have never felt better about the company and its prospects.","And with that, I'll stop and turn it over to Mark.","Mark B. Grier","Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you, all, for joining us and we appreciate the fact that we're competing with the Twitter story today. So we're glad you're interested in listening to what we have to say.","I'll take you through the results for the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital liquidity picture and our guidance for next year.","I'll start with Slide 2, an overview of our financial results for the quarter. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.94 for the third quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $1.59 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 32%, amounting to $2.39 compared to $1.81. On that basis, pretax earnings for our operating divisions increased 24% for the quarter. This increase is largely the result of organic growth in the base of account values and assets under management, driving higher fees in our U.S. businesses, reflecting both market appreciation and positive net flows over the past year; a greater contribution from investment results in our Retirement business, driven largely by the pension risk transfer business we've put on the books late last year; the contribution of the business we acquired from Hartford in January to our Individual Life results; and continued growth of our International Insurance business, which also benefited from strong investment results in the current quarter; and cost synergies, as we near completion of the Star and Edison integration.","On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $981 million for the current quarter. This includes the net effect of a charge to increase our embedded derivative liability for annuity living benefits, which was driven by our annual actuarial review. And it also includes a benefit to net income this quarter from the accounting impact of foreign currency remeasurements of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese insurance companies.","The comparison of book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, is affected significantly by the accounting geography mismatch from asset liability changes driven by foreign currency frustrations, where the impact on non-yen liabilities runs through the income statement while the offsetting impact on the assets is included in AOCI rather than in net income.","After adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of this mismatch, book value per share is $60.12 at the end of the third quarter, up $1.88 from year end, after the payment of 3 quarterly dividends totaling $1.20 per share. When we evaluate our ROE performance in relation to our goals, we also adjust for this accounting geography mismatch, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. After removing this benefit, along with a net benefit to results from actuarial unlockings and other market-driven and discrete items, our annualized ROE for the third quarter would be about 16%, reflecting the very strong performance of our businesses in the quarter.","Presented on Slide 3, this year's annual review of actuarial assumptions had a favorable impact of $280 million on pretax adjusted operating income or $0.38 per share. In our Annuities business, the main drivers of the favorable unlocking of $301 million were a reduction in our lapse assumptions and updates for expected benefit utilization based on emerging experience, along with some calculation refinements. The other charges and benefits from the annual review are largely offsetting. The most significant items were a $108 million charge in Gibraltar Life, primarily to strengthen reserves on a block of business that came to us in the Star and Edison acquisitions, driven mainly by observed benefit utilization; and also, a $45 million benefit in Group Insurance reflecting updates of both life and disability claims reserves based on experienced studies.","Slide 4 shows the remainder of this quarter's lift of market-driven and discrete items included in our results and it is short. In the Annuities business, the performance of our separate account funds reflecting the equity market increase in the quarter caused us to release a portion of our reserve for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and led to a favorable DAC unlocking, resulting in a benefit of $0.21 per share. Going the other way, charges for integration costs in the quarter totaled $0.04 per share.","In total, the items I just mentioned, including the impact of the annual actuarial review, had a favorable impact of $0.55 per share on third quarter results.","Slide 5 presents 2 views of our ROE trend. The blue bars are as reported, based on adjusted operating income and equity excluding AOCI. This view reflects the variability and results for market-driven and discrete items, including the impact of our actuarial reviews in the third quarter of each year, as well as the impact on ROE from fluctuations in the denominator due to foreign currency remeasurement. The gold bars provide a view of our ROE trend that is more indicative of our underlying performance by removing the impact of market-driven and discrete items and removing the impact of the foreign currency remeasurement that affects our book value through net income. On this basis, annualized ROE was 15.4% for the first 9 months of this year compared to 11.6% a year ago.","On a GAAP basis, our net income of $981 million for the Financial Services businesses in the third quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $556 million pretax, comprised of the items you see on Slide 6. The $1.7 billion loss from product-related embedded derivatives and hedging was largely driven by reducing our assumed level of lapses on variable annuity contracts based on our annual actuarial review. While lower assumed lapses contributed to a positive unlocking for our AOI results, they produced a charge here because of the capital markets assumptions we are required to use for embedded derivatives under GAAP.","Stepping away from the accounting treatment, greater persistency increases the present value of expected cash flows for the book of business under our base capital market assumptions, which include a 6% blended long-term annual rate of return, as we showed on our Investor Day, because the higher fees we collect outweigh the greater costs of the benefits. However, for product embedded derivatives, GAAP provides guidelines for capital markets assumptions to be used, both to project account value growth and to discount benefit payments, extending out decades into the future.","For example, under this quarter's GAAP calculation, the assumed blended annual long-term rate of return for account value growth is about 1.5%, with equities growing at 0.75% annually. These market inputs, when applied together with a greater persistency assumption, were the main drivers of a $1.5 billion increase in the embedded derivative liability, producing most of the $1.7 billion loss.","Foreign currency remeasurement was a positive item for our GAAP income statement this quarter. This remeasurement primarily represents changes in the value of non-yen liabilities relating to products denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies on the books of our Japanese companies whose functional currency is the yen. Strengthening of the yen produced a gain in the income statement because it would take less yen to pay off these liabilities. We consider this noneconomic because the liabilities are matched with assets in the currencies in which they will be settled. As I mentioned, the offsetting change in the yen value of the assets is in AOCI rather than net income. Impairments and credit losses on investments were small in the quarter.","Moving now to our business results and Slide 7. I'll start with our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses. Slide 7 shows a view of the results of these businesses and the adjustments we make for market-driven and discrete items to get a view of underlying performance relative to a year ago.","Slide 8 highlights the Annuity business. After adjusting for unlocking and experienced true-ups, Annuity results were $370 million for the quarter, an increase of $115 million from a year ago. Stripping out the impact of the unlockings and other one-off items we've disclosed, as we've done on Slide 9, in the gold bars, the trend of earnings for the Annuity business has outpaced our account value growth over the past year. Account values amounted to $147 billion at the end of the quarter, up 11% from a year ago. This increase was driven by market appreciation, together with about $4 billion of net flows, which mainly occurred last year and in the first quarter of this year. Our base policy charges on variable annuities are linked to daily account values. And with average separate account balances up 16% from the year-ago quarter, exceeding the point-to-point growth you see here, policy charges and fees were up 15% from a year ago. Our results also benefited from a reduced drag from distribution and other costs, which rose less rapidly than revenues, and also benefited from a more favorable back amortization rate as our gross profits have improved.","Turning to Slide 10, our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, in line with this year's second quarter but down from $5.9 billion a year ago. We regard our level of sales as an outcome rather than a target. And the current level of sales reflects actions we've taken over the past year to adapt our products to the current environment in order to maintain appropriate return prospects and improve our risk profile.","While leaving writer fees unchanged for our living benefit guarantees, we reduced the income payout rates at various age bands and eliminated the guaranteed doubling of protected withdrawal value after 12 years, when we introduced last February our current living benefit feature called Highest Daily Income or HDI 2.1.","In addition, over the past year, we've withdrawn our x shares or bonus product. We have suspended acceptance of subsequent premiums and generations of products offered before 2011. And we implemented a cap on subsequent purchase payments on more recent HDI products.","In addition, to maintain an appropriate balance between the value proposition to customers and compensation to our distribution partners. Early this year, we also reduced the commission rates that we pay.","Slide 11 highlights the Retirement business. After stripping out market-driven and discrete items, which include the impacts of our annual actuarial reviews in each year and a charge in the year-ago quarter to write off intangible assets relating to a business we acquired in 2008, earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $241 million for the current quarter, up $89 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited by about $80 million from a greater contribution from net investment results, driven largely by spread earnings from the 2 major pension risk transfer transactions that we closed late last year. The benefit from higher fees driven by account value growth was partly offset by higher expenses.","Total Retirement gross deposits and sales, shown on Slide 12, were $10.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to $6.4 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales amounted to $5 billion in the current quarter, compared to $3 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included $4.1 billion of stable value wrap products sold to plan sponsors, while the year-ago quarter included $2.5 billion of those sales.","Full service gross deposits and sales were $5.5 billion for the quarter, including a major case win of $1.3 billion. This compares to a total of $3.5 billion a year ago. Net flows remained in the positive column for the third consecutive quarter, with strong retention of existing cases. Total retirement net flows for the current quarter amounted to $3.4 billion. And account values stood at a record high $312 billion at the end of the quarter, up by more than $60 billion from a year ago, including about $32 billion from the pension risk transferred transaction late last year.","Slide 13 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $200 million for the current quarter, an increase of $11 million from a year ago. This increase was driven by higher asset management fees reflecting growth in assets under management, net of expenses. The segment's assets under management amounted to $848 billion at the end of the quarter, up 9% from a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the contribution from what we call other related revenues, which encompasses incentive, transactions, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, is variable in nature since it reflects changing valuations and timing of transactions. The contribution from these activities to current quarter results was $47 million, down by $24 million from a year ago, which partly offsets the growth in earnings that are driven by asset management fees.","Slide 14 shows our U.S. life insurance businesses, including the adjustments for the updates driven by our annual actuarial reviews and The Hartford integration costs.","Slide 15 highlights Individual Life. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, Individual Life reported earnings of $145 million for the current quarter, up $6 million from a year ago. The in-force block of business we acquired from Hartford contributed about $32 million. The business integration remains on track. We are building a unified distribution system, drawing on The Hartford's strength in financial institutions and our solid positioning in the brokerage general agency channel and are well into the process of integrating the product portfolios. Cost synergies are emerging in line with our expectations. The contribution from the acquired business was partly offset in the comparison of results by higher distribution costs, reflecting the expansion of our third-party distribution system, as well as higher current quarter sales and also partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment results.","Individual Life sales, on Slide 16, based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $165 million for the current quarter, including $53 million from the third-party distribution partners that came to us with The Hartford acquisition. This compares to total sales of $98 million a year ago. The current quarter sales increase was mainly driven by universal life products, with guaranteed universal life accounting for just over half of our current quarter sales. Our guaranteed universal life products have had strong demand in third-party distribution channels, including the financial institution distributors that came to us with The Hartford acquisition. We've taken steps to limit concentration and maintain appropriate returns, which have driven the sequential quarter declines in overall Individual Life sales that you see this year. These actions have included a series of price increases, most recently in July and October of this year, and we are discontinuing The Hartford's legacy guaranteed universal life product as part of our product portfolio transition. In addition, we implemented a cap last May on the amount of premium a client can invest when purchasing a contract. Because of the time span of the application and underwriting process, typically up to 4 months, we would expect these actions to have an increasing impact on our reported sales going forward.","Slide 17 highlights Group Insurance. After adjusting for the reserve refinements reflecting our annual actuarial reviews, Group Insurance earnings amounted to $23 million in the current quarter compared to $28 million a year ago. The decrease reflected higher expenses and a lower contribution from investment results, which together, more than offset improved claims experience in group life.","Slide 18 presents the results of our International Insurance business. Once again, adjusting for the refinements reflecting our annual actuarial reviews, integration costs and a China Pacific sale gain that benefited Gibraltar Life's results in the year-ago quarter.","Slide 19 highlights Life Planner operations. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our Life Planner business reported earnings of $405 million for the quarter, up $32 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by continued business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up by 7% from a year ago. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at 80 this year versus 85 last year, contributed a benefit of $13 million to earnings in comparison to a year ago.","Slide 20 highlights our Gibraltar and other international operations. After adjusting for the items I mentioned, Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $470 million for the current quarter, up $107 million from a year ago. The current quarter benefited from a contribution from investment results, about $50 million greater than a year ago. About half of this increase came from non-coupon investments mainly reflecting strong performance in Japanese real estate-related investments.","Third quarter results also reflected about $60 million of cost savings achieved thus far from the Star and Edison business integrations, compared to about $40 million in the year-ago quarter. The remainder of the increase came mainly from continued business growth and from improved mortality, which was about $10 million more favorable than the average contribution of the past 4 quarters. Current quarter results in Gibraltar also benefited by $11 million in the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates.","Turning now to the sales trend in International Insurance, shown on Slide 21. International Insurance sales, on a constant dollar basis, were $726 million for the current quarter, compared to $941 million a year ago. Our international sales pattern is affected by market developments, seasonality and actions we've taken such as repricings. The most dramatic impact on the sales pattern for the past 5 quarters is the surge in sales of Gibraltar's yen-based, bank-channel, single premium whole life product that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of last year, reflecting competitor actions earlier in the year, which limited the alternatives available to bank customers with substantial funds to invest in life insurance products. In order to limit our concentration in the product and maintain appropriate returns, we implemented crediting rate reductions and reduced commissions effective January 1 of this year, and we discontinued sales of the product at the end of September. A $280 million decline in sales of this product in the current quarter compared to a year ago more than offset an overall increase of $65 million or 11% for the remainder of our product portfolio.","Our sales tend to be seasonally strongest in the first and second quarters due to accelerated sales efforts toward the end of the fiscal year in Japan on March 31, and lump-sum payouts to retiring teachers that become available for investment in life insurance products during the second quarter. This seasonality effect is the main driver of the sales decline from the second quarter of this year to the current quarter.","Slide 22 breaks out Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $265 million in the current quarter compared to $271 million a year ago. As you see in the gold portion of the bars, sales of our U.S. dollar whole life and retirement income products in Japan amounted to $37 million in the current quarter, down from $46 million a year ago.","Changes in currency exchange rates have made products that are denominated in U.S. dollars about 25% more expensive to Japanese consumers in yen terms during the current quarter than they were a year ago. This has dampened demand for these products. The decline in these sales essentially offset an increase of $10 million or 8% in other products sold by Prudential of Japan.","Current quarter sales in our Life Planner operations outside of Japan were down $7 million from a year ago, driven by lower sales in Korea.","Slide 23 shows sales in Gibraltar Life. Sales in Gibraltar Life were $461 million in the current quarter compared to $670 million a year ago. Taking a look at the gold portions of the bars, you can see a $225 million decline in sales through the bank channel. This reflects the $280 million decrease in sales of the single premium yen-based product that I mentioned, partly offset by $50 million to $55 million greater sales of other products, mainly recurring premium death protection policies, good business.","Sales by Life Consultants are flat with the year-ago quarter. Over the past year, the Life Consultant count has declined by about 2,400 to roughly 9,300 at the end of the third quarter, which is consistent with our expectations as we near completion of the process of implementing minimum production requirements and other Gibraltar standards for the sales force that came to us with the Star and Edison acquisitions. The impact on sales from the decline in headcount was essentially offset by an increase in productivity, both in terms of policies sold per Life Consultant per month and in terms of average premium per sale. Sales by independent agents, which are largely in the small business market, are up $17 million from a year ago.","Slide 24 shows the results for Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $312 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $320 million loss a year ago after adjusting for market-driven and discrete items. The decrease in the loss reflects lower expenses in the current quarter.","And now, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Michael Falzon","Thanks, Mark. I'd like to give you an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility, and then address guidance for 2014.","Starting on Slide 25. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels consistent with what we believe are AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we manage to a 400% RBC ratio, which we believe gives us some cushion against our AA objective. We began the year with an RBC ratio above 450%. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio continues to be above 450% at Prudential Insurance after giving effects to The Hartford transaction and other activities in the first 9 months of the year.","Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 728% and 899%, respectively, as of June 30. These are comfortably above our 600% to 700% targets.","Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses on Slide 26, we calculate our on balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target, and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries.","At the end of last year, prior to funding the Hartford Life acquisition, our on balance sheet capital capacity was roughly $3 billion, of which $1.5 billion to $2 billion was readily deployable.","Through the first 9 months of this year, we funded The Hartford acquisition, declared 3 quarterly common stock dividends of $0.40 each, for a total of about $560 million, and repurchased $500 million of our common stock, totaling roughly $1.8 billion of capital deployment and returns of capital. These capital uses were more than offset by excess capital generated within our businesses, resulting in available on balance sheet capital capacity of about $3.5 billion at September 30, including about $1.5 billion that we consider readily deployable.","As you know, we announced a new $1 billion repurchase authorization in June, which extends through June 30 of next year. We executed $250 million of share repurchases during the third quarter under this authorization.","Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. This reflects senior debt issuance of $1 billion, as well as $500 million of senior debt that matured during the quarter. Our recent issuance prefunded $350 million of debt that will mature in 2014.","The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing debt, fund operating needs or redeploy over time.","Now I'd like to talk about our earnings guidance for 2014. Let's start by reviewing the key assumptions and considerations that underpin our guidance as summarized on Slide 27. First, to level set. Through the first 9 months of 2013, our earnings per share, excluding items we identified as market-driven and discrete, was $6.76. Recall that throughout the year, as we discussed our results, we called out additional items that tend to fluctuate and were, in the aggregate, tailwinds to results including excess returns on our non-coupon investments and favorable mortality in relation to average expectations. Adjusting for these items, as if they were roughly in line with midpoint expectations or historical averages, provides a run rate of approximately $6.50 per share for the first 9 months or about $8.65 per share on an annualized basis. We believe this provides an appropriate starting point for our 2014 guidance.","Our guidance assumes a 2013 ending S&P 500 level of 1,760, which is near to today's S&P, and then 6% growth for 2014. Our international insurance business nondollar earnings are hedged and therefore, locked in at JPY 82, and KRW 1,150 to the U.S. dollar. Interest rates were assumed to follow a yield curve based on current rates.","Lastly, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 28%. Pulling all of this together, our 2014 earnings guidance range for our Financial Services businesses on an adjusted operating income basis is $8.75 to $9.25 per share.","Now I'll turn it back to John.","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And we'd now like to open it up to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question, just on in the quarter, maybe the below the line charge, the $1.7 billion. You talked about it primarily related to lapses. And I think back at the Investor Day in June, when you walked through all the cash flows and MCV scenarios, you talked about lowering the lapse assumptions for those that were outside of the surrender charge period from 10% in 2012 to 9%. So I'm wondering if that's what this charge is related to or if you've done something else in terms of refining assumptions, maybe inside surrender charge period?","Robert Michael Falzon","Chris, it's Rob Falzon. No, that's on point. What we did is we further updated that base lapse assumption. We brought it down from -- brought it from 9% down to 7%. We also tinkered with the dynamic lapse assumption and the sensitivity of customer behavior to the in-the-money-ness of their policy, and the combination of those 2 are the primary drivers to the $1.7 billion that you're looking at.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the dynamic lapse assumption that moved from 5 4 to about where?","Robert Michael Falzon","Well, that's a very difficult thing to calibrate because it's a slope, so it sort of depends on where on the curve you are. But the order of magnitude of change would be sort of in the same range as what you're looking at on the base lapse assumption.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, regarding variable annuities. I mean, you've sort of stabilized here that the $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion range. We did see a competitor to a reinsurance arrangement. I'm just wondering your thoughts, given the distribution and how strong of a distribution channel you guys have, if that's something you would consider given the demand still appears to be there kind of across the industry for VA products.","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure. Chris, this as Charlie. We think that those kind of transactions are all about diversifying risk. And we review our risk management strategies for our living benefit guarantees on an ongoing basis. And while we've looked at reinsurance and we'll continue to look at Prudential reinsurance transactions up until this point, they haven't been as compelling to us. So we approach the issues in a slightly different way. First, we lowered sales to an appropriate level relative to our overall business mix, so we're down about 60% from year-over-year. Second, we lowered the risk profile of our existing VA product, as Mark described. And third, we've diversified and are continuing to diversify our product range into other products with different or complementary risk profiles. So for an example, we launched our PDI product earlier this year, which has no equity risk because it's based on fixed income. So we'll continue to look for ways to add products to diversify risk further, as well as continue to look at reinsurance where it might make sense both to our existing book and on a prospective basis.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. One last quick one, then I'll get back in the queue. Just, Mark, you guys, you accepted the non-bank SIFI designation. So wondering if you can give us any kind of additional comments in terms of maybe the decision why not to move ahead with legal action and then any other kind of updated thoughts or developments here over the past couple of months?","Mark B. Grier","Yes. The decision not to pursue this issue in court was a business judgment that was made by management and the board. And we believe it's the best decision for the company. We, by the way, I would say, have a fundamental difference of opinion with respect to the liquidity basis for designation. However, we also believe that, moving on is the right thing for us to do and that we will now continue to play a constructive role in the development of things like capital standards and the supervisory framework, and so we're moving on with it. In terms of where we stand, our supervisory, regulatory and capital regimes are all evolving. We'll be fully cooperative and responsive with respect to the supervision by the Federal Reserve and we'll seek opportunities to provide constructive input on issues that are important, like capital standards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of things. First, I wanted to again follow-up on the lapse assumption change and the discussion of GAAP versus economics. The returns that were assumed under GAAP, that's what came out of your stochastic modeling?","Robert Michael Falzon","Steven, it's Rob Falzon. No, on the -- our -- unless we're talking about the GMWB, to be clear. Our GMWB falls under FAS 157\/133. Under that accounting, we use risk neutral accounting for it, so it's not stochastic modeling. It's actually a market-neutral view of that liability that uses market rates for returns as opposed to best estimates for return. So by way of example, Mark highlighted them in his talking points upfront, that's the calculation that has equities earning 75 basis points, fixed income earning 2.25 over the life for a blended return on the account values of 1.5%. So it's not a stochastic modeling of expected account values but rather the risk-neutral view of that.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'll take this up Neal and where those numbers come from, I guess. Quickly, just looking at the guidance, just a couple of questions. Is share repurchase assumed in this?","Robert Michael Falzon","We don't provide guidance on share repurchases specifically, Steven. I think, as you know, our board authorized $1 billion of stock buybacks in June of this year. That extends from June of next year and out of that $1 billion, we implemented $0.25 billion in the third quarter.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, one more, if I may. The Japanese consumption tax, how much do you think that's going to affect earnings for 2014?","Edward P. Baird","This is Ed Baird responding. Not by a lot, because the consumption tax is applicable to third party. And third party is a smaller portion of our distribution than it is for some other companies that you may be monitoring on this. So we don't anticipate any material impact next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to get some of the annuity lapses, [ph] I understand this is a GAAP charge, but any implications for your statutory results, either for this quarter or for year end, cash flow testing?","Robert Michael Falzon","Nigel, it's Rob. It's a good question. There is a statutory impact as a result of the charge that we took. However, that impact is entirely offset within our PrucoRe entity where these writers reside by the gains that we have from the macro interest rate hedge we have within that entity. So as a result of that, there will be no capital capacity impact as a result of this assumption update.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Got it. Second, just in looking at the results. Obviously, one of the key areas of the upside was the non-coupon investments at Gibraltar. So I was just hoping to get some color regarding the size of the equity in real estate portfolio housed in Japan? And if we go back longer over the time frame, just beyond the last 4 quarters, what's sort of like a normalized return you would expect to generate from those investments?","Eric Durant","Nigel, it's Eric. Let me deal with the normalized return aspect of your question. The truth is we don't know what a normal return there is. So let me just give you some numbers. In all of last year, the contribution of income on non-coupon investments at Gibraltar was $97 million. For the year-to-date through September -- and in the third quarter, by the way, it was $71 million. For the year-to-date through September, it was $176 million. I think, you're on your own in coming up with what you would consider a normal level of income from those investments to be. As for the size of the portfolio, basically, are 3 different pieces here. There are equities that we own that generate dividend income but the equities themselves are not mark-to-market. There is directly-owned real estate and then there are fund investments generally in the form of a limited partnership. And the vast majority of the growth from 2012 to, so far, in 2013 has come from the fund investments and reflects a very favorable market conditions, both equities and real estate in Japan.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if you were to put those 3 buckets together, what will be -- can you provide the aggregate size or is that something you haven't disclosed?","Eric Durant","The aggregate size at Gibraltar, I don't think, is a very meaningful number, frankly, but I'll answer the question. It's about $3 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just another question on, first, the VA charge, just wondering how you're thinking of the charge. Is it more because you've underestimated the economic liability? Or it seems like it's more just because of very conservative market assumptions embedded in U.S. GAAP. And then, if the market does perform better than what's embedded in the charge, would some of that charge reverse over time? So that's the first question. And then, secondly, for Charlie, on the disability, the loss that you show, if we adjust for the actuarial assumption change, I think was around 96%, which is worse than where it was before. So maybe just talk about what you're seeing in the disability business, what drove the deterioration there and just progress on your repricing initiatives.","Robert Michael Falzon","So Jimmy, it's Rob. I'll answer the first question and turn it over to Charlie. In terms of our view of assumption updates, there's an accounting outcome and that's programmatic, and I think we've described for you how that math is done and you could place your own judgments as to how conservative that is. We gave you the reinvestment rates. They result in particularly large claims, way out in the future when the account values grow at those very modest levels. And then those claims are discounted back at a LIBOR curve or the swap curve at a very low rate, which reflects today's rates. When we look at our own expected case modeling for purposes of our anticipated cash flows, as a result of the assumption update, we believe there's been a significant increase in the present value of our cash flows associated with this book of business. And so that's kind of our economic lens on that. In terms of the second part of your question, which is the reversion, yes, to the extent that through the 1 33, it's going to always be marked at market through the swap curve; to the extent that we actually realize better returns than are forecasted, will result in reversions going toward us at points in the future.","Mark B. Grier","So just to be clear, the economics are better when lapses go down but the accounting is worse. It's a point we made on Investor Day, and your question is right on point. Charlie?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Okay. Well, let me answer Jimmy's second question, which has to do with disability and the benefit ratios. So the disability ratio this quarter was -- on a normalized basis, was 96% versus the year-ago of 96.5%. So we've come down slightly. It is worse than it was last quarter, which was 93.2%. Now we said the process wasn't going to be linear and that we're going to kind of grind the ratio back down, is the words we've been using, and that's exactly what we're doing. But if you look at incidents, severity and termination for a moment, third quarter to third quarter where we did see improvement, incidents decreased, severity was slightly higher but terminations increased. And I'll come back to termination in a second because that's an important part of the equation. Third quarter and second quarter, we have both incidents and severity both increase somewhat, severity more than incidents, which more than offset the increase in terminations. So you did have a little bit of a backstep there. But I think the issue and the important issues, we've been working really hard on claims management. And the terminations in both cases have gone up. So we're dealing with the problem. We're about 1\/3 of the way through it at this point. We're repricing certain cases. We're letting others lapse and we're working on the terminations themselves, which are showing material improvement. So we'll get there but it isn't going to be linear. But if you look on a sort of 4-quarter rolling average, I think you'll see improvement as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on the International business, if you can talk a little bit about your outlook for sales? And are you expecting growth to reaccelerate in 2014 as some of the noise from the tough comps in the single premium sales subsides?","Edward P. Baird","Yes. Let me explain a little bit about what happened in this quarter and then might lay a foundation from which you can drive some of your own extrapolations. So the overall drop was driven, as Mark pointed out, primarily by what happened in the bank. And that was a targeted reduction. The single premium product, which dominated last year much of the bank distribution of the roughly $1.4 billion last year, about $900 million of it was single premium. That product can work pretty well in a flat or rising interest rate environment, but in a dropping interest rate environment, it's not a product we want to be in. And that's why, as you'll recall, over the earlier course of the year, we put in a series of constraints, which culminated in ultimately our shutting the product down. So that's a big number that has dropped out of the overall production. If you then switch over to the -- and I think, by the way, within bank channel, you will see growth over time, but it will take time for that recurring premium growth to make up for the loss in the single premium. So that drop was precipitous and intended, whereas the growth equally intended would be more gradual. If you look over on the Life Consultant side, the flat sales is actually extremely good news for the reason that Mark pointed out. We were able to achieve essentially the same sales in this quarter as we did this time last year through Life Consultant, but with 2,400 fewer salespeople, which allows us to reduce agencies, real estate, et cetera. So that's about a 20% reduction in the headcount, which was fully made up for about equally between productivity measured in number of sales and the average premium. Those 2 are very healthy signs for this business going forward. I anticipate that the headcount, the reduction, our rate will slow down, gradually stabilize. And as a result, we'll follow precisely the pattern we followed a decade ago when we took Kyoei, now Gibraltar, to the same pattern. And if you look at the Life Planner, that was down a little bit, but I'm not so much concerned about that because of where the drop came from. As you well know, 3 factors drive sales. The headcount, which in the case here, continues to be pretty healthy at around 4%. That's probably as good as we can continue that in light of the emphasis on quality. The productivity actually rose slightly. So the only place where there was a drop, which produced the overall drop in Life Planner sales, was in the average premium. And that dropped relatively substantially by about 8%. I'm not too concerned about that. I view that as episodic, not in any way indicative. And the reason I say that is if you look back over the last 4 or 5 years, a lot of our sales growth was driven by, on average, about a 4% to 5% increase year-by-year in the average premium. So typically, what we have had and what I anticipate recurring again in the future is you get about a 4% growth in headcount, you get maybe a 4% or 5% growth in the average premium, you get a smidgen out of productivity and that gets you to the double-digit, which has characterized the historic pattern and I would expect us to return to that in the future. I hope that's somewhat helpful.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And then you mentioned some of the sales of U.S. dollar products have declined a bit given the movements in the currency. So are you seeing customers shift to yen-denominated products? And then can you just talk about how you're positioned in the yen-denominated market and whether you earn the same margins on yen-denominated products as you do on the dollar-denominated?","Edward P. Baird","Yes. The yen-denominated product, at least on the retirement income side, is very common product in the small business market, which is a significant market for our life planners, particularly some of our more experienced and successful life planners. The dollar-denominated one is used more traditionally in the individual market for the purposes evidenced by its name, retirement income. So you get a number of factors here. Part of it is the currency factor. But it's difficult to isolate that because there has also been rate increases on both currency-based products over the last year, 1.5 years. So it's a little hard to know precisely what might be driving it. But I will point out that the dollar-denominated retirement income has been the lead product in Life Planners, specifically in POJ, for probably 5, 6 years now. And over that period of time, you will have seen that the currency rate has fluctuated rather dramatically. So I wouldn't attribute too much significance to just a single quarter's movement in the currency. I suspect you will see this retain its position as a lead product for POJ regardless of currency movements.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And any comment just on the relative margin between yen and dollar-denominated?","Edward P. Baird","They tend not to -- over time, over a cycle of movements on the interest rates, they tend to be priced in relatively the same region, so it has a lot more to do with what's going on in at any one particular time in the capital market than it does, necessarily, what we're targeting in our pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Rob, you talked in your presentation about spending $1.8 billion between Hartford, buybacks, dividends, et cetera, and total available capital grew by about $500 million, so that gets you to kind of $2.3 billion, if you will, of implied capital generations, which annualizes to somewhere around $3 billion. And I guess, my first question is, is that the right way to think about capital generation going forward? Were there things in this particular first 9 months that kind of would influence that one way or the other? What is your outlook on '14?","Robert Michael Falzon","Well, Mark, let me try to answer your question without giving an outlook on '14, and tell you how I sort of think about the framework for capital capacity and capital generation. Start with the net income of the business. So if you look through -- and adjust that for the noneconomic things. So we always start with our capacity that we had at the end of last year, that was around $3 billion. We had net income, before FX remeasurement and NPR, of about $2.2 billion, if you did that calculation. And then deduct from that the capital deployment things that I called out to you, which was the combination of dividends, the stock repurchases and The Hartford acquisition. As a result of that, you had the difference between those 2 is about $0.5 billion worth of positive capital net generation. There are a number of other things that run through for the first 9 months of the year. However, all those other things wash each other out. And so when you look at where we were at the end of last year and where we are as of September, it's about that $0.5 billion difference between what we generate in earnings and what we redeployed in the 3 ways that I described. There are times when we have other things moving through capital capacity but that's not creating a lot of noise in this particular year.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe just moving to guidance a little bit. You just -- you kind of framed out $8.65 as a reasonable starting point. The low end of the range is $8.75. And I guess what I'm interested in is there -- are there any businesses that as we look out to '14, where if you kind of eliminate kind of the non-coupon investments or favorable mortality or kind of some of the non-kind-of-trendable stuff, putting that to the side, are there any of the businesses that you're expecting kind of pressured earnings relative to what we've seen in '13 kind of, in a sense, net earnings to go down, if you will?","Robert Michael Falzon","Well, in our guidance, we're not providing anything specific at a business level, Mark, so I actually can't respond to your question directly. Just to be clear, the starting number that I gave you, we did eliminate the excess non-coupon and the excess mortality. And so that's out of the numbers on an enterprise level basis. But the guidance we're providing is at an enterprise level without bringing it down any further.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. One more if I just may. What was the actual statutory charge on lapse? I think you alluded to it, saying it was offset by the macro hedge, but what was the actual impact?","Robert Michael Falzon","So if you look at the -- recall that our account -- statutory accounting for this particular product follows what we call a modified GAAP, so it's not traditional stat. And so if you look at the change in the hedge target, that would have been about $1.4 billion.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that was fully offset by macro?","Robert Michael Falzon","I'm sorry?","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that was fully offset by the macro hedge?","Robert Michael Falzon","That's the reserve charge. When you look at the capital implications of that, you have to tax effect it. And then we have to add to that some additional risk capital that we had to put in. So the net capital number, absent that reserve charge, that's what ran through the P&L in the statutory books, would have been about roughly $1 billion. And yes, it was $1.1 billion and it was entirely offset by the gains that we had on the macro hedge.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","In a rising equity and interest rate environment? I'm just confused about how the macro hedge would have offset that?","Robert Michael Falzon","It's a cumulative gain on the macro hedge, not just a quarter's gain. So it was the gain that we had in there that we never count as part of our capital capacity. And generally, you have -- it's a protection against rising interest rates, so it gains as rates rise.","Mark B. Grier","It's the famous under hedge.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","The Individual Annuity's core ROA was up to about 102 basis points in the quarter. If the equity market kind of follows the path in your 2014 guidance assumption, should we think about that as a sustainable type of margin going forward?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","I think so. Because if you -- this is Charlie, by the way. If you look at the drivers of that, it was really an increased margin from increasing fees and less increasing expenses. And so that drove the ROA, along with a lower take [ph] factor. So the combination of that and if you extrapolate out our assumption, should be that, that's a sustainable margin going forward.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And then, on statutory cash flow testing, as we head into the end of the year, I guess, last year, you added a pretty substantial amount for your long-term care business, I guess, relative to its modest size. With interest rate up in 2013, could we see some reversal of that reserve add from last year?","Robert Michael Falzon","Ryan, it's Rob. I'm not going to speculate on what interest rates will do in the future. What I will tell you is that when you look at the -- I think, I can give you the rates that we set our AAT at last year, and then you can make your own forecast as to what that may do in the future. You've just got to give me 1 second to run that down. I would say, the rates on -- that we set at the time that we set up the reserve for long-term care were significantly below today's rates. I'll have to -- rather than scamp around now and try to find it, I can follow-up with you and give you that number.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And I guess -- I'll follow-up.","Robert Michael Falzon","Actually, let me just follow-up, Ryan, when we set the rates -- as of September, where we set the rates a year ago versus today, we're about 56 basis points higher than when the LRR was established last year. Specific answer to your question.","Mark B. Grier","There are a lot of moving parts in this, but the gist of your point is that the directional impact of higher rates is good. But again, there are a lot of moving parts.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just to follow-up on the run rate and annuities, I understand that you don't give sales targets in annuities. If just thinking about that ROA is sustainable, it's fair to say that we're assuming that today's level of sales is a good base level, is that correct?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","I think what we'd say there is that we're comfortable with the level of sales we have today and sort of leave it at that, right? We wanted to reduce the level of sales, and we did because we think about a number of different aspects when we think about level of sales. One is the product and making sure it's profitable and we've taken steps in that direction. Second is to ensure that it still fulfills the customer need and it appears to be doing so. And the third is the overall percentage of business mix. And Mark and John talked a lot about business mix overall. And that can be a governing factor. So between those 3 variables, we come up with what we like to think of as a level of sales which we'd be comfortable with, and we think we're comfortable with the level of sales we have now.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just a follow-up question in terms of the share repurchase authorization and understanding that you're not going to give any specific buyback guidance. With you no longer formally challenging the SIFI designation, from a process standpoint, is there anything different in this quarter from last quarter in terms of being able to go into the market and repurchase shares?","Mark B. Grier","Well, capital planning, broadly, will be part of the supervision process with the Federal Reserve, yes.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And in terms of this quarter, even though there's no formal restriction yet, any action will need to have a discussion with the Fed, is that correct?","Mark B. Grier","I would characterize it more the way I just said it, which is pretty general and that is that capital planning is one of the issues that will be part of our supervisory process. I don't want to be more specific than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Kenneth Lee filling in for Eric Berg. I just have a question on pension transfers. We're seeing an environment of rising equity rates. Equity markets is presumably helping out pension funding levels for corporations. So just curious if, on balance, you guys are seeing more or less interest among corporate clients for pension transfers?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Sure. It's Charlie. Clearly, the funding ratios have gotten better. If you look at the latest Mercer study, you see that the average funding ratio is probably around 91% or so, with interest rates and equity markets rising. But I think it's fair to break the market down into 3 different segments. And the first is what we call 0 to $1 billion, maybe 0 to $2 billion. And that's mainly a cash market. And there's always a certain number of these transactions that are done year in and year out. And we have seen a slight uptick in activity here but this is pretty much business as usual. And there are lots of competitors in this space, especially in the 0 to $1 billion range, so I'd say a little bit more here but more or less business as usual. Then you get to $2 billion to $4 billion range, there's definitely more activity in this range. There are more conversations taking place with clients, and there's a lot more consultant activity here as well. And this is either a cash or, at the upper end of the range, kind of an in-kind market so there are less competitors here, but we're definitely having more conversations in this range. And then finally you get to the jumbo range, which is what we characterize as $4 billion and above. And here, what I would say is that we're having the same number of conversations but the intensity of those conversations and specificity of those conversations has increased. Now as we've always said, these will be episodic and they have a very long lead time, so conversations are absolutely happening. And here, there are far few players in the market. So I think you can segment it into 3 different areas but, in general, I think there are more conversations taking place, and at the upper end of the market the intensity has increased.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Two questions. The first one is on the Full Service Retirement business. I noticed that you had a large case win during the quarter. And I do recall you expressing some disinterest in this business going forward, given the competition and the pressure on fees. So I'm wondering if you've had either a change of heart or if conditions have gotten better?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Okay. We have not had a change of heart in terms of profitability. I think the conditions have gotten better. I think, your -- and you recall -- your recollection is correct in that 2 or 3 years ago, we expressed some concern over the pricing in the industry and we pulled back and, in fact, had negative lows for a number of quarters, and that, I think, reflects the discipline we showed. But what we're seeing in this market, it's interesting, is more RFP activity in part because we think some of the HR departments are less focused on health care going forward. They've kind of looked at that and now are refocused on their plans. So we see more RFP activity, which is, we think, real. In other words, not as many check bids in the marketplace, and so there's a little more plan turnover. What I'd also say is that we've seen some price stability in the marketplace. Pricing was going down for a period of time, it seems to have stopped as plan sponsors realize they can only squeeze so much out of a rock before they start losing in service. And so we have -- what we've seen is that we are not necessarily the low bid and we are still winning some plans because they've gone back to looking at service and quality. Now you can't be way out of line, but you can -- you don't have to necessarily be the lowest price in order to win the business. Service and quality are absolutely factors that are coming back into play. So we're not going to win every case. We still have our price discipline, but there are cases that we are winning and the pipeline looks pretty good going forward.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","And are you talking about the large case market?","Charles Frederick Lowrey","Large and mid-case market.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Large and mid-case. Okay. And then just for Mark, I've been reading a little bit about the language coming out of Washington concerning the Volcker Rule. And it sounds like it's going to be a lot more tougher than maybe some Wall Street executives think. I'm wondering, have you been able to assess what you've been hearing in Washington about how the Volcker Rule could potentially impact life insurers, especially their prospective hedging activity?","Mark B. Grier","Well, the short answer to that is no. This is still very much evolving and there's a lot of input flying toward Washington about the consequences of a number of aspects of the Volcker Rule. And we don't have a very good picture at this point of what that might mean for us. However, hedging activities are core to our business. And these are not proprietary trading type activities that would be the target at least of the spirit of the Volcker Rule. We use derivatives to reduce risk, not to increase risk.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Mark, do they understand the whole issue of the derivatives liability? Because it seems to me that the Feds don't understand the life insurance business and the whole complexity that we've been discussing on this call about the VA charge, I think, it would really confuse the Fed.","Mark B. Grier","Well, certainly, the complexity and lack of transparency, combined with volatility and size of the embedded derivative liability in the Annuity business is important. I would say that we have opportunities to work hard on explaining this and focusing on the economics versus the accounting, and working with the regulators to get pointed in the right direction around a sensible economic solution to thinking about risk and capital.","Operator","And today's conference call will be available for replay after 2:00 p.m. today until midnight, November 14.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead.","Eric Durant","Thank you very much, and thanks to all of you for joining our call. In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements on Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the first quarter of 2012, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com.","In addition, in managing our businesses, we use a non-GAAP measure we call adjusted operating income to measure the performance of our Financial Services businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses as adjusted and related charges and adjustments, as well as results from divested businesses. Adjusted operating income also excludes recorded changes in asset values that are expected to ultimately accrue to contract holders and recorded changes in contract holder liabilities, resulting from changes in related asset values.","Our earnings per share press release contains information -- our earnings press release contains information about our definition of adjusted operating income. The comparable GAAP presentation and the reconciliation between the 2 for the quarter are set out in our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website. ","Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Rich Carbone, Chief Financial Officer; Charlie Lowrey, Head of Domestic Businesses; Ed Baird, Head of International Businesses; and Peter Sayre, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We'll begin with prepared comments and then we'll take your questions. John?","John Robert Strangfeld","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Rich and Mark will review our financial results with you in detail in a few minutes. I'd like to begin with some high-level comments on the quarter and on our outlook. Our earnings this quarter reflected our poor results in Group Insurance. With that important exception, underlying performance of our businesses and the company overall continues to be favorable. As you know, Group Insurance includes life and disability operations. In Group Disability, we have clear performance issues, and we are moving aggressively to address and correct them. ","On the other hand, Group Life has generally been performing reasonably well. Although we had an unfavorable underwriting result this quarter, we believe this resulted in adverse fluctuation not an indication of fundamental deterioration in the business. You may have seen the Group Insurance is under new leadership effective last month. Steve Pelletier, a proven executive who most recently ran our annuities business is now at the helm reporting to Charlie Lowrey. Bob O'Donnell has succeeded Steve as head of the Prudential Annuities. Bob is intimately familiar with our annuities business and is ideally suited to his new role. ","Under Steve's leadership, you can be sure that we will be comprehensively reviewing all facets of Group Insurance and will make all needed changes. Our other businesses are doing well. In Annuities, sales for the quarter amounted to just under $5 billion, essentially in line with their levels since last year second quarter. Stripping out the benefit of favorable unlockings, earnings increased from last year's strong first quarter. In Retirement, flows in institutional investment products remain strong marginally because of growth in our investment-only wrap products. Our sales, again, included a meaningful longevity reinsurance case as we continue to pursue attractive pension risk transfer businesses. In full service retirement, we again experienced net outflows from case activities as we are maintaining pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment. Asset management, once again, recorded excellent institutional and retail flows. Although variable sources of earnings were relatively unfavorable this quarter, this business continues to perform well. ","Individual Life also delivered solid earnings this quarter and a healthy increase in sales as our competitors have raised prices making our products more competitive. Finally, International Insurance is benefiting from business growth and cost savings from the Star and Edison integration. Sales are strong in all distribution channels: captive agents, banks and independent agencies. All in all, Prudential is performing well with the exception of Group Insurance, which we are addressing. In addition, our balance sheet and capital position remain significant sources of strength and flexibility, and it's still early days in 2012. As for our 2013, ROE goal 13% to 14%, we never said it would be easy and we still believe it's achievable. We look forward to seeing you May 22 at our New York Investor Day. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rich Carbone. Rich?","Richard J. Carbone","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We reported common stock earnings per share of $1.56 in the first quarter based on adjusted operating income, and of course, that's for the financial services business. This compares to $1.62 per share in the year-ago quarter, and both periods give effect to the new accounting standard for debt. ","We have only 2 items, 2 market-driven discrete items affecting this quarter. In the annuities business, the equity market increase in the quarter caused us to release a portion of our reserve for guaranteed minimum debt and income benefits and led to a favorable DAC unlocking resulting in a benefit totaling $0.30 per share. Going the other way, in International Insurance, Gibraltar Life absorbed integration costs of $0.08 per share relating to the Star and Edison acquisition. In total, the items I just mentioned had a net favorable impact of about $0.22 per share on results. Year-ago quarter benefited about $0.23 per share from the impact of favorable unlockings and reserve releases, and a gain on the partial sale of our indirect investment in China Pacific Group. These were partially offset by transaction and integration costs of $0.08 per share related to the Star and Edison acquisition and costs from the earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan. Taking these items out of both quarters, EPS comparison would be $1.34 for the current quarter versus $1.39 for the quarter a year ago. This comparison, as John mentioned, is adversely affected by Group Insurance primarily from adverse claims experience and from asset management related to what we call ITSICOM [ph], that's incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. These 2 businesses had a negative impact of about $0.17 per share in comparison to the year-ago quarter. And Mark will cover this in more detail in his remarks. ","Moving to the GAAP results of our Financial Services business, we reported a net loss of $988 million or $2.09 per share. For the first quarter, this compares to net income of $539 per share -- million per share -- that'd be great -- $539 million or $1.10 per share a year ago. The net loss for the quarter includes amounts characterized as pretax net realized investment losses of $1.8 billion. This compares to $375 million or pretax net realized investment losses in the year-ago quarter. The main driver of the $1.8 billion current quarter loss was $1.5 billion of asset and liability value changes, driven essentially by currency fluctuations. ","Now for those CPAs in the room, if you pay attention here, we'll give you CPA credits for the rest of the next few paragraphs. We regard this as a noneconomic accounting driven by U.S. dollar and other non-yen liabilities on the books of the Japanese companies. For example, we have significant U.S. dollar-denominated products in our Japanese businesses. These assets and liabilities -- the assets and liabilities associated with these products are both denominated in U.S. dollars. When the value of the yen changes versus the U.S. dollar, the change in U.S. dollar liabilities on the Japanese books runs through the yen income statement. This is noneconomic because our liability is in U.S. dollars and is matched with U.S. dollar assets, so nothing is happening. In consolidation, back to U.S. dollars, this income statement impact is offset by an adjustment made to OCI, a component of equity not through the income statement. The end result is that our GAAP equity, which includes OCI, AOCI, is essentially neutral despite the volatility in reported net income. The impact of this accounting geography is greater than in the past because of our non-yen business that came to us with the Star\/Edison acquisition. The remaining $300 million of the $1.8 billion of realized losses came from net losses of $291 million in product-related hedging activities and $128 million of impairments and credit losses, partly offset by net gains of general portfolio activities. Book value per share on a GAAP basis amounted to $70.80 at the end of the first quarter, this compares to $69.07 at year-end. Our current and historical values all reflect new DAC accounting change or standard. ","At the end of the first quarter, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturities were $2.7 billion, down from $4.3 billion at year-end, and we were at a net unrealized gain position of $13 billion. Book value per share, excluding total accumulated other comprehensive income declined $2.17 from year end and amounted to $55.85 at the end of the first quarter. We are now excluding all of AOCI from our ROE calculations, which we believe is consistent with our peers. ","Now turning to our capital position. First, I will focus on the insurance companies. We continue to manage these entities to capital levels, consistent what we believe are AA standards. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported RBC ratio of 491%. The total adjusted capital of DAC of $12 billion on a statutory basis. We don't do a quarterly -- a quarterly bottoms-up calculation of RBC, but I can tell you that the key drivers of statutory capital have not materially changed since year end. We have not yet taken a dividend for Prudential Insurance so far this year. Our Japanese insurance companies will soon report solvency margins as of their March fiscal year end based on the new calculation method, which is now effective. As a result of the merger of the Star\/Edison -- Star and Edison companies into Gibraltar as of January 1, Gibraltar solvency margins will reflect the absorption of the acquired companies. While the calculations are not final, we estimate that both Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar will report solvency margins in the 700% range. These solvency margins are strong in relation to our targets, and will continue to position our companies as well-capitalized and financially secure insurers. ","Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services business, we calculated our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position in Prudential Insurance that I've mentioned a moment ago, to 400 RBC ratio benchmark, and then add capital capacity at the parent and other subsidiaries. As of year end, we estimated that our on balance sheet capital capacity was about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. It does not change materially through the end of this quarter. We also estimated that as of year end, about half of the $404.5 billion of capital capacity was readily deployable. This proportion has not changed substantially through the end of the first quarter either. Considering the impact of our results, the capital we've deployed in our businesses and the $250 million we returned to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In the aggregate, we have repurchased $1,250,000,000 under the current $1.5 billion authorization, which extends through June of 2012. ","Turning to the cash position, the cash position at the parent company -- cash and short-term investments at the parent, net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to $3 billion at the end of the quarter. We continue to target maintaining a $1 billion cushion at the parent company. The excess of our cash position over this target is available to repay maturing debt, fund the operating expense -- operating needs and expenses, obviously, and to be redeployed over time. And Mark will cover our businesses in detail.","Mark B. Grier","Thank you, Rich and John, and good morning, good afternoon or good evening. I'll start with our U.S. businesses. Our Annuity business reported adjusted operating income of $421 million for the first quarter compared to $274 million a year ago. The reserve  true-ups and DAC unlocking that Rich mentioned had a net favorable impact of $196 million on current quarter results. This includes the benefit of $136 million from the release of a portion of our reserves for guaranteed minimum death  and income benefits and a further benefit of $60 million from reduced amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, in both cases, reflecting favorable market performance. Results for the year-ago quarter included a net benefit of $58 million from a favorable DAC unlocking and reserve true-ups, also largely driven by favorable markets. Stripping out the unlockings and true-ups, annuity results were $225 million for the current quarter compared to $216 million a year ago for an increase of $9 million. This increase represents the net effect of growth in our fees currently offset by a higher level of base DAC amortization and by higher expenses in the current quarter. Policy charges and fee income for the quarter increased $51 million or 12% from a year ago, reflecting an increase of $10 billion in average variable annuity separate account values, driven by $11.6 billion in net sales over the past year. The benefit of higher fees in the current quarter was partly offset by a higher base level of DAC amortization. While  favorable markets have driven improvements in our amortization factors since our negative unlocking in the third quarter of last year, we are still amortizing DAC at a more rapid pace than a year ago. In addition, current quarter expenses were higher than a year ago, partly as a result of business development costs and spending on initiatives. Our gross variable annuity sales for the quarter were just under $5 billion. This compares to the record high $6.8 billion we recorded a year ago when new business was bolstered by sales in advance of the repricing of our annuity product in early 2011. We are comfortable with our sales level, which has remained in a band of roughly $4.5 billion to $5 billion over each of the past 4 quarters. ","While several other companies have recently began to embrace product-based, risk management strategies, our highest daily protected value feature, coupled with auto-rebalancing tailored to each customer's account, has a proven track record of more than 5 years with clients and their advisors. The popularity of our HD products has driven a continuing improvement in our risk profile. At the end of the first quarter, about 83% of our account values with living benefits add the auto-rebalancing feature. This compares to 78% a year ago and just under 70% 2 years ago. The auto-rebalancing feature performed very well over the most recent market cycle. In the third quarter of last year when the S&P declined 14%, roughly $17 billion of client funds were moved by our algorithm to the safety of fixed income investments, mainly investment-grade bond funds with relatively short duration protecting account values from severe market declines. Through the end of the first quarter, over $13 billion of these funds were returned to client-selected investments, allowing participation in equity market increases. ","Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $156 million for the current quarter compared to $172 million a year ago. The decrease reflected a lower contribution from investment results, as the impact of lower reinvestment yields over the course of the past year was partly offset by crediting rate reductions we implemented in our full-service stable value business in January of this year. The benefit to current quarter results from higher fees reflecting account value growth in Institutional investment products was essentially offset by a lower contribution of about $10 million of mortality-driven case experience on our traditional retirement products. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $9 billion for the quarter. This compares to $10.6 billion a year ago. Full service retirement gross deposits and sales were $4.6 billion for the quarter, roughly in line with a year ago. We continue to see limited activity in the mid- to large-case market, which is our major focus. We are maintaining pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment. 2 large case lapses totaling $1.5 billion contributed to net outflows for our full-service business of about $2.5 billion for the quarter. Standalone Institutional gross sales amounted to $4.4 billion in the current quarter compared to $5.8 billion a year ago. During the year ago quarter and the remainder of 2011, we experienced exceptionally strong flows of stable value wrap products sold to plan sponsors on a standalone basis. Clients added substantial funds to wrap programs established earlier. Sales of these products amounted to $3.5 billion in the current quarter compared to $5.3 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales also included a nearly $700 million longevity reinsurance case in the emerging defined benefit risk transfer market where we are developing innovative solutions to help plan sponsors and benefit providers manage the risks of defined benefit pension plans.","Overall, net additions for the retirement business were about $400 million for the quarter, and account values stood at a record high $240 billion at the end of the quarter, up 12% from a year ago. The asset management business reported adjusted operating income of $121 million for the current quarter compared to $154 million a year ago. While most of the segment's earnings come from asset management fees, the decline in earnings in relation to the year-ago quarter was mainly driven by a decrease of about $35 million in the contribution from ITSICOM [ph]. As Rich mentioned, results from incentive, transaction, strategic investing in commercial mortgage activities, which fluctuate and are partly driven by changing valuations and the timing of transactions. The current quarter reflects declines in the value of several investments, mainly co-investments and real estate funds we manage, while results for the year-ago quarter benefited from gains of about $15 million from sales of foreclosed properties. Lower contribution from ITSICOM [ph] activities, together with higher expenses in the current quarter, more than offset the benefit of higher asset management fees in the quarter, driven by growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management reached a record high, $637 billion as of the end of the quarter, up $68 billion or 12% from the year-earlier. The increase in assets under management reflected cumulative market appreciation and positive net flows in each of the past 4 quarters. ","Adjusted operating income for our Individual Life Insurance business was $112 million for the current quarter compared to $98 million a year ago. Mortality experience for the current quarter was slightly less favorable than our average expectations and improved in relation to the year-ago quarter, driving the increase in results. Our mortality experience fluctuates from one quarter to another, cumulative experience for the past 4 quarters has been essentially in-line with our expectations. Individual life sales based on annualized new business premiums amounted to  $79 million for the current quarter, up from $65 million a year ago. The increase was driven by third-party sales and reflects our improved relative competitive position in the universal life market and growth in term insurance sales through intermediaries working with financial institutions. The Group Insurance business reported a loss of $38 million in the current quarter compared to adjusted operating income of $39 million a year ago. Adverse fluctuation in Group Life claims experience, less favorable Group Disability underwriting results and higher expenses each contributed to the earnings decline. ","The current quarter group life benefits ratio of 95.4% represents our most unfavorable experience in the last 5 years and immediately follows the fourth quarter benefits ratio of 86%, our most favorable experience in the past 5 years. As a frame of reference, we regard group life benefits ratios of between 88% and 92% to be roughly the expected range. The unfavorable group life experience in the current quarter was mainly driven by larger average claim size in relation to our average historical experience. Claims severity can fluctuate from one quarter to another, and no particular block of business was found to be the main driver of the fluctuation this quarter. We would not consider the experience of this quarter to be sufficient to support any conclusions as to group life results going forward. ","In Group Disability, we are continuing to see an elevated incidence of new claims, and the benefit to results from claim terminations was below the level of a year ago. Group Insurance sales for the quarter were $313 million, including $211 million for group life. This compares to a total of $500 million a year ago, including a major case win that contributed about $180 million. More than 3\/4 of our group life sales in the current quarter were voluntary, representing coverage purchased by employees or association members rather than employer paid insurance. ","Turning now to our international businesses. Gibraltar Life's adjusted operating income was $224 million in the current quarter compared to $328 million a year ago. As Rich mentioned, Gibraltar's current quarter results absorbed $57 million of integration costs for the Star and Edison acquisitions. We continue to expect about $500 million of integration costs over a 5-year period, including roughly $200 million in 2012, to achieve targeted annual cost savings of about $250 million after the business integration is completed. Results for the year-ago quarter included income of $153 million from the partial sale of our indirect investment in China Pacific Group by the Carlyle consortium. And our year-ago results absorbed $47 million of Star and Edison transaction and integration costs. Excluding the transaction and integration costs and the year-ago China Pacific gain, Gibraltar's adjusted operating income was up $59 million from a year ago. This increase reflects business growth and cost savings from business integration synergies, partly offset by a less favorable level of policy benefits. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of our hedging program, contributed $10 million to the increase in earnings from a year ago. ","We are benefiting from business growth across all of our channels: active agents, banks and independent agencies. We now call Gibraltar's captive agents, life consultants, after combining the Star\/Edison and Gibraltar's sales forces when we merged entities on January 1 of this year. This growth is being driven by both protection and retirement products, and includes a full quarter contribution from the Star and Edison businesses, which are now included within Gibraltar. Results for the year-ago quarter included the initial month of operations of Star and Edison. Current quarter results reflect about $30 million of cost savings achieved thus far as a result of the business integration, which is well on-track. These savings were driven largely by consolidation of field offices, integration of systems platforms and reduction of support staff. The benefits from business growth and cost savings were partly offset by a less favorable level of policy benefits in the current quarter, which we estimate to be a negative of about $30 million in the comparison. This reflects less favorable mortality in relation to strong year-ago quarter experience and a lower contribution from accident and health products. ","Our Life Planner business reported adjusted operating income of $382 million for the current quarter compared to $300 million a year ago. Results for the year-ago quarter included a charge of $19 million for the estimated impact of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan. Excluding this charge, results were up $63 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up 9% from a year ago. More favorable level of policy benefits in the current quarter, which we estimate to be a positive of about $20 million in the comparison including mortality and reserve true-ups, also contributed to the earnings increase. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates contributed $12 million to the increase in earnings from a year ago. ","International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis reached a record high of $819 million for the first quarter compared to $660 million a year ago. Our current quarter sales reflect expanding distribution, the attractiveness of our products in the protection and retirement markets and a few factors relating to market developments and updating of our product portfolio. Gibraltar Life sales were $439 million in the current quarter, up $76 million from a year ago. Bank channel sales contributed $50 million of the increase, driven primarily by protection products. Our Single Premium Whole Life products, which have been popular in the bank channel, gained momentum as a major Japanese competitor, limited its sales of the yen-based Single Premium Whole Life products through banks. The remainder of the increase or $26 million came from the life consultant channel, mainly driven by greater sales of our U.S. dollar retirement income products. ","Sales from the independent agency channel amounted to $76 million for the current quarter, unchanged from a year ago. Strong current quarter sales of cancer Whole Life products in the business market in anticipation of a tax law change were largely offset by our discontinuation of certain products that were popular in this channel as part of our integration of the product portfolios. Life planner sales were $380 million in the current quarter, up $83 million from a year ago. Sales by life planners in Japan were up $76 million, including about $50 million from U.S. dollar and Japanese yen-based retirement income products. Our yen-based retirement income products are gaining popularity in the business market for use in benefit plans contributing to sales growth. The remainder of the sales increase in Japan came mainly from cancer Whole Life products, which are also popular in the business market served by our life planners. Similarly to Gibraltar, sales of these products in the current quarter reflected purchases in advance of an expected tax law change. Life planner sales outside of Japan were up $7 million or 9% from a year ago. In March, we announced reductions in crediting rates with Gibraltar's U.S. dollar-denominated products effective April 1. And in early April, we advised our life planners of similar pricing changes on Prudential of Japan U.S. dollar products to be effective in June. While we cannot estimate the near-term impact of these pricing adjustments, it is reasonable to assume some degree of sales acceleration into the first half of this year due to repricing activity. ","Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $363 million for the current quarter compared to a $269 million loss a year ago. The increased loss in the current quarter came mainly from higher interest costs reflecting a greater level of capital debt, reflecting our deployment of debt proceeds in our businesses; a charge of about $20 million in the current quarter to increase our reserves for our estimate of unreported debt claims based on application of matching criteria to the Social Security death file; a lower pension credit; and higher expenses, including nonlinear items such as corporate advertising. ","To sum up, our U.S. Retirement Solutions and asset management businesses are continuing to benefit from growth in account values and assets under management driven by solid net flows ending the quarter with record high account values in annuities and retirement, and record high assets under management in the asset management business. While business fundamentals remain strong, the comparison of  results to a year ago reflect items that can vary from one quarter to another, such as investment valuations and transactions in asset management, which were a lower contributor in the current quarter. Results from our U.S. Protection businesses were negatively affected in the quarterly comparison by an adverse fluctuation in group life claims experience and less favorable Group Disability results. And our international businesses are performing well, benefiting from expanding distribution across multiple channels and cost savings from business integration synergies well in-line with our targets. ","Thank you for your interest in Prudential. Now we look forward to hearing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see, I guess, firstly, about regulations. So in particular, curious on the status of deregistering as your savings and loan to automatically -- or to not automatically qualify for Volcker sort of what are your learning from the processes we're seeing around net in terms of the challenges in dealing with some of the regulators? And then lastly, how are you positioning around potential for nonbank SIFI?","Mark B. Grier","This is Mark. Quickly on the first one, we're absolutely on-track with respect to the transactions and processes associated with de-thrifting, which isn't actually a word. But we anticipate the completion of that process on schedule this summer. In terms of the lessons from watching what's happened to Met, I don't want to comment specifically on line items, and there's been a lot of discussions picking at the different parts of the framework and the way questions get asked. But I'd just emphasize that our view all along has been that the basic banking-type approach to balance sheet and stress tests will not be appropriate to apply to an insurance business for a variety of reasons related to the nature of assets and liabilities and the way in which risk is actually realized. And also I'd add the long-duration nature of both sides of the balance sheet. And I think if we're learning a lesson, it's that, that hypothesis is right. That basic framework doesn't work very well. You wind up with the need to make a lot of exceptions and explain a lot of things that just don't make sense because there's an application of basic rules of the road that just don't fit very well with respect to the insurance business model versus the bank business model. We have filed comments in response to  the Fed's NPRs consistent with that statement and consistent with what we've said all along, which is it's more important that we get this right and that we fight over the labels that get put on one company or another. And I continue to believe that, that's true. And we've provided pretty thoughtful discussion of the way in which we think the right framework differs from the pure cookie-cutter banking-type framework and looking at businesses like ours. And again, I would say if anything, we're learning that it really is true that it doesn't work very well. And then finally on the question of nonbank SIFI, we're part of the process. With respect to commenting on the latter, we continue to attempt to engage with respect to opportunities to educate and discuss our business models and the way in which risk comes through for us, and as a result of that, how we think we should be looking at solvency and stress test-type questions. And I expect that we'll have the opportunity as we go through the process to discuss both issue around whether or not we should be designated as a SIFI, and within that context, how we should be approached in terms of understanding the solvency measures and criteria.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly on variable annuities. In the past, you've had an appetite and I guess some success around acquiring certain blocks of business from AllState and Skandia. So it seems like every month, someone wants to get out of this business. So curious if you would be willing to acquire something in the VA space?","John Robert Strangfeld","I would say that with our highest daily value strategy that we are very comfortable with that and would not be, especially domestically, interested in acquiring any other VA block of business.","Mark B. Grier","We certainly wouldn't be looking for standalone books, this is Mark. Just elaborate a little bit. I guess, if there were something in it incidental to a very compelling story, we'd have to think about it. But we're certainly not in the market to buy variable annuity books.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","On capital management, maybe I'll ask the question this way. John, in your opening remarks, you reiterated the 13% to 14% ROE target as achievable in 2013 within that with obviously a contribution from capital deployment. And I guess my question is has there been any change in the pace or quantity of capital deployment in relation to those original expectations?","Mark B. Grier","Mark, let me answer that question more broadly, and then I'll come to the capital piece of it because I think it is important to elaborate on how -- why and how we have the conviction we do about our ROE aspirations, and capital's certainly one of the elements. When we talked about this in the past, we've been very consistent in saying there's really 3 things that are going to enable us to achieve our goals for ROE expansion. One is the superior business mix and the strong performance of our high ROE businesses. Second is the deal-related synergies in Star\/Edison, and the third is the capital management. So let me -- by expanding slightly, let me just hit each of those 3 briefly, particularly in the context of where we are in this quarter. Superior business mix thesis holds. If you look at our international businesses, which now represent nearly 50% of our earnings, we had strong performance and exceptional fundamentals. If you think about our asset management businesses, we're feeling very, very good about that business as well. The variable component of revenue was less strong this quarter than it sometimes been and that will fluctuate. But in terms of the overall vital signs, investment performance, asset flows and revenue growth of base level fees, that business is doing very well and we have no different change in our thinking regarding the prospects for the return potential in that business. Annuities life, retirement, they're strong as well. So Group clearly has been unhelpful in its performance in recent times, and we recognize that. But we have to keep in mind, that business is the smallest of our reporting segments, which represents in a good year, 5% to 7% of our earnings. So that while we're very intent on fixing it, and I don't mean to minimize it at all. It's not driving our overall business mix element of the achievement of our ROE. The second piece, which I'll hit much more briefly is Star\/Edison, you've heard from our comments that that's an important part of our retaining our ROE aspiration, and that holds absolutely true as well. And then the third piece that you specifically surfaced, Mark, was the capital management fees, and that's a combination of investing in our businesses, opportunistic M&A, returning -- also opportunistic divestitures, which you've seen us do as well, as well as returning shares to our -- returning cash to our shareholders as well. And it's a blend, and we continue to view it that way. So when I think of the overall picture and then taking expansive approach to your questions between the business mix and deal-related synergies on Star\/Edison and the strong capital management, all 3 of those remain essential elements to what we aspire to do, and we're holding the course of our expectations and aspirations.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up for Rich. Rich, I was a little surprised that the readily deployable capital component didn't increase. And I thought you did a transaction earlier in the quarter -- first quarter around RMBS that may have moved some money from capital capacity to readily deployable. Am I wrong about that? Or why didn't readily deployable capital go up?","Richard J. Carbone","That wasn't -- the REMI [ph] transaction only added to operating debt and it's going to be used to fund the operating needs throughout the year. It didn't add to capital debt. It was operating debt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question I had was on Gibraltar. And John, I know you had mentioned the benefit ratio went up on a year-over-year basis. But even when I look at the last several quarters, the benefit ratio relative to total revenues in Gibraltar was fairly elevated. Just curious, is there anything unusual in that number that we should think about? Is there seasonality at all, product mix shift? Anything you can elaborate just in terms of that one particular metric. Because I know DAC amortization was higher but this is not DAC amortization I'm referring to.","Edward P. Baird","Yes, Tom, this is Ed. This is an element of all of the above as you would imagine. As always seasonality is a factor, yes, you're right. Product mix, that's a factor, and there's probably more of that going on now than usual because you have the Star\/Edison life consultants moving away from their old company products to the Gibraltar products, so you have a lot of that. And then you have the normal fluctuation that takes place on a book this size. So when we filter through all of those moving factors, we don't see anything going on there that's of the slightest concern to us, frankly. It's a very steady book of business, very consistent profitability, very comfortable with what's going on, particularly in light of the magnitude of change that's taking place, this is actually very minor.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And just as a follow-up, are all of the bank sales done through Gibraltar or do some of those come through POJ?","Edward P. Baird","They're all done through Gibraltar, Tom. So POJ is not involved at all. And the way it works, just to take you inside the structure of it. We actually have a third company, which you're probably familiar with, we call it Prudential Gibraltar Financial, but it's part of the Gibraltar segment. So it operates as a separate company. All of our new business on banks is being done through that company, but it's all reported through Gibraltar; the Gibraltar subsidiary. POJ never has done any bank business. The reason that it may even be a question in your mind is that we have taken and consistently have taken life planners out of the POJ organization and have transferred them over to Gibraltar to be seconded to the banks. But that's the only connection between POJ and any of the bank business.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just looking at the supplement, it looks like sales are now half bank, half Gibraltar. So that would be the split. And I guess, just on a related note, is there any meaningful mix shift going on in terms of more retirement-oriented products versus mortality within that -- within Gibraltar?","Edward P. Baird","Not so much within Gibraltar. There is -- that is a steady trend kind of across-the-board that you're referencing. And it's one of the reasons you see the average premium going up. I would say it's more a phenomenon driving details inside POJ, which as you see have, for several years now, in particular in this quarter, grown very steadily. It's not so much the growth in headcount, which as you see remains relatively small and yet you hit double-digit growth in sales. That's coming from the double-digit growth in the average premium. But in the Gibraltar side of it, it tends to be more on the traditional protection side, particularly over in the teachers association, which represents about half of it. And then inside the bank channel, you get a mix of both protection and retirement. You get a combination of the 2. The bank channel does remain, oh, about 80% insurance, very small portion of other products either A&H or annuity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I'd like to talk about the losses in disability, and hoping you can share with us kind of some sense of what is driving the higher loss results in the last couple of quarters, if it's frequency, severity, case, size just to give some sense of kind of what's gone wrong in the underwriting there?","John Robert Strangfeld","Sure, we're happy to do that. Let me provide some overall context to the disability as well, and I'll talk little bit about life because I think they're very different issues. But over the past couple of years, the disability ratio has been moving up. But let me give you some context to previous years because the disability ratio was 86%, 87% and 89% in 2007, '08 and '09, respectively. In 2010, it did jump to 95%. We started to look at it then. We thought that in part, it was due to the economy. By the beginning of 2010, this was clearly on people's radar screen -- or by '11, excuse me, by the beginning of 2011. So by June of 2011, we had hired a consultant to review the pricing, the processes, the procedures, and in fact, are raising pricing. So the first point want make because I don't want people to think that we woke up yesterday and were surprised by the benefit ratio. We have had our eye on this for a while. Now we do think we can contribute part of this to the economy. That explanation is obviously getting a little bit long in the tooth. So again as part of your question, we're continuing to experience some of the same issues we've described before, especially on the long-term disability side, which is higher severity, higher incidence and lower terminations. And terminations -- the terminations that are occurring are for lower amounts resulting in smaller reserve releases. So what we've concluded is that we can't expect these results to self-correct totally on an improving economy. So we have been and remain in the process of repricing a book. Obviously, that won't happen overnight as cases are into 2 to 3 years. So it will take a while essentially for the lump to move through the snake but we've been working on this for a while. In addition, as John mentioned, we brought in Steve Pelletier, one of our most experienced managers, to run the business. And I think this says a lot about the seriousness with which we're taking the issue. So we've asked Steve to come in and re-examine everything, see if we missed something. So I hope you take away from this part of the explanation of our current performance is that we recognize that we have an issue and that we're dealing with it. But let me also talk about the life side of the business, which John touched on for a minute because this is a very, very different part of the equation. In this business, as you know, the benefit ratio tends to be seasonally weaker in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter. And as Mark said, this was certainly true in this quarter but to an even greater extent than we'd expect from a seasonal basis. We went from the benefit ratio in the fourth quarter that was the best in 5 years, to a benefit ratio in the first quarter was the worst in 5 years. And clearly, the composition of the block of business didn't change significantly in one quarter's time. And interestingly, over the longer term, the 5-year average benefit ratio for this business was just over 89%. So it's been reasonably steady over that 5-year period, which is to say that when you look at the experience in the first quarter, which is primarily for an increase in severity, not in incidence. And by the way, we've actually had the actuaries scrub this data. We don't see anything that will lead us to believe that there's anything but a one-off -- that this is anything but a one-off quarter, which would not imply a continuation of elevated benefit levels. Having said that, we're doing a lot introspection. And again, asked Steve to look to make sure that no stone's unturned in terms of looking at all the issues and make sure that our premise is correct. So that would be kind of the discussion of the 2 sides of the coin, if you will. And I hope that answers your question.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I have one quick follow-up. What kind of price increases would you expect to push through that block? And if you've already started them, what's been the reaction of the market to the price increases?","Richard J. Carbone","Well, the price increases have been in the low-double digits on average. I mean, you have some that are less than that, some that have more than that. And I think from the market's perspective, I think you're seeing a lot of people increase prices, so I think this is par for the course.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Some of my questions were answered, but I had one on the --  the ITSICOM [ph] revenues in your asset management business, they were a little light this quarter. So if you could just talk about what were some of the factors that caused that rather by-product or geography? And then also, what you your expectations are for that business if you've in fact had some losses in Europe given what's going on in the European economy and Asia?","Richard J. Carbone","Sure, happy to do that. Basically it was a tough quarter-over-quarter comparison, right, on ITSICOM, because last year, we had a boost from gains on foreclosed real estate assets in the interim portfolio, which provide a significant amount of gains. And this year, we had a drag from valuation declines on certain properties in funds, especially in Europe and Asia, that was the main cause, and specific properties in a few funds. But I'd say, looking forward to the economic conditions in Europe are affecting valuations of property, which may continue to affect ITSICOM [ph] going forward. As John and Mark both have said, this is a volatile segment, and it will go up and down. We've reduced the size of the proprietary investing significantly, or strategic investing significantly over the past few years, but there's still inherent volatility. We still have some legacy investments that will go up and down. Having said that, the other thing I would mention is what John touched on originally, which is the quality of flows within the Asset Management segment. We experienced significant positive flows of $8.6 billion, $4.5 billion of which were Institutional. And $3.2 billion which were retail. The interesting thing about the retail said was about 50-50, fixed income and equity. I think what that reflects is, one, it's very good investment performance, but 2, our investment over the past few years in the retail business. So that's led us to 12 consecutive quarters of record AUM and record asset management fees going forward. So I think for the business, as a whole, it's doing reasonably well. But I think it's fair to say that we will experience and continue to experience a certain amount of volatility in ITSICOM. And part of that could be because of what's going on with Europe. We'll just wait and see.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on the 401-K and the full-service or retirement business, your flows have not been that great for the last several quarters, actually, and I think you mentioned in the call that you're seeing high competition in that market. Could you elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing there and what your views are for that business?","Richard J. Carbone","Sure. Absolutely. On the full-service side, we're not seeing a lot of turnover -- plan turnover. So there's not a plan -- a lot of plans out there and we're still seeing a fair amount of price checking in the marketplace. So we're starting to see a few more RFPs, but we're not sure whether those are price checking or real. We'll wait and see on that. But you can really categorize the negative net flows of 4 different categories, and we look at this every single quarter and analyze it in detail what the negative flows have been. So let me give you some categories and some percentages. The first  one would be M&A or bankruptcy, right? And 50% of our outflows were because of M&A and bankruptcy where we're just on the side of the acquiree not the acquirer, and so you lose the plan. The second would be relationship changes, and this is a smaller percentage, but we're a plan sponsor. If there's somebody new that comes in or a new consultant comes in, and they just want to make change of some sort. The third is interesting. The third is pricing and we talked about that. And 60% of the cases we lost were below our target range or our target return that we would like. Now obviously 60% and 50% that of the more than 110%. So some of the M&A cases we lost puts us in the guise better be lucky than smart. Some of those cases were below our target rate of return. But we really do look at that very, very carefully. And the fourth is frankly, there are a few cases and these were less than a handful of cases and a small percentage both in terms of number of cases and in terms of dollar amount, but there were a few cases we lost we would rather have kept. But at the end of the day, we ended up with a record AUM of $146 billion on the full-service side. Now part of that was due to market obviously, but we still feel pretty good about that. The other interesting point about the business in general is the change in business mix. So we also had record AUM on the Institutional investment side with almost $94 billion. So if you look at the mix, the IIT business went from 32% of the total of AUM a year ago to about 39% of the total AUM at the end of the first quarter. The IIT, the growth came from investment only stable value business, as well as our pension risk transfer both of which we think are growth businesses with good rates of return, going forward or target rates of return. So we're quite pleased about the business. We're keeping the discipline on the full-service side, and we think the mix, the change in mix of business is not all bad.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","I'd like to ask about your life sales specifically   universal life what kind of target returns you're getting there? We're hearing some other carriers talk about pulling back because of the market is commoditized and too competitive?","Richard J. Carbone","I don't think we gave target returns on any specific product. But don't forget that twice in 2009, we raised prices significantly. And as a result, our sales and I'll get the percentage a little bit wrong but our in 2010 by about 30% or so. As a result of that, we haven't really changed our pricing. And so competitors have come back to us, if you will, in terms of pricing, which makes us relatively more competitive in terms of sales. So we feel good about the returns we're getting. But it's not because we've had any recent price decreases in order to boost sales.","Operator","And we have time for one final question and that will be from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had 2 questions. The first is on the run rate annualized results in the first quarter relative to guidance. So if I take the $1.34, annualize that and then add in the annualized impact of the $0.17 impact of the ITSICOM [ph], I get to around $6. And I realize there's some additional drag in the corporate line, but that still seems below sort of the 2012 guidance range. So am I missing anything else there, that's my first question and I have a follow-up?","John Robert Strangfeld","Jay, this is John. Let me offer a couple of observations. One is, we made a decision back in 2009 to issue guidance once a year and then to neither affirm it or to update it. And we're going to stay the course of that approach. But having said that, while not putting a specific number on it. I would say that we think that the current quarter is not fully reflective of either our earnings power our business momentum. And just picking 3 things off of that. One is the group life experience that Charlie talked about. The second is the asset management variable revenue component. In the third is corporate and other and a couple of things that Rich mentioned. And just looked 3 specifically. I think it validates this concept of the current quarter is not reflective of earnings power of momentum.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. My second question has to do with variable annuity sales. It appears that you're comfortable remaining in that quarterly sales range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. And my sense was that to come down over time because you didn't want it to be too large a percentage of the business. So maybe you can just clarify that?","Richard J. Carbone","Yes, I think what we look for in this business as in other businesses is sustainable, profitable growth. And that the level of sales comes out of that. And we don't target necessarily a level of sales. If we think we need to raise prices and the sales comes downs a little bit, we will do that. But what we look for is an acceptable rate of profitability and the amount of sales comes out of that function.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Understood. So is that run rate $4.5 billion, $5 billion something we should keep in mind?","Richard J. Carbone","I would say, again that, we'll look at the profitability of the product, and the sales will come out of that. So I don't want to predict any particular level of sales going forward one way or the other.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. Eastern today until midnight, May 10.
