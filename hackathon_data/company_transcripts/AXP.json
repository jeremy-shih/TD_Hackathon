Welcome to the American Express Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.","Richard Petrino","Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our Q4 discussion again. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1, 2 and 3 2012 Form 10-Q reports already on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for the prior period that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. Thanks, Rick, and I'll start on Slide 2. So this is the fourth quarter summary of financial performance. So revenues came in at $8.1 billion, up 5% both on a reported and FX basis. If you exclude the $93 million of cardmember reimbursements that are contra-revenues, revenues would have grown 6%.","Net income came in at $637 million. That's $0.56 of EPS. If you exclude the restructuring charge, MR reserve and cardmember reimbursements that we discussed last week, adjusted EPS would be $1.09. ROE was 23%. If you adjust it for the same 3 items I just mentioned, it would have been 26% for the fourth quarter. And you can see shares are declining, reflecting our repurchases.","Moving to Slide 3. So this is a reconciliation from net income of $637 million down to income of $1.2 billion, which relates to the $1.09. So the first item here is the restructuring charge, and restructuring is part of staying ahead of the curve. It is designed to contain operating expenses and free up resources for growth initiatives. Our core business results continue to show the benefits of growth investments we've made over the last several years. We have increased share in a very competitive U.S. industry, improved risk management capabilities and introduced innovative products. We believe these fourth quarter actions will make our cost structure leaner and more efficient. Our aim is to grow operating expense less than 3% in both 2013 and 2014, freeing up funds to reinvest back into the many growth opportunities we have across the business, be it our core products, prepaid or mobile.","Next is the Membership Rewards expense related to the refinement in the estimated ultimate redemption rate in the U.S. And third is cardmember reimbursements for issues that go back several years. The line items in the statement of income that these items are reflected on is clearly laid out on a chart in our 2012 fourth quarter earnings supplement.","Moving to Slide 4. So this is the only slide we have on full year 2012. You can see revenues came in at $31.5 billion, up 5% or 6% on an FX-adjusted basis. Net income was $4.4 billion. That relates to EPS of $3.89. If we were to adjust for the items that I discussed before, adjusted EPS would be $4.40. And you can see the lower shares reflect the repurchase of 69 million shares during the year and the issuance of 10 million shares under employee plans.","Moving to Slide 5. So these are our fourth quarter metrics. So billed business was $235 billion in the fourth quarter. That's up 8% from last year or 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. In the third quarter, reported growth was 6% or 8% on an FX-adjusted basis. So billed business growth, very similar in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter. And our billings growth continues to be toward the upper end of the range among our large issuing competitors.","Cards-in-force and average basic cardmember spending growth also are similar to the third quarter. We grew proprietary cards 3% in this quarter. Cardmember loans growth was down slightly from the 6% we had in the third quarter to 4% in the fourth quarter.","Moving to Slide 6. So this is billed business growth by segment. Total FX-adjusted growth moved from 8% in the third quarter to 7% in the fourth quarter. GNS, the yellow line, has moved up slightly to 12% on higher growth in Latin America. Global Corporate Services, the green line, moved down slightly to 6% growth as T&E spending grew more slowly than total billings growth. In the upper right hand, you can see that full year, we had billed business of $888 billion.","Moving to Slide 7. So this is billed business growth by region. The U.S. growth slowed slightly from 8% to 7%. The other regions are either stable or growth was up slightly. JAPA, the green line, is up slightly. Australia's growth rate stabilized in the fourth quarter, and Hong Kong growth was stronger. EMEA, the blue line, also is up slightly, driven by higher growth in Germany and the U.K.","Moving to Slide 8. So this is worldwide managed loans. The bars reflect the dollar amount of loans in each quarter, and the line is the growth rate. We now have several quarters where we've had growth around 4%, slightly down from 6% in the third quarter. So we are seeing growth in loans driven by our billed business growth. We are not using 0 balance transfers to grow loans. If you look at our competitors, November year-to-date, 73% of consumer acquisition mail offers included a 0 balance transfer offer. So in the fourth quarter, growth on spending on lending products was 9% while loans grow 4%, and we continue to see excellent credit quality.","Moving to Slide 9. So this is revenue performance. So total revenues grew at 5%. You can see that in the bottom right, 6% excluding the cardmember reimbursement, some $93 million which were contra-revenues.","Starting at the top of the page, discount revenue grew 6%, reflecting 8% growth in billed business, partially offset by a decline in discount rate, the impact of cardmember reimbursements and higher contra-revenue items, including cash rebate rewards.","Net card fees reflect an increase in proprietary cards and higher average fees per card related to our premium products in U.S. Consumer and International Consumer businesses. Travel commissions and fees decreased 2% due to lower transaction-related revenue. Business travel sales declined 1%, while U.S. Consumer travel sales increased 9%.","Other commissions and fees are up 5%, and that growth primarily reflects higher revenues at Loyalty Partner. Other revenues grew 4%. We had a larger gain on ICB shares in the fourth quarter this year compared to last year, although the fourth quarter gain on the ICB shares was similar to what we had in the third quarter. And we also had higher network partner fees in GNS. Net interest income increased 7%. Average cardmember loans are up 5%. Worldwide net interest yield is at 9.1%, up from 8.9% in 2011. The impact of cardmember reimbursements in the fourth quarter this year is why it is lower than the third quarter rate of 9.3%. Net interest yield also benefited from lower funding costs.","Next, moving to Slide 10. So this is provision for losses. And here you can see that provision in the fourth quarter of this year is higher primarily because of a small build in reserves in 2012 compared to reserve releases in the fourth quarter of 2011, and you can see that on the bottom of this chart. Charge card provision decreased 11% compared to last year. We had a lower reserve build of about $19 million this year compared to a $50 million reserve build last year. This is partially offset by higher receivable levels of 5%. And the write-off in both periods are about the same. So basically, the lower charge card provision relates to a lower reserve build.","Cardmember loan provision increased $247 million. This reflects a 4% increase in cardmember loans compared to last year, a reserve build in the fourth quarter of 2012 of $12 million compared to a reserve release in the fourth quarter of last year of $265 million, which was partially offset by lower write-offs this year. Write-offs this year were $346 million, and that compares to $386 million last year. So again, the change in the reserve is primarily driven by reserve releases last year or we had a slight build this year. So provision is going up while credit metrics remain stable, and you'll see that on the next several slides.","So Slide 11 is charge card credit performance. And on the left chart, you can see the U.S. consumer write-off rate has ticked up and down slightly over the past several quarters. But I would view this as basically stable over this period. On the right side, you see the International Consumer and Global Corporate Services net loss ratio, and the same thing is this is stable. So for charge card, relatively stable metrics over this period. And these are all historically -- at historically low levels.","Next, going to Slide 12. So this is the lending credit performance. So these metrics also continued to be stable. You can see on the left-hand side the write-off rate has ticked down slightly, but it's basically stable over this period. In December, the U.S. managed lending write-off rate was 2.1%. The 30-day past due improved slightly in the quarter, but again is basically stable over this period. These metrics are also at historic lows and represent the best credit metrics in the industry. As I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rates but to achieve the best economic gain when we invest.","Slide 13. So these are our lending reserve coverage metrics. So you can look at reserves as a percentage of loans, reserves as a percentage of past due and principal months coverage in both the U.S. and, at the bottom, worldwide. These metrics are all very similar to what we saw in the third quarter, and we think they're appropriate given the risks in the portfolio.","So next is Slide 14. So this is looking at expenses now. So total expenses increased 18%. You can see that on the bottom right. However, if you exclude the 3 items mentioned on Slide 3, the restructuring, the MR reserve and the cardmember reimbursements, adjusted growth in operating expense would be 3% and for total expense would be 2%.","Marketing and promotion is 2% lower than the fourth quarter of 2011 but remain at very healthy levels, as you'll see on the next slide. Cardmember rewards increased 27%, primarily driven by the $342 million expense related to the refinement in the ultimate redemption rate estimate in the U.S., and I'll discuss that in 2 slides. Excluding this item, adjusted expense grew 2%, a slower growth rate than spending on MR products, partly due to a lower weighted average cost per point in the fourth quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of 2012.","Total operating expense increased 15%. However, when you adjust for the fourth quarter 2011 Visa proceeds and the fourth quarter of 2012 restructuring and cardmember reimbursement charges, the growth rate is 3%. Now in most quarters, we have small reengineering charges that we don't separately highlight. If you were to further adjust the fourth quarter of 2011 for its restructuring charge of $49 million, the adjusted growth rate is 5%. I will discuss the operating expense line in a few slides.","Moving to Slide 15. So this is marketing expense. So marketing expense was $722 million in the fourth quarter this year compared to $735 million in the fourth quarter of '11, down slightly but still healthy. On the left side, you can see marketing and promotion expense as a percentage of managed revenues on an annual basis. Our objective is for marketing and promotion to be approximately 9% of revenues. On the right side, you can see the percentage by quarter. In the fourth quarter, the percentage was 8.9% of revenues, and it varied over the quarters in 2012. But as you can see for full year, it was 9.2%. This level, we believe, can drive our business momentum.","So next is Slide 16. So this is a historical look at the ultimate redemption rate for current enrollees worldwide. While we have refined our estimate prices -- process twice in the past 4 years, the primary driver for the higher ultimate redemption rate is higher cardmember redemptions as we have enhanced the program. A data point that supports this is that at the beginning of 2009, 45% of U.S. current enrollees had made at least one redemption. That percentage, so the number of current U.S. enrollees that have made at least 1 redemption, has increased to approximately 60% at the end of 2012, a clear reflection of the increased redemption behavior by current enrollees.","Next is Slide 17. So this is operating expense, and you can see in the bottom right that it increased 19%. Excluding the restructuring reserve, the impact of cardmember reimbursements in operating expense for the fourth quarter of '12 and the Visa litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of 2011, adjusted operating expense was 3%. Now if we look at salaries and benefits, it increased 24%. But excluding the $369 million of restructuring reserves that resulted in expense on this line, adjusted expense was flat with the fourth quarter of 2011. Professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications all grew modestly.","Adjusted other net increased 38%. If you exclude the restructuring charge in cardmember reimbursements from this line, adjusted expense increased 21%. This increase reflects a litigation-related reserve release, or basically a credit, in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as an impairment of a cost method investment in the current quarter. Overall operating expense adjusted growth was 3%.","Moving to Slide 18. So this is operating expense growth over the past 9 quarters. The green line is the growth in operating expense. The blue line is growth in revenues. And the dotted green line is operating expense, excluding litigation settlement proceeds, and in the fourth quarter of 2011, the restructuring reserve and cardmember reimbursements on the line.","So I'll make several points. The growth rate in 2010 and early 2011 was a result of our strategy to invest in the business utilizing credit releases and the settlement proceeds. In 2012, we stated our objective was to grow operating expense at a pace slower than revenue growth. Adjusting for the items I just referred to, we were successful at this in 2012. This demonstrates our ability to effectively control operating expense. Our aim now is to grow operating expense at an annual rate of less than 3% in both 2013 and 2014. The 2012 operating expense, excluding the restructuring charge, will be our base.","Looking at Slide 19. So these are expenses as a percentage of revenues. So this is adjusted expenses. And in this case, by adjusted, we mean to exclude credit provision.","So on the left side, you can see 5 years of history. On the right side, you can see the past 5 quarters. In 2012 and in the fourth quarter of 2012, the dotted line in the bar excludes the restructuring charge and cardmember reimbursements that are in the fourth quarter of 2012. The adjusted percentage in the fourth quarter is 70% and 71% for the full year of 2012. As you can see, in 2012, we made substantial progress reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenues. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first, through revenue growth; and second, our plans to contain operating expense growth.","Next is Slide 20, capital ratios. You can see that the tier 1 common ratio is 11.9% at the end of the fourth quarter, down from 12.7% in the third quarter of 2012. We generated $700 million in capital in the quarter, $600 million from net income plus $100 million from employee plans. We distributed $1.2 billion in capital, $1 billion in share repurchases, and this is in line with our capital plan and our 2012 CCAR submission, and $200 million of dividends. In addition, risk-weighted assets increased seasonally as accounts receivable and loans increased in the quarter. Tier 1 common ratio of 11.9% keeps us at -- with very strong capital ratios and well-above required benchmarks.","Next is Slide 21, which is our total payout ratio. So this is the percentage of capital generated returned to shareholders. On the left-hand side is the past 5 years. On the right side, the 4 quarters in 2012. Our share buybacks and dividends were in line with our capital plan and 2012 CCAR submission. We continue to make [ph] strong capital ratios while buying back 4 billion of shares in 2012 and currently paying a $0.20 dividend per share per quarter, and dividends in 2012 totaled $900 million.","Moving to Slide 22. So this is a liquidity snapshot. Our objective is to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. You can see that the funding maturities are $6.6 billion (sic) [$16.6 billion], and excess cash and securities were $6.1 billion (sic) [$16.1 billion] at 12\/31\/2012.","So we were $500 million shy of our objective, and this is a result of accounts payable decreasing faster than we had forecasted, therefore consuming cash. By the first week in January, excess cash and securities exceeded the funding maturities over the next 12 months. We continue to have a strong liquidity position.","Slide 23. So this is our retail deposits by type. And you can see that we increased direct deposits by $1.7 billion in the quarter to $19.4 billion, and total deposits increased $2.7 billion in the quarter to $39.7 billion. The increased deposits funded in part the seasonal increase in higher accounts receivable and loans on our balance sheet. We continue to be committed to increase direct deposits over time.","Next is Slide 24. So this is a chart that shows ABS and unsecured debt issuances over the past 3 years and an estimated range of potential issuances in 2013. This is in line with our funding strategy to maintain a diversified funding profile. So we will continue to use both ABS and unsecured funding channels, in addition to retail deposit program, to meet our refinance and business growth needs in 2013.","So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. While our fourth quarter results were impacted by 3 items, we feel that the trends in our business metrics are indicative of the underlying strength of our business. We continue to feel positive about our performance, especially given the uncertain economic environment.","In the quarter, spend growth continued to be healthy in a very uneven economy. Fourth quarter billings growth rates were relatively consistent with the prior quarter despite the negative impact of Hurricane Sandy. Our billings growth continues to be towards the upper end of the range among our large issuing competitors.","We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpaced the industry, leading to 7% growth in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates remain near all-time lows. Revenue growth was 5%, up slightly on a reported basis from last quarter, and consistent on an FX-adjusted basis. The growth reflects the impact of a weak economic environment but is still significantly better than many other issuers. Excluding the items disclosed last week and last year's Visa settlement payment, adjusted operating expense increased by 3% in the quarter versus the prior year.","We continue to focus on controlling operating expenses as evidenced by the restructuring program announced last week. We are now aiming to have operating expense grow at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next 2 years, and we will seek to use a portion of the savings to reinvest in the business. We will measure this off of the 2012 base that excludes the restructuring charge.","We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks in line with the authorizations under the 2012 CCAR submission. Our capital ratios remain strong and, despite the impact of the 3 items in the quarter, are generally higher than forecasted in our 2012 capital plan.","Looking ahead, we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead. So thanks for listening, and we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll open the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Dan, can you talk about whether you're seeing any evidence of competitors pulling back on their investment spending, particularly with the benefits from reserve releases having largely abated and the large bank issuers still not really seeing any balance growth?","Daniel T. Henry","So I think, Bill, if you look at card mailings really in this quarter and last quarter, they're down from where they were earlier in the year. What other investment actions they're taking, we don't have great visibility into. I would comment on that we continue to be very focused on operating expense, so that we can have additional resources to invest in the many opportunities we have, both in our core business and mobile and across all of our businesses. So we can -- remain very focused. And actually quite frankly, part of the reason for our restructuring charge was to stay ahead of the curve and to ensure that we had the resources we need to invest in the business, even though it's a relatively uneven economy.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So just to make sure that I'm interpreting that correctly. So is the way that you're thinking about the travel services restructuring, is that kind of a source of funds that's going to allow you to continue to invest in better growth opportunities in other areas? And then maybe along that -- along with that, if you could also talk about your pecking order of investment opportunities and how attractive you see them today versus, say, over the course of the last couple of years, how they've changed?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So this was not solely a business travel restructuring, right? I think business travel is a large piece of the restructuring, but the restructurings are also taking place in our servicing operations. And we are having other reductions in staff groups, basically areas that are not generating revenues. Business travel is an area where we are restructuring. It's an important business to us. It's an important adjacency to our Corporate Card business. It allows us to deepen our relationships with Corporate Card clients. And so while business travel hasn't been a significant generator of revenues for us, we do continue to look at ways continually to reengineer the business. The reason that we've taken a bigger step in business travel as far as restructuring is that we now have a new leadership team in place who proposed turning up the dial on our reengineering efforts in response to the changes that we're seeing in the business landscape. And we decided to implement their proposal. But that's not the only place that we're reengineering. We do it on a regular basis. And we have done really a terrific job in our servicing areas to improve quality, as you've seen, where we continue to win the J.D. Power award, and at the same time, adopt to changing in the marketplace. So we've invested, say, in the ability to take remittances electronically. Over 80% of our remittances are received electronically in 2012. Many people are changing the way they want to interface with us. So for instance, we've invested in apps to allow people to communicate with us either through smartphones or tablet servicing applications. In fact, we had contacts through those 2 means increase to 5 million apps downloaded  5 million times compared to 2.6 million times in 2011. So we're constantly reengineering both in business travel, in the servicing and in other parts of our business.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. If I may ask one last question here, can you give a sense of what percentage of your volumes comes from customers who would be directly impacted by the threshold -- the new threshold limits after the tax law changes?","Daniel T. Henry","So it's hard to say. The last time we saw a large tax increase was back in '93. At that time, there were a lot of other things going on, but we didn't see an impact on volumes in that period. Back in '93, billed business grew at 10% and in '94, 13%. Now it was truly a different economic environment, and GDP was more in the 3% to 4% range, but we didn't see it have an impact then. The other thing that I'd point out is U.S. consumer is an important part of our business, but our business is very diversified. We have large Corporate Card business, large international business. We have GNS partners around the world. So it's hard to predict what, if any, impact we're going to have from the tax law change.","Operator","We will open the lines of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to clarify if I could. The expense base, if you took the $23.141 billion of total expenses, backed out the $802 million charges in the fourth quarter, that's your base, you'll grow by less than 3%?","Daniel T. Henry","So I have to look at the numbers...","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just looking at Page 6 of your...","Daniel T. Henry","The only thing that we're going to back out, we're going to take operating expense as we define it on our slide for the year. And we're going to back out the $400 million restructuring charge. That's the only adjustment we're going to make. And then going forward, we will compare to that number.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And also the rewards charge, the cardmember rewards charge too, yes?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So this is not -- so when you look at this, it's not marketing, it's not rewards. It's just the -- if you were to look at Slide 17, the -- this is what we're defining as operating expense. So in this quarter, it's $3.7 billion. I don't know what the annual number is. But I think the annual number, as defined here, and subtract the $400 million restructuring charge, that will be our base.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, I mean you returned over 100% of capital generated this year, and your tier 1 common of 11.9%. Would you anticipate being having the flexibility as excluding -- assuming you don't make acquisitions, to do something similar? And what is your target tier 1 common?","Daniel T. Henry","So we have said our target is 10%. We have been above that level for the past couple of years. So at the moment, we're staying [ph] in the range that we are today. We have not completed our Basel II work, that will not be done for some time now. And we want to see whether there's any impacts that come out of that. We need to complete that work. And at that juncture, if there were no impacts, we would probably tend to take it down from where it is today. So from a target perspective, that's how we think about it. This year, we returned 98% of capital to shareholders. I think in our CCAR submission, we will have a similar philosophy that we had this year that if we're not utilizing the capital to support growth in the balance sheet for acquisitions, that we will be inclined to return it to shareholders. And the fact that we have a very strong capital position is helpful on that. I think it's also helpful that last year when the Fed did their stress analysis, we didn't see our capital ratios drop anywhere near what the other -- many of the other banks did in that review. So I think all those things contribute to having the type of flexibility that we want from a capital perspective.","Operator","We will open the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just had a big-picture question. I was wondering if in this type of macro environment, you guys think you could hit your on average and over-time targets, because it seems like we might be in this environment for a little bit.","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. I think that when we set our target of 8% revenue growth, we assumed it was a normal economy with GDP at the 10-year average, which is 2.7% or so. At -- GDP at 2%, it becomes difficult to hit the 8%. Discount revenue is 50% of revenues. And while our billed business has held up, performed well in this environment compared to competitors, this is a pretty good linkage between GDP and what our growth rates have been. Over time, if you look at real GDP, our growth rates have been between 3x and 4x that number. So if we have billed business growth in the high-single digits, then hitting 8% overall growth becomes a challenge. So in this quarter, we did have good growth in card fees. It was up 6%. We did have good growth in net interest income, up 7%. And some of our other fee business lines had mid-single-digit growth rates. So we'll strive to be a growth company in a slow-growth environment. But achieving 8% is challenging with GDP in the U.S. where it is.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess just one follow-up. I mean you guys are kind of returning a little bit more capital than your target suggests as well, and you do have some operating leverage kind of levers. Could you just speak to that as it ties into that discussion?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, we always are open to acquisitions. Although as you know, we've achieved our growth and the share gains that we've experienced over the last several years through organic investments, and likely that'll be the major driver. We remain open to acquisitions if the right one comes along with the right returns. Certainly, the extent that we're able to increase our operating leverage and control operating expense, then that frees up more investment dollars to put into the many opportunities that we have across our business, and that could help to generate additional revenues as well. This quarter, we actually saw Loyalty Partner, which was an acquisition, start to contribute to revenue growth. The other thing is that the share buybacks that we're doing are giving us good improvement in terms of reducing the shares outstanding, and that gives us a lift in our EPS calculation. So we balance all those things against each other as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","One question on the previously stated goal of getting to $3 billion in fee revenue by the end of 2014. Does anything change with last week's announcement related to some of the cardmember issues there, or also just as you commented previously a moment ago about the economic environment makes some things more challenging?","Daniel T. Henry","So I don't think any of the items that we identified last week will affect our ability to do fee revenues. Certainly, regulators across the industry are looking closely at all products that are offered to cardmembers. I think we're going to continue to look at opportunities to expand services that we offer to cardmembers and merchants. At this juncture, we don't have a plan to change our $3 billion target. We are about halfway through the time frame and still think it's appropriate, although I would say that $3 billion is an ambitious target given the uneven economy. And there's a lot of work to do, but we're moving forward on a number of fronts. I think Loyalty department is a good example of building fee services. I think the early returns that we're seeing on Bluebird in the reloadable prepaid space is another example where we think we can be successful. So certainly, the economy does have an impact, but we're going to continue to see if we can grow fee services as we go forward.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just one question about your comments about the tapping into rewards by cardmembers that, back in 2009, only 49% had regained rewards. If I take a glass half full perspective, that seems to me to suggest that you might have had a newer cohort of cardmembers back in 2009 who hadn't just gotten to the point where they did redeem rewards. Is that the wrong way to think about it or...","Daniel T. Henry","So I think -- so it was 45%.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","45%, sorry.","Daniel T. Henry","I wasn't clear. That's okay. I don't think that our cardmember base has changed radically. Obviously, we've added a fair number of cardmembers since 2009. I look at that increase as an increase of engagement of the people who are in the program. And I think that increase in engagement is heavily influenced by the enhancements that we've made to the program, expanding the options people have, giving people the opportunity to redeem with fewer points or using Pay with Points. So I think those are all things that have contributed to the increased engagement, of the number of people who have redeemed. And I thought it was useful just in terms of thinking about another data point that demonstrates that it is the higher level of engagement that's driving the URR.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I think as you've indicated, obviously the restructuring is going to help you at least slow some of the growth of OpEx. But you'll look to take at least some of those benefits and reinvest it, I guess, presumably in marketing and promotion. Can you talk about how those potentially offsetting factors might impact the pace at which you revert to that longer-term ratio of expenses to manage revenues of 68%, 69%?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I think -- so that percentage includes both marketing rewards and operating expense. And I think we want to be focused on operating expense growth levels and achieve our target of less than 3% growth over the next 2 years. We're going to take a piece of that and reinvest it back in the business. So that could be marketing and promotion, or it could be on the operating expense line as well, depending what we think is going to give us the best return. But it will be a piece of what we save, what we reinvest. And therefore, I think it'll actually continue to increase the leverage in this calculation and enable us to continue to head back to where we were. So part of it is to help with leverage and part is to enable higher levels of investment.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is that 69% level realistic for 2013?","Daniel T. Henry","60...","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","69%?","Daniel T. Henry","I'm not sure what the 69% is.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Of the -- your expenses to manage revenues?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I don't think we've set a target for next year. We were at 71% for the full year of 2012 and at 70% in the fourth quarter. So if we're successful on operating expense, you might expect that to decrease. I don't think we disclosed an exact amount. Certainly, it wouldn't take us all the way back to 67%, but I think we can continue to make progress towards that goal.","Operator","And at this time, there are no other questions in queue.","Daniel T.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Toby Willard, Head of Investor Relation. Please go ahead, sir.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Kathy. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s other reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome as well to VDU, as this is your first quarterly earnings call, since he took over the leadership of our Investor Relations function from the capable hands of Rick Petrino few months ago.","Overall, our results this quarter reflected what we consider solid core underlying earnings performance. Reported Q2 EPS of $1.42 was relatively consistent with the prior year, while understanding our performance is more complex than usual this quarter for several reasons. As expected, the results reflected discrete impacts including a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, the impact of various changes to our cobrand partnerships and the initial stages of our ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives.","On a year-over-year basis this quarter, EPS growth was also impacted by the prior year net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and of course Business Travel\u2019s Q2, 2014 operating results. Looking through the complexity of these items, our core underlying earnings performance was generally consistent with the financial outlook framework that we first shared with you at our Investor Day in March. We continue to view this framework as the usual way to understand the drivers of our performance through the period of the multiyear financial outlook we first provided in February of this year.","Accordingly, we have included this financial outlook framework that\u2019s the first slide in our earnings presentation today. Looking at our results through this lens, we saw revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX in the prior year impact of Business Travel revenues. We built upon this revenue performance with disciplined expense control and the return of significant amounts of capital to shareholders.","This solid core performance included making strong progress of some key initiatives highlight included the launch of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S., the expansion of our OptBlue small merchant program in Canada, the roll out of two new Centurion Airport Lounges, refreshes of our Gold and Starwood\u2019s products as well as the launch earlier this month of Amex Express Checkout, our online merchant Checkout solution.","As we expected, our solid core underlying performance was impacted by the discrete impacts from the strong dollar and FX along with the changes in our cobrand partnerships. In terms of our spending on incremental growth initiatives, we are really just starting to ramp these up and you will see that much more concentrated in the second half of the year.","As a result is while our year-to-date, our earnings are up approximately 5% versus last year, we would expect earnings per share for the second half of the year to be down versus the prior year consistent with our discussions on Investor Day. For these reasons, our full-year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect earnings per share for the full-year to be flat to modestly down. Just where in this range we end up will be a function of a level of incremental spending we do towards the second half of the year along with our billings and revenue trends.","We also believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and to be within our target range of 12% to 15% earnings per share growth in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall this outlook does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.","Now to turn to a high level review of our financial results for Q2, as you can see on Slide 3, reported billings growth was 2% on an FX adjusted basis, billings grew 6% significantly higher than our reported rate but modestly slower than the first quarter. I\u2019ll provide more details on our billings performance shortly but we did see some deceleration in volume growth in the U.S. that was partially offset by improving growth across most international markets.","Reported revenue growth was down 4% due to the inclusion of Business Travel revenues in the prior year and the stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%; net income was down 4% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and Business Travel operating income in Q2, 2014 which together contributed approximately $0.08 to EPS in the prior year. Below the net income line, we made our first preferred dividend payment during the second quarter which reduced EPS by approximately $0.02.","We also continued to leverage our strong capital positions to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 51 million common shares which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding benefited EPS which was down only 1% versus the prior year despite the 4% drop at net income. This performance resulted in an ROE of 28% for the period ended June 30, well above our on average and over time target of 25% and demonstrate the continued strength of our business model.","Let\u2019s now move to a more detailed review of our key performance progress during the second quarter starting with build business on the Slide 4. On an FX adjusted basis billings grow the slowed modestly 7% in Q1 to 6% in Q2 as you can see the primary driver of that decline is the U.S. where we saw growth of 5% down from 6% in Q1.","I\u2019ll provide more details on the drivers of the U.S. performance by segment in a few minutes. Across our international regions we saw strong growth in JAPA which was again the fastest growing region in the quarter up 16% on an FX adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China, Japan. We also saw improved performance in EMEA where the growth in the U.K. remains in the double digits. The decline in volumes in the LACC region was driven by Canada which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada.","Outside of Canada we are seeing improved performance in LACC particularly in Mexico the growth has accelerated during 2015. To turn to Costco and Canada for just a moment while it is still early we continued to be pleased by our efforts to catch the spent of the Costco cobrand card methods as you recall the September 2014 we\u2019ve launched a new cash back card in Canada, that was offered a former Costco Canada card members and it appears to be resonated well. Through the second quarter we\u2019ve been able to retain over half of the other stores spend related to the former Canadian Costco cobrand product.","Now I would pause here and highlight that this result is very specific to the Costco relationship in Canada and has the little relevance for the U.S. As we said the two situations are very different, was the most important distinction being that there was no portfolio sale in Canada. If you assume there is a portfolio sale in the U.S, it will have a profound impact on our ability to capture the spend and lend of the Costco card members in the U.S. obviously the sales itself automatically moves to card member relationship.","In addition as you might expect when a portfolio was sold there are likely to be contractual restrictions on what types of marketing activities to the seller is permitted to engage in. We realized that all remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco cobrand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality this is a very complex transaction and I can\u2019t comment on the specifics during the negotiation. I will remind you now that our contract with Costco imposes its own constrain on the sale process with of course by the contract and will continue to update you as appropriate.","To return to billings now and to provide you with some additional perspective on our international performance. We included Slide 5 quarter which shows total international volume growth with and without Canadian volumes on an FX adjusted basis as depicted it by the green line on the slide international volume growth excluding Canada increased 13% during Q2 and this trend has being driven by improved performance across all of our international regions excluding Canada.","Looking into results by segment on Slide 6, we saw a sequential decline in growth in GCS where billings were up 2% on an FX adjusted basis, similar to last quarter we continued to see slower spending across the number of corporate customers primarily in the U.S. In our U.S. consumer and small business segment we also saw some deceleration in growth to 6% in Q2. This performance continues to be impacted by gas prices, which we down 27% year-over-year. I would remind you that gas billings comprise about 2% to 3% our volumes. The U.S. billings performance also reflects the current external economic environment, which remains uneven.","Another driver of the sequential change in billings growth the U.S. CS segment was our Costco US portfolio. Historically, Costco billings have tended to generally grow in line with the U.S. CS average growth rate, but in the quarter, while still positive, Costco co brand car growth rates slowed to well below the segment average. The slower growth is in part due to a decrease in new card acquisitions. As you would expect during a wind down period, we have agreed with Costco to reduce our joint marketing efforts.","Turing to GNS, this continues to be our strongest billings growth segment with FX suggested growth of 16% during the current quarter. This consistently strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the much higher than average returns on equity of the GNS business and the fact that more than 85% of GNS volumes are from international markets. And again, I would remind you that the slower growth in ICS being driven by the end of our relationship with Costco and Canada, which I just discussed.","In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S. as you can see at the bottom of Slide 7.","Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX suggested revenue growth rates for the last eight quarters as you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the second quarter, foreign exchange had a slightly larger impact on our results than in Q1 driving adjusted revenue growth down by four percentage points.","As you know, this revenue impacted partially offset by the benefit we received from having certain expenses to nominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom-line impact especially when rates move this dramatically. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength our business model. At current FX rates, we would expect to see similar drag in the third quarter, but a smaller impacted Q4 as we begin to lap a significant strengthening of the dollar that occurred at the end of last year.","Turing now to loan, you see on Slide 8, that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio growth continues outpace the industry and move relatively consistent with the prior quarter at 7%. Looking continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain a greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.","Regarding the Costco loan portfolio in the U.S., which we consider of course to be a very high quality portfolio. We had previously disclosed that it made up about 20% of worldwide loans as at the end of 2014. It remains that approximately 20% of worldwide loans today have a growth rate in the portfolio is starting to slow in line with spending.","On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact of FX rates and an expected decline in loans related to the Costco Canada cobrand portfolio. So putting it all together on the revenue side on Slide 9, you can see that revenues declined by 4% on a reported basis, but increased by 5% on adjusting for FX and Business Travel of news in the prior year.","While this suggested growth was consistent with last quarter, we did this quarter have a benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals, we also had some unfavorable timing impacts in the prior year. These items collectively benefited the year-over-year discount revenue growth rate and also resulted in one basis point increase in the reported discount rate versus the prior year. These specific impacts as well as the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume where we are in a much lower discount rate, lower than offset the expected downward impact on the reported discount rate from growth in the OptBlue program and industry mix changes.","I would remind you that from quarter-to-quarter, individual merchant related items can cause fluctuations in the reported discount rate. While broadly we said for a number of years that you should expect to see the reported discount rate declined two to three basis points a year on average due to changes in the mix of spending by locations and industry, volume related pricing discounts competition and more recently growth of OptBlue amongst other factors.","Regarding OptBlue we have been pleased with the progress we have made signing up merchant acquirers for the program and the pace at which those acquirers have added new merchants to our network. Year-to-date, we have signed up over 700,000 new merchants in the U.S. through OptBlue and we are focused on driving card member spending those incremental merchants. We are also undertaking similar ones to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world as evidenced by the launch of the OptBlue program in Canada this quarter.","Coming back to our revenue performance more broadly, as we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters the gap between total discount revenue and total billed business growth was again impacted by GNS and cash rebate products growing faster than the company average. Before moving on let me first touch on a couple other items on the slide starting with the other key component of revenue, net interest income. Here we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding cost.","As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S. the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines. Turning to net card fees, other commissions and fees and other revenue, these lines were all impacted for greater extent by foreign exchange and also reflected growth in loyalty coalition revenue and some timing items in the prior year.","As we discussed in Investor Day, the loyalty coalition business is one of our most important initiatives to find profitable growth in adjacencies and we have been expanding the business since our acquisition of Loyalty Partner in 2011. Reported revenues - tangible example of how we can leverage our digital capabilities to provide value for merchants while creating a new revenue stream for the company. During the quarter together with our merchant partners, we were pleased to launch Plenti, our loyalty coalition program in the U.S. while it is still very early days, we have been encouraged by the initial response and it already has more than 20 million total collectors.","Moving now to credit performance on Slide 10, you can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels with our write-off offering declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rate remaining flat. As you can see on Slide 11, the steady lending credit performance as well as lower write-off and our charge card portfolio and benefits from FX helps drive a 4% decline in provision versus the prior year.","Though we experienced a year-over-year decline in provision this quarter, looking ahead we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance therefore we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and represent headwind to growth in the second half of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day we did build into our multiyear financial outlook and assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.","Shifting now to expenses on Slide 12, on a reported basis expenses declined 4% versus the prior year. Clearly there are a number of items impacting expense growth year-over-year including the Business Travel joint venture related items and Business Travel operating expenses in the prior year. Expenses also benefited year-over-year from the change in foreign exchange rates, I\u2019ll walk you through this impacts in more detail as you review marketing and promotion and operating expenses, performance in a few moments.","First however, let me touch on a few other items on this slide. Rewards expense grew by 1% which was a bit slower than reported build business growth. Growth this quarter does include a portion of the discreet impact form our renewed cobrand partnerships. However that impact was more than offset by a decline in membership rewards related expenses in part due to an enhancement to the ultimate redemption rate estimation process in certain international markets it occurred last year.","Turing to cost of card member services, you see a significant year-over-year increase of 26% consistent with the commentary provided last quarter as you recall a portion of the expense in this line has increased as a result of our renewed cobrand partnerships and we would expect these elevated levels of growth continued for the remainder of 2015.","Let\u2019s focus now on marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13 and make a few points. First, recall that last year in Q2 we leverage the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction to support an elevated level to spend lapping this elevated level along with this year\u2019s beneficial impact from FX led to the decline of 21% you see year-over-year.","Second, we have been clear since the Costco decision was made in February that we intend for spend on incremental growth in this during full year 2015. To be relatively simpler with the elevated level we were added full year 2014. This remains our intention; I would also point out that while the largest piece of this increment spending will flow through the marketing and promotion line a portion well also had operating expenses come to revenue.","Last looking at Slide 13, you see that we were still on the process of wrapping up our initiatives in Q2; you should expect to see marketing and promotion expense increased substantially in the second half of the year. As we have said the elevated level of spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we have across our company, it was our key initiatives including acquire a new card members, gaining additional spend and lend from existing consumer small business and middle market customers, expanding our presence internationally, growing our merchant network to program such as OptBlue, building our loyalty correlation business with things like the launch of Plenti in the U.S. and introducing new digital capabilities.","Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 14. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of business travel on the prior year across a number of expense categories. Complicating line-by-line comparisons. Additionally, this quarter\u2019s results were significantly impacted by last year\u2019s items related to the creation of the Business Travel joint venture, excluding expense related to the business travel joint venture transaction as well as expenses from Business Travel operations in 2014. Adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by5% in the quarter aided in part by a benefit from FX.","Moving to Slide 15 adjusted operating expense growth year-to-date remains well below our 3% growth target. As [indiscernible] noted in our Investor Day in March however we are not achieving this disciplined expense control for a cut back in investment levels but were added to ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. We continued to make strategic investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives. This is just one example.","Earlier this month we leveraged our unique technology in assets to launch Amex express check out which allows Amex card members to check out quickly, using their Amex login credentials. Looking ahead to the second half of the year I point out again that portion of the incremental spending on growth initiatives well had operating expenses including technology initiatives to enhance our small business in corporate capabilities.","Now shifting to capital performance on Slide 16. During the current quarter we return 97% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our already strong capital ratios. Our Q2 performance demonstrates our confidence in the company\u2019s ability to generate capital while maintaining at financial strength and we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.","Looking at the capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, I remind you that the greater year-over-year increase in the tier-1 capital ratio was driven by our recent preferred issuances do remain our first dividend payment this quarter. This payment has recognized there is a reduction of earnings available to common shareholders and therefore reduced our EPS by 1% during Q2.","Let me now provide an update of DOJ lawsuit before I could conclude and take your questions. We are disappointed, that our request for a stay of the decision in the adjunction was denied this quarter. We have of course, moved forward to comply with the trail courts remedy. As a result of the stay being denied, we can no longer enforce certain contractual provisions that prevent US merchants from steering customers to use other credit and charge cards. We are appealing the trail court\u2019s ruling. It is we believe that we will not provide any benefit to consumers and will in fact our competition.","Steering is not a good thing for sub-sellers, we believe many merchants to group. At this point, even that the remedy just took effect earlier this week, it\u2019s too early to tell what the impact in the market place will be. We are staying focused on delivering value to merchants and deeply believe in the strength our value proposition. I\u2019d also remind you that there are a number of other private merchant litigation cases, the Eastern district had New York and other proceeding seeking monitory damages that will begin to progress as our appeal is being heard.","So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you to confirm. And going back to the key things in our results. Our results show solid core earnings performance built to turn off financial model of having diversified growth businesses, disciplined expense controls and capital strength. While billed business growth overall slowed modestly for the first quarter, we saw positive momentum across many areas of our business including international merchant acquisition and loyalty collision.","Going forward, given our 5% EPS growth year-to-date simple math would indicate that EPS growth will have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.","As I mentioned, the biggest driver of where will end up within this EPS range will be the level of incremental spending on growth initiatives over the balance of the year, as well as our billings in revenue trends. Going back to our investor day in March, we discussed our plan to leverage incremental spending in 2015 to help drive sustainable growth going forward. We continue to believe this is the appropriate long term strategy and also that we have a range of attractive growth opportunities.","All this is also consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance will be more and even than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full year earnings outlook rather than our performance in any individual quarter.","Stepping back, as we\u2019ve discussed in multiple forms over the past couple of years, we of course have three on averaging overtime financial targets. Generating EPS growth from 12% to 15%, our return on equity of 25% or better and revenue growth of above 8%. Clearly our top focus when we think about these targets, is generating consistent EPS growth from 12% to 15%, which in most environments we have a fairly good track record of achieving over the 20 plus years that the target have been in place.","Our recent revenue performance has been below our aspirationally present target and we expect to remain below that level during the near term given some of the discrete impacts on our performance I noted earlier, as well as the current low inflation and low growth in economic environment.","However, when you think about our financial targets, the revenue target is just one of the facilitating leverage that we use to help drive 12% to 15% EPS growth. We have consistently demonstrated that we can achieve our EPS target across a variety of different economic buyer environments without having 8% revenue growth. In a context of our year-to-date results, we believe that our core earnings performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model that we are doing the right things to position the company for the long-term.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Toby with some details on our Q&A session.","Toby Willard","Thank you, Jeff. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the session, therefore before we open up the lines for Q&A I\u2019ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process.","With that, the operator will now open up the lines for questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. I guess I was trying to get a little bit more color on some of the commentary you had around retention, the Costco portfolio given the sale process and how we should think about a gain that might occur in fact you saw the portfolio and you can\u2019t go after those customers, could you just talk about how that affects the 2016 guidance. Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Good questions, Sanjay. Thank you. So the point I was trying to make in my remarks were we can now give you a little bit of information that are trying to help you understand what is going on in Canada where there was no portfolio sale but we were able to reissue cards with in fact the same card number in where we are pleased that we are tracking to retain over half of the store spend.","As I give people that detail, I think it\u2019s really important to realize that that is a completely different situation to what may happen in the U.S. and if you assume there is a portfolio sales in the U.S. where all the card members are automatically moved to new card and new issuer. If you assume that in general these contracts to your point Sanjay have restrictions around marketing, I want to caution people that you expect to get a very, very different outcome from what is happening in Canada and that\u2019s the way the U.S. were to play out.","When you think about portfolio sale and assuming there is a gain we\u2019ve been I think consistent for quite some time in saying that we would use that gain or at least portions of that gain to help on continued spending on a variety of growth initiatives and when you think about our company and our growth opportunities, we have many, many opportunities to grow in every part of our business and every part of the globe and so the efforts we may or may not make at times around Costco card members are just one small piece what is a much broader pie of opportunities we see to really effectively continue to spend in elevated levels marketing promotion and certain other things.","So I wouldn\u2019t overly try to tie it on JV elevated levels of spending with any particular segment including the Costco segment, it\u2019s really an elevated level of funding that we\u2019re applying to the best opportunities we have which occur all across our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Booth with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Booth","Thank you. Good afternoon. My question relates to marketing and promotion expense, you obviously are looking to increase that in the back half of the year, looking back at some of the recent experience going back to 2010, 2011 where you really did increase spending pretty dramatically then to drive growth, the level of that you accelerated spending at that time were considerably higher than what I think you\u2019re basically guiding to for the back half of the year, so I guess the question is do you think that taking up marketing and promotional expense to say somewhere in the say 34, 35, 36 basis points per unit billing is going to be sufficient to get to the growth you need to achieve your targets and if I\u2019m thinking about it wrong, is there a way to dimensionalize that?","Jeff Campbell","Well I think the way I would think about it Ken it\u2019s very good question is we have a range of opportunities, on the other hand we want to be really prudent about only focusing on those opportunities that offer really good returns for our shareholders. When you look at in fact one of the slides in the presentation today which lays out the last eight or nine quarters of spending around marketing and promotion, I would say if you stare at that slide a little bit, it will give you a more realistic sense of the range of spending that we would consider elevated and that we would consider a range where we can vary efficiently and vary effectively in today\u2019s environment to deploy all the dollars. I wouldn\u2019t, I\u2019ll be cautious about going back and looking at analogies from 2010 and 2011. It\u2019s a very, very different situation. So I think if you look at that more recent set of histories and think about the highest levels that\u2019s probably more we can target and be really effective.","Kenneth Booth","Good, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to James Friedman with FIG. Please go ahead.","James Friedman","Hi, my question is about Europe and the changes in the interchange environment there, just looking for some high level thoughts on how you might characterize your strategy now that competitor cards out there interchange rates capped is do you see that as an opportunity going forward?","Jeff Campbell","Well, it\u2019 very good question Jim, let me step back and say clearly as a general matter we don\u2019t think regulation is a good thing for consumers and merchants and for this category, when you look at the European Union regulation and the final layout of it, it certainly confirms our view that most of the reforms are really targeted at addressing concerns around Visa and MasterCard\u2019s interchange practices but as we along said, the reality is there are always impacts in these situations on our business some of which can create challenges for us we\u2019ve talked this particular case, in particular about the fact that there is some new cross border dynamics that are putting some pressure on our discount rates in Europe.","All that said, one of the strengths of our business model is we\u2019re out there every day having to prove our value to card members and merchants and everyday evolving the way we work with both to demonstrate that value that does give us an ability to flex and demonstrate our value in ways that others can\u2019t necessarily in this regulatory environment.","So we are working hard to manage some of the negative impacts of the regulation and use other parts of it to find ways to be even more creative about adding value to merchants and our card members and I would say well obviously the legislation hasn\u2019t had any or much material impact yet. We\u2019re pleased with the results we see right now in Europe and we\u2019re going to work really hard to try to continue those.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.","David Ho","Good afternoon. Could you talk about some of the interest rate headwinds that you might face and then what are not that baked into the 2016 guidance and what you may do as a company to offset some of those on paper headwinds from the liability side typically that you have currently.","Jeff Campbell","So good question, David. We of course are unusual in that raising rate environment in isolation if you hold everything out steady, is a negative for us and we put a number in our 10-K just use round numbers that says all else being equal, 100 basis point rise and all interest rates will cost us around $200 million a year, when you look at the outlook we provided, we built it, we\u2019re trying to be realistic in that outlook and so we built a steadily rising rate environment into that outlook for that matter I remind you we also built a little bit of steady uptick in some of the provision costs as well.","So relative to our outlook, you would have to have a spike in interest rates that was much quicker and larger than what the general economic consensus has been to cause us to see any impact relative to that outlook. In terms of how we think about offsetting the impact of those rising interest costs, if you look historically there is hugely some natural hedge here because as a general matter Central banks and the Fed tend to raise rates more when there is a little bit stronger economic environment and raise little less when the economic environment is not so strong and obviously the rest of our business benefits tremendously when there is a little bit stronger economic environment.","Beyond that the reality is we\u2019ve - the largest source of our position on our sensitivity - interest rate is the strength of our charge card franchise, we love that business, we think it\u2019s a great business and so it just comes with this one aspect that we have to manage as interest rates at some point inevitably raised. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next we have Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Go ahead, please.","Craig Maurer","Yes, hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask if you could frame the upload discussion little bit differently versus your historical penetration versus Visa and MasterCard in the U.S. in terms of merchant coverage, how has the additional 700,000 merchants helped you close that gap?","Jeff Campbell","Well, good question, Craig. I think there is a couple aspects to this. So because you first have to close the actual coverage gap and then you have to make progress on closing the perception gap and there is a time lag as you do both those things. So the program that we first begin to talk about little over a year ago was one where we said boy, if you play out the incremental merchants that we think we can get if you look at just the cycle of those merchants and how often they wrap as all merchants would acquirers, then you have a multi-year process here before we believe we can get to the point where in fact you signed on most merchants in the U.S. relative to MasterCard, Visa, you could have a process that then extends beyond that to match that with perceptions and to drive card members to those merchants.","If you think about the things they said a few minutes ago as I pointed out they were really pleased with our progress this year on OptBlue and we\u2019ve signed 700,000 new merchants under it. We also have to wait, say get them signed up and then you have to go through a process to drive business to those merchants. And we\u2019re engaged in that and we\u2019re certainly not at the point today where we would say that we have materially closed the coverage gap, so we\u2019re not going to go out and start talking about that until we\u2019ve gotten further end of this.","So this is clearly a multi-year effort because you\u2019re talking about a couple of million merchants, you ultimately have to add on to the role and it\u2019s a multi-year effort to change perceptions but we\u2019re really pleased with the way it\u2019s going. We feel strongly that when you take a multiyear view of this company, this is the really important part of our growth story and we will continue to give you a sense each quarter of how it\u2019s going.","Craig Maurer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question now from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. I was just wondering given the commentary you made about the opportunities for marketing, why did you wait till the second half and could you talk a little bit about how some of the new products that you\u2019ve been marketing and will be marketing especially like the 631 cards will impact the profitability?","Jeff Campbell","Well, all fair questions, Moshe. We went into 2015 as we began the year in January with an assumption that we would be continuing our very long-term partnership with Costco and we set marketing plans, then we set budgets, then we set the management teams off to execute on that plan. When we change that plan in February, and decided to go down a different path and concluded that we think in the long run we can generate more value for our shareholders with the past we\u2019ve now gone down.","We really have to do a little bit of a reset and we\u2019ve managed the company for the long-term, we want to be thoughtful and we chose to do something as dramatic as we\u2019ve done. Go to our shareholders and say we\u2019ve going to ramp up spending this year and it\u2019s going to result in not a lot of earnings growth and in fact EPS could even be down a little bit this year.","We want to be really thoughtful about the way we deploy those resources and so while we began to deploy them in the second quarter to be as thoughtful as we wanted to be, reality is it\u2019s taking us until the third quarter to get fully ramped up. So we think that\u2019s the right way around the company, the right results and as we said beginning back in February we\u2019re stepping away a little bit from overly focusing on each individual quarter.","Moshe Orenbuch","And the rewards, the profit of the impact on rewards costs of the new products.","Jeff Campbell","Well, look, the rewards environment in general has always been competitive and is pretty competitive right now, what we really try to focus on sure are a couple of things. Number one, ultimately this is about broad customer value proposition rewards is one component of that. We have a brand, we have a reputation for security and trust and service and try to leverage those things. Second, we have a very broad portfolio of products in the U.S. and we do that because we think there is tremendous value in making sure you are delivering to different customer segments that things they value the most, whether it be cash back rewards products, things that use our membership rewards program which is of course still by far the largest and most diversified rewards program or our many co brand products.","And by focusing on the broader customer value proposition by making sure we\u2019re being really thoughtful about how we segment the different customer groups and produce something that they are going to mostly highly value. We think we can get to the best possible result for both our card members and our share holders without having to compete dollar for dollar on every single aspect that every single product. So we feel good about some of the latest things we\u2019ve launched, certainly the big launch in the last 12 months was around the everyday card last year that card has performed better than we had anticipated. It has reached a little bit different demographic which is exactly what we are trying to do and so we are pretty pleased with that.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please, go ahead.","David Hochstim","Yes, hi. Thanks. I wonder what\u2019s the benefit of another three months of analysis if you could provide more color around the decline that we've seen in GCS build business and is weather a factor, comparisons and what is the outlook for some improvement in the third quarter and I guess, really just wondering why that has declined so much par rapidly than U.S. CS build business for example.","Jeff Campbell","So very good question, Dave there is two things, there was a sequential decline here Q1 to Q2 from 42% that decline actually relates to one product with actually anyone large customer and it\u2019s an airline fuel buying product very, very low margin product. As an old airline CFO, I will point out the airlines are little flush with cash right now and so they\u2019re sort of minimizing their use of these products which help them out with cash flow, that is what caused the drop from four to two as you go from Q2 from Q1.","Now four is still a low number and as I said last quarter boy, as we had really scrubbed our customer base, all I can tell you it is U.S. not international markets, it is very broadly spread in terms of a slowdown in just the organic growth spending trends amongst our mid-sized and larger clients. T and E oriented and very broad spread. So you can draw different conclusion from that is this company is tightening T and E budgets as they think about the economic environment as if little bit of fare pressure on the airline, lots of different areas and you can add your own but those are the facts as we see them.","David Hochstim","Was there any change late in the quarter that would lead to a different trend in Q3?","Jeff Campbell","You know we\u2019re always cautious David about reading too much into trends that occur over a couple of weeks. So as I would say, no we will just have to see how Q3 plays out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Vendetti with Citigroup. Go ahead please.","Don Vendetti","Yes Jeff in terms of your American Express Checkout product, that was pretty interesting that you can use your existing ID and password, I was just curious what you found as you\u2019ve rolled that out to merchants, are you having to offer any type of economic incentive, I know some of the networks have suggested it, it can be a more tricky to get their merchants to prioritize that and how quickly do you think you can grow that penetration to your top merchants?","Jeff Campbell","Well of course very, very early days here. We have just announced the product; it\u2019s available with a small number of initial websites with longer public list of people who will soon be adding it. Certainly we have done some pilot types before we launched it and of course the key here that everyone is trying to get to with these products is you\u2019re trying to get to a much higher percentage of people who go all the way through to the Ad and buy what they\u2019ve been looking at in any particular online or mobile experience and I would say we and the couple of merchants we had doing pilots with us were very encouraged by the results that we achieved in terms of improving those rates of getting people through to the final step.","So when you think about the economic arrangements, I obviously can\u2019t comment on specific economic arrangements, so what this is really about and real part of goal that everybody chasing here is can you get those rates up significantly and to the extent you can prove that you can then the economics take care of themselves for everyone and that is what we are seeking here, now I will go back to where I started it is very early days and we are going to have to see how things progress here but we are encouraged by the early results we think we have products with some very interesting features relative to some of the other alternatives it is very simple, it is very quick but we will like to give you an update as time goes on.","Don Vendetti","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Sameer Gokhale","Hi thank you. So just quick first question about the steering injunction which became effective on 20th of July, at this point have you notified all merchants that they can in fact steer just wanted to get a sense for that and then in terms of earlier this year there was a restructuring initiative enrolling 4000 jobs and just wanted to get an update on that, have you completed that restructuring with the 4000 jobs just an update on that would be helpful, thank you.","Jeff Campbell","So let me take those one at a time, so start with the DoJ, so you are correct the judge\u2019s order became effective at the beginning of this week and we are in the process of following that order, one part of that process is notifying all of our merchants of their right to steer and that will be happening for the order in the next several weeks.","There is other aspects to it but that is certainly one of the most important parts. As we think about the order I think the first thing I would say is when we sit here and think about it today, we believe that in near term, the financial impact of these orders within the financial outlook that we provided at Investor Day reiterated it again today no clearly in the longer term we are going to have to see how the marketplace reacts to the order and think about what impact that is going to have on our business normally. So that is where we are with the DoJ, much more straightforward question yes we took restructuring charge last year to involve about 4000 employees there we are well into that.","However there is still a significant portion still to come some of this involves fairly complex moves as we right interestingly enough a lot of this is moving from one non-U.S. location to another non-U.S. location at some of our operations that has to be done very thoughtfully and so there is a very experienced team is doing this who is involved in that process but they won\u2019t be done until much closer to the end of this year.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question now from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Thanks. Follow-up questions on what is embedded in your EPS growth guidance, what do you contemplate in terms of FX, is it I\u2019m assuming is it consistent with what you laid out Jeff or fading headwind from FX in the fourth quarter and if that is the case does that assume no further appreciation in the dollar in there, what might happen if you see continued dollar strength and also what happens if credit is more benign then you are thinking and you don\u2019t see the provision ramp in the back half of the year, could we expect that to part of the bottom-line or would you expected kind of reinvest the benefit to that.","Jeff Campbell","Yes, two good questions, so on FX essentially what is built into our multiyear financial outlook to use broad strokes is roughly the rates you see today and so to the extent because it is hard to imagine these may be same as last words if you could have another move as dramatic as you have had in the last 12 months beyond where we are today. If you do that will be a tough headwind for us that will do our best to manage.","I just remind you that the movement of the U.S. dollar so far so fast against so many currencies all it once as it\u2019s done in the last nine months you have to go back quite a number of decades to point another group like that so it could happen but will have to see on credit you\u2019re correct we built in both in the back half of this year as well as into our 2016 and 2017 outlook some modest up stand steady uptick in the provision and growth of the loan provisions, clearly we have a very steady track record now in growing our loans above the industry average.","What happens if that is more benign well that will be a very good thing, what I would say in terms of the bottom-line is what we are trying to be true to at this point is the financial outlook that we provide to people and making sure we are really well position to demonstrate and to execute upon, once we\u2019ve left all the FX, once we left all the cobrand changes, once we left Costco in U.S demonstrating the people that the business model, financial model that produced to 12 to 15 EPS growth rates throughout 15% is in place and is working well.","And so credit is a little bit more benign we will frankly look to see whether we are operating within the financial outlook that we haven\u2019t whether we have other growth initiative funding that we fact think you could be for shareholders are properly redeployed or whether we want to take into the bottom-line to make sure we feel comfortable that we coming with kind of outlook we provided so well there is all, we have lot of when we repeat as We'll have to see where they come out, but hopefully, mark, that will give you a sense at how we\u2019ll think about things.","Mark DeVries","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi Jeff, this is Eric Wasserstrom, how are you? I just want a follow up on David Ho\u2019s question, one of the teams that\u2019s come out from the recent slide of bank reporting has been some enthusiasm after many quarters of may be not so much enthusiasm about the growth in C&I credit demand and the growing growth in middle market demand and to the extent that corporate now are demanding more credits presumably to fund operations, do you think that potentially, pick up in spending in the middle market and corporate universe.","Jeff Campbell","Well, Eric I got to say that\u2019s the one where I hope you right and I hope that\u2019s the signal but all I can do is tell you what we are seeing in our corporate business I remind you it is a - where we do lots of things in the GCT segment the biggest component is still tied to more or less T and E oriented spend by mid to large size companies and so I have read some of those same comments that you just referenced will have to see whether they show up in our results over time certainly through June 30, it would be hard to see that.","Toby Willard","Hey Cathy we probably have time for one more question.","Operator","Alright. Thank you that will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.","Cheryl Pate","Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to circle back to some of the earlier comments on OptBlue and sort of closing the perception gap, can you just may be help us bank through is that increased finance with the merchants or is it more proactive with the card members and then how would tie that into I know we've talked about in the past the economics sort of move into the positive on OptBlue at some point this year. Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","It\u2019s a good question. And the answer of course is, yes. It\u2019s sort of all those things so there is - not to get overly tactical here. You have to get the merchants signed up, the reality is we have trained over many decades, our card members to look for little stickers in the window and so you literally send teams of people out to make sure the stickers are going up in the windows and that helps. There is an element of educating our card members.","Now here there\u2019s sort of we have to think about the pacing and the timing, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be if you were Cheryl an AmEx card member, which I\u2019m sure you are of course, want to get an e-mail from us every single time we signed up any merchant within 10 miles of you because you get tired of seeing all the e-mails and you would ignore.","So you kind of have to be thoughtful about when is the right time to communicate in the most impactful way to our card members and when do you make sure you are doing that soon enough so the merchants who sign up, start to see AmEx card members and feel good about what they have done. So there is no magic here, it\u2019s a matter of balancing some of those basic blocking and tackling things we need to do. But we are very focused on it.","I\u2019ll go back to that\u2019s why I said so far this year, we\u2019re pleased with all the sign ups and we are very focused now on continuing the signs but also beginning to drive more business to those merchants I would say we remain on track for this year for the program overall to be a positive to our bottom-line when you look at the net of all the positives and negatives. And we are tracking to our plan over a couple of years to much more significantly close the coverage gap.","So, Cheryl, thank you for that last question and thanks to everybody for joining us on tonight\u2019s call. I guess I would go back probably to where I started and where I ended earlier, which is, there is a lot of complexity in our results but we think that this quarter does again reflects solid core underlying performance. With that I will wish you all a good evening and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now like to turn the conference over to Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.","Rick Petrino","Thank you. Welcome, and thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. Before I turn it over to Dan Henry, I want to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the SEC.","In the first quarter 2012 earnings release and earnings supplement, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We have  provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to  Q&A.","  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I will start on Slide 2. So revenue net of interest expense for the quarter was $7.6 billion. That's 8%  higher than the first quarter of last year. On an FX-adjusted  basis, revenue increased 9%. Net income came in at $1,256,000,000. Diluted EPS is $1.07, that's up 10% from last year. And our return on average equity is at 27%.  The decrease in shares outstanding that you see is a reflection of our share buyback program.","Moving to Slide 3, which are our metric performance, billed business came in at $211 billion. That's an increase of 12% year-over-year and 13% on an FX-adjusted  basis. So this year, actually, we have a benefit, we think, from leap year, an extra day. So I would characterize our growth as generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2011, which had growth of about 11%.  Cards-in-force is up to 98 million. That's a 7% increase from last year. Cards issued by GNS partners grew 16%. Proprietary cards grew 2%, and so we're up about 1.3 million cards compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","  Average basic card member spending is up 10%. That's continued high engagement by our customers. Loans came in at $60 billion. That's up 4% as it's growing gradually, although I note that spending on lending products is growing faster. And travel sales are up modestly.","If we move to Slide 4, so this is billed business growth by region. So each region is up modestly, reflecting, I think, again the fact that we had a leap year this year. Excluding that, the growth rates by region are reasonably stable with the fourth quarter.","Europe had a growth rate of 6% in this first quarter. In Northern Europe, the growth rates were higher. Germany, for instance, grew at 8%. The U.K. also grew at 8%. Southern Europe was somewhat weaker, low single-digit growth. Spain, for instance, grew at 2%. The  growth in each region is similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.","Moving to Slide 5, so this is  billed business growth by segment. So the red line is the total company, and that's at 12%. GNS is the yellow line and continues to be somewhat above the average for the company, and it grew at 17%. International Consumer is the light blue square line, and it's slightly less than the company average coming in at 9% FX adjusted. And that was influenced by the lower growth rate in Europe.  U.S. Consumer is the dark blue diamond line, and  Global Corporate Services, the green triangle. Here, growth rates are similar to the total company."," ","Moving over to Slide 6, so this is lending billed business compared to managed loan growth. So the solid line is the growth rate for spending on lending products. The growth in spending on lending products is in line with the overall growth rate in billed business. The dotted line is the growth rate in loans. So we continue to see a difference in the growth rate on lending spending and ending loans, though  this gap is narrowing. The relative ratios of growth rates  going forward will be a function of lending customers' behavior in the future.  I would note, and this is not on the slide, but I note that  the net interest yield on loans was 9.2%  this quarter, and that's the same as the first quarter of 2011.","Slide 7 is revenue performance. So discount  revenue increased 9%, and that reflects 12% growth in billed business. While we had a 2-basis point decrease in the discount rate from 2.55% in the first quarter of 2011 to 2.35% this quarter, and this is driven by our strategy to increase penetration into everyday spend categories, as well as the mix of spending. It was also impacted by the relatively faster growth in GNS, and as you know, GNS, a portion of that discount rate we share with our GNS partners. It's also impacted by higher contra-revenues,  including volume-related  incentives to corporate customers and higher cash back rewards.","Card fees grew in line with the growth in proprietary cards-in-force. Travel commissions and fees reflect slightly higher sales and slightly lower commissions and supplier revenues.  Other commission fees are 10% higher, primarily reflecting the full quarter of Loyalty Partner. So we have 3 months in this quarter. Last year, we just had one month, and that's partially offset by lower foreign exchange conversion revenue.","  Other revenue increased 22%. So this reflects higher royalty revenues from GNS partner and also reflects the benefit in revision of our estimate for un-cashed TCs  in international markets.","Net interest income is up 6%, and this is driven by a 4% increase in card member loans. So total revenues grew at 8%.  This is a reflection of our spend-centric model and  enables our growth rate to be faster than our issuing competitors.","Slide 8 is provision for losses. We could see that the Charge Card provision is $178 million, 10% lower than last year. So the  write-off rate is up slightly as we are growing our business, but still at very low levels compared to historic numbers. But the write-off dollars in the first quarter of 2012 are higher than what we had in 2011, and that's offset by lower fraud and the fact that we had a $14 million reserve release in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a reserve build of $35 million in the first quarter of 2011.","Turning to the lending provision, that came in at $212 million, which compares to a credit of $120 million in the first quarter of 2011. The write-off rate is lower in the first quarter of this year compared to last year, and you'll see that in a couple of slides. So we have lower write-off dollars in the quarter. And as you can see on this slide, reserve releases this quarter were $194 million and that compares to $725 million in the first quarter of 2011. And that difference is really driving the higher provision year-over-year.  Improvement in the delinquency rate again this quarter and improvement in the migration rate is what drove the reserve release this quarter.","Moving to Slide 9, so this is Charge Card credit performance. So the write-off rate in the Charge Card portfolio have increased slightly, both sequentially and compared to last year, but again remains at near historic low levels.  Despite the higher write-off rate in USCS, the delinquency rate remains stable and our reserve coverage of delinquencies also remains stable.","International Consumer and Global Corporate Services is up slightly, but again here, at near historic lows.","  Moving to Slide 10, so this is lending credit performance. So the lending write-off rate is at 2.3% this quarter, the same as in the fourth quarter of 2011 and notably better than the first quarter of last year. The lending 30-day past due improved slightly sequentially to 1.4% and compares favorably to the 1.9% in the first quarter of 2011.  These are both at historical low levels and represent the best credit metrics in the industry.","Moving to Slide 11, so this is a chart related to lending reserve coverage. So U.S. Card Services and Worldwide, reserves as a percentage of loans and reserves as a percentage of past due were less than we had in the first quarter of 2011, and that's driven by improved credit performance and are both approximately the same or slightly lower than what we had in the fourth quarter of 2011. Now principal month's coverage was 15.9x in the U.S. and 15.8x worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2011, and they have both moved to 14 months coverage in the first quarter of this year. So this calculation, as you take write-offs in the quarter, you divide by 3 to get a monthly average and you divide it into the reserve balance.","  So write-offs in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2011 are about the same. But reserves in the first quarter of this year are lower, driven by the improvement in delinquency rates and improved migration rates that I've discussed before.","So we move to Slide 12, so this is our expense performance. So total expenses increased 4% or adjusted for the Visa and MasterCard settlement were flat in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2011. Marketing and promotion decreased 11% from last year. In the quarter, marketing and promotion, as a percentage of revenues, was about 8.3%, and this is below the historical level of 9%. Our plan for the full year is for  marketing and promotion to be approximately 9% of revenues. However, as we've said in the past, we will adjust marketing spend depending on economic conditions.","Membership Rewards expense decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting greater membership rewards and co-brand card-related  expense on spending volume in the quarter, but was more than offset by lower increases in the membership reward ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. And I'll discuss this in more detail on the next slide."," Card member Services increased 35%, reflecting increased cost associated with benefits recently provided to U.S. card members, including statement credits for travel fees for Platinum and Centurion card members, the Delta Companion program and lounge access. I'll discuss operating expense on Slide 14. "," The effective tax rate of 29% compares to 32% in the first quarter of last year, and this lower rate reflects a tax benefit related to the realization of certain tax credits.","So now we look at Slide 13, which is comparing card member rewards expense in the first quarter of this year to the first quarter of 2011.  Now as you saw on Slide 12, rewards expense is 7% lower in the first quarter of 2012, and you can see that on this slide as well.  So card member rewards expense includes the cost of co-brand products and Membership Rewards. I'd like to remind you, for co-brand products, the program partner has the obligation to deliver the reward, repay  the co-brand partner each month the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability.","On the other hand, we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Rewards program and have a balance sheet reserve for that. At year end, that was approximately $5 billion. So Membership Rewards expense is a function of 2 elements. The cost of points earned in the quarter and expense for points earned in previous periods if the estimate for the ultimate redemption rate changes.  "," ","In this chart, the blue section includes the co-brand product expense and the MR  rewards expense for points earned in the quarter. The green section represents MR expense, Membership Rewards expense, related to  points earned in previous periods due to the increase in the estimate of the ultimate redemption rate. You can see that the green section of the bar in the first quarter of 2012 is significantly smaller than in the first quarter of 2011.","  So the more moderate increase in the ultimate redemption rate is resulting in lower total rewards expense in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 2011.","In 2012, we continue to see increased customer engagement in the Membership Rewards program, resulting in a higher ultimate redemption rate estimate, but at a rate of change more in line with historic levels prior to 2011."," So I'll move to operating expense on Slide 14. So total operating expense grew 13%. Excluding the impact of the Visa\/MasterCard  settlement, which was a credit last year, adjusted operating expense increased 5%. So salaries and benefits grew 7%, reflecting merit increases, higher incentive-related  compensation and higher benefits-related costs.","  ","Professional services increased 4%. This is due to higher technology costs and higher third-party agent commissions, which relate to signing smaller merchants, offset by lower collection costs.  Occupancy equipment increased 11%, and this includes costs associated with Loyalty Partner and higher data processing costs."," ","Adjusted other, net decreased 16%, primarily due to a reclass, and we're reclassing a  benefit related to cross-currency funding hedges in the period.","So I'll move to Slide 15, again, talking to operating expense. So this slide provides 8 quarters of history on operating expense. At $3.1 billion in this quarter, we believe this is the level of operating expense that will enable us to drive business growth. Going forward, we will continue to implement our plan to contain the operating expenditures. When we think about 2012, you should also be mindful that the first quarter of 2011 was the low point for operating expenses in 2011 as you can see on this chart.  You can also see that operating expenses were similar in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Now I'm not making the forecast here, but if operating expenses stay at the current level, the growth rate for the full year, adjusted for the Visa\/MasterCard  settlement proceeds, would be in the low single digits. Our objective over the next 2 or 3 years will be to grow operating expenses more slowly than the growth in revenues.","Moving to Slide 16, so this is regarding expense flexibility over time. So this slide shows adjusted expense as a percentage of revenue. Now adjusted expense excludes credit provision. On the left side of slide, you can see 5 years of history, and on the right side, the past 5 quarters. So adjusted expense, as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of this year, continues to come down from the historically high levels that we saw in 2010 and '11. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first, through top line revenue growth; and second, through expense flexibility which includes our plan to contain operating expense growth."," I'll  now move to Slide 17, which are our capital ratios. You can see that Tier 1 common ratio increased to 13.4% from 12.3% at year end. We generated additional capital through net income and employee plans, and at the same time, risk weighted assets decreased, mostly due to lower loan levels.  Share repurchases did not start until mid-March, after the Fed completed their review of our capital distribution plan. As we continue to execute against our plan to return capital to shareholders and potentially pursue acquisition opportunities, we would expect that that Tier 1 common ratio would move down in subsequent quarters.","  ","Slide 18, our payout ratio. So this is the total payout ratio, and the bars represent the percentage of capital generated that we return to shareholders. On the left side is the last 5 years, and on the right side is the past 4 quarters. In 2011, which is the middle of the chart, we returned 56% of capital to shareholders, and this is in line with our stated objective of returning approximately 50% of capital generated to shareholders.","So the Fed has reviewed our 2012 capital distribution plan, along with 18 other large bank holding companies, including the operating performance of all 19 banks under stressed economic conditions. We believe the results demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business model and our balance sheet. For example, our minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio, a measure of balance sheet strength, was the third highest among all 19 banks. While looking at measures of operating performance under these stressed scenarios, we were best in class among the 19 participants. "," Our capital plan is to return capital to shareholders. Our capital plan of returning capital to shareholders is both through our dividend, which we increased to $0.20 per share per quarter from $0.18, and we'll also use share repurchases in an amount up to $4 billion in 2012 and $1 billion in the first quarter of 2013.","Next is Slide 19, a liquidity snapshot. So we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet 12 months of funding maturities. We have $20 billion of excess cash and securities. The next month of maturities is $13 billion. So this is larger than our normal excess and has been driven by the seasonal decline in loans in the first quarter, continued strong growth in our direct deposits, which you'll see on the next slide, and an unsecured debt issuance at the end of March under  favorable capital market conditions.","So Slide 20 is our U.S.  retail deposits by type. As  we have limited cash needs in the first quarter, total retail deposits increased only $20 million. You can see that on the right-hand side of the chart. We did increase  direct deposits by $1.2 billion. You can see that on the left side of the chart, while third-party CDs decreased by $1.1 billion.","So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters, as well as continued execution against our plan to migrate towards historic expense to revenue ratios.","Spending growth remains strong and we continue to grow above the average rate of our large issuing competitors despite difficult prior year comparisons.","Given the challenging global economic environment, we are pleased with the strength of international billings growth, including in Europe, where we saw a modest increase in the growth rate.","We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year, with net  yield comparable to the prior year and lending growth and a growth in net interest income of 6%. At the same time, lending loss rate remains stable near all-time lows. Despite very strong credit performance, provision expense did increase as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year compared to the prior year.","Our strong billings growth, the growth in net interest income and higher other non-interest revenues drove revenue growth in line with our on average and over time target of 8%.","Our revenue growth, which reflects the benefit of our spend-centric model, stands in contrast to many other issuance  that still face year-over-year revenue declines.  In the first quarter, strong revenue growth was paired with well-contained  total expense growth to generate strong earnings. We are still investing in the business, and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in our card base, while enabling us to build capabilities for the future.  In addition, we are continuing to implement our plan to grow operating expense more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years.","Looking ahead, we recognize that the year-over-year comparisons will continue to be difficult and that we will not have the benefit of the Visa\/MasterCard  settlement proceeds or significant credit reserve releases, but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead. In fact, the results of the recent Fed stress tests further demonstrate the unique aspects of our model and highlights its inherent flexibility and the ability to generate capital even under severe stress assumptions. We have started our share buyback program, increased our dividend and maintained flexibility as we considered balancing acquisitions and share buybacks. "," Thanks for listening, and we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  We'll go to the first line of Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's Brian Foran. I wonder if you could -- maybe just given how things are evolving in Europe, any color or thoughts you have on more recent customer behavior there? Are you still seeing the improvement you saw hold up or are you seeing starting to weaken again?","Daniel T. Henry","So  the fourth quarter, we had loan growth -- not loan growth, billed business growth that was kind of in the mid-single  digits. What we're  seeing then is that we had stronger growth in the northern part of Europe. We had somewhat slower growth in the southern part of Europe. The U.K. was performing more in line with what we saw in Northern Europe. Actually, that trend has continued into the first quarter. So we had overall growth in Europe of 6%, stronger in Northern Europe and the U.K., a little less so in the south. So I would say the trend in the first quarter was very comparable to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.  So some stabilization.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess I don't know if it's something you can comment on, but do all those comments carry through to April as well or things  evolve since then?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, absolutely the last couple of weeks, so we're not going to comment on April at this time.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then the follow-up I had was, I realized Charge Card performance is very strong in a historical context, but just any more color on why loss rates are trending up over the past 4 quarters? Anything you're observing in the data?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So the overall growth rate is 12%. We actually have very similar growth rates in lending and charge, so they both are seeing very strong growth. The tick up that we saw up to 2.3% in the first quarter this year is really a pretty minor tick up, and at 2.3% represents very low levels compared to what we've historically seen. We did notice that and we took a close look at delinquencies.  And so delinquencies this quarter stand at 1.9%. And that's exactly the same delinquency rate that we had in the fourth quarter and very comparable to what we had last year. So we don't have a concern about where write-offs  are. In fact, it's our expectation, as we grow the business, that we would expect to see some tick up over time in the write-off rates, both potentially in charge and in lending. But when that will happen will be dependent on the growth in the business and customer behavior. So  bottom line is that tick up is not a concern to me.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti","Moving on to the regulatory environment, I mean, clearly, your fundamentals are great. If you could just talk a little bit about maybe the CFPB  and what kind of interactions you've had with them and what they might -- where, if any, concerns you might have from the regulatory side?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, we started to engage with the CFPB. They are, I think, on site at this juncture. They're just starting their work. So I think it's going to be some time before we have findings from them or reports from them. The findings that the FDIC has had,  which we disclosed in the 10-K, they have shared those with the CFPB. We have not heard back from them on any reaction to that. They're a new regulator, so like everyone else, we're going to have to wait and see exactly what their observations are. But we have started to engage with them. We have a number of new regulators from [indiscernible] the bank holding company. The Fed was a new regulator for us. We have worked very hard with the Fed to establish good relations. We think we've been successful at doing that. Our plan would be to do the same exact thing with the CFPB, to be open with them and listen to any observations that they have.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just real quickly, it looks like there was a reclassification of card fees out of net interest income. Can you talk a little bit about that?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So this is -- sorry, I was getting a little help there. So there were some card fees that came with bank holding company. We decided should be included in interest income. Upon further review, we have decided that we should put it back into  card fees. So there's no change in revenues at all or the economics or the bottom line. It's just a classification of what revenue line that it's on.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And what kind of card fees were those?","Daniel T. Henry","It's just the annual fee that we get on lending products, and there was an interpretation of a certain accounting rule that we thought would cause us to move, to split the card fees and  put a portion up in interest income, but I have decided that, that is not where we should put it, and so we've really just reclassed it back. Simply low economics. There's no impact on the total revenue line or on the bottom line. And we restated the prior year.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just 2 things. Could you tell us was there  any effect on expenses because of the extra day for leap year? Is it really just the revenue effect?","Daniel T. Henry","So I would have answered that question no, but this is like more of an issue that we should really get into here, but we actually do accrue some salaries kind of on a day basis, so there might have been a slight impact on salaries and benefits as a result of that. But I don't think there's any large impact at all here. Since you have another day of spending, you get it on the revenue level. Rewards will be an example to the extent you have more billed business, you're going to have some more rewards.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then can you just clarify what the adjustment for the Traveler Cheque liability was, how much that could be? And then you do note in the supplement expenses for Enterprise Growth? Can you give us a sense of how much that is in the quarter?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay, so Travelers Cheques, to the extent that there are travelers cheques that are sold in the U.S., if customers do not redeem them, we sheet  those to the States. So there's no income related to that. However, for travelers cheques that are sold outside of the United States, other countries do not have a stringent law. And so we estimate how much of those travelers cheques will not be redeemed. We actually pick up an estimate of that at the time we sell the travelers' cherub.  We then step back and look at history and to see where the things are performing the way they have historically done. In a recent review this quarter, we realized that in fact fewer of those cheques were being encashed  if they were older, and so we simply revise our estimates of the amount that will not be encashed.  And there was a credit in this quarter related to that.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And about how much was it?","Daniel T. Henry","So it's small enough -- it's a big enough number that we should mention, but not a large enough number that we'd give the dollar amount.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Less than a $0.01 a share? Less than  a $0.05 a share?","Daniel T. Henry","So I'll just say, we wanted to know it, because it's not inconsequential, but it's not significant. In terms of Enterprise Growth, we haven't disclosed the exact amount we're  spending there. We do think that it represents a very good, an important opportunity for us. And so we are investing against those initiatives. At this point, they are investments that aren't generating large amounts of revenue. Anytime you start a new business, you need to continue to calibrate. Some things work less well than you thought, others better than you thought. And we shift our investments accordingly. So we are making notable investments in Enterprise Growth because it's a terrific opportunity. But again, the final number that we disclose.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right. I figured I might as well ask because you have it in the supplement. And then can you just give us a sense of what  we should expect for the tax rate for the balance of the year?","Daniel T. Henry","I think the tax rate, absent any specific credits in the period that occur, is generally in the low 30s, 31%, 32%. And then to the extent there's a credit like we had this quarter, that benefit will be reflected in the rate. So without any item like that would be in the 31%, 32% range.","Operator","We'll go to the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just real quickly, Enterprise Growth seems to be certainly the buzzword around American Express. Can you talk to us about a little bit of advancements that you've made in the quarter and what sort of roadmaps and things we should be thinking about in terms of announcements or progress or really frankly numerical -- numbers trying to come up to the surface in terms of progress that you've made on Enterprise Growth?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, I think, our whole businesses is kind of a buzzword, right? So our core business is performing exceptionally well, as you could see by a strong billed business, very good revenue growth, excellent credit performance. And the digital space, which is where Enterprise Growth is, is also a big factor in our core business. So we are doing a significant number of things in the core business. I think you can see the things that we've done with small businesses. I think we've done a number of initiatives with Facebook and Twitter, in Serve, but also in our core business. We're  also enabling our customers that want to interact with us from a servicing perspective online to do that. We're also enabling people who want to acquire  cards to do it online. So digital and American Express is a buzzword. We think it's important that we think about transforming the company because  digital will be a big part of the future. As we've said, it's actually a big part of today.  Digital spending is, last year was $130 billion of our $800 billion. So it's an important part of things that we're thinking about and investing in. Within Serve and Enterprise Growth, we are also investing there as I said. So some of the progress we're making as we've said is, we were very focused last year on signing distribution deals. And this year, it's all about executing against those distribution deals so that we can bring customers on to the Serve platform. We're  very focused on that, and we haven't at this juncture decided on sharing metrics. At some point in the future, we will. And we'll really, you mentioned revenues, and again,  I think this is an area where, of investment, revenues will flow more in the future. But to your point, we're not just investing without monitoring and assessing how we're doing. And so we do have guideposts out there that we're  very focused on in terms of what we're achieving and what parts are being successful and which ones aren't. And as I said before, we will calibrate our investments accordingly. But we do think we're accomplishing very positive things.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Brad Ball with Evercore.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Dan, I have a quick follow-up to that. Can you give us a sense as to what portion of billed business growth came from online and mobile?","Daniel T. Henry","We don't do that by quarter. But as I said, $130 million of the $800 million last year was digital online. And last year, we saw the digital growth at 22% of billings. So billings on the Internet were up 22%. I don't know the exact number for this quarter, but I strongly suspect it's, in all likelihood, growing at a faster rate than the average.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So faster than the 12% or 11% adjusted for the leap day?","Daniel T. Henry","So I haven't actually seen the number, Brad, but I would think that it probably is. Very strong growth.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just as a follow-up to that, a point of clarification. So you have board authorization and approval from the Fed for a buyback of up to $4 billion this year and up to $1 billion next year, but you talk about returning 50% of your capital to shareholders. So those amounts would exceed that 50%. So are those numbers just out there as sort of upside ranges? And if you don't exhaust the full $4 billion this year, is there a need to carry over into next year? How does that work?","Daniel T. Henry","So our overall philosophy here is to retain 50% of capital generated to grow the business, either  supporting growth in the balance sheet, you  need capital to do that, or for acquisitions. And to return the other 50% in the form of either dividends or share buybacks. To the extent we do less acquisitions, then we wanted to have the flexibility to do share buybacks. In 2011, we requested $2.3 billion of buybacks on the basis that we'd do about $2 billion in acquisitions. At the end of the day, based on the opportunities we saw, we did $900 million in acquisitions. And as a result, we've built over $1 billion of capital that we haven't planned on. So we made the submission this year. We did it on the basis that we would have the flexibility to do acquisitions if we identified the right opportunities, but also asked for a buyback amount of $4 billion in the event that we didn't do the planned level of acquisitions. So you're right, if we actually do $4 billion of share buybacks, we will be returning a significantly higher percentage of capital generated to shareholders. But it's really a trade-off between acquisition spending and buybacks.  The less we do in acquisitions, the more we do in buybacks. The more we do in acquisitions, the less we do in buybacks.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And if you don't exhaust the $4 billion, would it carry over into next year or are you back into the submission process in January of next year so you have to see what the Fed will approve?","Daniel T. Henry","So I have not asked them that question, but I would assume that if we do less than $4 billion, there's not a carryover. We would do a submission next January and then that will become effective, whatever that plan is will become effective after the approval, which would be mid-March, I assume. And what you're allowed to do in 2013 will be based on the plan you submit and whether the Fed does not object to that plan. So I don't think there's a carryover except if you didn't do it, you may wind up with higher capital going in, which might give you greater flexibility in your submission.","Operator","Next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Question on expenses, on clarity, and then tie that to growth because, I mean, over the last several years as American Express laid out very well, you were investing very heavily the benefits from lower falling credit losses in the Visa\/MasterCard payments.  Now you talked about the $3.1 billion of expenses in the quarter, Dan, Pages 15 and 16, and I mean I think -- and while it's clear you're going to grow expenses slower than revenue, it sounded like that $3 billion was -- as you were suggesting, that was going to be kind of a steady run rate for the year. And then, I mean, just as that ties to growth, you had -- I mean, you grew 8% historically. You've said at least 8% revenue growth is what American Express had targeted prior to the downturn. Can you still get this? Can you still drive the revenue growth with pulling back on the investment spend? So 2 questions.","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, okay. So we knew all along that, as you said, we were spending at higher levels in 2010 and '11. And that  was helping to drive growth. But at the operating expense level that we have, which is higher than we had in the beginning of 2010 or in the first quarter of 2011, at this level, we think we have sufficient resources to drive growth going forward. So it's higher than it was back in those periods, but we think it's a level that is appropriate and would enable us to drive revenue to achieve our on-average  and over-time  targets. So that's our perspective. We're going to control them well, but we think we have the resources.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And the $3.1 billion this quarter through the year is, I mean, were you suggesting on Page 15 that -- I mean, I wasn't totally clear and you pointed out last year was lower in the first quarter then grew.  Are you -- I mean I think it sounded like you might be suggesting that the $3 billion was going to be kind of a run rate for this year before you grow next year or did I misread it?","Daniel T. Henry","So it's going to be -- not to give a forecast, all right, so I don't want to do that. As you know, we don't  do that. But I was simply making the observation that if operating expense continued at the current level and you adjusted for the Visa\/MasterCard  proceeds and then you took that number and compared it to last year, that you would have low single-digit growth, right? So I wasn't saying exactly what it's going to be, but I was trying to illustrate if it was at that level what the growth rate would be, which is in line with we've  talked about being -- containing operating expense growth. But we do believe that at that level, that we have the resources necessary to continue to grow the business and achieve our on-average and over-time  financial targets.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So there's one follow-up on the one, I mean, quarter overall look very impressive, but the one number that surprised me that was weaker was the travel number, travel growth. And it seems like all the data, market data we look at on travel spend look like very strong growth, MasterCard and Visa giving out some very strong cross-border spend numbers. Is there a -- within GSS, the commercial business, was there a significant client loss? Or what happened to your travel business that doesn't match with the market data and the competitive data we've heard?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes,  so I think sales were actually up slightly, but commissions were down a bit and supplier revenues, which are an important part of the economics, sometimes are lumpy. And they were down a little year-over-year. So sales, again, I guess are the key thing in this discussion about just volumes and they were off low single digits. But that's the travel experience. I don't think we had major losses that I'm aware of, but those are the volumes that we were at.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Because it looked like you lost some share,  but you're not sure why.","Daniel T. Henry","So I wouldn't comment on share, it's more kind of a client by client is what you're doing when dealing with corporate clients, but certainly, sales for business travel were lower than what we experienced in billed business and our Card business. So that's a fair comparison.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask you about the Membership Rewards costs. In the fourth quarter, you made a comment discussing roughly 78 basis points as a percentage of billed business ex-GNS  to think of for that cost, and that we can think of that for '12. In the first quarter, it was up around 81 and I was curious if you're still thinking about that level for the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, for the year to average out or should we be thinking about that a little differently? And additionally, can we expect going forward dividends to grow at a rate similar to earnings which I believe had been your history prior to the recession?","Daniel T. Henry","So let me answer the second question first. So that's exactly right. So we think about that we want to have dividends at a certain relationship to income and we kind of keep it in the 17% or 18% range. So if net income increases, then we would stay with the same philosophy and increase dividends to be in line with that percentage that I talked about, 16%, 17%, 18%. So that's exactly right. And as you point out, I mean, you can calculate the numbers. It was 78% -- 78 basis points in the last quarter and 81 basis points in this first quarter. So it's really somewhat dependent on what's happening with the ultimate redemption rate. And if you look over time, if you had, if you look at the schedule, if you look back to, say, the second quarter of 2010, many of the quarters are between this 78-basis point range and 81 basis points. The only time it's really gone above that were in the quarters of 2011 where we had higher growth in the ultimate redemption rate in each quarter than we have seen historically. So in this quarter, the ultimate redemption rate growth was more similar to the historical levels that we saw prior to 2011. But where it goes is going to be totally dependent on customer behavior.  As we've said, the ultimate redemption rate goes up when we see redemption levels go up -- if we see redemption levels go up, that's greater  engagement to the long-term health of the franchise. That's a very good thing. It puts some expense in the quarter, but it's very good for the long-term health of the franchise.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So it sounds like we should think about a range similar to what you said, 78 basis points to 82 basis points or so at least for this year.","Daniel T. Henry","So I didn't say exactly. You said -- but I did  give you those data points.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Question on the share repurchase. I was just wondering, as far as like timing and the M&A pipeline, I was wondering, I mean, could you just talk about that pipeline and how we should model in the share repurchase to the extent that there are opportunities available? And you guys may not kind of push the lever too hard on share repurchase. And then secondarily, on top line growth, I was wondering if you could just talk about billed business growth going forward. It seemed like you guys had some decent momentum in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, but the comps obviously get tougher as the year progresses. How confident are you that you keep that momentum going? And then just finally on the top line growth, can you just talk about the contra-revenue  items as well? Are there any big kind of contra-revenue  items that we should think about and how they trend over the course of the year?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So starting with share buybacks and acquisitions. So as you know, we have not relied on acquisitions to drive our growth. It's been primarily driven by organic growth and our investments in our business. Our philosophy is to do what I refer to as bolt-on type acquisitions, where we either acquire a capability that we can leverage within our existing business or acquire near-in  adjacencies that are fee-based in nature. Loyalty Partner would  be a good  example of that. So our philosophy is that we want to take a look at acquisitions that fall within  those parameters. If we see good acquisitions with good economics, then we're  going to make those acquisitions. But if we don't identify acquisitions that meet our criteria, we're not going to do them for the sake of doing acquisitions. So what we actually do in 2012 will be calibrated by the opportunities we see and the assessments we make of the economics. We see good acquisitions, we'll do them. If not, we'll use  the capital to do share buybacks. Now in terms of billed business, we think we have had excellent billed business over the past 2 years. Certainly, excellent compared to the industry. We've had 9 quarters in a row where we've had double-digit growth in billed business. Certainly, really excellent compared to the industry. And we continue to believe that we have sufficient resources to continue to drive strong growth and have business momentum going forward. So I think where we're constructing our plan is to continue to drive spend, focus on our spend-centric model and to be successful in the future in terms of taking  share as we have been over the last decade. In terms of contra-revenues,  so contra-revenues  include cash rewards. As I mentioned, those are up this quarter. We issued recently a new product that was a cashback product. That  higher reward level would indicate as being successful in the marketplace. We do give volume incentives to certain corporate customers. So to the extent  they're hitting higher levels of spend, that's a good thing economically, but it is a contra-revenue. We  also have, sometimes, signing bonuses that go in the slide. This quarter, that wasn't at a higher level than we've seen historically. And for the other impact on the relationship between billed business and discount rate is GNS, right.  So GNS is a terrific success story. We share a part of the revenue with our partners. We keep some to ourselves. That has the impact of bringing down, creating a gap in that relationship. So those are the largest items that are impacting the difference between billed business and discount revenue within our P&L.","Operator","You do have a question from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The one item  in the expenses that  was a little bit surprising directionally was the occupancy and equipment. And the reason I say that is, it's my recollection that this is the quarter where the Greensboro shutdown actually goes into effect. Was there any lingering expense associated with Greensboro or is this net of that shutdown, and the other facilities that you added actually more than offset it?","Daniel T. Henry","So it really doesn't have anything to do with Greensboro. The things -- the costs we were going to incur related to that, that were people related we accrued upfront. There are no notable Greensboro expenses in here. We have largely wound that down at this juncture. So that is not a factor in this quarter. So you're asking me if that was lower because we don't have Greensboro, is that the question?","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm sorry you got muted out in the middle of that, but my question is I'm surprised  that occupancy went up this quarter on a year-over-year basis. It was the only expense where you didn't really show a degree of operating leverage. So I'm curious with that coming out. What the incremental expense was?","Daniel T. Henry","I got you, okay. So Greensboro is not a large factor here in the year-over-year comparison just from a occupancy cost perspective. The reason it's up is Loyalty Partner is part of it. So we had, again, 3 months in here for their occupancy as opposed to only 1 month last year. And we do have some -- so this is occupancy and equipment. So the equipment part is we do have some higher data processing costs, which are just related to the higher volumes that we're experiencing and the fact that we continue to invest in capabilities. So those are the things that are the main drivers of the increase of 11%.","Operator","And you do have a question from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","We've got a follow-up question on your capital plans. By our estimate, under the plan, you have the ability to pay back up to about 100% of earnings. Given that you're already sitting on a pretty large capital cushion of in excess of $2 billion and loan growth has been moderate and M&A has not been that big of a part of your business recently, was there any thought of asking for a payout in excess of 100% so you could start to draw down some of that cushion?","Daniel T. Henry","So I think if you look at schedules that investment banks have put together, we probably are  at the high end in terms of what we requested in terms of buybacks. We were sitting at 12.3%, right, at the end of last year in terms of Tier 1 common. So for the moment, that's a comfortable place to be. We don't know what all of the final rules will be as  relates to what capital we'll be required to hold. In addition to that, we  are still in the process of looking at Basel II, so we don't know completely what impacts that could potentially have on us. Well we simply go from Basel I to Basel III. There's not a big impact there. We've disclosed those numbers, but we've yet to complete our work on Basel II. Once the rules are completed and we have a full assessment of the impact of Basel and the ultimate rules that are out there, we'll think about exactly where we want to settle. But we didn't contemplate asking for higher buybacks to actually take the ratio down beyond what our plan that we submitted was.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. If you -- if M&A was a meaningful part of your plans for this year, would you still contemplate potentially using the full authorization and bring your ratio down in that course?","Daniel T. Henry","So I think if we did a modest level of acquisitions, we would probably tend towards the higher end of the $4 billion range. If we do higher levels of acquisitions, then we would bring the $4 billion down correspondingly.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Ken Bruce with Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question relates to several that have been asked, but would like to maybe get you to step back for a second and give us a sense around the expense management. How long do you think it will take for your adjusted expenses to get back to the historical norm? Obviously, there's a couple different things that can ultimately drive those down. But I'm wondering how long you think they're going to remain elevated before you get down to that 67% level?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, okay. So we said we were going to head back towards those levels, right? And in that calculation, provision is not an element. So to the extent going forward, provision is a lower percentage of revenues than it was historically if that were the case. Then really to kind of  achieve the kind of margins we want, you wouldn't have to get all the way back to  67%. So we'll calibrate things based on both of those factors. I think we've made very good progress to date. We've gotten back to 71% in this quarter. So I think we're making very good progress. I won't forecast exactly what the ratios will be going forward, but as you intimated in your question, we can really get there 1 or 2 ways, right. We can get there through very good containment of expenses and we can also get there by good revenue growth. And to the extent we get good revenue growth, then we actually have more flexibility in terms of the level of operating expenses that we have. So we want to calibrate all these pieces together so that we have strong growth with the right margins and the right returns for shareholders. So I think you consider all those things as we move forward. But we think the progress that we've made is good and we think we have thoughtful  plans in place as we go forward.","Kenneth Bruce","Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, when you look at the new businesses  that you're investing in, I think you've made some comments in the past that those are very decent margin businesses. They may look different than your historical business. Your margins in the quarter were down 23% and change I think from 24%. Do you think that, at some point, your pretax operating margin begins to drift higher or do you think -- what would you kind of say is the stable level when you look at your new business investments beginning to actually kind of kick in?","Daniel T. Henry","It's a little hard to assess since we have to actually see exactly what the structure is for revenues. We've run scenarios, and in those scenarios, we have good economics associated with those. But exactly how that whole  space will play out will take honestly a couple of years to do and we'll see what margins we have. We think about financial returns, we think about growth, we think about margins, we think about  return on equity. So the total economics across all those metrics could be somewhat different or similar to what we have today and we'll have to wait and see exactly how they play out. But we think it's a sector that will have high growth in the future. We think we have the capabilities to be successful in that space, and we think the returns will be good. And concerning all those things are the reason that we're making the investments in that space.","Operator","That will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Dan, I was looking at  the slide, I think it's Slide 12 that had -- 13 actually that had the rewards expense.  And the green part of the bar that represented the increase for points previously earned, you had mentioned that, that was $188 million in 2011. So if you were to subtract that, the total amount for the first quarter this year is only less than 6% higher. So I guess, how do we kind of square those numbers given that you've got 12% growth in Charge volume and you're saying that there is some increase in the liability on top of that?","Daniel T. Henry","I think the green bar for the first quarter of 2011 actually has 2 pieces in it. One, we revised the estimation process in which we -- under which we actually did the ultimate redemption calculation. That was the $188 million. Also in that quarter, just in the normal course, based on the behavior of the customers, the ultimate redemption rate increased for that as well. So the green bar includes both of those pieces, not just the $188 million.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And also on the Slide 11, on credit, you've gone from 16 months coverage of principal down to 14. And that's kind of a concurrent measure, not a prospective one. So I would assume  that you're not going to take that all the way down to 12 if receivables are growing and there's potential for dollars of losses to go up at some point  in the not-too-distant future. How much room do you have to take  that 14 down or from the standpoint of the reserve at this point?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So for us, this calculation was really just an outcome of how we set reserves. So we don't  target a particular level of coverage.  We set reserves. We have a migration model that we look at using history. If there are a need for specific reserves with something that's  not captured there, we include that. We have some higher reserves for TDRs. So that is what drives where we set reserves, not this metric. This is simply an outcome. It's one that people follow, so we've provided,  but it's not a driver of how we set reserves. Reserves are going to be driven by the behavior of our customer, what delinquencies are, what the  migration rates are. So that's what's driving our reserves.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. Does that essentially mean your migration says that dollar losses are coming down in the future?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, not in the future, right. So if you look at this quarter, the migration rates were better in this quarter than they were in the fourth quarter of 2011. We're using history, right. We're using a certain period of history to help guide us there."," Okay. So thanks, everybody, for joining the call, and good evening.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the conference over to your host, Ted of Investor Relations, Mr. Toby Willard, please go ahead sir.","Toby Willard","Thanks so much. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s other reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our Web site at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Ken Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and will be joined by Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Once they complete their remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken.","Ken Chenault","Thanks, Toby and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. We have a lot to cover with you today, including a review of our fourth quarter and update on the Costco portfolio sale, and our outlook for 2016 and 2017. I'm joining the call today as I thought it was important to share my thoughts on the financial outlook and the evolving operating environment.","Before Jeff begins, let me acknowledge that the performance we're discussing today is not what we or you are accustomed to say from American Express, and that we are taking significant actions to change the trajectory of our business going forward. During our remarks, we'll address three main questions. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? Why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long-term?","So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well. Thanks, and good afternoon everyone. To answer the question Ken just posed, I'm going to start by explaining our 2015 results. How they've impacted our view of the future, and how they reflect the actions we are taking. I'll also acknowledge upfront that across all the periods we're discussing, there are a large number of items adding complexity to our results. We've provided some normalizations to help you better understand the underlying performance trends.","I'll start on Page 2. Our fourth quarter and full year performance reflected the strength and the headwinds that we've been managing throughout 2015 versus the prior year on a reported basis the billings were up 2% for both the quarter and the prior year. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q4, which was consistent with the prior quarter and slightly below the full year growth rate as billings did decelerate modestly during the second half of the year.","During the quarter, revenues were down 8% year-over-year and were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar and the gain from the sale of our investment in Concur during the prior year. Excluding FX and the Concur gain, adjusted revenue growth was relatively consistent sequentially at 4% during the quarter. This was also in line with our adjusted full year performance of 4%.","Earnings per share are $0.89 in the quarter and $5.05 for the year, and included a charge in our Enterprise Growth business, which was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology together with some restructuring charges. Excluding this charge, adjusted EPS would have been $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.38 for the full year, down 3% from last year\u2019s EPS of $5.56, which did include a net gain of about $0.10 on the global business travel and Concur transactions. This performance is slightly above the high-end of the earnings range we provided on the Q3 earnings call, with the favorability primarily driven by our continued focus on operating expenses.","In terms of key drivers for the year, our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions, excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense controls, and the benefits of our strong capital position. In particular, the accelerated new card acquisitions, loan growth, and expense control, all stemmed from actions we took in late-2014 and throughout 2015, as it became clear that the environment was evolving and all these actions should further help us 2016 and beyond.","But these positives were challenged by several factors. First, the cumulative impact from the early renewals of our co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, and Iberia, along with the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, reduced EPS in the quarter and the year by approximately 5%. So we are done lapping these changes as we enter 2016. Second, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed, reducing EPS by another approximately 3% to 4% for both the quarter and the year. At current rates, the dollar will now represent a headwind for us as we enter 2016. Third, our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year remaining at the elevated levels we were at in 2014 further pressured our earnings in 2015 and we now intend to stay at these levels throughout 2016, before returning to lower levels in 2017. And last, the economic, regulatory, and competitive environments, all became even more challenging as the year progressed.","The combination of these factors resulted in our billings and revenue growth rates being fairly steady throughout the year, whereas we had expected to see a sequential strengthening. Despite these challenges, we leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and again returned over $5 billion of capital through buybacks and dividends during 2015, which reduced our average share count by 5%. These results also brought our reported return on equity for the period ending December 31st to 24% excluding the enterprise growth charge, our adjusted ROE was 26% to slightly above our target and illustrates the continued strength of our business operations.","Let\u2019s now go through the components of results beginning with Billed business performance by region and segment which is on Slides 3 and 4. Billed business growth was 5% on an FX adjusted basis during the fourth quarter, consistent with Q3 and below the full year number of 6%. Overall, our billings growth rate decelerated modestly during 2015, while we had anticipated a sequential strengthening. Although, this is disappointing, we did see positive momentum in certain segments. International performance excluding Canada continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q4.","I\u2019d note that Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014 in advance of the termination of our relationship with them as of the end of 2014. Therefore, the drag on our ICS growth rate from Canada was smaller this quarter and we will fully lap this impact during the first quarter of 2016. GNS remained our fastest growing segment with volumes increasing 14% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis powered by continued strong performance in China, Korea, and Japan.","In the USCS segment, billings growth remained consistent sequentially 5% despite further softening in billings on the Costco co-brand product, where volumes this quarter dropped more significantly versus the prior year. I\u2019d also note that lower gas prices continue to be a drag on USCS growth as average prices were down 24% versus the prior year. GCS billed business growth continued to slow and volumes were flat versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis during the fourth quarter. Performance continues to be impacted by lower airline volumes in a generally cautious corporate spending environment.","Looking forward into 2016, we expect to see a modest uptick in billings growth rates beginning in the first quarter as we lap some of the headwinds we faced in early 2015 and as our initiatives to drive growth have more impact. Obviously, our billings growth rates during the second half of the year will be impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. around mid-year.","Turning to loan performance on Slide 5, loans were down 17% on a reported basis, but this is entirely related to the reclassification of a portion of our loans to held-for-sale effective December 1st. We now expect the sale of JetBlue loan portfolio to occur during Q1 and I'll provide more details on the status of our Costco portfolio sale discussions later in my remarks. Excluding the held-for-sale portfolios from the prior year, worldwide loans were up 7% and U.S. loans were up 10% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances, international loan growth also remained strong at 10% during Q4. So we are pleased with the underlying trends in loan growth and that our increased investments and efforts to grow loans since earlier 2015 are already having an impact.","Looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment and continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the Company. I'll also remind you that net interest income this quarter made up only 18% of our total revenues. Even if we continue to grow our loan portfolio at the higher rate you have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend focused given the expected reduction in loans associated with the co-brand relationships which are ending this year.","Moving to our revenue performance on Slide 6, reported revenues were down for the full year and quarter driven by the prior year Concur gain and changes in FX. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 4% during the quarter which was consistent with our full year performance. Looking at our major revenue drivers, discount revenue was down 1% during the quarter, which was relatively consistent with our full year performance. During the quarter, our discount rate declined by 2 basis points versus the prior year driven impart by the continued roll out of OptBlue. Going forward, we anticipate that our discount rate will decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of OptBlue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures.","Moving to our other primary revenue driver, growth in net interest income remained strong at 9%, it\u2019s modestly higher than our full year performance. Performance continues to be driven by strong loan growth. Stepping back, while revenue growth did not accelerate sequentially as we anticipated through the year, we were still able to consistently generate adjusted revenue growth of 4% even in a challenging environment. Going forward, subject to FX and economic trends, we believe that our efforts are focused in the right areas to drive acceleration in our revenue growth rate.","Turning to credit performance on Slide 7, our provision was down 2% versus the prior year as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels. Our write-off rates remained the lowest among large peer issues. I'd note that the reclassification of a portion of our loans this quarter to held-for-sale had a small impact on provision, but did not significantly change our performance trends or reported credit metrics. Going forward, the continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provision as we expected since we first provided our multiyear outlook last year. We also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic performance.","Moving to expense performance on Slide 8, total expenses were up 1% in the quarter and down 1% for the year, but were influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Overall, we continue to be very disciplined about controlling expenses, but recognize that we will need to be even more aggressive going forward as evidenced by the $1 billion target to reduce our overall cost base announced in today's press release.","Looking at the quarter's results, marketing and promotion expenses ramped up to $892 million, which was similar to the prior year as we also had an elevated level of spending during Q4 '14 due to the Concur gain. As we discussed, another one of the key areas of focus for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter, which remained well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods. Now obviously this is a very early cycle for our investors and it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our performance.","Turning to rewards, expenses were down 5% in the current quarter driven by $109 million impact in the prior year related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a significant impact on the cost of card member services, which was up approximately 20% versus the prior year during both Q4 and the full year. We will have lapped this as we head into 2016.","One last item I\u2019d highlight is the tax rate, which was 38.2% in the quarter and significantly above the full year rate due to the enterprise growth charge, majority of which was not tax deductible. Looking forward into 2016 excluding the impact of discrete items, we believe that our underlying tax rate will be closer to the 34% to 35% range if it's trending to prior to this quarter.","While there were a number of items that impacted year-over-year growth in operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses were down 2% for the full year and were up 2% after adjusting for FX. Both of these results are below our 3% operating expense target and impart reflect actions we took at the end of 2014 and throughout 2015 as we observed that the environment was evolving. We have a long track-record of taking cost actions when needed and looking forward we plan to take a series of additional aggressive actions which we expect will result in restructuring charges during 2016, and drive benefits in 2017 and beyond.","Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 10. During the current quarter, we returned over 150% of the capital regenerated to shareholders, while maintaining our strong capital ratios. During full year 2015, we returned over $5 billion of capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year and continued to increase our dividend, which is now approximately 60% higher than it was in 2011. Our full year payout ratio of 105% reflects our confidence in the Company\u2019s ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, as well as our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.","So let me now shift to a discussion of our negotiation efforts on the Costco portfolio sale and our 2016 to 2017 financial outlook. As we mentioned in our press release and 8-K last Friday, given the progress on our portfolio sale discussions, we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as held-for-sale in a separate line on our balance sheet. Given this progress and given the importance of the transaction to our 2016 outlook, we have decided to provide a substantive update on the status of the anticipated transaction today.","Clearly, since the agreement is not final, the update is subject to change. But we believe an agreement consistent with what I will outline will be signed in the near future. We now expect there to be a sale and for that sale to close around midyear 2016. And we expect that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close.","In addition, as you would expect, we will continue to hold the co-brand loans and co-brand card members will also be able to use their cards at any AmEx accepting merchants through the transaction close date. We will be paid a premium on the assets when the transaction closes. The ultimate gain will be determined based on the assets actually sold. But we currently estimate a gain of approximately $1 billion. We have not yet signed a definitive agreement, and given that we are still several months away from the close and the card member borrowing and pay down trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain could differ from our estimates.","So now that we\u2019ve concluded 2015 and progressed in our portfolio sale discussions, we can provide additional clarity on our 2016 and 2017 EPS outlook. Because year-over-year growth rates during this period will be complicated by the number and timing of the moving pieces in our results, we have focused on the absolute dollar amount of earnings we are targeting in H2.","That said, we have not seen volume and revenue growth accelerate as we expected over the past year. And the competitive, economic, and regulatory environment has become more challenging. As a result, we have become more cautious in our outlook and now expect our earnings per share during 2016 to be between $5.40 and $5.70. This now includes a substantial benefit from the portfolio sale gain and the incremental economics associated with the Costco contract extension and also includes the incremental spending on growth initiatives that they are helping fund.","This range excludes the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies. This is clearly a change in our expectations. I can assure you though that we are acting with a strong sense of urgency and confidence and executing on our plans to accelerate revenue growth and even more aggressively reduce our cost base. To help drive revenue growth, we plan to maintain our spending across a range of business opportunities during 2016 at similarly elevated levels to 2015. I emphasize that while the gain from the portfolio sale will impact us only in the quarter we close the transaction, the increased spending on growth initiatives will occur in all four quarters, resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance.","On cost, as we moved through 2015 and gained more clarity on the portfolio sale, as well as our revenue growth outlook, it became clear that we needed to accelerate and expand our cost reduction efforts to right-size our cost base with the evolving business environment. As a result, we've launched cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion cost by the end of 2017. To put this into perspective, since 2007 our billed business volumes have grown by over 60%, but our adjusted operating expenses are almost flat over that period. We achieved this disciplined cost control by continuously taking actions to increase the overall efficiency of our organization.","Looking forward, we determined that those actions were no longer enough and that we needed to be even more aggressive on eliminating cost which is why we are targeting a $1 billion cost reduction. We plan to take actions throughout 2016 to drive these benefits in 2017 and beyond, which we expect to result in restructuring charges this year.","So if you step back and think about our 2016 EPS guidance versus 2015, there are several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will grow based on our financial model of revenue growth which we believe should accelerate to 2015 levels, while with operating expense leverage and capital returns. Second, the portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund a continued elevated level of spending on growth initiatives. Last, when the Costco volumes go away at midyear, the marginal contribution will fall away immediately, but we will need to maintain certain costs all the way into the first quarter of 2017 to ensure strong customer service. In addition, given the slower than anticipated overall revenue growth we saw in 2015, we will also need to remove more cost to offset the lower revenue which will take some time.","Turning to capital, the portfolio sale will increase our capital ratios to a significant reduction in risk related assets. We plan to leverage this additional capital flexibility to support business building opportunities including growth in the loan portfolio and potential strategic acquisitions. As you're aware, we have been aggressive historically in our capital request through the CCAR process. Consistent with this approach, we plan to consider the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the portfolio sale as part of our 2016 CCAR submission.","Turning to 2017, we're now targeting to earn at least $5.60 per share. If you step back and think about this versus our 2016 EPS guidance there are again several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will again grow based on our simple financial model of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and capital returns. Second, we will have to lap the portfolio sale gain along with half year of getting the marginal contribution from the Costco business. Third, our more aggressive cost reduction efforts will be gaining traction, reducing our operating expense versus the 2015 adjusted base of $11.3 billion by at least 3%. And last, our spending on growth initiatives will be lower based on the changes we are making to drive further revenue growth more efficient.","Looking beyond 2017, because there are so many moving pieces in the near-term, it's difficult to project when we might return to our consistent 12% to 15% earnings per share growth range. And we point out however that to achieve our 2017 target of $5.60 per share, the core will have to be growing at a healthy rate and overall, we believe the 12% to 15% EPS growth is still an appropriate long-term target for the organization. We recognize that we're operating a new reality and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.","Now let me turn it back over to Ken, so he can provide some additional context.","Ken Chenault","Thank you, Jeff. And now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook, let me come back to the questions I set out at the start of the call. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long-term?","To give context, our performance comes against the backdrop of changes that are reshaping the payments industry. These include a reset in co-brand economics, regulatory and competitive pressure on merchant fees and intense competition for customers. A number of cyclical factors in the broader economy also weighed on our 2015 performance and influenced our outlook for 2016 and 2017. As Jeff said, the economic headwinds we sighted last year including the stronger U.S. dollar and lower gas prices have lasted longer than we previously said. This is a long list of challenges, longer than we've seen in a number of years, we recognize them, we've been addressing them with a strong sense of urgency and we're making progress on many fronts.","Over the past 12 to 18 months, we took decisive actions in the co-brand space, accelerating contract talks with partners, we focused on those where we can earn attractive returns and provide strong customer value, which led us to deals with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Air and Charles Schwab. We contained operating expenses and restructured many areas of our business. Now we\u2019re set to take cost reduction to the next level through our Billion Dollar Improvement program. We ramped up spending on card member acquisition and brought in 7.7 million new cards in the U.S. last year. Our investments here are paying off, and we\u2019re now focused on turning those new accounts into additional volumes.","We stepped up investments in our international business with strong results, adjusted billed business rose by 12% last year. We expanded our merchant network, adding more than 1.2 million new merchants globally in the past year, with our OptBlue program we\u2019re continuing our efforts to move toward parity coverage with the other card networks in the U.S. We grew our lending business faster than the market, while maintaining our industry-best credit performance. We\u2019ll continue to target new lending prospects and deepen relationships with current customers.","We expanded our digital capabilities with new apps and partnerships to better serve our customers. We streamlined our management structure, creating integrated consumer, commercial and merchant teams to accelerate growth. And taking advantage of our financial strength, we\u2019ve returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders last year. Although, 2015 was challenging, we did accomplish a lot. However, let me be clear, we need to accelerate our efforts and we have a plan to do just that. It includes three priorities; accelerate revenue growth; reduce our expense base and optimize our investments; and continue to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders.","Let me start with expenses and give you a little more context. In 2013, we set a goal to limit OpEx growth to 3% or less. We beat that goal every year since then. To do this, we took a number of restructuring actions that provided benefits in 2015 and will continue to aid us in 2016. The plan we announced today is a major step up from there. It targets reducing our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017. Along the way, we intend to see operating expenses decline by at least 3% from our 2015 base in 2017. And we expect to see the full benefit in our run rate by the beginning of 2018. This will involve restructuring actions to streamline the Company starting in the first quarter of this year.","I\u2019ve assigned our Vice Chairman, Steve Squeri to lead the effort. He\u2019ll work with me and our senior leaders in every area of our business to ensure we move quickly and meet our goals. Steve is one of our most accomplished leaders. He\u2019s been at the forefront of campaigning our operating expenses over the past several years and has an outstanding track-record of making the organizations he\u2019s led more efficient and more effective.","As this new effort advances, we\u2019ll be taking actions to reduce cost in a thoughtful way, without compromising our ability to serve our customers, meet our compliance obligations, and grow the business. We have a strong history of meeting our reengineering commitments and I am confident we\u2019ll do it again. At the same time, we\u2019re also focused on optimizing our investments. We\u2019ll continue to use Big Data analytics to improve the way we evaluate, prioritize and execute our investment opportunities.","We\u2019ll gain efficiencies from our new management structure and we\u2019ll stop certain initiatives where we\u2019re not seeing results or a clear path to results just as we did by refocusing in our price growth, using our investment dollars more efficiently should help us as we move toward a lower level of investment spending in 2017. As we work to accelerate revenues, we\u2019ll be focused on the opportunity I cited earlier. We\u2019ll invest to grow our card member base and merchant network, deepen customer relationships through lending and rewards, increase our international presence, grow our commercial payments business, and develop newer adjacent opportunities like our Loyalty Coalition business.","In addition to organic growth, we\u2019ll continue to explore opportunities to grow through acquisitions. Even with the challenges we faced in 2015, we continue to see underlying growth in the business. Adjusted revenues rose 4% for the year and we\u2019re confident that we can improve upon this performance. We have a tremendous set of assets to draw upon; our trusted brand, financial strength, the advantages of our closed loop, world-class customer service, and our proven ability to innovate.","Our integrated payments model runs about $1 trillion in spending through our closed loop each year. That rich data enables us to create value for card members and build the business for our merchant partners. This is a major advantage and that\u2019s one reason why other card issuers are trying to cobble together a closed loop on their own despite only having a portion of the essential data. We're not simply looking to do a better job of processing payments, we're focused on using our relationships, technology and data to better serve our customers and open up commerce opportunities for our partners.","As the boundaries between online and offline blur, I believe our business model puts us in a great position to benefit from the conversions of payments and commerce. We have a deep and experienced management team to guide us forward. They've been tested by major challenges many times over the years and our Company has always emerged stronger. You'll hear more about our plans to drive growth from Steve Squeri, Anr\u00e9 Williams and Doug Buckminster as well as Jeff and me during Investor Day on March 10th.","Let me conclude by saying, we recognize that we're operating in a new reality. That's why we're focused on the plan I outlined to increase revenues, reduce cost and optimize our investments. We're confident that we can deal with our near-term challenges, return to growth and position the Company for long-term success. Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Ken. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the session. Therefore, before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process.","With that, the operator will now open up the line for questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Don Vendetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Don Vendetii","Yes Jeff, can you confirm in terms of the '16 guidance, do you have an incremental payout ratio assumed in there from the gain or do you not have that built in yet?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think Don it's fair to say we take our best shot at estimating what we think a reasonable capital return is based on our view of our capital strength and our opportunities. Of course as you well know we'll have to see if the Fed agrees with this, but certainly what we have built-in is what we think is a very healthy return on capital.","Don Vendetii","Right, and then of 1 billion of expense cuts, clearly the Costco is a big piece of the portfolio 20%, you'd expect some cost reduction from that. Can you sort of help us think about how much of the billion is sort of Costco related versus sort of core business?","Jeff Campbell","Well, the way I guess I would answer that Don and I'd remind you Costco is 20% of our loans and look our net interest income is only about 18% of our income statement so they are about 8% of our billings for the co-brand, another 1% for other merchant acceptance. I think the broader way to really think about it is that as Ken said in his remarks, we recognize that there are many things that have changed in the environment we are in and as we have gone through 2015, we have not seen the revenue acceleration that we had expected to see. If you go back to our Investor Day in March, if you go back to the original conference call we did last February when Ken and I talked about our decision to walk away from the Costco agreement, we said we're going to have to see how much other volumes ramp-up and what the pace is of that ramp and exactly what the final outcome is of when the Costco portfolio goes away and in what way, well we have those answers now and when you put all of that together with the evolving environment that we are in we concluded we need to be much more aggressive about all aspects of our cost base. So I don\u2019t think Don you can really attribute it to any one factor, it's the confluence of all the things that Ken and I talked about this afternoon.","Ken Chenault","Yes, I would just add to what Jeff said is that, one we recognized early that the economics of the co-brand marketplace were changing and certainly that competitor pressures throughout the industry were likely to increase and that's one of the reasons Don that we initiated two separate restructuring initiatives in 2014 which was well before we knew how our Costco negotiations would come out and I think those initiatives certainly helped us to hold OpEx growth below our target again flat in 2015. Then in February as we talked about, we recognized that the termination of the Costco relationship was going to create a short-term volume and revenue gap and that's why we said it's possible that we take an additional restructuring charge.","We know what the situation is now, but that also would be based impart on the revenue and volumes growth that we saw in other parts of our business. And as Jeff said in his opening remarks, the revenue and billings growth is not accelerated as we would have expected and so we're working to right-size the course of the cost base, there are variable costs that we can take out relatively quickly, but there are fixed costs as well and that's going to take time to transition, but I think that the reengineering plan that we have put in place gives us a lot of confidence that we can realize the cost objectives that we have put in place and we can do it in a way that is not going to impair our ability very importantly to build on the range of growth opportunities that we\u2019ve identified.","Operator","Thank you. Out next question that will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch, please go ahead. Okay Mr. Bruce, your line is open. Please check your mute key.","Ken Bruce","Encouraging on the card acquisitions in the quarter and the year, I guess as you\u2019ve been looking at what is kind of the center piece of that growth is that coming from premium cards, credit cards, star cards. Could you give us any sense as to what is underlying that growth please?","Jeff Campbell","I think Ken what is very pleasing to us and this goes back to the broad range of opportunities set we have, we clearly are pleased with the growth we\u2019re seeing in against premium cards. We also have a very good small business franchise. International, as we\u2019ve said, is performing well for us. Certainly what we are benefiting from is to have a variety of card growth initiatives. So very frankly it is really across the board that we\u2019re seeing this card acquisition growth. And certainly the point that we have emphasized, it\u2019s one thing to get the cards and we\u2019re excited and we think we\u2019re getting the right types of cards. But we also have a demonstrated track-record of in fact generating spending on those cards. And that\u2019s very important. But what I would say, the headline would be that we feel very good about the growth that we\u2019re seeing across the franchise.","Operator","The next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess I want to reconcile the commentary on the weaker revenue growth trajectory into 2016 and 2017. I guess we knew kind of the co-brand reset and the regulatory backdrop and I understand the economic environmental a bit weaker. But is it really mainly coming from the competitive environment affecting the business? And maybe you could just specifically talk about what\u2019s changed over the last three to six months, that\u2019s really affecting your outlook. And then when we think about strategic acquisitions, maybe you can just talk about what you guys are anticipating in terms of size and where exactly an acquisition might fit into the business? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Sanjay let me just go back and explain how things have evolved over the last year and then Ken you might want to provide a little broader context. As you think about the course of 2015, we clearly did have an expectation that you would a significant sequential strengthening in both volumes and revenues. And as we went through the year that clearly did not happen. As we thought about that Sanjay in the context of our forward outlook, at some point when revenues weaken a little bit, as you know we have a financial model that has lots of levers and we can pull those levers at different times.","With regards to the end of the year though and looked at a full year revenue growth not being where we thought it would be, we concluded it didn\u2019t make sense to pull the levers as hard as we would have had to pull them to get to where we had hoped to get to in 2016 and \u201917. And so we\u2019ve adjusted course. So I think there is many-many drivers of that slower revenue growth which Ken and I tried to get in our remarks, but Ken you probably want to provide a little broader context.","Ken Chenault","Yes I would, I think what\u2019s important is while certainly Sanjay the revenues and the volumes are not where we want them to be. I would just go back if we look at the competitive environment and look at the large issuers. We are at least generating an adjusted 4% growth rate against the backdrop of a more challenging economic environment. And as we have continued to maintain over the last several years a intensifying competitive environment, what we\u2019ve seen from our large issuing peers is despite the investments they\u2019re making and the billings growth, they\u2019re not achieving much revenue growth. So our revenue growth is certainly better I\u2019d like it in fact to be accelerated and we believe it will in 2015. I think again the investments that we\u2019ve made in card acquisitions have frankly been performing in general in line with our expectations.","Now, we are constantly reviewing our investment alternatives and while allocating those dollars, we believe we can generate the best returns. And I think as we\u2019ve said when some of those initiatives are not working enterprise growth was an example of that. What I\u2019ve also been pleased with is the increasing way that we are using our technology and our data analytics to improve our marketing programs and to make them more effective. So I think there is always some lead time as we have talked about between when we are making investments and when we see the returns, but I think it's not just the sign post that we've seen in card in bringing in new cards, but it's also some of the sign posts that we're seeing in some of the services and capabilities that we're providing something like pay with points which we're seeing from a standpoint of young people there is an attraction and engagement to those programs. I think what we've done with some of our digital partnerships I think the progress that we've made with OptBlue and then I go back to what I think has been very strong performance in a range of international markets. So I think that that's the balance.","Jeff Campbell","Can I just kind of summarize, if you think about 2015 Sanjay you had oil that kept going lower, you had FX that kept going against us, the economy was weaker than people thought and you have accumulative impact of regulation and competition. All that said, as we get into 2016 for all the reasons Ken talked about, our expectation and you should expect to see some acceleration in our volume and revenue growth trends beginning in the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Craig Maurer","Ken we don\u2019t often get you on a call, so I think a long-term question seems appropriate, historically AmEx has been a trade of premium to peers due to its spend centric discount revenue having modeled. Now we're hearing about ramped up pressure on the discount rate and aggressive lending growth against a backdrop. As an industry quickly moving toward giving up interchange economics to drive loan growth and share gains, so my real question is concerning the competitive backdrop and the change in how your competitors are looking at their economics, how can you maintain the model long-term that has traditionally allowed AmEx to be valued at a premium to competitors?","Ken Chenault","Well I think that's Craig a multi-layered question, so let me hit it on some different pathways as we go forward. I think one is if you look at the issuing side of the business and you focus on the spend centric versus the lend centric, I go back to a point that Jeff made in talking about the fourth quarter results and certainly we have said this in the past, if you look at net interest income as a percentage of revenues that range is around 15% to 20%, in the fourth quarter it was 18%. So at the end of the day, the progress that we're making on lending and I should add to that growing better than the industry with industry leading credit performance and I think we're getting good spending on those cards, I think that is working well for us as I look at it on the issuing path. So I feel pretty good about the viability of our spend centric model.","The second thing that I would say is that the nature of just focusing on specific customer segments and just focusing on one geography in the U.S. so what's interesting is when you look at small business and I think you know this in 2014 $4.8 trillion were spent by small businesses, but only 10% of that was on plastic and where we are the market leader in small business. So I think that it's not just the payment industry dynamics that we're competing with in this case, we're competing against cash checks and the fact that only 10% of 4.8 trillion is on plastic suggests there's a strong opportunity, I can do the same thing in middle market. Then I go to international and I look at a range of markets where the penetration against plastic is relatively low and we've actually achieved pretty good growth rate, so 12% in billings growth in a number of markets we're growing faster than the market. So I think when you look at the breadth of our portfolio in consumer, small business and corporate and the geographic and the fact that we are competing also against cash and checks. That gives me some confidence relative to both the growth and the economics. Now I will absolutely admit that's why I started off, there's a reset on co-brand economics. That certainly is a challenge, but we are not overly dependent on co-brands and we have a range of opportunities that we are pursuing.","On the merchant side, let's be very clear Visa and MasterCard have different models at this point in time those models are working pretty well for them, but as I look at our opportunities going forward, I think there is a sea change going on in payments and commerce. So certainly they provide an important part of the payments process, but I think increasingly it's going to be very important to have direct relationships with consumers and merchants and we think direct relationships in the inside, the information that we have from card members and merchants is going to be even more valuable as the convergence of online and offline commerce continues. And so building on the relationships inherent in our integrated model provides the foundation we think to deliver strong value to our shareholders. So I think that that is going to be an important development as we go forward.","What I would also say is that when you look at the value that we provide and certainly regulation is playing a role in the merchant business. But I do want to avoid sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison between the Visa and MasterCard rate structure, which is enormously complicated and that varies significantly by product. And I would say that our merchant rates really do reflect the value that we provide. And so the fact that as you know card member spending is 3 to 4 times the amount on Visa and MasterCard, I think Visa has consistently increased their prices in the nation groups and that obviously is a dynamic there. But when I relate that to the importance of how we drive value going forward and direct relationships that we have with the end-user customer and the merchant and the changes in commerce, I think that we have the ability to compete. So you\u2019ve got to look at the breadth of the portfolio and the number of levers that we have to pull.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","I guess I was struck by the comment that you expect that in 2017 the level of marketing and rewards could be reduced as you kind of lap some of those investments. You talked about how much that could be. And maybe relate the level of rewards that are on the cards that you\u2019re offering to these new consumers to what your current cost of rewards is?","Jeff Campbell","All right Moshe to be clear rewards were not what I was referencing. What we\u2019re talking about is when you look across the range of things we spend in the market and promotional area and the operating expense area. When we look at our evolving digital acquisition, our evolving use of Big Data, when we look at certain markets, Ken just talked about the breadth of our business model where in fact we\u2019re increasingly finding the use of direct salesforces to be a more effective way to grow than certain of our more traditional marketing and promotional efforts, we absolutely look at that from our marketing and promotional line and see a pathway to moderate down the level of spend without losing any ability to grow revenues. And so as we think about taking the billion dollars out of the cost base, we very consciously have said while the majority of that will certainly come out of operating expenses. There are instances where in fact it makes more economic sense for us to pull down marketing and promotional expenses and actually grow operating expenses. And we want the flexibility to do the right thing to drive revenue growth going forward.","Ken Chenault","I\u2019d just say two or three things Jeff, is one what we\u2019ve seen on the operating expense side if I just take small business and middle market what we\u2019ve seen is the expansion of our salesforce the return on that has been substantial even though that adds to OpEx that is a very-very good trade-off that we want to make. But I just come back on the rewards point because there\u2019re different categories of rewards. There is cash back, there is co-brands and the reality is if you look at how we\u2019ve managed the cost for example of membership rewards I think we\u2019ve been able to manage those costs very well.","When we look at the engagement of our customers on membership rewards, it\u2019s been very strong. So I mentioned that that segment of 30 and under is very attracted to pay with points. And so the deals we\u2019ve done with Airbnb and Uber are very attractive to that segment. And one of the reasons why is because we have a program that\u2019s over 20 years old and in fact we have a very large number of points in our bank.","So I think as with other categories, when you look at rewards, you\u2019ve got a segment and you\u2019ve got to look at the economics of cash back, you\u2019ve got to look at co-brands as we\u2019ve talked about and certainly the margins have been squeezed more in co-brands. But the fact that we have a very broad-based rewards program that we continue to evolve we\u2019ve made more digital, we\u2019ve made more mobile, I think gives us a flexibility in how we manage the overall reward gains of our customers.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll move on to our next question and that will come from Bill Carache with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carache","Could you clarify for us the core EPS number, what that is for 2016 excluding any gain net of reinvestment? And the reason for the question is that some investors that we've spoken with are stripping out the $1 billion Costco gain or about $0.66 a share to get to kind of what they're calling a core EPS number for 2016. The math I've seen is people are using the midpoint of your 2016 guidance to get to above $4.89 that would imply negative 9% year-over-year growth for '16 and then they're comparing that to kind of what you had previously been guiding to the modestly positive EPS growth, I think consensus of about plus 2%. Maybe could you give a little bit of clarity around that, just so there's not I guess speculation around how much of '16 is being influenced by or I guess inflated by the gain?","Ken Chenault","Yes, so I think Bill the way to think about it is as I said in my remark, we are -- we will use the gain partially to remain at the more elevated level of growth oriented spending that we were at in 2015 and then in fact Moshe was just talking to us about in terms of how we will rationally pull it down through 2017. That is a change if I go back to the way we first talked about 2016 in February and March last year at our Investor Day, our assumption had been we will begin to moderate that growth oriented spending down in 2016. As the gain has come in as we've looked at all the things going on in the Company, we have made the decision that the right thing to do for the long-term is to stay at that higher level.","Now in terms of the exact amount, I guess if there's a little bit of judgment Bill involved in that, certainly a very substantial piece of the gain is being used to keep our investments up at a higher level is it all the gain, probably not, is it the majority of the gain probably I'm hesitant to put a firm number on it because that's not reflective of how we run the Company, we look at the range of opportunities we have that we think make sense either shareholders' money on for the long-term we are funding those up very fully in 2016 and that soaks up a good portion of the gain.","Yes the point I would make Jeff is that American Express has had a velocity of how we've used gains overtime and where we see growth opportunities and those of you who followed the Company for a while might recall that we had a fairly substantial gain over a multiyear period in the Visa MasterCard private action and so the damages claim was in I think the first amount charged was probably $1 billion I think it was $3 billion in total, I can't remember it exactly, but the reality is that we believe we had a range of opportunities to invest in growing our business middle market was an example and small business and I think what we demonstrated is we used those gains in a very-very productive way.","So when I look at what we can do relative to adding new card members, deepening customer relationships from a lending, reward standpoint, we believe even though commercial payments had a slower year in 2015 we see that as an area for investment going forward. So this has been pretty consistent that where we have seen opportunities either to make investments in technology platforms or from a growth standpoint, we've done that and I think we've had a pretty good track-record of basically achieving the outcomes that we set out to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question queued that will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash","I guess two unrelated questions. Given everything that we're hearing in the economy around corporate, particularly the industrial economy, any material weakness that you're seeing across any sectors and I guess specific for you Ken given the planning you laid out today, can you just talk about how management incentives are aligned with delivering on the plan?","Ken Chenault","What I would say Ryan is our managements and it start with pay with performance and so what we have is very clear objectives around each of our businesses whether that's consumer, commercial, merchant, international. We obviously factor in what are some of the external factors that we need to weigh, but we have very clear objectives that we have set for the Company overall and for particular businesses. And I think we have a demonstrated track-record that we hold our people accountable. So what we have not had is a situation that someone simply says that it will be certainly will be reflected in our compensation is because it's a challenging economic environment that people get a pass that\u2019s not the way we operate as a Company. On the other side, there are different strategic initiatives and particular areas that we\u2019re going to make multiyear investments in and we established certain signposts to judge the effectiveness and the performance of those activities. And it is a very rigorous process that we very consistently review not only as a management team but with our Board and the comp committee in particular on a regular basis throughout the year.","Ryan Nash","And then just on the other part of the question, around what you\u2019re seeing from corporates any particular sectors of weakness?","Ken Chenault","I think as we\u2019ve said, hopefully we believe that we\u2019ll see some improvement but I think we\u2019ve been very clear throughout the year that I would say the segments that I\u2019ve been most disappointed in has been the corporate segment. And I think you have heard me say this before through the years that the easiest expense category to cut is T&E that\u2019s the first thing you see. Then you start to see people cutting on technology investments. And we hope that we\u2019ll see some improvements in that in 2016. But as I evaluate 2014, that was an area that in the beginning of the year we started off in a better place, and we saw a pretty consistent decline. And certainly what we\u2019ve seen in my 30 plus years experience with the Company is cut backs in T&E tends to be an early indicator for a slowdown. And I am not sure what will happen going forward. But what we do believe is we\u2019ll see some improvement in the growth in commercial in 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","A question I guess Jeff you sounded pretty confident and Ken about accelerating growth in 2016 starting in the first quarter, that\u2019s kind of an unusual statement in an environment where the markets are very jittery about decelerating economic growth. What gives you confidence in seeing accelerating growth in 2016 to build it into your plan and even say that you would see it in the first quarter?","Ken Chenault","Well, I think I\u2019d maybe answer that in two parts. So something it closed in is the first quarter Bob you really look at just some of the things that is happening right. So, FX while still a headwind for us is not as big a headwind as you get into the first quarter. We\u2019ll see what happens with oil prices. A couple of weeks ago I would have told you I think they\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re going to get to a lapping point on oil prices although those have gotten a little bit of tougher. And then when you just look at some other things going on in our business including Costco Canada, the areas that we have been focused on throughout 2015 in terms of spending and the trends we\u2019re seeing, we do think that as soon as Q1 you should see some acceleration in the year-over-year volume trends that you\u2019ve been seeing. As you think more broadly across the year, I mean certainly we worry about all the same broad macroeconomic risks and trends that you talked about. But we are just balancing that against all the other things that we\u2019re doing to try to accelerate revenue growth. And the fact that 2015 was another year of not particularly great growth and yet we still got on an FX adjusted basis to 4% revenue growth and we think we can do better than that in 2016.","Bob Napoli","And are you counting on an acceleration in GDP growth to get to those numbers?","Ken Chenault","Yes, of course\u2026","Jeff Campbell","Not no, no.","Bob Napoli","And then you\u2019re clearly not seeing a deceleration then in the pieces of your business in line with some of the concerns you\u2019re not seeing strong trends necessarily but you\u2019re not seeing, you\u2019re not concerned about the U.S. economy going into recession for example?","Ken Chenault","Yes, here is what I would say, Bob, is we are not seeing decelerating trends. We\u2019re certainly not seeing in the overall economic catalyst that would say that we think there are going to be improvements in GDP growth. But I think the indicators that and the reasons that Jeff cited, we are really focused on our business model and the reasons why we think we\u2019ll see improved revenue growth. And I would keep it at that. I think as with most people, I don\u2019t think we are of the view that we're going to see a dramatic change in the improvement in the U.S. economy. We hope things hold and I would say we hope certainly I'm not predicting that things will get a little bit better, but I certainly would not bank our plan on seeing a dramatic improvement in GDP growth, that's certainly not an assumption at all that we are making for our plan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Brendler","Ken you mentioned the acquisitions of the potential growth strategy earlier in the call and I just wanted to see if you could give us any color on the potential areas of focus. You also mentioned the importance of being closer to the merchant and I was wondering if you've ever looked at the private label space as the potential area of expansion anything closer to merchants through proprietary closed loop card within a merchant at this point? And sort of second question just clarify for '17 is there any anticipated impact in your guidance from Starwood and also from the European interchange reductions? Is that a net positive or a negative in your view? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Let me quickly Chris take the latter two and then Ken you should chat about the M&As. Question is certainly in '15 you see an impact from European deregulation because while we're not subject to the interchange caps the reality is as we've said for a while it puts some downward pressure on our discount rate as we really believe our merchants who saw that impact in '15 have to see a little bit more of it in '16 probably get -- need to get all the way to '17 before we fully lap that space into all of our thoughts. On Starwood, we'll have to see, we think we do a great job and have a great partner for Starwood we think we have a great partnership and I think SPG is one of the assets that Marriott is acquiring, but we'll have to see over the longer term exactly where Marriott decides to take the two programs.","Yes, so I would just say on private label, I don\u2019t see that as an area that we're going to pursue. I think as we talked about there are aspects of non-card lending both in consumer and commercial that we're certainly taking a look at and I think we believe that we have a range of opportunities as we look at lending, we don\u2019t think we're getting our fair share of blend from existing customers that we have and we see that as an opportunity. I think that private label you got to think through the different cycles and as we look at the different cycles in private lending in private label lending, we actually think that we can have more balanced growth and have a more balanced risk profile in the way that we are conducting our lending strategy.","I would just say to add a little bit on Starwood and then I'll talk about how we're looking at acquisitions overall that I would emphasize and I think it is certainly one of the reasons why Marriott made the deal is they were very-very focused on the high quality customer that Starwood has, SPG which is what their co-branded card is called is viewed very positively. You may or may not know when the deal was announced there was a lot of buzz on social media from the Starwood SPG customers saying we really love this product, there were a lot of good things said about AmEx. I had a lot of respect for the Marriott management and I think our job as we've been doing is to provide really-really strong value and if we do that, I think we're going to be fine, so that' what we're going to be focused on.","On the acquisition side, the reality is as we look at a range of different opportunities, I think the loyalty partner example is a very good one. One we see it as a very manageable acquisition, but it also plays off a number of the capabilities and takes advantage of the merchant relationships that we have and what you know in the loyalty partner model that I think is quite attractive is the merchant actually funds the reward on loyalty partner. And so we're in the early stages as you know with the Plenti launch we actually announced I think it was two days ago that Chile's restaurant chain has come on and part of what you want with this program, we've got Macy's AT&T, ExxonMobil, nationwide a range of companies if you want to get people a range of redemption options where they can buy something in one place redeem somewhere else and having the different need categories and that is very important so we're very happy to have Chile's in the Plenti program.","But I do think as we look at the merchant side, as we look at consumer, as we look at commercial, we think there are a range of opportunities of that obviously if we feel they\u2019re going to leverage some of the assets and capabilities or bring us some of the assets and capabilities what we would look as we looked at with loyalty partner is can they substantially improve the size and scale and the growth of those businesses. And so that\u2019s the philosophy that we\u2019re going to take from an acquisition standpoint.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat","Two related questions for guidance for 2016. Jeff I thought you said something about restructuring charges being part of expenses embedded in the guidance. I am wondering if you could quantify that at all. And then also on one of the sort of headwinds you\u2019re facing for 2016 on the regulation side. Is it all regulation like Europeans stuff that was just discussed? Or is it also the anti-trust litigation and an anti-steering rule sort of embedded in what you put under the heading of regulation? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","So the specific things on regulation really that we\u2019re referring to Chris are around the European regulation, which went into effect in early December, as well as some new rulings in Australia and that will also impact our business. So that\u2019s really the main driver there. In terms of 2016 guidance to be very clear as we said in the press release our 5.40 to 5.70 range does not include any potential restructuring charges. I did say and I would expect that it is likely we will take restructuring charges in 2016, at this point while we have lots of work streams that have been underway for a while. We are not at the point where we can estimate those charges and therefore give you any sense of them, which is why we didn\u2019t feel comfortable trying to build it into any guidance. That said, if you might just if you look at history as Ken said earlier, we have over the last couple of years done a number of restructurings and those probably give you a reasonable range to think about.","Ken Chenault","The only other point Jeff I would make is obviously I think most people are aware of the second circuit court of appeals which issued an order granting a temporary stay of the trial court\u2019s injunction. And so what that means is as long as that order remains in effect, American Express is no longer subject to the trial court\u2019s injunction. And so that means that we are entitled to enforce the pre-injunction non-discrimination provisions. And so we\u2019re obviously awaiting the pallet court\u2019s decision which we don\u2019t know when will be coming out. But I think that was an important development that occurred towards the end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Ho","Obviously a lot of talk about what premium multiple or if that still exists versus other card issuers and specifically obviously you have a advantage on the spend centric model. But particularly have been rewarded for an above average growth rate versus peers. So if I think about your 12% to 15% target through the year, is it basically on an underlying basis it\u2019s not a realistic target for 2017 or is it and do you plan to provide additional visibility on the underlying growth rate of earnings maybe ex-Costco and a lot of the moving pieces from here through \u201917?","Jeff Campbell","So David, we will do everything we can. We did chose to go to absolute levels of EPS because there are so many moving pieces in our results as you go through the \u201915 to \u201916, to \u201917, time frame but it is very difficult I think for people to make sense of just talking about growth rates. As I said in my remarks so if you carefully do the math you only get to the at least 5.60 in earnings per share that we\u2019re targeting in 2017 if you have what I recall a very healthy core growth rate as you move from \u201916 to \u201917.","In \u201915 alone and I would point out directing people through the math if you think about the 5% or so of EPS that\u2019s a co-brand reset cost that\u2019s which will lap, FX impact of 3% to 4% and then the $0.10 or so was about 2 points of EPS growth that 2014 had it as the net gain from chief global business travel and Concur transactions. So if you ended up with a core that\u2019s growing not quite where we would think a still appropriate consistent target is 12% to 15% but showing pretty good growth. And to get to that 2017 number you\u2019re going to have to better the math and get out the acceleration and revenue growth that Ken and I talked about.","So to try to put a specific number on it, gets I think very confusing and you start to run together what\u2019s part of our billion dollar cost reduction versus normal OpEx leverage and that\u2019s -- it is a combination of those things that led us to say here is just the absolute numbers we think we can get to.","Ken Chenault","I think Jeff where it does go to is really the underlying strength of the business model. As you pointed out relative to the performance in 2015 and as we talked about what we see as the opportunity is going forward in 2016 and 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Cheryl Pate","I just wanted to sort of follow-up on the revenue growth question and spend a little bit more time on the MDR guidance and looking for that to be a little bit more severe compression than what we saw this year. Can you just help us think about some of the moving pieces there in terms of relative impact? Is it coming more from the international piece, is it more OptBlue as that continues to build out? And sort of on the flip side of that as we talk about continuing to build out the acceptance piece, is there an acceleration in timeline as to when you expect to get to parity relative to Visa MasterCard?","Jeff Campbell","So, three things Cheryl on my specific comment that we do expect to see more year-over-year decline in the discount rates in 2016. The drivers are really just what you said; number one, OptBlue as we continue to build it out, the cumulative impact does grow a little larger as you get into 2016. We continue to believe that program is good for us economically. We passed the breakeven point in 2015 and we think we are making great progress in that program too. You do see a greater impact in 2016 from the regulation in Europe and its impact on merchant negotiations as I talked about earlier. And three, you do have some mix issues right. So in the first half of the year, oddly enough as we completely finish lapping Costco in Canada that was helping our year-over-year discount rate a little bit in 2015. As you have seen a little bit less growth in the corporate card business, that tends to be spending at a mix of merchants that tends to be a little bit higher in terms of discount rate and as growth in the U.S. has been a little slower than it has been historically, relative to the U.S. that also causes puts a little bit of pressure on the discount rates from a mix perspective. So it\u2019s all of those things that drove the comment I made about expecting a larger year-over-year discount rate decline in 2016. And then Ken you might want to comment and cover it up a little.","Ken Chenault","Yes, I mean the point I would make is Cheryl I can\u2019t give you a specific timeframe, but the farthest I\u2019ll go is to say it is several years, which certainly 10 years ago I wouldn\u2019t even come close to saying it\u2019s several years. I think we\u2019ve made some really strong progress I\u2019ve been pleased with the momentum that we\u2019ve seen with OptBlue I just reinforced what Jeff said is the growing mix of business within the retail and everyday sector is obviously very critical to the expansion of OptBlue and obviously some of the regulation that we\u2019re seeing in some of the key international markets. But as we\u2019ve talked about before, the increased coverage also has an impact on improving the perception of coverage which should help our growth. Now, that takes time for perception to catch up with reality. And to the earlier point that Jeff made if we can start to see some improvement in the corporate business, that\u2019s going to help. But we consciously understood that with expansion of OptBlue we were going to have a greater mix of retail and every day and that\u2019s something that we want to see because that increases the utility of our acquired products.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Togut","For 2016, could you please quantify the elevated spending on growth initiatives, break it down in each of the major buckets of spending. And then walk us forward into 2017 giving us a sense of how each of these major buckets of spending will change. And in particular I am wondering how you can reduce spending on these areas, particularly given the more competitive environment you talked about, a tougher economy and a tougher regulatory environment? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well, David the shorter answer is no, I am not going to walk you through that level of detail because we would consider it competitively sensitive to be that precise about the areas we\u2019re targeting that there\u2019re opportunities and also because as the world changes, it\u2019s very important that we retain flexibility to react to the evolving environment and we go back to the things I talked about earlier, what makes us believe we can moderate spending without losing our ability to run revenues well it is due evolving use of Big Data, the growth in the percentage of our new card acquisitions that comes from digital channels that are very efficient and it's through focusing on the areas of greatest opportunity.","Ken Chenault","The only point I\u2019d make Jeff and I would say we\u2019re in an even better situation because of the progress we\u2019ve made on data analytics and performance marketing. But if we go back over the last 15 years, the reality is we\u2019ve gone through periods of elevated spending where we saw opportunities and then we\u2019ve reaped the benefits three, or four, or five years, down the road, even when we have moved down those level spending. So we have an opportunity and we\u2019re taking advantage of it. And I would say the analytics and the capabilities that we\u2019ve developed give me confidence that we\u2019ll take advantage of those opportunities and the efficiencies that we have brought to bear in our business over the last several years have really produced good results. So we feel that that dynamic is something that we can continue. And we\u2019re going to continue to push very aggressively.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Aaron Rabinovich with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Aaron Rabinovich","Just a point of clarification on the expenses, I think in Ken\u2019s remarks he said that you expect operating expenses to decline by at least 3% from the 2015 base. Is the 2015 base just your GAAP total which includes spending around 519 million of onetime charges just trying to get a better understanding of that?","Ken Chenault","Yes, so to be very precise think about 2015 base of 11.3 which takes out those doesn\u2019t really include the Q4 charge. And so as we think about the billion dollar cost target the reality is we\u2019ve done the easy stuff. It will take until the end of 2017 to get to a full run rate, but if you think about full year 2017 results, we should get at least down 3% below 2015.","Jeff Campbell","So operator, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you, sir that will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Just one quick follow-up on Starwood, do you have any provisions in your program partnerships with, whether it\u2019d be a Starwood or a Delta that preclude or limit the co-brand partners\u2019 ability to dilute the value of the points by changing and, on our redemption options? And then just one follow-up on the guidance, what does it contemplate in terms of FX and provisions for 2016?","Ken Chenault","So we\u2019ll split this up, I\u2019ll do Starwood and I\u2019ll have Jeff talk about FX, obviously it would be totally inappropriate for me to go in to the terms of the contract. But what I would say that\u2019s very clear is that if you have a group of customers that in fact have relied on getting very strong value for a product, the last thing you want to do is diminish the value of the product. And as I said earlier, and not just from us but if you look at independent card surveys, the SBT product is one of the highest rated products from a value standpoint.","So, I think that the Marriott people are very customer centric, very smart, and I don\u2019t think they would have done this deal if the objective was to dilute the value of products to some of their most important customers. So that would just be my perspective, I don\u2019t have any information from them there. But I do know in some of what I have read publicly they have talked about their excitement about having this size of customer and the value that they put on it. And so that would be my perspective.","Jeff Campbell","And on FX, our comments today are based on the world as it exists today. And so we basically presume all of the increase or strength of the U.S. dollar that you\u2019re seeing today but not that it continues to get worse. On provision, we\u2019ve been very consistent in saying. We see a continued pathway to have loan growth grow at a good cliff. Obviously, provision will grow with it. And as we continue to get the cumulative impact of a lot of really good growth in loans then you have a different mix more early tenure folks. And so there is a little bit of seasoning that will also drive these provision rates up a bit. So that\u2019s all built into the commentary we made today.","Toby Willard","Great.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Rick Petrino. Please go ahead, sir.","Rick Petrino","Thank you. Welcome, and thanks for joining us for today's discussion. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ","In the fourth quarter 2011 earnings release and earnings supplement, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com, we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay, thanks, Rick. So we will start on Slide 2, the Fourth Quarter Summary of Financial Performance. Total revenues net of interest expense were $7.7 billion, 7% growth on both a reported and FX basis. That compares to the third quarter where we had 9% growth reported and 6% FX adjusted. So down 200 basis points on a reported basis, but up 100 basis points on an FX-adjusted basis. ","Net income is $1.2 billion, EPS is $1.01. That is up 15%. You might remember that in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a reengineering charge, which was $74 million after tax. In the fourth quarter of this year, we also have reengineering, and that's $32 million on an after-tax basis. So if you were to back those out, EPS growth would be 11%.","So return on equity was strong at 28%. You can see that our shares outstanding have decreased compared to last year, and that reflects our share buyback program. ","Moving to Slide 3. Now this is a full year slide for 2011, and total revenues net of interest expense was $30 billion. That's up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. That's very favorable compared to most of the other issuing competitors. EPS was $4.09, up 22%. So that's strong performance well above our EPS target of 12% to 15% growth.","Moving to Slide 4, which is back to the fourth quarter, and these are our metrics. Billed business was $219 million, that's a record level of billed business for us. The growth was 11%, both on a reported and FX basis. So that compares to 16% reported growth and 13% FX growth in the third quarter, so a slight decline in billed business growth from the third quarter, which is what we've seen across the industry.","So cards-in-force are at $97 million, GNS cards grew at 18% and proprietary cards grew at 2%, so in total, 7% growth. Average basic cardmember spending grew 8%. So we continue to have a high level of customer engagement. Loan growth was 3%, generally better than the industry. And travel sales, growing at 5%, reflect both growth in our Corporate and Consumer Travel businesses.","We move to Slide 5, again this is full year metrics. So we had billed business growth of $222 billion (sic) [$822 billion]. That's growth of 13% on an FX-adjusted basis, and this will result in us gaining share again in 2011. If you look at average cardmember spend for the year on FX-adjusted basis, it was 11%. So again, high level of cardmember engagement. ","We move to Slide 6. This is Billed Business Growth by Region. So if you look at the yellow line, which is Latin America and Canada, growth was 13% down 100 basis points from the third quarter. The dark blue line is the U.S. and the green line is Asia, and they are both down about 200 basis points compared to the third quarter. So these 3 regions held up reasonably well. If you look at the lowest line, which is the light blue line, that's Europe, and there we had a decrease to 4% from the 8% growth we had in the third quarter. So the U.K., Germany and France all had growth in the mid-single digits. Italy, actually, had a slight decline.","If we move to Slide 7, so this is Billed Business Growth by Segment, so total billed business growth is the purple line. And you can see that, on an FX-adjusted basis, it decreased from 13% in the third quarter to 11% in the fourth quarter. GNS is the yellow line with circles and that decreased from 23% growth to 17% growth. It's due in part to a decline in Europe, but it's primarily due to the U.S., where Macy's is now in the numbers for our full year. GCS or Global Corporate Services, the green triangles, declined from 14% to 11% growth. And the decline is slightly higher in Europe, but it's broad based globally. USCS, which is the blue diamonds, is down only 100 basis points from 12% to 11%. And ICS, International Consumer, the light blue squares, moved from 9% to 6% growth, primarily due to Asia and Europe. ","Next, we move to Slide 8. So this is comparing lending billed business compared to managed loan growth. So loan balances continue to grow, up 3% compared to a year ago, but it grows at a much slower rate than the growth rate of spending on lending products as you can see from the chart. This reflects that consumers continue to be cautious about taking on credit card loans, and a change in our strategy to focus on premium lending. Transactors continue to be a larger percentage of our loan book, and the lending trust pay down rate in December was 30%. ","Moving to Slide 9, Net Interest Yield. Now historically, we have just shown the U.S. yield, but here we're also showing the yield for International Card. So international loans represent 14% of loans as of December 31, 2011. Yields are in line with our previous guidance of yields being in the high 8% to 9% range. You can see that the U.S. yield is now reasonably stable. In international, we're seeing the impact of our premium lending strategy as we see a decline in revolve rates, more transactors and a change in bucket mix due to improved credit. Going forward, yields will continue to be influenced by credit quality, the percentage of the portfolio that is revolving and cost of funds. ","Moving to Slide 10, Revenue Performance. Discount revenue reflects 11% growth in billed business, a slightly lower discount rate, 1 basis point lower than last year, the impact of the GNS billed business and higher contra revenues, including partner payments, and this brings the growth with discount revenue to 8%. Card fees grew in line with the growth in proprietary cards-in-force, 2%. Travel commissions and fees are up 9%, reflecting higher travel sales and higher supplier revenues. Other commissions and fees include revenues from Loyalty Partner, which was purchased in March of 2011. Offset by an accrual for late fees, the company expects to refund to certain charge card accounts.  ","Other revenues increased 20%, reflecting higher GNS partner royalty revenues and a contractual payment from a GNS partner. Net interest income is lower by 1%. In the U.S., it was up 2%, with loan growth of 4% up to $53.7 billion, with yield acquiring 20 basis points compared to last year. International was down 10%, loans decreased $400 million to $8.9 billion, and yields declined 140 basis points for the reasons I described a minute ago. All in, we had revenue growth of 7% in the fourth quarter compared to 6% FX growth in the third quarter. Not at our 8% target, but given the environment, good performance.","Moving to Slide 11, Provision for Loans. Charge card provision was $237 million compared to $183 million last year. The write-off rate is up slightly as expected, as we grow the charge card business, and as a result, accounts receivables are up accordingly. Here, credit metrics continue to be at historic lows.","The loan provision was $149 million compared to $37 million last year. So the reserve release this quarter was $300 million. That's $400 million less than last year. So that change would push up provision, increase it. However, the write-off rate this quarter was 2.3% compared to a write-off rate of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. So the write-off dollars in this quarter were $400 million, $300 million less than last year. So the lower reserve release pushed it up by $400 million, lower write-off dollars pushed it down $300 million, so a net increase of about $100 million. Again, here the credit metrics continue to be at historic lows.","Next is Slide 12, which is Charge Card Credit Performance. So the write-off rates in the charge card portfolio have increased slightly, both sequentially and compared to last year, but remained at historical lows. The slight increase in charge card metrics align with the company's charge card strategic objectives for growing and expanding the business. ","Slide 13, Lending Write-off Rate. So lending write-off rates continue to improve. These are also at historic lows. And these are the best write-off rates in the industry, and they reflect our high-quality risk capabilities, our affluent customer base and our focus on premium lending.","Moving to Slide 14, so this is Lending 30 Days Past Due. In the U.S., you can see that the past due percentage are stabilizing, which is what you'd expect at some point. International continues to improve, and again these are industry-leading metrics. ","If we move to Slide 15, so this chart is helpful as we look forward. On the right side we see bankruptcies continue to be lower than last year. I would remind you that about 2\/3 of the bankruptcies are already written off when we are notified. Now the upper left-hand green triangles are the accounts that are rolling from current to 30 days past due. So the green triangles represent May, June and July, and they would write off in 5 months later if they continue to be delinquent or they'd write off in the fourth quarter of 2011. So looking at that upper left-hand chart, if you look at the next 3 blue triangles, they are slightly higher than the green triangles. So if the 30-day past due to write-off rate, which is the bottom chart, remain constant, then you'd expect the first quarter 2012 write-off rate would be either flat or up a tick. I'll also remind you that bankruptcies and recoveries affect the write-off rate. You can see the U.S. delinquencies are stabilizing. ","Now as I've mentioned in prior quarters, our objective is not to manage our business in order to minimize write-offs. Going forward, we will continue to balance our risk profile with the company's strategic growth objectives, and over time, we do not expect the loss rate to stay at these historic low levels.","Moving to Slide 16. Here you can see on the chart across the top are the lending reserve releases by quarter. Then the light blue bars are the write-off dollar amounts in each quarter and the dark bar is the provision, so basically, the write-off dollars less the reserve releases. You can see the write-off dollar, the light blue bars, are decreasing as write-offs have come down. Also, reserve releases are decreasing as the past due rate of improvement slows. So the reserve release, these reserve releases should diminish as we go forward.","Slide 17 or our Lending Reserve Coverage. You can see that the credit metrics continue to improve. Reserves as a percentage of loans and reserves as a percentage of past dues have come down both in the U.S. and worldwide. Although we released $300 million of reserves in the quarter, coverage remains at appropriate levels.","Moving to Slide 18, so this is Expense Performance. So total expenses increased 1% or decreased 2% if you adjust for the MasterCard settlement payment that we received in 2010, but not in the fourth quarter of 2011. And that compares to 10% FX adjusted growth in the third quarter. ","So looking at marketing and promotion, this decreased to 12% from the high levels of spending that we had in the fourth quarter of 2010. But marketing is still 7% of revenues, which are the historic levels that we have been at and reflect an appropriate level of investment to drive business growth.","Rewards increased 10% in line with spending on rewards products. There was a slight increase in Membership Rewards ultimate redemption rate estimate in both the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2010, so it had no effect on the growth rate of rewards expense in the fourth quarter of this year, unlike the second and third quarter, when higher ultimate redemption rate growth caused high growth rates on the rewards line.","Operating expense had a 0 growth. It actually decreased by 4% if you adjust for the MasterCard settlement. And this compares with 9% FX-adjusted growth in the third quarter. We provided guidance that we would slow growth in operating expense as we exited 2011, and we have. This demonstrates our ability to control operating expenses. ","So let me give you a little bit more detail on operating expenses on Slide 19. So salaries and benefits are down 2%. So I remind you in the fourth quarter of 2010, we had severance costs related to reengineering initiatives of $113 million, compared to severance cost in the fourth quarter of this year of $26 million. If we excluded both these items, we'd have a growth rate of 4%, approximately what you'd expect.","Professional services is 6% lower, reflecting lower consulting fees and lower technology expenses, the type of items that we can flex up and down. Occupancy increased 9% and includes costs associated with Loyalty Partners, as well as lease termination costs associated with the company's reengineering. ","Adjusted Other, Net is adjusted to exclude Visa\/MasterCard. So here, our interest rate hedges are functioning exactly as intended. However, accounting rules require us to mark the hedges. So there's no economics here, and over the life of the hedge, the marks will equal 0. But in this period, we had a benefit compared to last year. And we had a litigation-related reserve release, and these 2 items really create the variance compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.","So if we move to Slide 20, this is year-over-year operating expense, and this is a view of operating expense over the past 8 quarters. You can see the increase in operating expense in the fourth quarter of 2010, which is in the middle of the chart, at $3.2 billion. So this was driven by some onetime costs, including the severance-related reengineering initiatives and some higher incentive compensation, but it also included increases in our ongoing investments. ","You can see that the quarters in 2011 have been in $3 billion to $3.1 billion range. This reflects higher levels of investments than we had in 2010, including investments in internal sales force, initiatives related to the digitization of our business, greater third-party merchant sales force, costs related to Loyalty Partners, new business initiatives, including Serve, and technology development expenditures, all designed to drive business growth.","We are at an investment level that enables us to drive business growth, and at the same time, we are continuing to implement our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012. Now when you think about 2012, you should also be mindful that the first quarter of 2011 was the low point for operating expenses in 2011, as you can see on the chart. ","So now I'll move to Slide 21. So this is expenses and the flexibility over time. Adjusted expenses are all expenses excluding provision, as well as the Visa and MasterCard settlement payments. Now we recognize that we are currently at elevated levels. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back toward historical levels in 2 ways. First, through revenue growth, and our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012. You can see that we have started to make progress in the fourth quarter of this year.","Slide 22, our Capital Ratios. You can see that Tier 1 common capital ratio remains at 12.3%. We generated approximately $700 million of capital net through net income plus employee plans, less our dividend and our share repurchases, while the risk-weighted assets have increased due to seasonal growth in loans and accounts receivable. Let me point out that year-over-year, the Tier 1 common ratio has increased from 11.1% at the end of last year to 12.3% at the end of 2011. So we continue to have strong capital ratios.","Looking at Slide 23, so this chart provides history on share repurchases. For the full year 2011, we returned 56% of capital generated to shareholders. We only repurchased $350 million in the fourth quarter as the request we made in our CCAR filing with the Fed last January was a total repurchase for 2011 of $2.3 billion. Since acquisitions in 2011 were less than we planned and repurchases were capped at $2.3 billion, our Tier 1 common ratio increased from 11.1% last year to 12.3% at the end of 2011.  We were mindful of this when we made our CCAR submission this year on January 9 and endeavored to create more flexibility.","Moving to Slide 24, so this is our liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the 12 months of funding maturities over the next 12 months. So we hold $18 billion in excess cash and securities and the next 12 months of maturities is $14 billion.","Slide 25, this is retail deposits. So we raised $4.8 billion in deposits in the quarter in part to fund seasonal needs, in part to replace maturing long-term debt. Direct deposits increased by $1.4 billion in the quarter, and over the course of 2011, we raised 6.7 indirect deposits. As we've discussed, deposits provide greater degrees of funding diversity for us. ","Page 26 is some history on our ABS and unsecured debt issuances over the past 3 years and an estimate of the range of potential issuances in 2012. We plan to continue to access the ABS and unsecured debt markets in addition to raising deposits as part of having a broad funding diversity.","So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results in the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters, as well as the realization of a planned slowdown in the growth of operating expenses. Spending growth remains strong, and we continue to grow well above the average rate of our large issuing competitors, despite difficult prior year comparisons and a challenging global economic environment. Certain regions internationally did show slowing growth, especially in Europe where growth slowed to 4%, though all regions continue to grow and overall buildings held up well in reaching our new record high.","We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year. Lending loss rates continue to improve. Loss rates in both the U.S. and international lending portfolios have reached all-time lows. Despite the continued improvement, provision expense did increase as reserve releases were lower this year and the prior year. ","Our strong billings growth coupled with higher other noninterest revenues, drove solid revenue growth. Our revenue growth, which reflects the benefits of our spend-centric model, stands in contrast to many other issuers, who are still facing year-over-year revenue declines.","In the fourth quarter, strong revenue growth was paired with significant reductions in the total expense growth rate to generate strong earnings. Despite the improvement in expense growth, we are still investing in the business, and these investments are driving higher average spend and growth in the card base, while enabling us to build capabilities for the future. We feel very good about the recent performance, but acknowledge that the global economic environment remains uncertain.","Looking ahead, we recognize that the year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult and that we will not have the benefit of the Visa\/MasterCard settlement proceeds and significant credit reserve releases. But we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead.","We are continuing to implement our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012. And in the fourth quarter, we saw a clear evidence of our ability to do that. Going forward, we will continue to monitor spend trends around the world, but we are very pleased with our results. 2011 was a great year for American Express as we achieved record billing levels and record earnings, while facing the highly competitive environment and challenging economic backdrop. ","So thanks for listening, and we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Obviously, a lot of what's going on in terms of spend is just a function of tougher and tougher year-over-year comps. But Dan, historically, one of the data points that you provided periodically was a stratification of spending trends by what you called wallet size or annual spend. Is there anything there that you can point to right now in terms of what's going on? Is there any difference between the high end and the low end at this point?","Daniel T. Henry","So that's usually the type of information we provide at one of our semiannual conferences and don't provide it on a recurring basis. I guess what I would say is what we saw in the quarter where our growth was generally higher than most of the other competitors is a reflection of our business model, and we're only reaping the benefits of the investments that we've made over the past couple of years. While the growth rate did decline from the third quarter, I think we've seen that really across the industry. And the decline really was pretty spread out across the globe and really across most of our businesses. So it's kind of the -- what we're seeing, I think, is really a reflection of what's taking place in the economy. But at this point, we don't have other information to share in terms of changes that may be taking -- by different wallet size. As you know, when we had this decrease or recession, you saw the steepest reduction in people who had the highest spend because they had the greatest amount of discretionary spending. But we've seen those customers bounce back very nicely over the last 2 years, and they continue to have very high levels of engagement as you can see by the increases in the average spend of our cardmembers.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'll cross my fingers that you guys put that out at investor day.","Operator","And our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. Just a touch additionally on the spend trends. Just wondering, like, what was the trend that was seen during the quarter? Was it weaker throughout the quarter or did it get weaker during the quarter? And then if there's any updates on the first couple of weeks in January.","Daniel T. Henry","I would say it was pretty even over the course of the quarter, kind of month by month. So it wasn't a situation where December was notably different than the spending growth rate for the quarter.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Sure. And any updates on what we've seen month-to-date in January?","Daniel T. Henry","Not at this point.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess, another question is with regards to your longer-term targets and -- what are your thoughts about that for 2012 in an environment where it continues to remain slow growth economic environment?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, what we'll see actually next year, as you indicated in your question, will be dependent on where the economy goes. And we fully recognize that we have had very strong growth over the last 2 years, so the comparables will be more difficult, and there are some benefits that are not going to reoccur. As we think about this, we want to make good, smart investment decisions that are going to drive the growth of the business over the long term. And as we think about all of our targets, we think about them as on average and over time targets. We've always kind of addressed it that way and we'll continue to do the same as we go forward.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then final question, on the international yield side, do you think that the yields will remain kind of at the fourth quarter levels, or will it continue to decline from here?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, so I think the change in yields that we've seen in international are a part of the focus on premium lending that we put in place. And that's what's really driving the yields down. To us, whether the yields in international stay exactly where they are or modulate from there, the important thing is one of the overall economics of the product focusing both on the spend that they have, the loan balance that they have, as well as the yield. In the U.S., we've kind of given guidance that we expect it to be kind of in this high 8% to 9% range, and you could see that we've stabilized in the U.S. at that level.","Operator","We will go next to Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Question on Membership Rewards costs. We saw that actually grow a bit slower than the U.S. billed business growth rate. Just some thoughts there and how we should expect that to trend as I'm modeling that to grow at a similar rate to the U.S. billed business growth. And secondly, when we think about your payout ratio, what's the company's -- what's your thought process on dividend versus buyback at this point?","Daniel T. Henry","So in MR, we had growth on the expense line of 10%, which is fairly in line with the growth that we see in spending. And most of our products have a report -- a reward component related to it. In any given quarter, it's also impacted by what the weighted average cost per point is and a number of other factors. So to the extent rewards is a couple of percentages, growth is a couple of percentages above or below, I would consider that to be in line with spending growth. So in the absence of an acceleration in redemptions, which lead to higher growth in the ultimate redemption rate, we would expect that rewards expense would grow generally in line with spending. Now as it relates to dividends payout, so we think about dividends as trying to, over time, maintain the kind of the yield or the payout ratio of dividends compared to earnings that we've historically have. So I would expect as earnings go up, we would try to keep that same type of payout ratio going forward, not radically change dividends either up or down. And to the extent we then generate capital, that is either dividend-ed out or used to support growth in our balance sheet to maintain our capital ratios, or to support acquisitions, we would use that in terms of share buybacks. We've said dimensionally we would expect about 50% to be retained in the business of earnings and 50% to be returned to shareholders, but that's very dependent on the number of acquisitions that are out there that we think are economical and will help us drive our business strategy. So this time if we saw more acquisitions we thought worthwhile, the payout could be a little lower than that. And to the extent we don't see acquisitions that we decide to make, then the payout ratio in a given year would be higher than that. So no change really in the policy that we've articulated over the past year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just as we think about 2012 earnings and your on average over time, the earnings forecast and our estimate are relatively flat with 2011. And I think at one point you had said or American Express had said maybe 2010 was a reasonable period to think about as kind of a base year for the 12% to 15% target earnings growth. Is that still true? I mean, just the expectations currently are for relatively little earnings growth as you don't have the reserve releases and you don't have the MasterCard\/Visa payments, and you manage your expenses in a relatively slower growth than the global environment.","Daniel T. Henry","So as you'd expect, I'm not going to forecast next year's EPS, but you're absolutely right. What we have said is 2010 is a good base year and off of that, on average and over time, we would look to achieve the financial targets that we have out there in terms of 8% revenue growth and 12% to 15% EPS growth. So 2010 is the base year, and we haven't modified our targets at all. Obviously, we hit 22% growth in this year, and it's an example of when we are above that range.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Tax rate for 2012, any thoughts on tax rate?","Daniel T. Henry","So our tax rate is generally 30% to 32%. So in the absence of benefits, either from planning or from the resolution of audits, I would expect it to be in that same range.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then the last question. Just on some of your initiatives like the Prepaid with Target, the Serve, I saw an interesting investment you made yesterday. Can you give any update on how's the Prepaid Target? How's that product looking? Loyalty Partners is something you guys certainly are pushing pretty hard. I'd love some update on some of these products.","Daniel T. Henry","So there are 3 different topics. So Prepaid, we think, is an expanding market. We are investing in Prepaid. We think it has very good growth rates over time and attractive economics for us. So that is an area that we are focused as a growth area. Target is just one example of some of the new products that we have out there. We're focused both in the U.S. and really globally for Prepaid. So we're very pleased with how the Prepaid business is growing. In terms of the announcement we made yesterday. Basically, we've entered into an operating agreement with a company in China named Lianlian. Basically, we are going to license our Serve platform, which will be really what drives a digital wallet that they want to develop. As we all know, China is a very large market. It provides an opportunity for us to participate there. And we also made a equity investment in Lianlian Pay, Inc. of $125 million. So it's very much in line with our strategy, and we're pleased with that agreement and investment. In terms of Loyalty Partner, which is the acquisition that we closed in March of 2011, we think we -- and it continues to have good growth prospects, which is the reason that we acquired it, and we're in the process of doing the work necessary to execute against our strategy. So I think each of those are moving in line with the plans that we've set out for each of the respective businesses.","Operator","And we have a question from Mark DeVries with Barclays Capital.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the rewards expense in a slightly different way. By our calculation, rewards as a percentage of proprietary billed business was down pretty significantly Q-over-Q to about 78 basis points from 88 basis points last quarter. And I think you also indicated there was at least a slight increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the quarter, so presumably that included, at least, a little bit of a reserve adjustment. Is that 78 basis point level assuming no material change in redemption rates from here, a reasonable run rate going forward?","Daniel T. Henry","So certainly you could kind of look at it on a basis points to billings basis. We have invested in making Membership Rewards a highly attractive program, which we think it is. We think it's terrific if customers increased the amount of redemptions they make, because there's a clear link between cardmembers who do redemptions and growth in their spending as we go forward. So improving the program and increasing engagement, which is reflected in redemptions. But that ultimately impacts our estimate of the ultimate redemption rate. We think it's a good thing for the franchise. In this quarter, it so happened that, that increase, which is a slight increase, was similar to the fourth quarter of last year. If in fact as we go forward that ticks up, the ultimate redemption rate, we would actually view that as a positive thing, long term for the franchise. As you saw in the second and third quarter, if it moves up quite a bit compared to the prior year, then you get high growth rates on this line. However, if the ultimate redemption rate stayed at the current level with modest increases, which was similar year-to-year, then I think you have this relationship of rewards to billings continue into the future.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And understanding that you're not going to rigidly managed to that 8% long-term revenue growth target year-to-year, that said, in an environment where organic growth may be challenged because of the economy, does that create any greater sense of urgency for you to deploy some of those retained earnings and investments that may generate more immediate revenue benefit than, kind of, benefits that are further out?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. I think there's a tremendous focus on revenue growth in our industry. Certainly, what happened with the economy, which is uncertain, will have a bearing on whether we achieve the 8%. But I think it's important to remember that our business model is very different than many of our issuing competitors. They are very dependent on loan growth, which is particularly challenged. Net interest only represents about 15% or only represented about 15% of our revenues in this period. So to the extent we're successful with our business strategies and drive spending, then I think we're going to be in a better position than many of our competitors in terms of achieving revenue growth as we go forward.  But in terms of how we allocate our investments, certainly as we've said in the past, we look to allocate investments to things that will give a short-term benefit, some to the medium term and some to the long term. Certainly in periods where things are more robust, you may tend to allocate more to the long term. And if it's a more challenging environment, you may do more focus on the piece that has short-term benefits. But we would never skew completely away from investing in medium to long term because we really do look at achieving results on average and over time, and that we're in the midst of investing in some new businesses that we think are -- have a lot of potential to them. So we would not detract from continuing to invest in those new businesses as we go forward. But certainly, we can modulate in terms of the amount we allocate into the short, medium and long-term buckets.","Operator","We will go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question and a follow-up from earlier on the capital front. So you're clearly still well above the targets that you had laid out several quarters back. And I think you returned 56% of capital this year, which is above the 50%. But should we not see any acquisitions materialize in the near term? Could there be the expectation that you could go above the 50% -- the 50% to 60% in the near term in terms of capital returns?","Daniel T. Henry","If you think about the amount of capital that we generate, which is substantial, we have a fair amount of capital that we have discretion in terms of how we actually use it. So we generated earnings in the year of nearly $5 billion. So to the extent we're allocating 50% to really build the business because consumers are cautious about taking on additional loans. The growth in the balance sheet hasn't been that significant, so the amount of capital that's actually required to support that is $500 million or $600 million last year. So it leaves a lot of capacity for acquisitions. And if we find good acquisitions that can help us achieve our business strategies, we're going to go and make those as long as the price and the economics are reasonable. And if we found more than $1.9 billion, we go higher. On the other hand if we don't see good acquisitions, we would be inclined, actually, to return that capital to shareholders, if we're not going to use it in the very near term. That's always been our philosophy and will continue to be our philosophy. But if we see good acquisitions, we will seize on them. If not, we'll return the capital to shareholders.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and I guess -- well, it's a relatively smaller part of the billed business. Can you just give us maybe a little bit more of a sense of what you're actually seeing out of your customer base in Europe? I mean, I think you referenced something like you saw growth in the U.K., Germany and France and that there was declines. Any further clarity you could give just on what you're seeing or what your expectations are for that?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So let me just add 1 or 2 more sentences to my prior answer as related to capital. So what I just described is the capital philosophy that we have, but obviously, what we actually do would be dependent on the Fed approving the plan that we submitted to them on January 9. So I would just put that as a modifier to the comments I made a minute ago. As it relates to Europe, I mean we saw 8% growth in the third quarter, 4% growth this quarter. The countries, certainly the U.K. and Germany and France, the companies that are -- the countries that are stronger, there we've seen declines from previous quarters in terms of growth rate, but still we're seeing growth in the mid-single digits, which is pretty good. And as you'd expect in the countries that are more impacted, we're seeing less growth or actually a slight decline, which is what we saw in Italy. So beyond that, I don't have any other additional color to add, but I think that will give you a sense. And what you'd expect is exactly is what we're seeing: more impact on the countries that are under greater economic stress in terms of their funding.","Operator","We will move on to Marc Lombardo with Meredith Whitney.","Marc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC","Just wanted to see, kind of following up on Ryan's question. Are you able to breakout the percent that Europe represented in billed business either for 4Q or for 2011?","Daniel T. Henry","In terms of what percent of billed business? So in 2010, it was 12%. So if you look across the year, based on the information that we provided to you, Europe has actually grown at a slower rate than the rest of the world. So it could be still 12% or slightly less than that, but I would say in that neighborhood. Probably a little less than what we had last year when it represented 12% of billings.","Marc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC","Okay, great. And then domestically, are you noticing that cardmembers are trading down still?","Daniel T. Henry","Trading down in terms of the average ticket price?","Marc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC","Correct.","Daniel T. Henry","So I don't think we -- I'm not aware that there's been any notable change in average ticket price. The positive is in the U.S., billings have really held up well. Growth has been 11% compared to 12% last quarter. And it's pretty broad-based, both in consumers, small business and corporate spending. So -- and as I said before, the average spend of our customers continues to grow very nicely, showing high levels of engagement on their part.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I don't know if you addressed this or not, I have been multitasking here, but could you comment on [indiscernible] any update on the Department of Justice case? I believe at that time in October of 2010, you'd set it around a 2-year window for some movement in that case. Is there any timeline that we should be aware of there? And then secondarily, is there any thoughts you can give us relative to your rules on surcharging and whether or not Visa and MasterCard are rolling back their rules on surcharging a lot [indiscernible] in the U.S. could impact your business model?","Daniel T. Henry","So there's no real update on the DoJ case. The first time that we'll have anything new would be there is a schedule to complete discovery I think in the first quarter of 2013. So right now, this discovery is taking place, and that'll take place over the course of the next year. So no real update in those terms. In terms of surcharging, I think there's nothing new on our part in terms of any changes to our policies in that regard. And the place we have seen surcharging to the greatest degree, which is a little bit of an old story now, is Australia. Certainly it had an impact on us initially, when it took place a couple of years ago, but we continue to evolve our business strategy there and have had very healthy growth rates in the market and are doing well. So nothing really to update that's new as it relates to surcharging.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is there any relationship between the 2? The DoJ kind of seem, as a matter of fact, seem to be okay with surcharging. It's more about allowing discounting. Is it possible you could allude [ph] to the DoJ case to retain the ability to not allow merchants to surcharge in the U.S.?","Daniel T. Henry","So I think that case is primarily whether merchants could steer from one credit card company to another credit card company. I think it's the basis of the primary point in the suit. As we've said before, we have an advantage on the discount-rate basis compared to Visa and MasterCard, but there's only a certain limited amount of economics there. So it could be a real question in my mind of whether there's enough economics to actually cause somebody to switch from one credit card product to another credit card product given the potential cost that could be involved in that. But it's really a case focused on whether merchants can steer from one credit card to another. Basically within Durbin, they're allowed to steer from credit cards to debit, but that case is about credit card to credit card. And merchants have always had the ability and the right to give discounts based on payments for cash.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Dan, your net interest income as a proportion of total revenues has been coming down 15% this quarter. I think it was historically in the sort of 20% range. Should we expect that trend to continue the decline in net interest income as loan growth is less of a focus and you continue to look at higher end transactors?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, I think it's going to be totally dependent on the behaviors of our customers. If you look at the paydown rates in the lending trust last month or even a year ago, they are kind of all in that 30% range up a little bit, down a little bit. So we had gone through a period where it was increasing quite a bit. It seems to have stabilized here some. So it depends on whether that continues. We are focused on premium lending, but it certainly doesn't mean that our customers aren't going to evolve periodically. Certainly, they're picking a lending product because they want the ability and opportunity to revolve periodically. Now as we've talked about, we have some more transactors that we had historically in the portfolio. But I think lending will continue to be an important revenue stream at 15%, but it really depends on how consumers think about debt and how far they want to leverage. I don't think anybody knows whether that's complete yet or whether it will start to be more willing to take on some more revolving debt periodically. So really we're going to have to wait and see how customer behavior plays out. It's hard to pinpoint it since it's really a new space for where they were historically. But for us, the important thing is to put products in the marketplace that meet our customers' needs, and then they can use the product in a way that really meets their needs. So we can continue to be focused on that. But certainly, if there's the ability to put products out there in customers' hands and they would choose to evolve more, that's fine with us as long as the credit is right. Or if they choose to evolve a little less, that's fine with us as well. So we'll have to see how it evolves. It's really dependent on customer behavior going forward.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what proportion of your lending book is at introductory rates now?","Daniel T. Henry","So I don't know what it is, but it's very small. You can certainly see from public data that we are not using balance transfer the way some competitors are. And even in our acquisition, it's not a huge tool. So I would say the amount at introductory rates is relatively small within the scheme of the whole portfolio.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Less than 10%?","Daniel T. Henry","I don't know.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just your net interest yield declined. You've guided to, I think in the USCS business, 8% to 9%. Is any proportion -- any portion of the decline this last quarter or any of the guidance driven by CARD Act-related look backs?","Daniel T. Henry","So the answer to that is no. We thought it would -- before we started, before the CARD Act was passed, we were kind of in this high 8%, 9% range. When we put in pricing changes, we said our objective was to get back to where we were after the impact of the CARD Act. And we were successful at doing that. 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis is pretty minor, but it's not due to a look back. Certainly in the future, regulators will come and take a look at that, and you'll feel pretty comfortable with our position. But until you actually have somebody come in and look at it, you don't know if they concur completely with the steps that we've taken. But from our perspective, we're in an appropriate spot. And to specifically answer your question, no, it wasn't due to a look back.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just one unrelated real quick. What proportion of total billed business is GNS right now?","Daniel T. Henry","So I don't know exactly. Have we disclosed this? I think it's about 15% in that range. Could be 14%, could be 16%, but we'll take a look and before we get off the phone, answer that question. I think it's 15%.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This was, I think, the first time in a while you've seen billed business growth below 20% in GNS. Is there anything to be cautious -- caution on in that area?","Daniel T. Henry","So I think we were getting a lift over the last couple of quarters as a result of the Macy's agreement that we put in place. But if you go back, we have many, many quarters where GNS business was growing at more than 20%. And 17% growth, which is what I think we had this quarter, is pretty darn good. So I think GNS continues to be a very good line of business for us, and we think it has good prospects as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question will come from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Dan, I believe earlier you referenced the uptick in U.S. Card Services, the -- or charge card services, the charge-off increase. You mentioned that obviously, new business is not going to limit charge-offs but to drive revenue at an economic return. But can you talk about maybe how you've widened the credit scope maybe for the charge card customer? I don't know if you could give FICO or maybe tiering ranges, but it sounds like you're going a little deeper in terms of credit.","Daniel T. Henry","So we basically keep our credit standards pretty constant, both in the past and now. Certainly, when the recession hit, we tightened up some, but I think now, our view in terms of the type of credit worthiness that we want is not dissimilar to what we've looked for historically. Certainly we've built in to our models all those earnings that we've had over the past couple of years. But the good growth we've had is really based on the fact that our strategy is to grow charge card and that we've allocated investments to acquiring charge card customers, which is what's really driving really the growth in that business as opposed to having credit standards that are not as tight as we've historically had. So we'll do it by designing products that customers want to have and by adding both acquisition investments and loyalty investments that drives higher levels of spending.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then regarding marketing and promotion, you pointed out that your expense containment, you guys are executing on your strategy and one of the key areas of reduction of expense has been marketing. But it seems that some of your peers are ramping up marketing spend now. And I was just curious, how would you respond to that? Do you watch market share? And I guess, is it possible to maintain low marketing spend in the face of an industry that seems to be increasing marketing spend?","Daniel T. Henry","So we certainly do focus on market share. I mean, one of our objectives is to continue to gain market share. And if you look back over the last 10 years, other than in periods when there's a slowdown, we've gained market share. I think if you went back to 2002 or something, our market share was, in the U.S. for credit, was 19.9%. And today, it stands at about 26.4%. So we've made steady progress there, and we want to continue to make steady progress. Now you refer to low levels of investment. So I would say we're in actually the opposite position. In terms of marketing, in 2010, we took marketing expense to very high levels, levels notably above where we've ever been before. We think about marketing, if you look historically, as being about 9% of revenues. And in this quarter, we're at 9% of revenue. So we think those are levels of investment that can drive the business. So it's nice to have even higher levels. But at this level, we think we can be successful at driving business in a way that helps us meet our financial targets. And the level of investments that we're making in some of our other businesses that run through the OpEx line, as we talked about before, we have increased those. And we think we have levels of spending and investment that, again, can continue to grow our business. So I don't think about investments being at a low level. They are at very healthy levels as we go forward.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And one final question. As you have pointed out earlier the call, revenue seems to be a challenge for you. And revenue growth seems to be a challenge to the industry. And just wondering if we're starting to see receivables, loans pickup little bit to find, like, 3% growth. Is that eventually ever going forward, maybe emphasize loan growth a little bit more and collect more interest income to offset maybe slowing billed business growth elsewhere?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I think it will be really be driven a little bit by what I talked about before. We're going to look to continue to have products in the marketplace that meet our customers' needs. So I would say if we see loan balances decline, it would be because the customer's deciding to be more cautious. And if we see loan growth pickup some, it would be because the customer wants to utilize the revolving feature on the products in terms of how they live their lives. So I think it's going to be more driven by consumers' behavior than us changing our focus on whether we want to just put on more loan balances. We, as a company, have never had a target in terms of what loan should be or what loan growth should be. Where loans go is simply an outcome of how our customers decide to use the products that we put in their hands.","Operator","And we have no one else in queue.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay, very good.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, to Mr. Edmund Reese, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Edmund Reese","Thank you, Lori. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the Company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our web site at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then, Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of Q2 financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session on the quarter's results, with both Steve and Jeff.","With that, let me turn it over to Steve.","Steve Squeri","Thanks Edmund and good afternoon everyone. As I have been meeting with shareholders and analysts over the past several months, a number of you have said, you would like to hear my views of the company more frequently. With that in mind, I plan to join our earnings call with Jeff, going forward, to share my perspective on our strategic progress and quarterly results. Jeff will continue to cover our financial performance in more detail, before we take your questions.","As you saw in our release earlier today, we had a strong second quarter that built on the momentum we started the year with. Revenues grew 9% and earnings per share were $1.84. We are a globally integrated payments company and the power of our differentiated business model was evident throughout the results.","Our revenue growth was driven by broad-based increases in card member spending and fees, and it also reflected higher loan volumes, which that spending growth helped to generate.","Second, we are both strengthening relationships with current customers and attracting new ones, through innovative products and services. Third, our disciplined control of operating expenses, combined with revenue growth, gave us the flexibility to make substantial investments in our global brand campaign. Additional customer benefits and digital capabilities that will help us grow our business over the long term.","In addition to our business results, we completed this year's CCAR process with a green light to increase the quarterly dividend, and we are resuming our share buybacks this quarter.","All in all, I feel very good about our results to-date. Looking ahead, we expect 2018 revenues to be up at least 9% and we are reaffirming our full year EPS guidance at the high end of the range we set for this year, which is the $6.90 to $7.30 per share.","Coming into the CEO role earlier this year, I focused the organization on four strategic imperatives. You may recall, that I first shared them with you back in October of last year. At the midyear mark, I am pleased to report solid progress on each.","The first imperative is to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space worldwide. We once again delivered record performance on our U.S. Platinum card, and we continue to refresh our premium product line globally, with enhancements to our Platinum card in Mexico and Hong Kong, and our Gold card in the U.K. In addition, we announced new co-branded cards with Marriott and launched the new Cash Magnet card in the U.S. This follows the launch earlier this year of a new suite of co-branded products with Hilton.","We are continuing to invest in differentiated value propositions that distinguish American Express from the competition. We provide our card members with global access to exclusive services and experiences. We continue to expand the global range of these offerings and have recently announced the expansion of our Centurion Lounges with new openings scheduled in Los Angeles and Denver, and a second one in New York, at JFK.","Our official partnership with the Wimbledon Championship and a new partnership with Saks to offer value to our joint customers.","Our second strategic imperative is to build on our strong position in commercial payments. Just last month, we announced a multiyear partnership with Amazon, which will include a new co-branded small business credit card in the U.S. This is an exciting opportunity and a great example of why we are the small business partner of choice, because of our ability to bring value to partners and their customers by leveraging our brand, innovative technology, data analytics and other unique assets. In addition, we also introduced new value propositions for Hilton and Marriott small business card members in the U.S.","Our third strategic imperative, is to strengthen our global integrated network to provide unique value. We introduced a new card with Wells Fargo, one of our larger GNS partners in the U.S.","This is an important win and another validation of our differentiated benefits and services, like access to one of a kind experiences and special offers that enables us to win in a competitive marketplace. We continued our progress towards parity coverage in the U.S. and expanded our merchant network internationally.","Our fourth strategic imperative is to make Amex an essential part of our customer's digital lives. Technology and innovation on the engines that continue to fuel our brand, and customer value propositions, and we are making investments to enhance our capabilities in this space. We are developing artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain capabilities to better serve our customers.","Our mobile enhancements are being recognized, and we placed first in JD Power's 2018 Mobile App Competitive Survey, up from sixth in 2017. We expanded chat-based servicing feature on our mobile app, as another way to serve our customers where, how and when they want, and we are continuing to expand our capabilities, as we integrate two specialized platforms we recently acquired, Mezi and Cake, into our digital offerings.","We are also experimenting with technology and recently announced a pilot with the online retailer Boxed, using blockchain and our membership rewards program to give card members more ways to earn points, and merchants, more ways to drive business.","Two additional and important second quarter items are worth noting. First, we launched our new global brand campaign, which underscores the powerful backing of American Express. The campaign is being across both our consumer and business segments, and it drives home what our brand is all about, building enduring customer relationships through their intertwined business and personal lives.","Finally, my list of wins for the for the quarter , includes the favorable ruling we received in a major antitrust case at the Supreme Court. The Court has found that our differentiated business model has spurred innovation in the payments industry. Their ruling was a welcome end to a long legal battle with the Department of Justice.","All in all, it was a very good quarter. Six months into my tenure as CEO, I feel good about what we have accomplished. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I am confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders.","Let me now turn the call over to Jeff, who is going to provide more detail about our financial results.","Jeff Campbell","Well thanks Steve, and good afternoon everyone. It's good to be here today, to talk about another quarter with strong performance. To get right into our summary of financials on slide 3, second quarter revenues of $10 billion grew 9%, another quarter of revenue growth at the highest levels we have seen since the financial crisis. Even more importantly, this result was driven by strong growth across all of discount revenues, fee revenues, and net interest income. Given the recent strength in the dollar, our reported revenue growth was pretty consistent with our FX adjusted revenue growth, unlike the last few quarters, where the weaker dollar caused our reported revenue growth to be above our FX adjusted revenue growth.","Net income was $1.6 billion, up 21% from a year ago, and earnings per share was $1.84 for the quarter, up 25% from the prior year. Now of course, our earnings growth this year reflects the passage of the Tax Act last December, but it also reflects our business model's steady and consistent earnings growth, along with the impact of our share repurchases, lowering the shares outstanding by 3%, despite the suspension of our share repurchase program for the first half of 2018. All in, these are results we feel really good about.","Looking at the details of our performance, I will start with Billed Business, which you see several views of on slides 4 through 6. I'd start by pointing you to the top right of slide 4, where you see that there are two different trends impacting our overall billings growth. This quarter, our proprietary billings make up 85% of our overall billings, and growth in these proprietary billings accelerated to 12%, up from 11% in the first quarter, all on an FX adjusted basis. This is another sign of the momentum we have in our business. You can also see on the top part of slide 4, that the other 15% of our overall billings, which come from our network business, GNS, is now seeing the expected impact of regulation in the European Union and Australia, and hence billings in GNS were down 3%, and this caused our total AXP billings to come in at 9% for Q2.","As you turn to slide 5, I'd remind you that our results this quarter reflect the organizational changes Steve has made, since becoming CEO, so we now have three reportable operating segments; Global Consumer, Global Commercial, and Global Merchants and Network Services. Although we are reporting financial results on a Global Consumer basis, we do want to continue to provide you transparency into both the U.S. and international consumer metrics. So here on slide 5, you can see all of the diverse parts of our business, maintaining or accelerating good growth rates, aside from GNS.","Turning to slide 6, we have a more detailed view of billings by customer segment. This slide also serves as a helpful reminder of the relative size of each customer segment. Global Commercial and Global Consumer are roughly the same size, representing 41% and 44% of Q2 billings respectively. Global Network services makes up the remaining 15% of billings.","Starting on the left, with our small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs, U.S. SME was up 10%, and has been relatively stable for several quarters. International SME, which has consistently been one of our strongest growing customer segments, accelerated to 25% on an FX adjusted basis in the second quarter, reflecting our increasing investments in this particularly attractive component of our global opportunities.","The large and [ph] Global Customer segment continued to perform nicely with 9% growth on an FX adjusted basis, and on a related note, you can see in the earnings tables that the company's overall global airline billings continued to accelerate to 7% on an FX adjusted basis, and U.S. T&E billings growth remains strong at 8%.","Moving to U.S. Consumer, which made up about 32% of the company's billings in the second quarter, we are pleased to report our second consecutive quarter of double digit growth. We feel particularly good about our U.S. consumer platinum performance, where growth did not slow as we expected this quarter, as we fully lapped the changes that we made to the product early in 2017. Around half of our acquisitions on U.S. Consumer Platinum continued to come from millennials.","I would also point out, that similar to last quarter, our strong billings growth reflects both our continued focus on customer engagement, as well as general strength we are seeing in consumer spending and confidence, within our premium U.S. consumer space.","Moving to the right, we continue to see strong growth for international consumer, which is up 18% on an FX adjusted basis, up from 16% in Q1. Although it is only 12% of overall billings, we feel really good about the widespread strong growth in key markets, with FX adjusted growth of 13% in Japan, and over 20% in both Australia and the U.K.","Last, on the right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 3%, driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia. Although, network billings are down in these regions, we are seeing strong growth on the proprietary side, as I just mentioned. Additionally, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia markets, the remaining portion of GNS was up 8%. Overall, we feel good about the diverse sources of growth.","We have been sustaining double digit billings growth in U.S. consumer and U.S. SME, while also accelerating billings growth across both international consumer and SME, as well as with large and global corporate clients.","Turning next to loan performance on slide 7, our total loan growth was 16% in the second quarter and in line with the prior quarter, and once again, over 60% of our growth came from existing customers.","I'd remind you, that we completed the Hilton portfolio acquisition earlier this year, which contributed about 140 basis points and 130 basis points to the growth rates in the first and second quarters respectively. On the right, net interest yield was 10.6%, up 30 basis points versus the prior year. For some time now, we have been saying that we expect year-over-year growth in net interest yield to moderate, and you can clearly see that playing out, while net yield is still growing over the prior year, the increase has moderated over the last few quarters, as we lap some of our pricing initiatives, and experience higher funding costs.","Lastly, I would add that we typically see a seasonal decline in net yield from the first to second quarter, as you did see this year, with net yield down 20 basis points sequentially in the second quarter.","To spend a minute now on funding, I'd remind you that our funding strategy is to be active in three markets, deposits, asset-backed securities, and unsecured debt. Focusing on deposits, we have about $67 billion in total at June 30, with about $31 billion coming from sweep accounts and CDs, which tend to move in line with market rates. The remaining $36 billion in deposits is coming from our online personal savings program, which in a rising rate environment, is generally our least expensive source of funding.","We expect to continue to grow our online savings program steadily over the next few years, facilitated by the recent consolidation of our two U.S. banks. In terms of rate sensitivity, since the Fed started raising rates back in mid-2016, our beta has been about 0.45, but is trending up. More recently, our beta is closer to 0.7, which is also what we use for internal planning purposes.","Stepping back, while we view a rising rate environment as a modest headwind, it is usually mitigated in part by a stronger economic environment, which is certainly what we see currently.","Turning next to credit metrics, which you see on slide 8; starting on the left with the lending portfolio, the lost rate for the quarter was 2.1%, up about 30 basis points from last year and 10 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder of what we have been saying quite some time, we expect these rates to drift up as they have, to back lending rate [indiscernible] in the second quarter were slightly better than we originally expected in our plan for the year.","On the right side, you can see net write-off rates in our charge portfolio, as well as the global corporate payments loss ratio. There is often some quarterly volatility in these rates due to seasonality, and this quarter's write-off rate included some write-offs related to the hurricanes last fall, for which we had previously taken a reserve. Looking forward, we don't see anything in the performance of our tenured customers to suggest any change in the broader environment.","Given these credit metrics and moving to slide 8, provision was $806 million, up 38% in the second quarter, right in line with our full year expectation of mid-30% growth, despite loan growth running a bit higher than we had originally planned.","Turning now to revenues on slide 10; as I suggested, revenue growth was 9% in the second quarter. This represents our fifth straight quarter of having adjusted revenue of at least 8%, driven by steady growth from all of spending, fees and lending. On slide 11, you see the components of our total revenue. Discount revenue, which makes up over 60% of our revenue, was up 8%, which I will come back to on the next slide.","Net card fees growth was 9%, driven by growth in key international markets, as well as Platinum and Delta in the U.S. We continue to feel good about our ability to generate card fee revenues by offering differentiated value propositions right in the face of constant competition. Another example, year-to-date through May, over 60% of our global consumer new card acquisitions were on fee paying cards.","Other fees and commissions were up 5%, while other revenue was down 8%, driven by several discrete items. Lastly, let's turn to net interest income, which I would point out is down to being just 18% of our second quarter revenue. For this quarter, net interest income was up 19%, driven by the growth in loans and yield that I mentioned a few moments ago.","Turning now to slide 12, to cover discount revenue, our biggest component of revenue. Starting on the left, discount rate in Q2 was 2.37%, stable for the last few quarters, and down 5 basis points from a year ago. As you have heard both Steve and I talk about, our focus is on driving discount revenue growth, not on managing the average discount rate. This has led us to strategies like increasing coverage with small merchants, and deepening relationships with our key strategic partners, which we believe are key components helping drive the strong discount revenue growth you see on the right side of the page.","Discount revenue growth was 8% on an FX adjusted basis in the second quarter, maintaining the strong momentum of the prior quarter.","Turning now to expenses on slide 13; before coming to the components of customer engagement, marketing and business development, card member rewards and card member services on the next slide, let me cover operating expenses.","Operating expenses were down 2% this quarter and though this reflected a number of discrete items, even excluding these items, we continue to have well controlled operating expenses. Our ability to generate steady OpEx leverage continues to be a key part of our financial model, and one that we have great confidence in sustaining over the long term.","So that brings me next to customer engagement on slide 14. In total, customer engagement expenses were $4.5 billion in the second quarter, up 13% from the prior year. Starting at the bottom, we have the marketing and business development line, which has two components, our traditional marketing and promotion expenses, as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners.","This lending total is up 14% versus the prior year, and there are three things that I would highlight. As I said last quarter, we have some increases in partner payments this year, due to recent co-brand negotiations, and agreements and growth in our corporate business.","Second, Steve talked about the launch of our new global brand campaign in the second quarter, and as you would expect, we have increased marketing spend to support the brand refresh. And third, the benefits of the Tax Act and our strong performance year-to-date have allowed us to ramp up somewhat the spending we do to drive long term sustainable revenue and earnings growth.","As I said on last quarter's earnings call, we began the spending in the second quarter and expect it to continue through the balance of the year.","I would point out, that the confluence of all these factors, allowed us to acquire 2.9 million new proprietary cards globally this quarter, which is one of our highest acquisition quarters recently, when you set aside the Hilton portfolio of purchase.","Moving up to rewards expense, you can see that it was up 11% from the prior year, the rewards were expected to and did, grow roughly in line with proprietary billings program.","Moving then to the top of the slide, as you have seen for some time and as we continue to expect, card member services costs were our fastest growing expense line, up 22% in the second quarter. The kinds of things that drive card member services cost are exactly the things that drive the differentiated value propositions that Steve discussed, that are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access, and other travel benefits.","Turning last to capital on slide 15; as you know, we suspended share repurchases for the first half of 2018 to rebuild our capital ratios, following the $2.6 billion charge we took in Q4 2017 related to the Tax Act. And given our high ROE, we can quickly rebuild capital.","So at the end of the second quarter, our common equity tier-1 ratio had increased to 10.1%. We are now at the low end of the 10% to 11% range that we are targeting. Given this, we will be resuming share buybacks in the third quarter, as the Fed did not object to our CCAR submission that raises our dividend by $0.04 per quarter, beginning the third quarter and returns $3.4 billion of capital through share repurchases over the next four quarters.","Overall, this capital plan is consistent with our objective to target common equity tier-1 ratios of 10% to 11%, while supporting asset growth and distributing capital to shareholders.","So that brings us to our outlook, and then we will open the call to questions. As Steve mentioned, our expectation continues to be at the high end of our original EPS guidance range of $6.90 to $7.30. We are really pleased with our revenue performance to-date, and given the strong trends that we are seeing in the performance of our recent investments, we now expect revenue growth of at least 9% for the full year.","Our solid performance in the first half of the year, has allowed us to raise our guidance to the high end of our original range, while also increasing our investments into areas that we believe will drive long term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. This guidance is reflective of our simple financial model, in which we invest in our many and diverse growth businesses, generate operating leverage and return capital to shareholders to drive steady and consistent revenue and EPS growth.","With that, let me turn it back over to Edmund to begin the Q&A.","Edmund Reese","Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Steve, just a question on the page 2 of your strategic imperatives. Do you have specific measurements against each of those four that you are comparing yourselves to, and can you give any color on what you are looking at?","Steve Squeri","Yeah. So I think, so as we look at the four strategic imperatives, we have looked at these over the longer term, and so while we are not looking at specific year-to-year growth targets, we really are looking at, what, from a capabilities, and what from an accomplishment perspective. So let me just give you an example. When we look at the premium segment, what we are really looking to do, is to expand our definition of premium, as you have thought about premium over the years, we have thought about premium from the perspective of premium wallets. We are really looking at those that really look for premium service, premium access. And so that then includes to expand to more millennials, and so, when we look at some of our platinum card acquisition, and over half of our acquisition is coming millennials. So from that regard, it really is an expansion of the value proposition.","When we look at sort of the second one as it relates to our competitive -- continue to build on our competitive position from a commercial perspective, things like our growth from an SME perspective and international, our continued growth and progress that we made from a co-brand perspective in the U.S. with Hilton, with Marriott, and the launch of the Amazon card. So looking much more than just the metrics we have, but how we are embedding ourselves even more, and the launch of working capital and so forth.","When we get into the network piece of it, we are really looking to expand with more partnerships, and Wells Fargo is a great example of that expansion, and in addition, obviously, coverage, we continue to push on coverage, and we have stated from a coverage perspective, we want to be a parity coverage in the U.S. by the end of 2019.","From a digital perspective, when we talk about being more essential in people's digital lives, I think here, there is a lot of qualitative stuff that's going on. I mean, to be able to go from a J.D. Power survey from number six last year, from a mobile app perspective to number one, and why do we do that? Well, we really focused on engaging our customers in that app, number one. Putting chat based services within that, looking at other things from a digital perspective, whether it's the blockchain test that we are doing, our acquisition of Mezi and our acquisition of Cake.","So as we think about those four things, we are really looking, from an initiative perspective and how we are moving those things forward. And I think, the initiatives that I laid out and the specific actions that we have done is, is moving those business priorities forward for us.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our next question will come from Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Please go ahead.","Chris Brendler","Hi. Thanks [indiscernible] and thanks for taking the question. I guess, to circle back on the U.S. car business for a second, you said you had a Platinum refresh last quarter. How much of that Platinum refresh was lapping in the second quarter, and sort of more broadly, as you lookout the rest of the year, the marketing investments you have made this quarter, is the plan for the second half to really continue to put the pedal to the metal on marketing, and what does that mean for U.S. bill business growth? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well I think, Chris, to be clear, as you recall, in the U.S., we refreshed both the consumer, as well as the small business Platinum products in the early part of 2017, and we have been thrilled with the reaction to both of those upgrades. One of the things I cautioned people about last quarter, on the April call, was that well, the second quarter was going to be the first quarter where we fully lapped all those changes, and that might cause a little bit of a moderation in growth in those two products. Not as much surprised this quarter, which we really didn't, and so we were particularly pleased to see on the consumer side, that the growth rates did not slow at all, even though we have completely lapped now all of those changes we made, and I think it really goes back, Steve, into the strategic imperative. It's all about differentiated value propositions that we can put in the marketplace, and we feel really good about that Platinum.","The other comment I made is, we are in an unusual situation as a company, and that we have tremendous opportunities to invest and accelerate our growth across both consumer, commercial, U.S. and international, and we are always leaving a few really good opportunities on the table, as we balance short and long term financial performance. So when we have really good performance, as we have had year-to-date, it allows us to dip a little deeper into those really good opportunities, and I think that bodes really well for long term sustainability of the kind of revenue growth we are seeing now.","Steve Squeri","And to Jeff's point about continuing to invest in unique and differentiated services, we had announced the -- we are going to implement three new lounges, which adds again to more value for our travelling Platinum card members. We have also added to the Platinum card merchant funded value offers from Sacks, and so that adds more value, and it shows the power of the integrated model. We are able to take our merchant relationships that we have and marry those up with our high spending card members, and it works for our card members, and it obviously works for our merchants as well.","But just -- the other point that I did make, and that may have caused a little bit of a confusion is, in addition to -- obviously, we refresh the Platinum card products in the United States, we did in the second quarter, refresh the Platinum card products that we have in Hong Kong and in Mexico, and those cards are of smaller footprint, obviously, than our U.S. -- both U.S. platinum cards. But I think it is important to show that, as we think about the premium segment, you tend to focus on the premium segment as the U.S. There is a large premium segment outside the United States, and it is really important for us to continue to refresh the product line on a global basis.","Chris Brendler","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Steve, good to have you on and hi Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, as you mentioned, your top line expectations are now better than expected, and your EPS guidance didn't really change. Should we assume all of the incremental revenues are being spent, and that the marketing and business development line, that was up quite considerably, and you mentioned several reasons why. Should we expect that to continue to grow at the rate it is going forward, and maybe you could just talk about the payback on those returns? Thanks.","Steve Squeri","Let me make a couple of comments, and then I will ask Jeff to jump in. Again, I think we try to be as transparent as we can from an EPS perspective. We have adjusted at the end of the first quarter, as we looked out, we said, obviously $6.90 to $7.30, we said we'd be to the high end. But we feel really good about 25% EPS growth this quarter and 38% growth in the first quarter. Adjusted revenue growth of at least 8% for five consecutive quarters. And I think what's important to think about when you think about customer engagement, is that, you know, we are making investments not only to drive results this year, but we are looking to drive results in the moderate to long term. And so, our objective is, is really to make sure that our revenue growth levels are sustainable, and our objective is also to make sure we are taking advantage of those opportunities, as they present ourselves.","And Jeff has just made his point. I mean, we don't want to have opportunities go by the board. So that's how we think about it.","Jeff Campbell","I don't really have a lot to add. I think Sanjay, the second quarter marketing and promotion was a particular spike, because we only launch a new brand campaign every couple of years. But to Steve's point, that is also the line -- where a lot of the things we do that, we think are about driving longer term growth though.","So we feel good about the fact that we are hitting the high end of the guidance range we started out with, and we feel really good about the revenue growth sustainability we are building.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good evening. It looks like the contribution of your discount revenue as a percentage of revenues, net of rewards expense increased to 50% this quarter from 48% last quarter, while your net interest income contribution actually decreased. That seems to mark a reversal in the trend that we have been seeing. So you know, my question is, as we look ahead, is it reasonable to expect that we will continue to see a growing mix of your revenues coming from spend versus lend? And if I may just tack on to that, there has been some focus on the other operating expenses being better and part of that being from like reserve releases and perhaps, could you comment on, whether, consistent with your philosophy of reinvesting gains in the business, that perhaps part of the reason for the increase in marketing and promotion was the opportunistic reinvestment of some of those releases? Appreciate that.","Jeff Campbell","Well let me see if I get all, if I miss one, you can come back. First, I guess I'd make a couple of points on the net interest income discount rate mix. And that, on the discount revenue side, look, you do have a couple of things like OptBlue, like the immediacy of the regulation in Australia, and Europe, like some of the big strategic partner renegotiations we had last year, that are causing a little bit more reduction in the discount rate this year, than we would probably expect on a run-rate basis. So by definition, that tells you over time, discount revenues should move up a little bit in the mix.","On the opposite side, we have had a really good run on net interest income, of doing a lot of really good stuff on the pricing side. But, I have been pointing out for a few quarters, that is an end to that, and so, I do expect the growth in net interest income to moderate down more to where loan growth is. So I do think those two things in the absence of other changes in the business will cause a continuation of the trend that you called out.","In terms of reserve releases, I guess I am, Bill, a little puzzled by that. There is nothing in particular that's unusual going on in our operating expense line. We are just, as we always will be and as we have been for many years, very focused on the aspect of our business model, that is we can grow and pump a lot of revenue through our fixed cost infrastructure without adding a lot of cost, and technology helps us do that more efficiently every year, and that's really what you see happening on the operating expense side.","When you hear Steve and I talk about investing a little bit opportunistically this year, it really comes from the revenue upside.","Steve Squeri","Yeah, just one other point that I will make, is as you look at sort of the shift I guess, the little bit of the shift mix, and it's a slight shift mix this particular quarter, we are really focused on driving spend, right? So and if you dig within the numbers, and if you go to the slide that showed sort of the breakout of billings, you see across every single one, whether it's SME, SME international, U.S. consumer, and consumer international, these are all double digit growth numbers, and when you look -- if you net out GNS, we had 12% proprietary billings growth in the second quarter. And you know, we had that GNS drag due to regulatory issues in Europe and in Australia.","Well that spending is obviously driving the discount rate revenue, but that's the spending as well, where the lending comes in. We drive spend, and from that spend, we get -- we look to get whatever lend we can get from our existing customers. And again, and Jeff mentioned this in his remarks as well, 60% of our AR growth this particular quarter came from existing card members. So we feel good about how the model is working, right? I mean, the whole thing works together. We are -- the discount rate is working for us as well. It's driving more spend. That spend drives more lend with existing customers, hence, drives, what we believe, is very good revenue growth at 9%.","Bill Carcache","Thank you very much.","Steve Squeri","Thank Bill.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Squeri","Hey Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Good evening guys. How are you doing? Jeff, I wanted to ask a question on capital; you talked about the 10% to 11% CET1 as the binding constraint as you shift from CCAR to the rating agencies. I guess, given the lower risk and less NII dependency of your model, like why is that the right number, given that your model is less lend centric and a lot of the other traditional card lenders will be running at 10% to 11%? And I guess, what do you think is the right level of capital to actually run the business, relative to what the rating agencies are telling you? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","You know Ryan, maybe I should bring you with us on our next round of meetings with the rating agencies. You are correctly pointing out that, as I think about what the Fed has said publicly about where they are likely be taking this CCAR process, I think the Fed sees this [ph] to be the constraint on our capital, and I do think it's about the rating agencies.","We are very comfortable with the way we are rated today, but we think the ratings we have are important to sustain, and the reality of the way we work with the rating agencies today, is that's going to require us to stay at that tier-1 common equity ratio in the 10% to 11% range.","And certainly, we have lots and lots of discussions with them about this unique strength of our business model, about how strongly we performed in economic downturns and that's probably [ph] something you see in the Fed's modeling of the latest round of CCAR results. But I am trying to be very transparent.","10% to 11% isn't where we are today, unless we succeed in further -- working with the rating agencies. So I will give you a call to tell you when the next meeting is, and you can join us.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Just pulling up on the top line discussion. It seemed that, except for the impact from regulation on discount revenue; discount revenue would have continued to accelerate year-over-year. And so, what did your sense about some of the underlying drivers, such as the benefits of corporate tax reform on commercial C&E growth and that kind of thing to the extent that these can continue to maintain accelerating discount revenue, as the comps begin to get a little bit tougher, relative to the back half of last year?","Jeff Campbell","Well, let me start Steve, maybe then you can continue. So it's a good question Eric. When you think about sustainability, I'd make a few comments. We can look at the acceleration in revenue growth we have seen over the last few years, and very-very much link it to changes we have made in the business, and that really builds confidence as to the sustainability.","Couple of things around the edges though, that I would say, go a little bit beyond that, that's clearly in this calendar year, we are benefitting a little bit from buying the Hilton portfolio. So that goes away next year, and the other thing is, last quarter, I brought up the fact that we had seen a modest acceleration in organic growth that began very late last year. It has now sustained itself for the first half 2018, and that clearly is indicative of the fact that at least for the demographic of customers we serve, there is clearly some increased level of confidence.","So that could strengthen, it could weaken, we will have to see where the economy goes. But other than those two pieces, I think, we feel pretty good about the things we have done that are driving the revenue growth and their sustainability.","Steve Squeri","Yeah. And I think two of those things that we are doing, that are really driving the revenue growth, it's really the coverage initiatives. I mean, when there is more and more places that use the card. I mean, last year, we signed over 1 million merchants in the United States, and what happens is, that gives us an opportunity to go after a higher share of wallet with our existing card members, and it's also, a very good way to attract new card members. And we are doing a really good job from an acquisition perspective, both in the United States and in our international markets, of gaining new card members, both from a commercial perspective, and from a consumer perspective. I mean, just to put a highlight on, so that the volume growth, when you look at the second quarter, 25% SME international growth and 18% consumer growth in international, and that shows us that the investments that we have made and we are going to continue to go do well on those same investments, because they are truly working for us. And look, the SME business in the U.S. and the consumer business in the U.S. are obviously more mature than the businesses that we have, and a little bit more competitive than -- from an international perspective. But again, double digit growth in both of those portfolios as well.","So again, really a lot of focus on our card member acquisition efforts. Coverage is really helping, and then, we also do, is the journeys we take our card members through, to get more and more of their spend from a trigger marketing perspective, we continue to do that, and will continue to do that, as we look to get more and more pockets of their spend.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks. And if I can just follow-up on one question? You indicated that there is some increase in investment coming from the top line strength. I think previously Jeff, you had indicated that might be something around $200 million in the second, third and fourth quarters. Is that still the same investment level?","Jeff Campbell","Well, to be clear, so the $200 million, Eric, is what -- when the Tax Act passed in December. We actually made a very conscious choice. Even we had the plan done for the year, to add another $200 million, because we didn't made that choice till the beginning of January, we couldn't thoughtfully spend it in the first quarter.","What we are telling you on this call is above and beyond that $200 million, our revenue strength is allowing us to both get to the high end of our guidance range, but also put some additional money to work, making sure we are doing all the kinds of things, Steve, you just talked about, that are going to really sustain the sort of revenue growth we are getting.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Yeah thanks. Was hoping to better understand kind of strategically, why you decided to add this new Shop Saks benefit to the Platinum card, at a time, I think where you'd indicated you are already very pleased with kind of the reengagement and the customer acquisitions you are getting from that card. What was the need to do that? And also, could you give us a sense of the cost? To you, I mean, presumably, you are not paying your merchant partner a hundred cents on the dollar for the benefit. I assume, the same goes for the benefit you provide through Uber. If you could just give us a sense of what the costs might be, relative to how the --","Jeff Campbell","I am going to give you a sense of what the cost is for Saks, zero. It's fully funded by the merchant partner. So as we -- look, we are in a big -- one of the unique advantages of our model is, we manage a lot of our merchants, and as we manage them, what the objective is, is to help them drive and grow their business, and in conversation with Saks, they are very interested in our Platinum card holders. Our Platinum cardholders tend to spend money at Saks, and\/or merchants like Saks. And so, in working with Saks, we came up with $100 annual credit on Saks purchases. And so, the real question is, why wouldn't you? Someone is handing you $100 and it fits from a premium perspective, it fits from a demographic perspective, it's going to help drive value to Saks and it helps drive value to our customers as well.","So that's why we added the benefit. And I think, we will continue to add merchant funded benefits when they make sense. And what happens also with the Platinum card, this is an offer that sticks with the whole year. What we will do from time-to-time, is do time based offers for our Platinum card holders and for our Centurion card holders, because merchants want access to those customers, so that's why we did it.","Mark DeVries","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Steve Squeri","Thanks Mark.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Steve Squeri","Hey Don.","Jeff Campbell","Hey Don.","Don Fandetti","Steve, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the commercial segment? The bill business is obviously performing well. You got the Amazon co-brand. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive intensity in commercial, maybe contrast it with consumer, and do you think there is more upside to the growth rates that you are seeing today?","Steve Squeri","Yeah. So it's different, right? I mean, so let's talk about international. In international, from an SME perspective, it's really an open playing field. I mean, when you look at the penetration, I think the market is a couple of percent penetrated. So we have, not only replicated what we have been doing in the United States from a sales force perspective, but a talent perspective, and really engaging from a digital perspective, and that's why you are seeing these growth rates. And so, I am sure, over time, it will become competitive as well, as it's -- we believe it's a huge opportunity, which is why we continue to invest and why we continue to see large growth rates.","When you look at the SME segment in United States, it's competitive regionally, and different banks through different banks, because customers mean different things to them. And so we compete regionally. So you will compete with Capital Ones and we will compete with Wells and we will compete with Citi and JPMorgan and so forth. But I would say is that, it is probably not as intense as the competition that we traditionally see in the U.S. consumer business.","The other thing is, is that we are truly leveraging scale here. We are leveraging the assets that we have from a large and middle market, and global corporate card perspective, we are leveraging that global footprint, and that's really helping us out. And so, we will continue to do that.","I think, if you look at Amazon, you look at Marriott, I will just pick those two out in particular, because they truly had a choice. With the split portfolio with Marriott; Marriott could have gone either with us or with Chase or could have split it and what they like was our assets, our ability to reach small businesses, and so we won that part of the portfolio, and Amazon obviously looked at it the same way.","So we are excited about not only the growth opportunities here, but the new partnerships that we really just engaged with. So we are going to continue to aggressively compete in these segments. And the large segment, 9% growth. And so, that's what I have always talked about, when we have had the one-on-one analyst meetings, I have talked about how our value is to really help companies control their spending and reduce their spending. But as Jeff said, we are seeing an uptick in T&E, we are seeing an uptick in sort of airline spending, and we are winning more accounts.","So we believe, our -- we play really well in this space, and we are going to continue to compete very vigorously, as we move forward.","Don Fandetti","Thanks.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. So maybe, could you talk a little about how we should think about the provision and reserve build over the course of the next year? Just given, you have still got 30% plus growth in losses on both the charge and the credit portfolios, and this quarter is a fairly small build. But if the double digit loan growth continues, like how should we think about that?","Jeff Campbell","Well, so if you think about it, Moshe, we went into this year with a very clear expectation. We communicated publicly that we thought provision would grow 30%, given the growth we have seen and the -- very importantly, as you would understand, the accelerating growth that you have seen over the last few years, as we go through a seasoning process on some of the vintages from the last couple of years, and that's playing out actually a little better than we thought. So our loan growth is a little higher than we expected. Provision is coming in right where we thought this year, and so we feel very comfortable and good about the trends, and we feel good about the overall economics.","I'd also make the point that, I think you can kind of see this, if you look at the provision slide. When you think about 38% for the year, in 2017, the first two quarters were much lower than you had kind of a step up, as we started building reserves. So that factors into a little bit of the trend I would expect for the next two quarters. Now once you get beyond 2018, look, we will have to see at what rate loan growth continues to perform. I mean, I don't want to govern our team, I want to pursue as much really good, really economic, through the cycle loan growth, as we can achieve, particularly with the focus we have on our existing customers. So depending on if that happens to be in 2019, we will have to see exactly what it means for provision.","And what we feel comfortable with is, we are getting really good, through the cycle economics, even net of the provisions that -- when you are accelerating growth, you have to billed.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks very much.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Moshe.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat","Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I wanted to ask one question on Australia of all places. Just because I am trying to understand the dynamic there. I thought you said that billed business was up 20% year-on-year in Australia. But then you got the headwinds from GNS. Is there something in the dynamic or we are going to lap a pricing?","Jeff Campbell","Chris, I should probably clarify that. So to remind everyone, what's going on in Australia, is with the latest round of regulatory changes, we are in the process of shutting down our network business. So we had some great bank partnerships that are slowly going away, and so that's why, when you look at the GNS business, it is shrinking in Australia, and will eventually shrink to essentially zero. But that very fact is creating some really interesting growth opportunities for us on what -- the term we use as, our proprietary side, where we are the card issuer, including a co-brand, that we have launched with one of our former network bank partners, WestPac.","So that is fuelling really-really high growth rates for us in Australia, over 20% is the number I cited. And I'd just remind everyone, that when you replace a dollar of network billings with a dollar of proprietary billings, that is a really-really good trade economically.","So in some ways, this is just a commentary on the flexibility of our business model, as the world changes competitively or from a regulatory perspective. But I'd say, we feel good about the overall trends in Australia.","Chris Donat","Okay. And that you got a decent runway to grow the business, as you move more proprietary in Australia; because there had been, I think in the past, you disclosed that Australia was, I want to say like 4% to 5% of revenues, or when you did sort of FX exposure, it was in one of your larger markets at least?","Jeff Campbell","Yeah. You know, Australia is one of the five or six markets that are very significant to us outside. When you look at our non-U.S. results, you can pick eight or 10 markets and that's most of the economics in Australia would be near the top of that list.","Chris Donat","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will be from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Campbell","Hey Craig.","Craig Maurer","Hi. How are you?","Jeff Campbell","Good.","Craig Maurer","Wanted to drill down if I can, a little bit on what you are seeing in the U.S., from our vantage point, we have seen deceleration in all your competitors in U.S. and their U.S. purchase volume. You guys have done an amazing job sustaining growth. So I guess, the question begs, who are you taking share from and in what categories in the U.S.?","Steve Squeri","From an SME perspective, we continue to grow and even large market customers are even growing, because if you look at sort of large market global results in the U.S., just look at it sort of a year ago, these were sort of stagnant numbers for us. And our consumer business, we feel really good. I mean, we feel really good about the U.S. consumer business. Double digit growth two quarters in a row, and we feel good about the co-brand partnerships that we just announced and launched obviously, two of them.","So look, with the network to report, I guess, next week, we will find out sort of where we are from a share perspective, at least, directionally. And look, you have seen Citi and JPM and U.S. Bank and so forth reports. So you can sort of look at their results and our results and you can make your own assertion of just where it may be coming from.","Craig Maurer","All right. Thank you.","Steve Squeri","Okay. So anyway, thank you everybody for participating today, and let me just give a couple of closing thoughts. Hopefully, what you have seen as a globally integrated payments company here, our business model and we hope that the commentary did this today, does set us apart from the card issuing and merchant acquiring competitors. I think Saks is a really great example of just what we can do, with relationships on both parts. It's different in the networks and it's certainly different in the pure Fintechs, which really don't have either relationships, the brand or the scale to do some of the things that we have been doing.","We operate, we believe in an industry that has a long runway for growth, and we think that differentiated business model that we had, will provide us with many ways to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.","We feel good about the results we have generated, by focusing on the four strategic imperatives that Jeff and I discussed, not only in our prepared remarks, but certainly through the questions. And again, just once again, thanks for all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in American Express.","Edmund Reese","With that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you, Jeff and Steve, and thank you to those of you on the phone. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions. Operator, back to you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T executive teleconference service.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Toby Willard. Please go ahead, sir.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Kerry. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the Company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks, Toby and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be here to recap the strong finish we had to our two-year game plan and to lay out our expectations for 2018. Let me start with 2017.","As you can see in this afternoon\u2019s earnings release, like all U.S. companies, our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results reflect some onetime impacts stemming from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted for the impact of the Tax Act, which I will come back to in a minute, we earned $1.58 in the fourth quarter and $5.87 for the full year, in line with the increased guidance we gave at the end of Q3 when we said we expected to earn between $5.80 and $5.90 for the year. Just as important as these EPS outcomes was the strong momentum we continued to see in the business, with success executing against each of the three priorities we set out in our game plan at the beginning of 2016, accelerating revenue growth; optimizing our investments; and resetting our cost base. In fact, billings and revenue growth reached multiyear highs in Q4 2017. And we are particularly pleased with the diversity of the drivers of our growth and the linkage between the many changes and investments we have made over the last couple of years and where we now see growth. So, we end 2017 with momentum and close out the two-year game plan period having surpassed the financial objectives that we laid out in early 2016.","We now start a new chapter in 2018, and of course, starting in February, we will have a new CEO. We are all fortunate to have worked with an incredible leader in Ken Chenault, who has done a remarkable job over his 37 years with the Company. As we now turn the page to Steve Squeri, I would echo what Ken said in his comments in our earnings release, the Company is in very strong hands going forward with our new CEO.","As we move ahead in 2018, we will be focused on the four key priorities that Steve laid out on last quarter\u2019s call, strengthening our leadership in the premium consumer segment; extending our leadership in commercial payments and in particular with small and medium-sized enterprises; playing an even bigger role in the digital lives of our customers; and strengthening our global integrated network to provide unique value.","Now, of course, beyond these core focus areas of business growth, 2018 will also benefit from a lower corporate tax rate, which I will come back to in discussing our 2018 guidance as we wrap up the call.","With that, let me turn to the results, starting on slide two, where you see revenues in Q4 of $8.8 billion, growing at 9% adjusted for FX, reflecting accelerated growth in billings and continued strong growth in loans and fees. Net income and EPS for the quarter were both impacted by the passage of the Tax Act. And as I mentioned a moment ago, to provide a bit more detail, we recognized the Tax Act impact in the quarter of $2.6 billion, which is primarily composed of two pieces. First, given the global nature of our business, we recognized approximately $2 billion of taxes on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings; and second, we recognized a roughly $600 million charge related to the remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax assets to the lower rate of 21%. This $2.6 billion represents our current estimate, which is slightly higher than the estimate we previously disclosed.","We will continue to evaluate the implications of the Tax Act as guidance and interpretations evolve. The $2.6 billion and tax-related charges caused us to report a quarterly loss on a GAAP basis. Excluding this amount, adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.4 billion and earnings per share for Q4 was a $1.58, in line with our expectations.","Turning briefly to the full year results. Revenue of $33.5 billion for the year was up 4%. Adjusted revenue growth accelerated steadily through the year, starting at 7% in Q1 and ending at 9% in Q4. Our reported growth rate for the full year of course includes in the comparison two quarters of revenue related to the Costco relationship in the prior year. As you can see on the right side of slide two, full year earnings per share adjusted for the tax charges is $5.87.","Moving now to our metrics, starting with billed business performance trends, which you see several views of, on slides three through five. Before we get into the details, I would quickly point out that reported billings growth was 11% in the quarter, our first double-digit billings growth quarter in some time. This is partly due to the dollar weakening year-over-year versus the major currencies we operate in overseas but also reflects strong underlying growth. What you see on slide three is billings accelerated to 9% in the fourth quarter on an FX adjusted basis.","Looking at the segment view on slide four, it is clear that we have strong momentum across our segments. And in the quarter, we saw acceleration in each segment from the Q3 growth rate which further illustrates the diversity of the drivers of our growth.","Digging into this a bit deeper, on slide five, you see a view of billings growth that brings together several ways we have talked about our broad ranging growth opportunities. Our global commercial and global consumer segments were roughly the same size, representing 40% and 43% of billings respectively. Global network services makes up the remaining 17% of billings.","Represented by the first three columns of the chart, our global commercial segment includes our small and midsized enterprise customers or SMEs as well as our large and global corporate customers. As a reminder, SMEs represent one of our highest growth areas, and you see that again this quarter with U.S. SME billings growing at 9% and international SME billings accelerating to 20% on an FX adjusted basis. The large and global customer segment grew 6% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter, up a bit sequentially from last quarter. And I would note that we also saw some sequential improvement in the overall T&E billings growth rate this quarter.","Moving to U.S. consumer which makes up 31% of the Company\u2019s billings. We see 8% growth in the quarter and we are pleased by the acceleration and growth from Q3. International proprietary consumer continues to perform particularly strong with growth of 14% on an FX adjusted basis. Once again, we see robust proprietary growth in markets such as the UK, up 19%; Japan and Australia, up 16% each; and Mexico, up 13% on FX adjusted basis. And finally, our network business is up 6% on an FX adjusted basis.","As we said before, evolving regulations in Europe and Australia are driving declining network volumes in these geographies. And as a result, we expect our proprietary international billings growth to continue to outpace our network partner billings, which you see again in this quarter\u2019s results. Overall, we are pleased with the billings growth we see across our business segments and geographies.","Turning next to loan performance on slide six. Our growth in total loans was 14% and adjusted for FX, total loans grew at 13% in Q4, as we continue to penetrate the lending opportunity with our existing customers and add new customers. On the right, you can see that net interest yield began to stabilize sequentially in the fourth quarter at 10.5% as we have been expecting for some time. Our results in the quarter however are still benefiting from the growth in yield over the prior year, which is a result of the ongoing mix shift of revolving loans towards higher rate buckets and pricing actions we have taken.","Turning next to credit metrics on slide seven where we see the write-off rates for our various portfolios. Starting with the lending portfolio on the left, the loss rate for the quarter was 1.8%, in line with the third quarter and up modestly from the prior year. As we\u2019ve said in the past, we do expect lending write-off rates to continue to increase in large part due to growth in non-cobrand lending products, which have higher loss rates as well as seasoning of the portfolio. On the right side, you can see loss rates in our charge portfolio, as well as the global corporate payments loss ratio. With both, we see relatively stable performance, which we believe reflects the quality of our customer base and a stable economic environment.","Moving to slide eight. Provision expense for the quarter was $833 million, up 33%. The growth in provision this quarter is in line with what we saw year-to-date through the third quarter and our comment on last quarter\u2019s earnings call. We continue to build reserves to account for loan growth seasoning and the mix shift over time away from cobrand products. As we\u2019ve said before, we see attractive opportunities to continue to grow lending across multiple fronts. Our absolute growth in net interest income well exceeds the growth in provision, and net interest income remains just 20% of our total revenues.","Turning now to our revenue performance on slide nine. FX adjusted revenue accelerated to 9%. As you look at the adjusted revenue growth trend over the last several quarters, you can very clearly see our success in capturing the growth opportunities we\u2019ve highlighted over the last couple of years. While not on this slide, I would also point out that if you look at our segment results, the highest revenue growth is in our U.S. consumer segment at 13% for the quarter. This demonstrates our ability to grow even in the competitive U.S. consumer segment.","Looking to the components of revenue on slide 10. We have healthy growth across all the lines. Discount revenue was up 8%, driven by the strong growth in billed business. Net card fees growth was 8%, driven by strong performance in the Platinum and Delta portfolios and growth in key international markets. Other fees and commissions grew 17% and 12% on an FX adjusted basis. The weaker dollar had a larger impact on this line. And other revenues declined 13% in the quarter though primarily driven by prior year revenue from a small business that we sold in Q4 last year. Net interest income was up 23%, driven by the higher net interest yield and loan growth that I spoke about a few minutes ago. ","So, turning now to slide 11 we\u2019ll look discount rate. The discount rate in the second half of 2017 was 2.41%, down 5 basis points from the prior year. So, ratio of discount revenue to billed business was 1.75%, down 4 basis points from last year. These changes within the range of our expectations, which we shared with you at our last Investor Day and which are shown on the right side of slide 11.","As we turn to 2018, you may recall that on our Investor Day in March of last year, we expected a decline in the discount rate in 2018 of 2 to 3 basis points. As we look ahead now, we expect a larger year-over-year decline in 2018. This stems from the stronger growth we are seeing in places around the world with lower discount rates and also from decisions we have made about how best to grow our overall economics with some of our larger partners. Both of these factors are actually part of what will continue to drive the Company\u2019s overall revenue growth.","Turning now to expenses on slide 12. I\u2019ll review marketing and promotion, rewards and card member services expenses as part of our card member engagement discussion on the next page. But first, let me cover operating expenses. Total operating expenses were down 2% from the prior year, as we continue to see the benefit of our cost reduction efforts.","Let me pause here and make some final comments on our $1 billion cost reduction exercise. When we started this program in early 2016, we laid out specific plans to drive cost savings. And I am pleased to report that we have successfully executed on these plans. We have driven savings through headcount reductions, vendor negotiations, process changes, expense policy changes and many other initiatives. Throughout the year, as our business performance started to outpace our own plans, we took the opportunity to use some of these savings to selectively reinvest in the business, including in particular some incremental spending on sales force and technology which are part of our operating expenses. I would also point that in fourth quarter, we made an incremental contribution to our employee profit-sharing program of a little bit more than a $100 million related in part to our overall tax position in light of the new tax law and also the strong performance of the Company.","In general, we feel good about our operating expense control efforts and we believe we are well-positioned to manage operating expense growth going forward.","Moving to slide 13 and Card Member engagement spending. In the fourth quarter, total expense was $3.3 billion, flat versus the prior year. However, it\u2019s clear that we have made tradeoffs between the components of the spending.","M&P was down 28% versus the prior year, partially due to significant investments we made in the second half of 2016 as well as a continued focus on creating more marketing efficiencies. Despite significantly lower spending, we added 2.5 million new proprietary cards globally in the fourth quarter, 1,000 more new cards than a year ago.","Rewards expense growth in the quarter was 12%, just slightly above the 11% growth in proprietary billings as we lapped changes to the U.S. Platinum value propositions at the end of 2016. We continue to be pleased with our Platinum product performance in the U.S. and around the globe. In the U.S., we finished 2017 with our highest ever number of Platinum members and record levels of spend.","Cost of Card Member services increased 39%, reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and cobrand benefits such as first bag free on Delta as well as usage of the new Uber benefit on Platinum. This remains an area where we offer differentiated benefits and where we plan to continue to invest.","Let me turn now to capital on slide 14. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve steadily returned capital to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs which continued through the fourth quarter as we returned $1.6 billion of capital. For the year, while we returned a 190% of the capital we generated, adjusted for the Tax Act impact, our payout ratio would have been about 100%.","Due to the Tax Act impact, of course, we ended the quarter with a net loss. The net loss combined with growth in the balance sheet and continued capital returns in Q4, resulted in a decline in our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.0%. For perspective, adjusted for the Tax Act impact, our common equity Tier 1 ratio would have been approximately 200 basis points higher.","So, our capital ratios are now below the level we had projected in the 2017 CCAR process. And as a result, we do not plan to use our remaining 2017 CCAR buyback authorization for the first half 2018. So, there will be no change to our dividends. The suspension of share buybacks will substantially rebuild our capital levels and ratios and better position us for the 2018 CCAR process.","Over the next few months, as we develop our 2018 CCAR submission, our goal will be to get back on our trajectory towards capital ratios consistent with our plans prior to tax reform while supporting balance sheet growth in the business. Of course, most importantly, for the long-term, the new tax law does significantly lower our tax rate going forward, which increases the capital generating power of the business. Given the lower tax rate, we expect that over time, we will more than make up for any reductions in the buyback in 2018 and generate more earnings and return more capital than we would have without tax reform.","And so, in summary, 2017 was a very strong year for the Company. We have come a long ways since early 2016, when we set the objective of delivering at least $5.60 of EPS for 2017. We exceeded that EPS goal on an adjusted basis, invested back into the business, and we believe we are set up well to grow as we go forward. Our strong 2017 performance sets the foundation for our 2018 expectations as we introduce a 2018 EPS guidance range of $6.90 to $7.30. The outlook is based on the current economic and regulatory climate.","Let me provide a little perspective on the drivers behind our expectations, which are summarized in slide 15. Starting with revenue growth. We expect continued strong momentum in our billings and loans metrics as we capture the diverse growth opportunities we see across our customer segment. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect the discount rates to decline, but to also see continued momentum in other areas like card fee growth. As we look at all the moving pieces, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 7% to 8%.","Another important driver to consider for 2018 is our expanded agreements with two important cobrand partners Hilton and Marriott. We are excited about these partnerships and the platform for growth they give us over the next several years. Looking specifically at 2018, the purchase of the existing Citi\/Hilton loan portfolio in the first quarter is expected to drive a little less than 100 basis points of revenue growth for the year. Incremental revenue from other new products we will be introducing, however, will phase in more gradually in future years.","As you would expect, in today\u2019s competitive cobrand environment, the margins are lower on these partnerships, starting in January. And as a result, we expect to the overall impact of these renewals to reduce 2018 pretax earnings by more than $200 million versus 2017. To be very clear, these agreements generate attractive economics under the new terms, even though the margins are lower than before. And over the long run, we are excited about the opportunity to grow the portfolios and drive ongoing benefits for our customers, our partners and our shareholders.","Next, let me talk a little about lending, building on the comments I made earlier. We expect the dynamic in 2018 to remain pretty consistent with 2017. Our loan growth is expected to exceed the industry as we continue to focus on increasing our share of lending, particularly with existing customers. Net interest yield has started to stabilize but is expected to still contribute to growth versus prior year. Lending write-off rates and delinquencies are expected to continue to increase, but we believe we will remain below the industry average. These dynamics together should again drive strong growth in net interest income as well as growth in provision for loss similar to the growth rate in 2017. And as a result, we again expect significant growth in the economics of the loan portfolio.","Finally, as we thought about our overall tax position and the implications of the new Tax Act, we certainly broadly believe the new tax law is positive for the U.S. economy and in turn for American Express. We have reached a series of conclusions and decisions around this. First, while we are still evaluating recently released interpretations of the new tax law, we expect an effective tax rate for 2018 of approximately 22% before discrete items. Second, as I mentioned, we decided to suspend our share repurchase program for the first two quarters in 2018, but we will continue dividend payments. Third, as we thought about our overall tax position and how to manage the impact from a Tax Act, we focused on three key constituents.","First, employees. So, considering our tax situation as well as strong Company performance as I previously stated, we chose to support the long-term wellbeing of our employees by making it incremental contribution to our employee profit sharing programs, which in most cases go directly to employees\u2019 retirement accounts. Second, customers. So, consistent with our long history of balancing short, medium and long-term objectives, we now plan to invest up to $200 million more in customer-facing growth initiatives in 2018 than we had originally planned prior to the passage of tax. And finally, shareholders. As the remaining tax benefits, we\u2019ll build capital and support earnings growth in 2018. All of these lead us to an earnings per share range of $6.90 to $7.30. Of course, there remains a lot of work to do in 2018 to deliver in this range, but our focus is to deliver against the plans we have set.","Stepping back, before we move on to your questions, we are starting 2018 from a position of strength with the tremendous set of customers, strong momentum across our integrated payments model and opportunities to capture growth in many different parts of our business. At our Investor Day in early March, we look forward to providing more insight into our growth opportunities.","And with that, let me turn it back over to Toby.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I\u2019ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question. Thanks for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Kerry?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first, we go to line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.","Don Fandetti","Hi, Jeff. On the discount rate, as you look sort of further out, has the kind of base case of down 2 or 3 bps changed to where it\u2019s structurally higher or is 2018 just kind of based on some moves you\u2019ve made?","Jeff Campbell","Well, good question, Don. I guess, I\u2019d make a couple of comments. First, I think it\u2019s important to remember, the end objective here is to drive revenue growth. And we feel really good about the acceleration in revenue growth that we have achieved over the last two years and the fourth quarter results of 9%, the highest we\u2019ve shown in many years. And we did that with some significant declines in the discount rate above that historical 2% to 3% range.","Now, why did that happen? Well, because we are very consciously making some decisions that we think drive more revenue growth but also have the impact of bringing that discount rate down. So, the decisions we\u2019re making around expanding coverage in the U.S. through the OptBlue program and some similar programs around the globe, some decisions we have made about how to best gain overall economics with some of our larger partners that had a positive impact on revenue and a more challenging impact on the discount rate, and of course regulation in certain places around the globe such as Australia, are doing some things to drive the discount rates down but also creating some opportunities for the kind of growth in our proprietary business that I talked about in my prepared remarks, in Australia and the UK for example which are both in the high teens.","So, some of those things will clearly pay over time. The OptBlue program in the U.S. will begin to wind down as we get into 2019, and that pressure we\u2019ll receive. The impact of regulation in Australia and Europe which we\u2019ve been going through for -- in the case of Europe, a couple of years now; in the case of Australia, really just began again in July last year, those will fade a little bit over time. But, our objective is going to remain what can we do to drive the most revenue growth and that will have varied implications over time I think to the discount rates.","So, we have line of sight into what we think is going to happen in 2018, both on revenue and we feel about the guidance of 7% to 8%, and on discount rate. Beyond that we will have to see what decisions make sense to drive the best overall economics for the Company.","So, thank you for the question.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Ken Bruce from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Bruce","Hi. Thank you and good evening. My question relates to the guidance. I am hoping you might be willing to unpack the provision growth commentary a little bit, just in terms of what you are expecting in terms of the absolute rise in losses relative to the reserve building. It\u2019s a pretty substantial growth that you are kind of pointing to on the provisions. So, I just want to make sure I understand that.","Jeff Campbell","Yes. I guess, I\u2019ll make a few comments. So, we\u2019ve now been at growing our lending a little bit faster than the industry for quite a number of years. And of course, we have a platform for doing that because we have historically so underpenetrated our own customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors. And so, I think we now have a multiyear track record of achieving above industry growth rates while still getting really good economics. Now, we\u2019ve pointed out for a while that particularly with the shift that began in the third quarter of 2016 to less lending on cobrand products, more lending on proprietary products, those products come with little higher write-off rates and pricing that also is reflective of that risk as well, thereby producing really good economics. Given that\u2019s when we started, we just as you got into the latter part of 2017 are beginning to hit sort of the key seasoning time period in a lot of the new lending that we have taken on and that\u2019s why we have said for almost two years now, we do expect this steady trend upwards in write-off rates and provision. It\u2019s been part of the plan all along. As we look at the great diversity in our lending portfolio, we draw a lot of comfort from the fact that other parts of our portfolio, the cobrand portfolio, some of the lending we do on our charge products or our lending on charge products, you see very little change in the write-off rates. So, what you see when you\u2019re looking at the average is that mix shift to more proprietary lending and the seasoning effect of the fact that we began an earnest to make that mix shift as you got into 2016.","So all of that will lead you in 2018 to continued really good strong growth in net interest income. Now, we\u2019ll come with the same kind of growth in provisions that you saw in 2018 and the combination of those two should continue to produce really good economics for us. So, I guess, I\u2019d like to leave it at that Ken as opposed to also trying to provide a write-off metric. But, we feel good about where we are and we feel good about the continued growth opportunities ahead of us in this area for many years.","Operator","And now to line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Jeff, I wonder if we could talk a little bit about some of the customer-facing initiatives that you\u2019re planning on using some of the tax windfall for the 200 million that you referenced in the press release and talked a little bit about. Be interested in understanding corporate customer-facing initiatives versus consumer and perhaps, you could give us a sense as to whether this is pulling forward what you already have been planning or is there something plus something new here that you\u2019re considering with this 200 million?","Jeff Campbell","Yes. All good questions, Betsy. Let me make a few comments. First, one of the luxuries, I suppose, of the diversity of the growth opportunities we have is that our constraint as a company on the levels of customer-facing growth investing we do each year is really not that we run out of opportunities with very attractive long-term economics, but more that we do manage the Company for a mixture of short, medium and long-term objectives. We believe, it\u2019s really important as a company and for our shareholders to show steady earnings growth every year. And so, when you look at the opportunities we have to invest for growth, generally in any given year, there are a variety of unfunded initiatives with good economics that we choose not to pursue, because doing so in the short run would not allow us to meet our financial objectives.","That\u2019s why, if you think about the history of our Company over many years, that\u2019s why when we have from time-to-time have some kind of sudden financial windfall, upside, better than expected performance. We often put a little bit of that into our shareholders\u2019 pocket and we put a little bit to work funding some of these initiatives that we can\u2019t necessarily get to in the normal course of business. So that\u2019s really the context in which you should think about our decision once the Tax Act passed, to go ahead and increase in 2018 our customer facing growth investing by up to $200 million.","And if you think about where those next best previously unfunded opportunities are, they are probably where you would expect it. So, if you look at our consumer business, I did point out in my remarks that the highest revenue growth segment in 2017 was the U.S. consumer segment. And so, even in the face of how competitive the U.S. consumer segment is, there are some really good results we\u2019re generating and some good opportunities we still have. When you look at the kind of growth we have with small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly outside the U.S. where we had 20% growth in billings in Q4 and you\u2019ve been in the teens for a number of years now, there are tremendous opportunities to continue to accelerate our growth. So, those are the kinds of things that you will see us with the last incremental dollar of investment likely pursue. But I think the broader and important point here is, we always tend to have a pool of rally good opportunities left unfunded. And what we felt was the right balance here was the majority of the Tax Act benefits fall through to the bottom line in 2018, but to take a portion and put it for work for the longer term.","Operator","All right, thank you. And now to the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Craig Maurer","Yes. Hi, Jeff. Thank you. So, I just want to confirm one that you are guiding toward 36% year-on-year growth in the provision for 2018. And secondly, Platinum, the changes you\u2019ve made to Platinum obviously spurred some very aggressive growth and that\u2019s good to see. Are you seeing any tail-offs in that momentum going into 2018, or should we expect another very strong year for Platinum growth? And have you seen any reactions from competitors to the more experiential benefits you put on that card?","Jeff Campbell","Taking notes, Craig, to make sure I get all your questions.","Craig Maurer","Sorry. I\u2019ve taken advantage.","Jeff Campbell","On provision, look, I\u2019m not trying to be quite as precise maybe as you were in the way you\u2019ve phrased the question. But, our point is we expect continued really strong growth in loans and continued -- you\u2019ll still have some benefits from net interest yields, so that\u2019s going to drive really good net interest income growth. And yes that will come with provision growth on a percentage basis that is somewhere in the vicinity of what you saw for calendar 2017. You look through all that map and it will produce really nice overall economics for us.","Platinum, we are pretty pleased by. So, if you think about the Q4 results, with the highest revenue growth we\u2019ve seen in quite some time, well, fourth quarter was actually when we already began to lap the Platinum changes. That\u2019s actually why if you do the math of the rewards to billings ratio, while for the last four quarters you\u2019ve seen rewards going faster than billings, that\u2019s because of the Platinum changes. This quarter, it came back down to a much more normalized level where rewards were more consistent with billings. So, the fact that you continue to see strong performance in Platinum, the fact that you did not see any drop off in revenue growth, we feel really good about. And to end 2017 despite all the competition that you absolutely do see in the U.S. with a record level of Platinum members in the U.S., with record levels of spending and with our fee increase fully hitting customers now for some time, I think it is a tremendously strong confirmation of the differentiated value proposition we offer of the value of some of the experiential benefits and the fact that we have the courage because we believe in them to price for those benefits and that value proposition. And we think we as a result are going into 2018 with great moment around this product.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Since the starting point for the stress test is the December 31st balance sheet date, some investors are asking whether your relatively low CET1 starting point of 9% could also hurt your ask in the next -- in the 2018 CCAR cycle. Could you speak to that?","Jeff Campbell","Yes. Good question, Bill. I think, the really important thing to think about here is we run the Company for the long-term. And in the long-term, the lower tax rate is going to produce much higher earnings, much higher capital generation and therefore much higher capital returns than otherwise. In the long run, we need to get back to whatever the, as fed regulatory environment involves, whatever the appropriate steady state capital ratio is at any given point in time. So, the only question given the $2.6 billion charge we took is how quickly or in what pattern you get back to that steady state capital level. And so, we could have continued to repurchase shares in the first half of 2018 and then what you would have seen is a lower result as we go through the CCAR 2018 process. Our decision, which we feel very confident in, was no, look, let\u2019s just very quickly rebuild the capital that of course will be built into the CCAR 2018 process. So, this will we think produce in fact a much stronger CCAR 2018 result than if we chose to spread out a reduction in our share repurchases. And look, we\u2019ll have to see how the fed\u2019s thinking evolves because we\u2019re not the only CCAR participant in this situation. We will have to see how the rating agency thinking evolves. Although we\u2019ve begun those conversations as you would expect today and we are going fine.","And I just want to end with the emphasis to people that we have a strong track record of being aggressive about returns of capital. We are going to produce more capital in the next couple of years than we otherwise would have that\u2019s going to drive bigger capital returns. We think the best way to get at that is to take a small pause and to do it at a time when if you think about our guidance, it\u2019s producing year-over-year EPS growth somewhere depending on how you want to do the math in the 20% plus range. So, we feel good about all those tradeoffs.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","So, maybe focusing on the revenue side of maybe where the benefits might reside from tax reform. I guess, when we look at your guidance range, are you expecting any benefit as it relates to the macro, given the tax reform benefits to consumers and corporations? And I guess, when you talk to your customers, at least on the corporate side, is there an expectation that they\u2019d invest some more towards expenses? And then, I guess, when we think about the return that you\u2019re generating and the fact that your competitors also get this benefit, are you making any assumption that some of the upside gets competed away?","Jeff Campbell","Okay. I\u2019m also taking notes\u2026","Sanjay Sakhrani","I\u2019m sorry.","Jeff Campbell","That\u2019s okay. So, a couple of comments. I think the reality of the way we do our planning process Sanjay is, as you know, we don\u2019t try to be macro economic forecasters. But there is also a little bit of lag. So, we sort of built our plan over the last few months based on a view of the economy probably as it existed prior to the passage of the tax bill. So, mechanically, the reality is, we have not built into our plan any expectation that there is a stronger economy in the U.S. or anywhere else in the world for that matter than what people thought prior to the passage of tax reform.","So to the extent that tax reform does help the economy and we certainly believe along the long run. What that means for 2018 is probably a little secure, that will clearly be a good thing for us. And look, we ended Q4, I will say, with a little bit more momentum on the revenue side than we probably had originally anticipated. So, I think all of that bodes pretty well. I also think, it is interesting to look at -- and one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but it is interesting, if you look at our large, global corporate customers, that\u2019s a segment that for some time -- now, we\u2019ve pointed out is not a growth segment. Most corporations like us are trying to control T&E spending because this is more T&E oriented. But actually, it grew 6% this quarter, which is the highest growth rate we\u2019ve had in a while. And if you dig through the tables, you see -- in our earnings release, you\u2019ll see that for the company T&E spending sequentially strengthened a little bit. And that as I said a quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but it\u2019s an interesting data point, if you think about a little bit more confidence in the economy and a little bit more of plan to spend.","So, it\u2019s upside to extent the economy strengthens, because of the Tax Act, and we\u2019ll have to see what happens. In terms of the competitive environment, I guess, look, I can speak for our view, Sanjay, which is we have looked at the implications of the Tax Act and we said we should do something for employers, which we did. We have to reset our baseline by choosing to invest up to $200 million more in customer-facing growth initiatives this year and we\u2019ve given you clear EPS guidance for 2018. We have to now show you off that 2018 performance that as we get into 2019 and beyond, we can produce the same kind of steady EPS growth that the Company has historically been known for and that\u2019s what we\u2019re very focused on. And that means we are not at all looking to do anything other than use the lower tax rate to produce 2018 performance, a steady growth thereafter.","I talked a little bit actually in response to other questions earlier about the reality for us that we always have a pool of unfunded things that are good opportunities for us to invest in but we don\u2019t. So having a little bit lower tax rate in all those models doesn\u2019t actually cause us Sanjay to think differently or to invest more, because we\u2019re still focused on short versus long-term. We\u2019re focused on producing steady earnings growth.","So, look, we\u2019ll have to see where the environment goes. I will tell you today, we feel really good about the value propositions we have in the marketplace on the consumer side, on the corporate side, in the U.S., outside the U.S. As I think for that reason about the rewards to billing ratio with some of the folks on the phone who look at as a little bit of an indicator of the competitive environment, I will tell you that my expectation sitting here today for 2018 is that ratio is actually pretty flat to 2017 because I feel good about our value propositions, they\u2019re performing really well, and we\u2019re trying to do the best we can for shareholders. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on and that\u2019s how we think about it, Sanjay. Thank you for the question.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Chris Donat from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat","Hi. Good afternoon, Jeff. Chris Donat here. One other question on the $200 million or upto $200 million of customer-facing spending. I\u2019m just wondering what sort of timing you might expect for that, will you frontend load it or kind of have it evenly over the year? And are you factoring in what competitors may or may not do? Will that affect how much you spend if they\u2019re aggressive on things like promotion and\u2026","Jeff Campbell","So, good question. Couple of things to put this in perspective. So, our total marketing and promotional spending was over $3 billion last year. Our total spending on rewards was probably over $7 billion. And then, you\u2019ve got bunch of money we spent on card member services. So, look, $200 million I\u2019m choosing to call out, because as you think about the EPS guidance range we\u2019ve given and certainly had an impact on that EPS guidance range because this was at the margins and decisions we made at the end. And we didn\u2019t have to make it, and we could have given you a little higher EPS guidance range. On the other hand, in the context of all the customer-facing spending that we\u2019re doing on an ongoing basis and plan to do in 2018, it\u2019s a very small number and a very small increment. And that\u2019s why we would anticipate that as this spreads throughout the year, it is based on our current understanding of the competitive environment and how our value propositions play. And I don\u2019t see it as changing anything about our value propositions; I do want to come back to that, or changing anything about the level of incentives we need to put into the marketplace to attract any particular customer set. This is about there are incremental things we can do to garner more growth that we weren\u2019t previously doing. And that\u2019s really what you will see us targeted at.","Operator","Thank you. And now, to line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Hey, great, thanks. Jeff, with respect to the tax side of things, I mean, the actual DTA write-down was smaller I guess than we had thought. But in aggregate, obviously, still a pretty big number. It feels like that\u2019s going to take bunch of years for that tax benefit to be recovered. So, kind of coming at the capital kind of question, a slightly different way, I mean, how should we think about what to expect post 2017 CCAR as you go into 2018, and I guess also recognizing that loan growth that you\u2019ve put on in the last year probably has higher stressed losses as well? So, may be kind of walk through that.","Jeff Campbell","So, a couple of comments I think I\u2019d make. So, when you think about our $2.6 billion charge, you\u2019re correct, the smaller piece is the $600 million piece which is the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset. And as you think about that number going forward, for us, we\u2019re a pretty simple monoline business financially. And so, our net deferred tax position doesn\u2019t change that much from year-to-year, and it actually changes out pretty quickly, it\u2019s mostly driven by things like provision timing and membership rewards. So, there\u2019s not long, multiyear, complicated investments or business impacts on that. So, other than the revaluation, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to have any different impact on our regulatory capital calculations going forward than others.","On the deemed repatriations, as everyone knows, one of the in some ways ironies there is you pay out that amount over eight years. And in fact, if you dig into the details, you\u2019ll see that the actual payment of the cash is backend loaded. And yes, from a regulatory capital perspective, we have to book it all upfront and that\u2019s why you have the big hit to regulatory capital upfront in those and actually no cash impact for a while.","So, I think that we will use the two-quarter stoppage of the share repurchase program to very quickly get our capital ratios back into a range that all of the rating agencies, the regulators and we are comfortable with. And I think we will very quickly get on to the positive side of the one-time charge that we in return for a much lower tax rate going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash","Hey. Good evening, Jeff. I just wanted to ask two quick questions. First, I wanted to bring to you some of the things that you talked about, Jeff. In terms of the EPS guidance, can you talk about what the two or three biggest swing factors would be that would get you from the top end of the range to the bottom end of the range, just given that the 7% does seem like the range that\u2019s wider than you\u2019ve historically given? And then, just on the renewals, the $200 million pretax impact, is that just a true-up from renewing the contracts and then that goes back down or is there another step-up beyond 2018? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well, let me take those maybe in reverse order. So, on Marriott and Hilton, the way I would describe this is, as you commonly see in these larger cobrands where you have very long-term agreements, as they are renewed, there tends to be a step down in economics and we work over the course of the subsequent five, seven, eight years to really rebuild the economics. You\u2019ve seen that pattern several times with Delta, you\u2019ve seen it with some of the hotel partners before. And to be very clear, as I said in my remarks, you still have very attractive economics for us but not as attractive as they generally are in the very last year, what was the prior contract. There is no further step-up. So, over $200 million impact to PTI in 2018 is one of the hurdles that we have to overcome as we think about our EPS growth in 2018; it goes away in 2019. Just like our decision do a little bit of incremental investing, because of the Tax Act, it\u2019s really a one-time resetting of the baseline, and I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that same kind of increase in 2019 or beyond. That\u2019s a little bit on Marriott and Hilton.","On the EPS guidance. In many ways, I think, I would go back a little bit to Sanjay\u2019s question, which is, when you look at our performance in 2017, the plan we have articulated for you this evening is really one, which is just a continuation of the momentum that we have today with the lower tax rate put on it and the impact of Marriott and Hilton, and the decision to step-up investment a little bit. So, the plan doesn\u2019t assume any particular greater strength in the economy. The plan does not necessarily assume a quicker take-up on some of the new and innovative things that we continue to do both in our proprietary product lines, as well as with cobrand partners like Delta or Marriott or Hilton.","So, those are the kinds of things that I think could cause you to do a little bit better. I think the main thing that I worry about in terms of anything that could put you more towards the lower end are really the standard external factors. So, if you see a blip in the economy or if you see some sudden regulatory change in some major market for us, which I particularly have any line of sight into today, but it\u2019s those kinds of external factors that I would worry about, that would drive you more towards the lower end. I think other than that, as I said, the guidance we\u2019ve given you is just a continuation of the performance. But, you should have confidence and based on what we\u2019ve seen recently and if we get a little stronger economy and\/or some of the new things we\u2019re doing take off a little quicker, that will really help us to get to the upside.","Operator","And now to line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ashish Sabadra","Hi. This is Ashish Sabadra. Thanks, Jeff. And my question was about NIM, you talked about NIM stabilizing. I was just wondering, how do you think about the loan yields going forward with the rate hikes? And then, also, if you could comment on the deposit betas. Have you seen anything on the competitive environment there with the deposit rates?","Jeff Campbell","So, I think, as we think about net interest yield, we have had a pretty good run over the last five or six quarters as we have evolved a little bit, our mix of customers, as we have taken some thoughtful pricing actions where we could, and as interest rates have edged up a little bit while the portion of our funding stack that comes from our personal savings program was acting with the beta of about 0.3. So, all of those things have given us a really nice sequential run.","What I said in my remarks is as you think about 2018 I think our ability to sequentially keep growing the net interest yield is probably about at a plateau. Although, if you look at full year 2018 results, there will still be some year-over-year growth, because what I\u2019m telling you is we\u2019re plateauing kind of at Q4 levels. And in fact, the first part of 2017 was below that if you do a little bit of seasonal adjusting. So that\u2019s how I think about net interest yield.","If you look at deposit betas, so fed\u2019s now done five rate hikes; if you look at our personal savings program, our beta to date, if you will, is about 0.35. As we have for a while for forward planning purposes, we assume a beta of 0.7, based on a lot of history. Certainly, I hope that is a very conservative assumption. And in general, we are trying to make sure we provide good returns for our accountholders but just competitive returns. And we\u2019re comfortable with the balances we have and with our ability to attract new balances. So, we\u2019ll have to see where that goes. As you know, if that data flips all the way up to 1, then interest rates start to be, as they go up, a headwind for the Company because of our charge card portfolio. If we can keep the beta a little bit below the 0.7 level, then interest rates going up ceases to be much of a headwind, and of course, the betas that we\u2019d had thus far is mostly a tailwind. So we\u2019ll have to see where all that goes. So, thank you for the question, Ashish.","Toby Willard","Kerry, we have time for just one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And that comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Just had questions around clarifying the guidance little more. I think you exited the year with the revenue growth FX adjusted at 9%. I think you called out an additional 100 basis-point lift from the acquisition of the Hilton related receivables from Citi. But you\u2019re guiding to 7% to 8% for next year. Is it just an inherent conservatism in that or are there some specific headwinds you have in mind? And then, just to clarify the comments around the contributions to profit share. I think you indicated, you made some contributions in December but then talked about it in the context of the 2018 guidance. Is there more coming in 2018 and did you quantify that at all? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","So, two good questions, Mark. First, on revenue, look, we\u2019ve put together a plan, as I said in response to an earlier question, based on the world as it existed over the last few months, not necessarily as it has existed since December 22nd when the tax act passed. So, the only two things that are at some point headwinds -- not headwinds, but start to fade a little bit from the revenue growth that you saw in Q4, two things I\u2019ve talked about for a while, which is net interest yield has I think started to hit a little bit of the plateau. It\u2019s still going to show nice year-over-year growth for the first half or so of 2018, but will probably show less year-over-year growth, as you get into the back half. So, that\u2019s a little bit of a moderation of the revenue growth rate. The second thing you\u2019ve heard me talk about for a while is at some point, the changes we made in the U.S. Platinum products way back in 2016 we\u2019ll be done lapping them. Now, we actually started to lap those in Q4, although not the fee -- increased fee in the consumer Platinum and yet we were still at 9%. So, as you heard me say earlier, look, Q4 probably came in a little stronger than we had anticipated. So, we\u2019ll have to see what all that means. I think our 7% to 8% range that we\u2019re giving you guidance for on 2018 is one we\u2019re very comfortable with that we can very confidently hit. And our job is to see if we can do any better.","On the profit-sharing, let me clarify that. So, if you think about the timing of all this, we -- the decision to top up our profit-sharing is one we made in the days after passage of the Tax Act as we thought about the overall economics of the Company going forward and over the long-term, as we thought about the strength of our 2017 results and as we thought about doing something very consistent with our view that we\u2019re about the long-term, we\u2019re about the long-term for our shareholders in terms of performance, were about long-term relationships with our customers and we want to be about the long-term wellbeing of our employees. And that\u2019s why we think that doing something that we have not previously done a real top up around the world of retirement-oriented profit-sharing plans is a really good thing to do for the long-term wellbeing of our employees. That is a 2017 Q4 period expense and it would not be an expense in 2018, nor do we expect it to necessarily repeat.","Toby Willard","Great. Thanks, Jeff.

Thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.","Richard Petrino","Thank you, Tom. Welcome and we appreciate everyone joining for today\u2019s discussion. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.","The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s 2011 10-K already on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2013 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior period that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I will start on Slide 2. So the first quarter of 2013, summary of financial performance, so total revenues came in at $7.9 billion for the first quarter of 2013. That\u2019s 4% higher on a reported basis and 5% growth year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. That\u2019s the same FX adjusted revenue growth that we\u2019ve had for the past two quarters.","Pre-tax income came in at $1.9 billion, up 8%. Net income came in at $1.3 billion, up 2%. So net income grew at a slower rate than pre-tax income in the first quarter, because in the first quarter of 2012 it included a tax benefit realized on certain foreign tax credits and we had no such item in the first quarter of 2013.","Diluted EPS was $1.15, up 7%. EPS grew at a faster pace than net income due to share buybacks. As you can see, shares outstanding on the bottom of this chart are 5% lower year-over-year. ROE is 23% for the quarter compared to 27% in the first quarter 2012, and this is due to the three charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2012, which was about $600 million. So the ROE is calculated using net income for the 12 months ended March 31, 2013. Therefore, it includes the fourth quarter of 2012, and that\u2019s divided by average shareholder equity. Excluding those three charges, in the fourth quarter adjusted ROE would have been 26% and you can actually see that calculation in Annex 6 through the slides.","Moving to Slide 3, which is a metric performance. You can see that billed business came in at $224 billion. It grew at 6% on a reported basis, 7% on an FX adjusted basis. So the same FX adjusted growth rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2012, despite the negative impact of having an extra billing day in the first quarter of 2012, because it was a Leap Year.","Cards in force grew at 5%, the same as the fourth quarter. Proprietary cards grew at 2%, which is comparable to the growth rate we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Growth in average basic cardmember spending reflects continued strong cardmember engagement and cardmember loans continued modest growth, growing at 4%.","Moving to Slide 4, so this is billed business growth by segment and as you can see on the chart, total FX adjusted growth, the redline, in the first quarter of 2013 was 7% consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. Each of the business segments is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012 except for GCS, which is Global Corporate Services, that\u2019s the green line, and you can see here that the growth rate for that segment has moved down slightly as T&E spending grew at a slower rate than total billings growth rate in the quarter. Now, 2012 was a Leap Year, so we lost one day of billing year-over-year, which negatively impacts billed business growth rate in the first quarter of this year by about 100 basis points.","Going to Slide 5, this is billed business growth by region. So, you can see that the U.S., which is the dark blue line with the diamonds, grew at 7% consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012. And while each of the other regions had their growth rate slow a bit in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, in aggregate total FX adjusted growth rate of 7% is consistent with last quarter.","Then we have Slide 6, so this is the U.S. consumer managed cardmember loans. The bars are the dollar amount of loans, the light blue line is the U.S. consumer loan growth rate and the new line is the green line, and that\u2019s the U.S. industry revolve growth in each of the quarters. So the 4% growth in loans is driven by growth in billed business. Loans are growing at about half the rate of the growth in billings or lending products.","Our loan growth continues to outpace the industry, as you can see by looking at the green line. So, for example, in the fourth quarter of this year we grew at 4% and the industry growth rate was 1%. The last point they make is that while loans grew 4% year-over-year, loans decreased sequentially on a seasonal basis from the fourth quarter. As you\u2019ll see in a minute, credit performance continues to be excellent.","Slide 7, so this is our revenue performance. Total revenues grew 4%. That\u2019s 5% on an FX adjusted basis. Discount revenue came in at 4%, and this reflects 6% growth in billed business, partially offset by 1 basis point decline in the discount rate and higher cash back rewards.","Net card fees increased 7%, and this is reflective of higher average fees per card, primarily due to fee increases and a greater mix of premium products. Travel, commission and fees decreased 3%, as worldwide sales decreased 3%. Business travel declined 4%, while consumer travel sales increased 2%. Other commissions and fees decreased 2%, and this is the impact of some modest cost of cardmember reimbursement, partially offset by higher Loyalty Partner revenues.","Other revenues is lower by 3%, and this is primarily due to a favorable revision of our liability for uncashed TCs in international markets in the first quarter of 2012, and is partially offset by higher gains on our sale of ICBC shares in the first quarter of 2013.","Net interest income increased 10%, and this is a combination of 3% increase in average cardmember loans, an increase in the worldwide net interest yield to 5.9% from 9.2% a year ago. Now, a portion of this increase is due to the reversal of reserve for cardmember reimbursements that we set up in prior periods and without it, the increase would have been slightly lower. It\u2019s also influenced by a decline in funding cost for our charge card portfolio.","Moving to Slide 8, so this is provision for losses. You can see the total provision for losses increased 21%. Charge card provision increased 10%, primarily driven by higher receivables, which are 5% higher than a year ago.","Cardmember loan provision increased 30% or $63 million, and this reflects a 4% increase in cardmember loans compared to last year. Our reserve release of about $100 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a reserve release of $200 million in the first quarter of 2012, and this has the effect of increasing provision by $100 million, partially offset by approximately $50 million less in write-offs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, due to improved credit performance. This will net to a $63 million increase in the lending provision. So provision is increasing, while credit metrics are stable and you\u2019ll see that over the next several slides.","So Slide 9 is charge card credit performance and if you look at the left charge, this is the U.S. charge write-off rate and this has ticked up and down slightly over the past few quarters, but I view this as stable over the period. On the right side, you see the international consumer and Global Corporate Services net loss ratio and this also has remained stable. Both of these metrics are at historically low levels.","Moving to Slide 10, so this is the lending credit performance. The left side is the net write-off rate and this metric continues to be stable. The right side is the 30 days past due and the same is true here. This metric continues to be very stable. So, these metrics are at historically low levels and represent the best credit metrics in the industry. As I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but to achieve the best economic gain when we invest.","Next is Slide 11; so these are the lending reserve coverage ratios. So each of the metrics, whether it\u2019s reserves as a percentage of loans, reserves as a percentage of past dues, or the principal months coverage, are lower in the first quarter of 2013 compared to last year based on the improved credit metrics, and are trending slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2012 as we continue to sustain historically low credit metrics. Our reserves in these metrics are appropriate for the risks that are inherent in our portfolio.","Slide 12; so this is expense performance. You can see on the bottom right that total expenses grew 1% year-over-year. Marketing and promotion expense decreased 2%, reflecting lower brand advertising, partially offset by higher card acquisition spending. I\u2019ll cover this in more detail in the slide.","Next is cardmember rewards expense and this increased 4%, reflecting higher spending on rewards products, partially offset by slower growth in membership rewards ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. I\u2019ll cover this in more detail on the following slide.","Cardmember services decreased slightly. Total operating expense grew 1%, lower than our target of growing total operating expense less than 3% for the next two years and I have a slide on this later as well. The effective tax rate was 32.9% in the first quarter of 2013. This compares with 29.2% in the first quarter of 2012. So lower tax rate in the prior year includes a tax benefit related to the realization of certain tax credits.","Moving to Slide 13; so this is marketing and promotion expense. So marketing expense in the first quarter of this year was $621 million. That compares to $631 million in the first quarter of 2012. So, down slightly. As you can see from the chart, it\u2019s also down slightly for marketing as a percentage of revenue. So all the way on the right you can see the percentage for the first quarter of this year was 7.9%, and for last year in the first quarter it was 9.3%. But we remain committed to our objective of having marketing and promotion expense to approximate 9% of revenues on an annual basis. While in the first quarter of 2012 this percentage was 8.3%, if you look at the chart on the right, you can see that we increased spending in the second through fourth quarter to achieve our annual objective, and you can see on the left hand chart that 2012 for the full year came in at 9.2%. We continue to invest in our business, despite the slow growth economy.","Slide 14, we\u2019ve cardmember rewards expense. So rewards expense in the first quarter of this year was $1.520 billion. That compares to $1.467 billion in the first quarter of 2012, a 4% increase. So, cardmember rewards expense is a combination of rewards on co-brand products and membership rewards expense. Within membership rewards, it is a combination of expense of points earned in the current period and this is included in the chart along with co-brand expense in the dark blue section of the chart. This section of the bar basically grows with the growth in billed business.","Membership rewards expense also includes expense related to changes in the membership rewards liability for points previously earned. This is the green section of the bar. As you can see this portion of expense in the first quarter of 2013 is lower than the first quarter of 2012, as the increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 was less than the increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2012. The ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 is 94%, the same as it was in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Next slide is Slide 15, operating expense performance. In the quarter, as you can see in the lower right, operating expense increased only 1% versus the prior year as we continue to focus on controlling expenses. Our expense performance is consistent with our aim to have operating expense grow at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years.","Salaries and employee benefits decreased 1%, reflecting a decrease in employee count of 1,100 people compared to the first quarter of 2012. Professional services increased 4%, reflecting increased investments in the business and higher legal fees. Occupancy and equipment increased 8%, driven by higher data processing, costs and software amortization.","Other net decreased 2% and this is resulting from a favorable impact related to hedging of fixed rate exposures versus an expense in the first quarter of 2012. So this is an accounting adjustment we need to record. These hedges are functioning exactly the way we intended, and over the life of the hedge it will move to zero.","Now we go to Slide 16; so this is expense as a percentage of revenue. Now adjusted expense means we\u2019re excluding credit provision. On the left side you can see six years of history, and on the right side you can see the most recent five quarters. The 2010 and 2011 reflect elevated investment levels. In 2012, we committed to migrate this ratio over time back towards historical levels in two ways; first, through revenue growth, and second, our plans to control operating expense, while continuing to invest in the business.","In the bars for 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2012, the dotted line in the bar excludes the restructuring charge and cardmember reimbursements in the fourth quarter of 2012. As you can see on the chart on the right, we are making substantial progress in reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenues.","Moving to Slide 17; so these are capital ratios. In the first quarter of 2013, Tier 1, Tier 1 common and total capital ratios increased due to an increase in capital during the period, primarily driven by capital generation of $1.5 billion. This is a combination of $1.3 billion in net income and $200 million raised from employee plans. Offset by capital distributions of $1.1 billion, and this is $800 million in share repurchases and $300 million in dividends, as well as a decrease in risk-weighted assets mostly due to lower cardmember loans. Tier 1 common capital ratio of 12.6%, provides the company with a strong capital position.","Next is Slide 18; this is the total payout ratio. So, this is the percentage of capital generated through net income returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. On the left hand side, we see the past five years. On the right side, we see the most recent five quarters.","In 2012, we returned $4 billion or 98% to shareholders. Now, the share repurchase in the first quarter of 2013 was governed by our CCAR submission in January of 2012, and so for the quarter we returned 70% of net income. We plan to increase our dividend to $0.23 per share from $0.20 per share next quarter, a 15% increase for shareholders. We are also moving ahead with plans to repurchase common shares that will total up to $3.2 billion to shareholders during remainder of this year to total of $4 billion in 2013 and up to an additional $1 billion in the first quarter of 2014.","Next slide is Slide 19, our liquidity snapshot. Our objective is to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities. As you can see, we have $20.9 billion in excess cash compared to funding maturities of $17 billion for next year, thereby meeting our objective.","Next is Slide 20. So this is our U.S. retail deposit program and it shows you the deposits by type. As you can see on the right, the deposits increased by $1.1 billion in the quarter, with direct deposits increasing by $2.5 billion and you can see that on the left side of the chart. We remain committed to increasing direct deposits over time.","So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. We continue to feel positive about our performance, especially given the slow growth economic environment. In the quarter, spend growth continue to be healthy and was relatively consistent with the past several quarters, despite the negative impact of having an extra billing day in the first quarter 2012 because of Leap Year. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpace the industry.","Moderate loan growth and slightly higher net yields led to a 10% increase in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates remained near all-time lows. Revenue growth was 5% on an FX adjusted basis, consistent with last quarter. This reflects the sluggish economic environment and the negative impact of having one less day in the quarter versus the prior year.","In the quarter, operating expense increased only 1% versus the prior year, as we continue to focus on controlling expenses. Our expense performance is consistent with our aim to have operating expense growth at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years. We\u2019re also continuing to invest in the business, and expect full year marketing and promotion expense to be approximately 9% of total revenues, in line with our historical average. EPS growth of 7% outpaced revenue growth, reflecting the progress we have made on controlling operating expense and our strong capital position. We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks while maintaining strong capital ratios.","The results of the recent Fed stress test underscore our capital strength and our ability to remain profitable even under severe stress assumptions. Risk flow in capital position provides flexibility, we are planning to afford 15% increase in our dividend during the second quarter and allow us to balance the capital needs of our business with the potential for significant share buybacks.","We recognized that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to shareholders even in an extended slow growth environment.","Thanks for listening and I\u2019m now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Ryan Nash representing Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. ","Hi, thanks, hi Dan. When you think about your outlook for revenue growth that came in about 5% on FX-adjusted basis quarter below when you\u2019re factoring the FX. So if you\u2019d assume that the revenue trends remain consistent over the next few quarters, how should we think about OpEx growth for the remainder of the year? I know you\u2019re staying less than 3%, but assuming revenues were to stay at the 5% level, do you think we should end up on the low end of that range?","Daniel T. Henry","So, as we talked about staying, having growth of less than 3%, we really haven\u2019t factored in exactly where revenue growth is going to come in. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the factor in terms of our commitment to keep OpEx growth at less than 3%.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. ","Got it, and\u2026","Daniel T. Henry","So at the FCA we\u2019re trying to give a variety of scenarios in there in terms of what the potential outcomes could be when you vary both revenue growth and operating expense growth, and share repurchases to give you a sense of how each of those items could affect EPS in the several different scenarios.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. ","Okay, and in terms of the spend volumes can you give us a sense of how they progressed during the quarter end? At this point, have you seen anything that points a pull back on the part of consumers from higher tax rates?","Daniel T. Henry","So our spending levels, our FX-adjusted basis have been pretty consistent over two quarters, and we didn\u2019t see any historic trends within the quarter. So whether the change in the tax rate is having a impact that was something that we could concern within our numbers.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. ","Great, thanks.","Operator","Question today comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.","Yeah thank you. I was hoping if I can get like some specifics around the gain that you guys had from the sale of the ICB shares, as well as kind of those benefitted from the reversal of the reserve for cardmember reimbursements? And then secondly, I was just wondering how far we were into the restructuring that you guys have undertaken, and at what point during the year will we hit a level of operating expense, ex-marketing without that overhead? Thank you.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So as we relates to the ICBC shares, we put a hedge on that in the past and have effectively locked in the gain. As you have seen over the last several quarters, we are taking that over time and the reason we\u2019re doing that is to enable higher levels of investment spending to help generate business momentum. So it\u2019s a locked in gain we have in sort of time, our plan to take it over time.","With respect to your second question about the reversal of our reserve we put up previously related to cardmember reimbursements. We have come up with an estimate in the fourth quarter, upon further refinements we realize that the announcement we\u2019re going to reimburse is actually lower in our estimate. It\u2019s a relatively small amount, but it did have an effect on the increase in spreads. So I didn\u2019t want people to think that that was a permanent increase that\u2019s really the only reason I spiked it out, but it\u2019s not really a large number at all as it relates to our income.","In terms of restructuring, we announced restructuring in January; the impact of employees leaving American Express is actually going to take place over all of 2013. Some have left in March, but others will not leave until later in the year. So we\u2019re only get a portion of the benefit from that actions in 2013 and we\u2019ll get an additional benefit in 2014 as some people would have been here for a portion of 2013. So it\u2019s going to come to us very gradually over 2013 and 2014. And I would say, most employees, the first employees to leave were probably in the March timeframe. So there is a limited amount of benefit from that in the first quarter. So we really see it come to us over the next seven quarters, I would say.","The very good control of operating expense is just our continued focus on operating expense which we really started last year, which is rolling over into this year as we see the proper control of expense as a way of creating resources so that we can invest in the business, some of which takes place on marketing portion line, other portions of that actually take place on the operating expense line. So I don\u2019t even know it was only one question. I hope I got each of the four parts correct.","Richard Petrino","You there?","Operator","Question? The next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. Good evening. Dan, I had a follow-up question on slide 16 and the detail that you gave on the expenses. So you\u2019re clearly making progress on reducing expenses, but I wanted to kind of make sure that I was thinking about the commentary that you guys have made correctly. You referred to how in the past that you intended to get debt expense ratio down to historical levels and I thought that you had said in the past that 2007 was kind of a good benchmark so that kind of 67% level and you\u2019re at 69% now in first quarter 2013 and we see the progress you\u2019ve made there. But should we be thinking, is that in fact a fair way to be thinking about it that that 69% over time is going to move towards 67%? And I know you guys don\u2019t want to get locked into a timeframe, but let\u2019s call it the next 12 months to 18 months or so kind of a reasonable timeframe to be thinking about.","Daniel T. Henry","Yeah. So I think what we said is we want to move back towards historical levels and 2008 and 2009 are low because it was during the crisis, and 2010 to 2011 are higher because we had all the levels of investment. Soon we\u2019ll lock in exactly on the 67% and certainly want to head back in that direction. How much we actually think this ratio down to will depend on lot of things including where our revenue growth is, what\u2019s in place of provision and what we\u2019re aiming for in terms of what we want to free up for investment capacity. So all those things work together in terms of the pace and the level that we take this ratio to.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And finally as a follow-up, can you give a little bit more color on what drove some of the weakness in GCS billed business, and then, should we expect reserve bills for the rest of the year or should we be looking for more releases? And then, I guess the last part of that is, the travel commissions and fees were little bit lower than what we were expecting. So I wondered if there is any kind of, maybe you could, if there is anything behind that and any kind of impact from the restructuring that we should expect to impact this line item? Thanks.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So let me talk to GCS, so corporate services. So really across the broad we\u2019ve seen lower spending in T&E categories, right and we are seeing better strength outside of the T&E categories.","Corporate services is primarily T&E type of spending and so that\u2019s where you see it come down and that\u2019s relatively broad geographically. So it\u2019s just lower T&E type of spending as it\u2019s causing them to be lower, and that actually ties into travel commissions and fee, right. So if T&E spending is lower, then that way it is going to be impacted. Worldwide sales were down 3%, that\u2019s the main driver. Now business travel was down 4%, consumer was actually up 2%, but business travel is much larger than consumer travel and so that\u2019s yielding the lower sales, so it\u2019s the activity in this particular category.","In terms of reserve, what\u2019s going to happen with reserves, so we have seen them come down for the last couple of years, actually in the fourth quarter we had a slight reserve billed, but a return this year to a release, but the release was much lower. The way our models work, they use the last 12 months worth of information to do the modeling to the extend we get to a point where the core of it is falling out, this is about the same level as the metrics we have in store.","Then you are going to have relatively stable provision, so it\u2019s a relationship of what\u2019s kind of pulling out of the model and what the new quarter going into the model is. So I think most people are anticipating that reserve releases are not going to be in 2013, what they were in prior periods.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Dan, could you walk us through your thoughts behind your revised buyback request under the CCAR process. You only missed the FED\u2019s Tier 1 common buffer by 3 basis points, but then when the subsequent request lowered the buyback request by $1.5 billion, was it communicated to you that would not be allowed to return in excess of 100% of earnings or alternatively did you just want to make sure that you had a really conservative request around 100% that you were confident that they would approve?","Daniel T. Henry","Right, so they never said to us you can\u2019t be above a 100%, I think stage two, it\u2019s in fact above 100%. And it turns out before our submission and subsequently. So that was not it. Our initial plan we asked for an increase of dividend to $0.23. We asked for a share repurchase of $4.7 billion, all the remainder of \u201913 and $1 billion in the first quarter of next year.","Our revised submission, we were asking for the same $0.23 dividend. We dropped our request from $4.7 billion to $3.2 billion this year in cap. The request for the first quarter of next year is the same. So when we prepared our initial submission to the FED under the stress scenario, it was based on our own internal analysis and that internal analysis yielded a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 9.2%, which was above the 5% minimum threshold that the FED reserve has set. However when the Federal Reserve did its own modeling, it generated a confusion that dropped us below that 5% minimum amount.","Now the good thing is both on our scenarios and their scenarios, even in the stress situation we have a hue of the process over the nine quarter period. However the FED\u2019s projection of the loan loss provision was $3.1 billion higher than ours. And, was actually $4.6 billion higher than the analysis they had done the prior year, right? So, in 2012, their estimates and ours were relatively close.","Our net estimates for 2013 was similar assumptions were 2013 and 2012 were similar. Okay, what the FED has come out in the report that they published they said that some of the reserve models that the FED was using this year had changed substantially all were newly implemented. So, it was that change that caused us to fall below the 5% minimum. Now, as we thought about our revise submission. We didn\u2019t want to putting a submission that just eked us barely over the 5%, and we said where we go back to the request that we have made in \u201912, we thought that was substantial in terms of what we were returning to shareholders and that\u2019s what really drove us at the end of the day.","And based on that, when you do that and reduce the share buyback request under the FEDs stress scenario our Tier 1 common ratio comes in at 6.42%, a healthy amount of 5%. So that was really our thinking in how we set our resubmitted request.","Mark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, I got it. On a separate fact, when I look at a year or so back, the delta between your billed business growth and loan growth was 10% plus, and I understand you are telling us then you would eventually expect lend to follow spend and those would converge, but now it\u2019s relatively tied I guess there is only about a 240 basis point difference between your proprietary billed business growth and your loan growth which is actually a little bit tighter than I would expect it given your more spend based model, is that relationship in line what you would have expected or is it a sign that you are getting more growth from your revolvers than you are from your transactors here?","Daniel T. Henry","So given that pre-crisis our loans grew at about the same pace as the growth in billings on lending products okay, that\u2019s separated while during the crisis as consumers started to de-leverage. What we have said, I think is that what the growth in loans will be in relation to the business is totally depended on our customers. Right, they are going to decide what amount of leverage that they want to have, although intuitively, at least in the near term didn\u2019t seen that we moved back to where we were pre-crisis.","In the fourth quarter loan growth came closer to billings growth, but in the first quarter the growth in loans was about half the rate of the growth in billed business, it is kind of been about that level for several quarters. Now whether it goes up or down from there as I said depending on the customers, we give products to customers, we give them the opportunity to revolve if they choose, as you know probably the number of customers that we have that have lending products that are actually transactors they are very much in the high 20s, right. But if those customers choose to revolve the products design to allow, so it will be driven not by us, but by the choice of the customer and we will rely on the credit capabilities we have to properly monitor that, and you can see that while we are having loan growth even though really no one else in the industry is at the moment, our credit metrics were excellent. So, it\u2019s really be driven by the behavior of the customer.","Mark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with the Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Donald Fandettin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Dan, sort of looking at billed business in the U.S, I mean effectively your growth rates you could argue accelerated a bit and you\u2019ve got the banks and JPMorgan sort of coming at the affluent side, I mean I guess my question is, do you still think you are gaining share, how is growth so stable and good. I mean is there anything specific in terms of sort of a income breakdown where they super affluent is maybe stronger, I mean are you just seeing across the board decent numbers?","Daniel T. Henry","Our customer basis is primarily affluent customer base and as I said before we don\u2019t see any discernible impact of taxes on our base. As you said in the U.S, we had some pretty consistent performance over the last several quarters that we are pleased with, given where GDP is, and the fact that it\u2019s a sluggish economy. Now we always have the fact that lots of our competitors want to be in our space and we mean to continue to innovate and provide to as a service to customers to maintain the kind of performance that we have, but and we haven\u2019t done analysis to distinguish by income level within our customer base, but it\u2019s pretty good performance over of what based of our products that\u2019s giving us this stable growth.","Donald Fandettin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you. And then, in terms of the Chase, Visa deal, I guess, some have suggested that maybe that could be a competitor for us to AmEx because of the closed loop. I mean is there anything specific that they could do that\u2019s incremental, is there any sort of incremental competitive threat from that you see today?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, they\u2019re trying to replicate our closed loop. I think people realized that that has value. But the number of customers that actually operate within that space is limited. Right, it has to be a Chase customer and a merchant that uses their merchant-acquiring process. And we add that all up, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very large piece of the total universe. So is it something that will enable them to achieve growth. I think it likely is, but I don\u2019t see it as a large threat as our closed loop covers all our merchants and all of our customers.","Donald Fandettin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Now we\u2019ll go to line of Ken Bruce representing Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good evening. Firstly, I appreciate the commentary in your prepared remarks as it relates to the marketing and promotion expense and expense levels in general. I do want to make sure I understand some of your comments there and my question will tie in with some of the others. But firstly, you\u2019d mentioned that marketing and promotion expense, running at 7.9% in the quarter, likely going to go higher just in terms of where you expect to run it on a more stable state basis, and I want to make sure that that\u2019s your outlook is for marketing promotion as a percentage of managed revenue to rise.","And then within the context of your marketing and promotion expenses, you had pointed out that brand advertising was down and acquisition costs or acquisition spending was up. And I want to understand, maybe you can dimensionalize if there has been any changes in terms of what is the discretionary side of the expense versus what is more cardmember behavior, if you have seen any change in the outlook for where you want to invest, whether that would be geographically or within products and get a sense as to how you are looking at the investment horizon, if you could provide some color on those areas, please?","Daniel T. Henry","So what we have said is, our objective is for marketing and promotion on an annual basis to be about 9%, it\u2019s not a forecast that that\u2019s our objective. I was just putting out that last year, we had got marketing as a percentage of revenue down in the first quarter. We\u2019ve done that again. But again we aren\u2019t changing our objective of being at that 9% level.","The commentary say we took brand down a little bit and acquisition up a little bit was going to say we had a strategy change in terms of the mix, which is say, during this quarter, when we had lower expenses coming more from the brand side and that our acquisition engine to bringing customers was actually at or little above what we have in the past. So it\u2019s really just to give you a sense of how we allocate within the quarter.","Every year, we look at all of the opportunities we have in terms of where we spend our marketing dollars, whether it\u2019s on brand, or charge in the U.S. or charge internationally, our lending products or co-branded products. And we have pretty refined models in terms of what the expected economic gain of those investments are and that\u2019s what really drives where we put the dollars.","Obviously, it\u2019s a lot easier to measure when you do an acquisition, because you can see the actual cards that come in and we have a pretty good idea how they\u2019re going to perform, but I guess things like brand advertising, if you don\u2019t have that nice mathematical calculation. We know this is certain amount that you want to do. And if you do, you will have good products and good brand advertising and that\u2019s where you want to be. Because it\u2019s really driven by which investments give us the greatest economic gain, it will drive what geography and what products we put the investments behind.","Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And as a follow-up are you, when you look at brand versus acquisition expenditures, it feels that the branding is very discretionary, but ultimately as a longer payback window versus you know the acquisition investments that you maybe making, which are harder to pullback and trying to get a sense as to how much of this maybe in reaction to, meeting some shorter term financial objectives versus any change in the overall outlook for investment in your business?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, I think we need, so for the marketing and promotion just about maybe not 100%, but very, very large, it's completely discretionary. Right, Then we can decide to either do or not do, so it\u2019s not like a fixed cost of having employees within the company. So, it is just a matter of, I think we recognized that we can take marketing and promotion down in any quarter or for a couple of quarters in fact as we did back in \u201808 and \u201809. And there is really no negative impact to the franchise, you couldn\u2019t do that longer-term. So this is just in recognizing in the first quarter. We\u2019ve taken it down some. We\u2019re committed to hit the objective that we set and we chose in this particular quarter to have brand come down and acquisition go up, but that can change from quarter-to-quarter depending on what we\u2019re endeavoring to achieve.","Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Yeah. Next we\u2019ll go to line of Chris Brendler representing Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good evening. Dan, if you could gently touch on the lending business one more time. The margin seems to pop up a little bit in the first quarter. Anything going on there, is it sustainable. And also just sitting back a little bit, the lending business also seems to be going fairly well. As you mentioned you\u2019re doing receivables better than almost anyone in the industry, the margins are healthy, credits at all-time lows. Any change in strategy around lending and given that this, the weakness in other parts of the business, is there any desire to increase your focus on lending and can you just comment at all on your use of teaser rates currently? Thanks.","Daniel T. Henry","All right. So I\u2019ll start with teaser rates. So others are using balanced transfers with zero for a certain period of time. That is not a strategy that we are following. So we\u2019re not growing loans by putting teaser rates out there. The growth in our loans is coming by as a result of cardmember spending, the business spending on our products which is what we want them to do.","Coming out of the crisis, we did have a shift in our lending strategy, right. So we weren\u2019t coming out of the crisis to be focused on premium lending, right. So that was a change. So that\u2019s really a change that we put in place back in 2009 and we\u2019ve continued to execute against that. We\u2019ve shared information about what percentage of lending customers actually are transactors, and that has increased quite a bit over the last several years, and as a result of the premium lending strategy, we\u2019re focused on cards that have higher spending on them, so we have also shared the percentage of customers who have a tenure of less than 2.5 years with us so there is a lot less than it was again five years because we are bring fewer products right?","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right","Daniel T. Henry ","That\u2019s helpful from our credit perspective as well, so I think you\u2019re putting a number of metrics out there show that we not only talking about a premium lending strategy, but actually executing against it. We can actually see that average cardmember spending is in the whole base is growing up. So that has been something of a change because changing some strategy changes that we made a couple of years ago.","Lending products for credit worthy customer, our products that have good economics associated with it, and so we were grow both charge card and premium lending and as I said before, which ones we are actually investing against is based on the return that we think we\u2019ll get out of each investment.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Any comment on the manager\u2019s margin and then also separately can you also comment on fraud? I heard more and more concerned about fraud but the lack of EMB in the U.S. and this year plan to start issuing EMB cards in the U.S. an update there. Thanks.","Daniel T. Henry","So net yield is at 9.5% in the quarter, up about 30 basis points from last year, I made a comment that a part of that increase had to do with adjusting of our reserves, I wouldn\u2019t expect to stay at exactly 9.5%. Coming out of the crisis or actually coming out of the new regulations that we had. We had said, 9% was about our yield prior to those regulations and our intend was for our yield to be about 9% after those regulations with the changes we have made in our products, so we have achieved that and slightly more.","So on our lending products, we are getting good growth, low credit losses and good yields and that\u2019s a pretty good combination to have, right. So we are very pleased with how our lending products are performing.","As it relates to fraud, our fraud losses are less than half of what we see across the industry and I think that\u2019s the benefit of having very good gross proceeds to money growth, it\u2019s probably one of the benefits of closed loop and we have not seen any notable tick-up in fraud in our core business.","As it relates to EMV, we have started to put EMV chips on some of our premium products or products for customers who travel expensively, so that they have the best utilization possible quite frankly outside the U.S., but I think gradually within the U.S. we put EMV on to our cards over a number of years.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","No big roll out plan for this year, Dan?","Daniel T. Henry","It\u2019s going to be a very gradual roll out over several years, I would say, so no big push to do it in 2013, but it\u2019s a gradual undertaking for us.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next, we will go to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good evening.","Daniel T. Henry","Hi.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Couple of questions; one is just on the travel segment. Travel segment have been relatively weak thinking about just airline and airline seat capacity, and I\u2019m wondering how much of that may have impacted your first quarter in terms of billed business.","Daniel T. Henry","Yeah. So I think I mentioned before, the reason that Corporate Services was down in terms of growth rate, the growth rate was lower, was that we were seeing weakness in T&E spend compared to our average. So we saw that in all of our products. It\u2019s a bigger percentage of Corporate Services. So it had a bigger impact there. So it was impacting growth in the quarter.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, but no sense of degree of impact?","Daniel T. Henry","It\u2019s hard to tease out exactly. I guess I would say that was little bit, overall we\u2019re very pleased with our aggregate growth rate given the sluggish economy.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. And then on slide five, just looking at the different billed business growth rates per region, it\u2019s kind of interesting that they\u2019re somewhat coming together fairly tightly and I\u2019m wondering how you guys are thinking about that, is this new normal where distribution of growth rate across the globe is likely to be running more similarly or do you have a different outlook than what you experienced this quarter?","Daniel T. Henry","Yeah. I think there have been times when it kind of moves together like it is now and I think to be a time where it performs again. Let\u2019s say EMEA is slower than the other regions and so kind of figure out exactly all the issues and problems. It could well be in the EMEA space kind of in the lower part of the chart. We think JAPA is being impacted by China. So it\u2019s good growth rates, but not the growth rates that they had in recent history that impacts countries like Australia. So it\u2019s really very much going to be driven by the economies in those regions in large part.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. Okay. And then, just lastly couple of questions on Bluebird. I wanted to understand the impact of adding a checking feature and the FDIC insurance on Bluebird, and if there has been much in a way of any effort to expand the merchant acceptance to attract more Bluebird spend?","Daniel T. Henry","So, Bluebird products were all reloadable products, are accepted across our whole network, right. So you can use any of those products in any location where American Express product is accepted. The FDIC insurance we put on because it refer some customers that they matter, and also to load certain checks like government checks or your tax refund bond, it had to be FDIC insured. And in terms of the check writing, we just want to have a full suite of options for customers. So it\u2019s the best possible product for them.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So have you seen any uptick in growth rate beyond what you were experiencing before post the FDIC announcement?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, they just went on. So it\u2019s hard to measure, but we are seeing healthy in renewable prepaid across that product set.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, the question on the merchant acceptance. Again that BlueBird is accepted at any merchant who access AmEx. So I guess the question is, does a reloadable prepaid card user seek a potentially different kind of merchant addition to the merchants that AmEx has today?","Daniel T. Henry","So we say it\u2019s possible, but we do have an initiative to, so we\u2019ve always had initiative to expand merchant coverage. So I think a small merchants is a particular initiative within 2013 and we\u2019re trying to expand it. So it\u2019s very much in line, it will be good for customers who use reloadable prepaid, will be good for our customers who use our corporate card as well. So let\u2019s do the next question if you could.","Richard Petrino","Thanks.","Daniel T. Henry","This will be the last question. Well, two more questions. Two more questions. Okay.","Operator","All right. Next we\u2019ll go to line of Brad Ball with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Thanks Dan. A lot of my questions have been asked. Just you mentioned that you were experiencing higher cash back rewards. Is that a contra-revenue item and how many of your \u2013 what proportion of your customers are using cash back?","Daniel T. Henry","So cash back reward is a contra-revenue and cash back is a good product. I don\u2019t think we actually break out the percentage, but it\u2019s still a reasonably healthy product within our suite of products.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","And is it a product that resembles the products that are in the market, 1% type cash back on all outstanding that kind of product?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, these products is a little different, but it\u2019s basically a percentage of spend you get and sometimes there is higher rewards in particular categories either on a product feature basis or on a promotion basis.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay. And then one other. You had mentioned that other revenue were helped by higher loyalty partner revenues.","Daniel T. Henry","Yeah.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Can you give us a sense as to the magnitude of the contribution there and just broadly how are you tracking to the $3 billion target for fee revenues?","Daniel T. Henry","So we\u2019ll be partnered as a substantial business. However it\u2019s one business in a very large company, but they are performing nicely, very much in line with our expectations and it\u2019s the one spot that we think is going to help us achieve our $3 billion target.","As we said, we are kind of halfway through the timeframe of achieving that target, which we still think is appropriate. It will be different fee businesses like certified, royalty edge, royalty partner, revolver prepaid, that we\u2019re looking forward to get us there. And as of 2012 we stood at $1.5 billion that was up 15% from the prior year. We recognized $3 billion an ambitious target particularly in a sluggish economy, and we had a fair amount of work to do as we go forward. Our royalty partner, reloadable prepaid are two examples of how we\u2019re diversifying our base and we expect those to ramp up as we hit towards the end of 2014, which is when we\u2019re shooting to be at a run rate of $3 billion.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","That\u2019s great. Thanks.","Daniel T. Henry","Last question.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Great thanks. Just to comment about the bank stock gain, could you just tell us how much is left in that that you\u2019re releasing kind of overtime when you said you needed the earnings for marketing purposes? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up?","Daniel T. Henry","So we\u2019ve taken gains, I think over the past six quarters or so seven quarters, the hedge still runs for into next year sometime, probably towards the middle of next year. So I would expect we\u2019re going to take gains pretty evenly over the next six or seven quarters.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","All right. And just on the reserving, I mean, if you kind of take the analysis that you described, and look at what kind of forward 12 months would have been at the end of this quarter versus at the beginning, you're kind of down 3% or 4% in terms of charge-offs. But I guess, given that\u2026?","Daniel T. Henry","Could you start the sentence again because I didn\u2019t catch up with you?","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Yeah, sure. Basically, you had said that with respect to reserving, that you kind of look at the forward kind of 12 month losses and if a quarter drops out that had higher losses and, in that exact analysis I mean taken literally, your losses are down 3% or 4%. So, kind of with the reserve drop we saw seems reasonable. How do you factor in the idea of growth because you've gone from 14 months of coverage at the current rate to 13 which kind of implies that you're not leaving as much room for either growth or any kind of deterioration in the existing rate.","Daniel T. Henry","We actually use 12 months looking back. All right, so we use historical information to seat our models. That\u2019s striving the reserve.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Okay. So the growth has nothing to do with it, expected loan growth?","Daniel T. Henry","No, we\u2019re looking at the behavior of our portfolio right? And if you have loan growth, we\u2019re assuming I guess apparently that loan growth will have a similar loss aspect to it as our existing book of business. And we\u2019re not putting reserves on our books today for loans that we put on in the future. So, this is, what is the reserve you need for the loans that are already booked at this moment.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Got you. Okay. Thanks.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay, so thanks everybody for joining the call. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Cathy. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the Company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that maybe discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to quarter's results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we published our second quarter results and with our earnings per share for Q2 at a $1.47, and with adjusted revenue growth for 2Q of 8%. We believe that our results continue to reflect solid progress against our priorities, laid out again on Slide 2, accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting the cost base.","Since early 2015, we have made many changes to the company and have been investing in a broad set of growth opportunities generated by our unique business model. As we have made these changes, we have always thought to balance the short, medium and long term.","We are certainly encouraged by our current revenue performance and the near term payoff we are getting from our actions. But to be clear, we are making decisions and generating sustainable revenue growth and we've remained focused for the years beyond 2017 on the 6% revenue growth scenario that we shared at our Investor Day in March.","In addition, we are clearly seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and continue to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs.","Our efforts across these areas are driving the simple model we have shared over the last couple of years. We have a diverse range in growth businesses as a business model that provides steady operating leverage plus a balance sheet that shows tremendous capital strength all of which contribute to steady EPS growth.","Now, I know our numbers have been difficult to interpret over the past two years of repositioning the company, but Q2 does mark the end of the need for the quarterly adjustments we have sharing with your comparison purposes since the beginning of 2016. I know we are all looking forward to next quarter on that front.","Indeed more broadly, in many ways the end of the first half 2017 is a milestone for us as we complete the transition from repositioning the company and managing the related volatility to executing plans focused again on delivering steady revenue and earnings growth. Of course the environment we operate in is challenging but we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively across our diverse customer segments and geographies.","With that let me turn to the detailed results starting with the summary financial performance on Slide 3.","Revenue of $8.3 billion for the second quarter increased 1% versus the prior year, reflecting primarily higher year-over-year net interest income. Excluding Costco-related revenues from the prior year and the impact of FX, adjusted revenue growth was 8%. The second quarter also included growth in provision in rewards expense above the growth in loans and billings respectively as we would have expected, both of which I will come back to in a few minutes.","Net income of $1.3 billion was down 33% versus the second quarter of 2016 largely due to the $1.1 billion gain recorded last year upon the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio. Earnings per share of a $1.47 reflects our net income performance and also the benefits of our strong capital position. Over the last four quarters, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, which is resulted in a 5% reduction in average shares.","These results brought our ROE for the 12 months ended in June to 22%. This ROE performance is below our recent performance of approximately 25%, primarily due to the uneven quarterly earnings we experienced in 2016. If you simply look at the math of our expected earnings range for the full year 2017 and our equity position, our ROE should trend back towards our recent performance level as we progress through the year.","So let me move to our metrics starting with billed business performance trends, which you see several different views up on Slides 4 through 7. Worldwide FX adjusted billing grew 1% in the quarter versus the prior year.","As we move to Slide 5, you can see the Q2 billings growth adjusted for both the impact of Costco and changes in foreign exchange rates remained consistent with Q1 at 8%.","We are encouraged by the continued momentum in billing this quarter, which reflects broad based growth across our diverse segments and geographies, with adjusted U.S. billings steady at 6% and international billings growing the low double-digits.","Turning to the segment perspective, in GCS, which grew at 5% year-over-year consistent with Q1, we continue to see healthy performance in the small business and middle market client segments, which I'll refer to as SMEs in my remarks.","Just to remind you, at our Investor Day, we defined SMEs as clients with less than $300 million in annual revenues. Adjusted volumes from our SME client segment in the U.S. grew in the low double-digits in the quarter. And outside the U.S., SME client volume grew in the mid-teens. In the large and global GCS client segment, volumes were up a bit as compared to last year though. As we've said for a while now, we expect the large and global client segment to remain slower growth rates as corporations look to manage their travel and entertainment expenses.","In addition, we do not yet see any significant complexion point in macroeconomic trends that has caused a shift in spending patterns for these large and global customers.","In the international consumer and network services segment, the FX adjusted billings growth rate was 8% in line with the previous quarter.","Looking at the two parts of the segment, FX adjusted volume from proprietary cards grew at 12%, up from an 11% in Q1, reflecting continued strength in several international markets. In GNS, the FX adjusted growth was 5% in Q2, down modestly versus the prior quarter, primarily due to China as well as Australia and the EU, which were impacted by changes related to regulation.","Moving to international in total on Slide 7, our billings growth rate is down slightly sequentially, but remained healthy with double digit growth in FX adjusted terms.","As we look our few key markets for example, we see continue double-digit FX adjusted growth in the UK up 15%, Mexico up 12%, and Japan up 17%. While we have been showing strong growth across international, the regulatory environment in markets like Europe, Australia and China will continue to evolve and we will continue to adopt our business model as the regulatory environment unfolds. Stepping back, we are pleased with the continued strength of our adjusted billings growth rate.","The momentum in the first half of the year reflects the investments we have made in a verity of growth opportunities over the last couple of years. Although we face intense competition in the U.S. and the regulatory environment in uncertain in many markets around the world, we've remained focused on driving more volume under our network, we feel good about the diversity of our billings growth.","Turning to our worldwide lending performance now on Slide 8. Our total loans were up 11% versus the prior year and are solid quarterly performance. We continue to steady grow loans faster than the industry as we capture the particular opportunity we have to growth loans with existing customers while also adding new customers. As we look forward, we believe we have a long runway for growth given our existing customer opportunities, while maintaining best in class credit performance.","Looking at the right hand side of the slide, you can see that net interest yield is again up significantly year-over-year. The improvement in yield is driven by a number of factors, including a shift in mix to non-cobrand customers who are more likely to revolve, having fewer revolving loans at introductory rates, specific pricing actions taken in recent quarters and a benefit from increasing in benchmark interest rates without a similar increased in our overall funding cost.","As a quick reminder, our online deposit program personal savings is a little over $30 billion in size. In our 10-K interest rates sensitivity analysis, we assume that as benchmark rates increase, our personal savings rate increases with a deposit data of 1.","However, if you look over the last couple of years, the prime rates has increased by a 100 basis points, while our own personal savings rate has only increased by 25 basis point. Now that change to our rate has come in just a last couple of months and we will continue to adjust our deposit funding rates to stay competitive in the deposit markets. In general though, the personal savings program continues to be a very cost effective and attractive source for us.","Looking out to the balance of the year, if you consider the list I just went through, many of these drivers will persist, however the year-over-year change in the yield should not be as pronounced as we move through the coming quarters.","Before turning to provision expense, let me tough on our credit metrics on Slide 9. Again this quarter, delinquency and loss metrics in our portfolio were best in class. In the worldwide loan portfolio, you can see that the delinquency rate was consistent with Q1 and up modestly versus the prior year. Loss rates as we would have expected also continue to be modestly higher year-over-year.","Going forward, we continue to expect loss rates to increase gradually due to the seasoning of new accounts and a shift towards non-cobrand products, which have slightly higher loss rates but also generate greater yields. As loss rates gradually move higher and loans continue to grow, the growth rate in provision will exceed the growth rate of loans, which is you can on Slide 10 was in fact the case for Q2 as provision increased by 26%, while loans grew by 11%.","Turning into our revenue performance on Slide 11. FX adjusted revenues were up 1% and revenue growth adjusted for both Costco and FX increased by 8%. Clearly, we are pleased with another quarter of accelerating adjusted revenue growth. And in particular with the broad based contribution to that growth from our diverse business segments. If you take a step back, we have taken clear and different actions across those diverse segments to drive growth.","Let me take you back here for a second to Slide 12, which I first shared in our Investor Day in March. On this slide, I talked about the growth opportunities we have across our different segments and I stressed that we have made specific changes in the way we operate to better seize these opportunities.","As I look at our results this quarter and in indeed over the last several quarters, I see progress against each of these growth opportunities as we realize the returns on the changes and investments we have been making. Today, we have a consumer segment generating strong internationally and in the U.S. where we have strengthened our product offerings in the premium sector. And lending efforts that have broadened our card member relationships and successfully balanced growth, the strong credit quality and industry leading presence with SMEs who use our cards for an expanding portion of their payments needs, a larger merchant network that accommodates a greater share of our card member spending, a card acquisition engine that has successfully been redesigned for digital age and the more agile technology infrastructure that brings customized products and services market more quickly and efficiently.","All of these are driving our performance as we come back now to the components of revenue on Slide 13. First, discount revenue was flat year-over-year and grew by 7% on an adjusted basis. The discount rate in Q2 was 2.44%, up 1 basis point for the prior year due to lower rate volumes coming off the network.","As we stated in Investor Day, once we move to the second half of 2017, you will see the discount rate trend shift back to down year-over-year due to the ongoing impact of merchant negotiations particularly in a regulated markets like Australia and Europe and the continued rollout of OptBlue. Of course as always, the mix of our billings across industries and geographies will also impact the rate year-over-year as we go forward.","I know many of you also focused on the ratio of discount revenue to build business, which in addition to the reported discount rate also includes the impact of certain contra revenue items and also how we account for our GNS business. In the quarter, this ratio was flat year-over-year at 1.79% as growth in corporate client incentives and co-brand partner payments and the shift in our billings mix towards GNS were offset by a year-over-year decline in cash rebate payments.","Net card fees grew by 8% in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the U.S. Platinum and Delta portfolio as well as growth in Mexico and Japan. Given the competitive environment especially in the U.S. consumer segment, we view steady growth in card fees as indicative of our Card Members recognizing the breath and strength of the value propositions we offer on our products. In addition, I would remind you that the increased Platinum fee for existing U.S. Consumer Card Members does not start to contribute to card fee grow until September of this year.","Other fees and commissions grew 7% in the second quarter while other revenues declined by 19%. The decline in other revenues was primarily driven by a contractual payment from a network services partner in the prior year second quarter and the sale of a small business in Q4 of last year.","Net interest income grew by 6% and on an adjusted basis grew by 24% as the higher net interest yield I described earlier and higher adjusted loan balances combined to drive significant growth in net interest income.","Turning now to expenses on Slide 14. Performance vary across the lines and I'll discuss the changes to marketing and promotion rewards in Card Member Services expenses when I come back to Card Member engagement spending in just a minute. But first our operating expenses.","Total operating cost during the quarter were up 39% versus the prior year excluding from the prior year the $1.1 billion gain from the Costco co-brand portfolio sale, which was treated as a contra expense. And a $232 million restructuring charge, adjusted operating expenses were down 4%. And this marks the fourth consecutive quarter that adjusted operating expenses have declined year-over-year.","We continue to make solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives and we are confident that we will remove $1 billion from the Company's cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. We are steadily executing on our plans to improve our efficiency and get costs out. This progress along with our revenue performance today is allowing us to selectively reinvest some of those savings in areas that will help drive continued revenue growth going forward.","Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.2% compared to 33.2% in the same period last year, reflecting both discrete items and proportionally higher earnings from lower tax rate international market than in the prior year. We now expect the full year tax rate to come in slightly below our previously stated range of 33% to 34%.","Moving to the summary of our Card Member engagement spending on Slide 15, total engagement spending in Q2 was $3.1 billion or 10% higher than the prior year in the quarter and up 7% year-to-date. Looking at the components of that spending, in the first half of the year, M&P was up 1% versus 2016.","As a reminder coming into 2017, we expected marketing and promotion to be down significantly from 2016 levels as we found efficiencies in our marketing spend and moved past some of the unique investment opportunities we had in 2016. And you will see that year-over-year reduction in the second half of this year.","I would also remind you that consistent with our historical practice, we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities and monitor our business performance and saving initiatives and balance our financial commitments with driving long term value.","As we look at the effectiveness of our marketing spend, we continue to see good traction in attracting new customers for the franchise. In the quarter, we added 2.7 million new proprietary customers globally and in our global consumer business close to two thirds of new customer acquisition came through digital channels and 35% of new customers.","Rewards expense increased 9% in Q2 despite a small decline in proprietary billing volumes versus the prior year. Excluding the Costco co-brand volumes in the prior year, adjusted rewards expense would have increased in the quarter by 20%, while adjusted proprietary billings grew by 6%. This growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost to proprietary billings of 86 basis points were roughly in line with the prior quarter.","The greater year-over-year increase in rewards expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products that we implemented at the beginning of Q4 2016, as well as continued strong growth and our Delta co-brand portfolio.","Cost and Card Member Services in the quarter increased 24%, reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and co-brand benefits such as First Bag Free on Delta, as well as usage of the new Uber and benefit on Platinum. We continue to believe that this is an area where we can offer differentiated benefits and we will continue to invest in Card Member Services.","To focus for just a moment on U.S. Platinum, you already know we have made a series of changes to our U.S. consumer and small business platinum product offerings over the last several months both in rewards and other more experiential benefit. The yearly results from these changes look good and we are seeing both increased engagement from our existing U.S. Platinum Card Members as well as higher rates of new customer acquisition since the introduction of the new benefits.","Turning now of Slide 16 in touching on capital. We continue to use our strong balance sheet to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. Over the last four quarters, we have returned 94% of the capital we have generated. I think this shows the commitment we have over time to leveraging our business model and capital position to steadily create shareholder value.","As you all know, we have recently received a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2017 adjusted CCAR submission. We have both increased the dividend payout for the next four quarters as well as significantly increased the share buyback versus the prior CCAR authorization.","We remain confident in the strength of our business model and our ability to drive shareholder value through capital returns. Of course, we also use capital to support business building activities such as growth in our loan balances and potential M&A activity in addition to returning capital through dividends and share buybacks.","Stepping back now in conclusion. Over the past several years, we've embarked on a series of initiatives to reposition the company and drive sustainable and consistent revenue and earnings growth. These efforts have been targeted at providing a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer term.","Looking forward we are encouraged with the trends that we've seen in our business metrics and revenue growth. And believe that these initiatives are driving real momentum across our diverse business segments. Even though revenue performance of the first two quarters, we now expect full year adjusted revenue growth to be above the top end of the 5% to 6% range I discussed in our Investor Day in March.","While this is clearly a positive development. I would remind you that our recent revenue growth is benefiting from certain drivers that are likely to stabilize somewhat in future quarters such as growth in yield and increased customer engagement particularly on the platinum card. In addition, as is our historical practice, we will continue to balance delivering earnings to the bottom line and investing for the moderate to long term.","I would also say that as moved the back half of 2017, the uneven year-over-year comparisons from the last few years have discontinued partnerships, large restructuring charges and portfolio sales will be behind us. And results in the second half of this year should therefore provide a clearer picture for all of us of the progress we have made towards producing steady and consistent results.","Against the backdrop of all these moving pieces and given that we are at the midpoint of the year, we are confident that we will deliver full year earnings per share between $5.60 and $5.80.","With that, let me turn it back over to Toby as we move to Q&A.","Toby Willard","Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that the operator will now open up the line for questions. Cathy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Go ahead please.","Ken Bruce","Thank you. Good evening. One clarification if I could and it relates to card fees in some of the value prop subset already in the market. I guess you had mentioned that you get card fees they were up nicely in the quarter, but that is not benefiting from the increase in platinum card fees which is later this year, are we looking at some of the costs already being included in the expense side of the equation. Related to that, I guess I just want to make sure we understand the timing of the revenues versus expenses on that particular platform?","Jeffrey Campbell","Yeah, it's a good question Ken. So to remind everyone on the business and consumer platinum products, we made some changes in the latter part of 2016, and then on the consumer product, we offered a further range of benefit enhancements that went in at the end of the first quarter of this year. So all of the costs associated with the significantly higher Card Member engagement that those changes are driving are what you see reflected in our results can really the last two quarters and are key part of what is driving a little higher rewards cost and a little higher Card Member services costs.","As I said in my remarks, on the Consumer Card where we did include a fee increase, existing card members don't actually pay that until renewals begin in September. So the increase in fee revenue will lack to your point the increase in costs, we think that's an important way to do this. So customers have a sense of what the enhanced values are at the time that they see the higher fees. As you know we have a long track record of every couple of years with all of our products doing these kinds of upgrades and changes to the value propositions, which are often accompanied by a fee increase. So we think we have a pretty thoughtful approach to this.","I guess the last comment I would make is, we've not only been pleased with the increased engagement with our existing card members, but with both the business product and the consumer product, we've been very pleased with the significant increase in new card member acquisitions. And on the consumer side, those new card members of course do pay the higher fee right from day one. Totally can that helps clear up exactly what's in and not in the results so far.","Ken Bruce","Thank you. I'll jump back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash","Hey good evening, Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Jeff, I'm just wondering maybe two quick things, one I think in you Investor Day you talked about improving EPS each quarter throughout the year, I know there could be some timing around certain investments, but do you still feel confident in that?","And then I guess just related to that you're now saying revenue growth above the high end, your tax rate is going to be lower, so I know you had mentioned selectively reinvesting, so can you just maybe talk about the decision between allowing the incremental revenue hit the bottom line versus where you may potentially reinvest some of the stronger revenue? Thanks.","Jeffrey Campbell","Yeah, so there's a couple of good questions there Ryan. I think first on EPS progression, certainly we are pleased with the first half that we have had. And so I would probably not reaffirm those statements about EPS progression, the point I would make if you have the first two quarters of EPS and you have our full year guidance.","So I do think it's important as I say that to point out that we're only halfway through the year. Just like everyone else, we would sort of like to see next quarter's clean comparisons before we think about an updated view on the full year. And there are some reasons that I talked about in my remarks around growth in yield at some points slowing that cause us to want to see one more quarter before we adjust what we see for the year.","And to your point, we always are thinking about how we balance the financial commitments we have which we take very seriously in the short term with the opportunities we see to invest and build for the longer term. And even in the first half of the year, we have selectively chosen to spend a little bit more a couple of things in the M&P line than we had originally intended this year, because we're very pleased with revenue growth, we're very pleased with our progress on the cost reduction efforts and we could do those things while still being remaining very consistent to the earnings commitments that we've made to our shareholders.","So you know we'll have to see as we get into the quarter, we're now 19 days into exactly what all that means for the rest of the year, but clearly we're off to a stronger start than we expected. We feel really good about the revenue growth and all the efforts that we have underway and we will as always balance the short term and the long term as we make decisions in the next six months.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. I guess just when we think about that revenue growth for the second half, Jeff, as you look forward, you mentioned there might be some moderation, I mean is that the running expectation that you have, I mean what is the swing factor that will either sort of drive us better than what you're anticipating versus not, because we kind of know what the impact of the yield part is, if it stays constant.","And then when we're thinking about spending more than what was planned, I mean where exactly do you see the opportunities, is it in some of the areas where your competitors are kind of retrenching some, and you could take back share? Thanks.","Jeffrey Campbell","So lot of good questions here. Sanjay, sure I'll make a few comments. First, my comments about revenue growth and the 8% you see in Q2, we're really meant to point out that there's two things that in particular are helping us right now, and that's the very strong sequential growth you've seen in yields, and all of the drivers of that growth we think will sustain themselves in terms of the absolute level of yield you see today. But you know we can't keep raising prices for example forever, so there's some moderation I'd expect in the year-over-year growth in the yield going forward.","Clearly, we made some significant investments and this is really the point that Ken was asking about in the first question. We made some significant investments in the U.S. on both the business platinum and the consumer platinum card and that is really driving a really nice result in terms of increased Card Member engagement. The effects of - the economics effects of that to can question well play out over a longer time period that the fee increase benefits you actually won't begin to see until you get into the latter part of the year.","All that said, I would expect there is some stabilization if you will of the growth rate driven by all of those changes as we go into future quarters.","So for all of those reasons Sanjay for now, as we look at the low GDP growth, low inflation environment we're in, as we look around the globe at the range of competitive and regulatory issues we face, as I go beyond 2017, we're going to drive revenue growth as much as we can, but the target that I'm trying to communicate we are still focused on is that 6% level as you get beyond 2017 for the reasons I just described.","Your last question about selectively reinvesting as we look at our stronger performance. The great thing about the growth we're seeing right now is, it is very broad across almost all of our customer in geographic segments with the exception probably of the large and global corporate segment which is not as we've said for some time, particularly growing segment right now. So the modest amount of reinvestment done is spread across almost every geography and every customer segment. And sure we are always trying to be responsive to changes in the competitive environment.","On the other hand, we run the company for the long term, we try to build long term customer relationships and we're a little cautious sometimes about reacting overly short term to any one particular move by competitor. So hopefully that covers the waterfront there Sanjay.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Yeah, thanks. Jeff, you've indicated you still see a very long runway for growth - for loan growth that is particularly with existing customers. Can you help us think out through in a little more detail, I mean how much of the growth is coming from what you might consider lower hanging fruit and how much more challenging does that become as you know grabbing that growth as time passes?","Jeffrey Campbell","You know Mark, as you've heard a number of a say, for a while the track record we now have for several years of growing a little bit faster than the industry while still retaining best in class credit metrics. That's not a new thing. The track record is now there for several years. And despite that as you know with our consumer customers and also for our commercial customers, we capture a far smaller share of their borrowing behaviors and we do of their spending behaviors. And that gives us we think a rather unique opportunity relative to most of our competitors to tap into people we know really well, our existing customers and try to develop the right products, the right pricing, right marketing to get a little bit greater share of their borrowing behaviors.","And yet despite several years of doing that when you actually just look at the math, our share of their borrowing behaviors has gone up a couple of points and in the consumer world in the U.S. for example, we still probably have double the share of a customer spend behavior that we do with their borrowing behaviors. So when you run the math out on there is just a long, long run way to continue to do all this. And now you know we grow our lending both to the existing customers and by being lot more focused on acquiring new customers who want to engage in some level of borrowing.","But as you look at recent quarters, we've driven over half of our loan growth from our existing customers and it's that dynamic could makes us believe we have such a long runway to continue to grow little faster than the industry while retaining really good credit quality.","Mark DeVries","Okay, thanks.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Craig Maurer","Yeah, hi Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. So first question, I just wanted your thoughts on the new surcharging ban that was introduced in the UK that will go into effect next year. How that - how you believe surcharging has been impacting your ability to grow volumes in the UK? And then just is your charge off guidance still consistent with the 15 basis points to 25 basis points year-on-year for 2017 that you've discussed earlier? Thanks.","Jeffrey Campbell","Craig, you obviously very timing sense, the UK ruling came out just say a look. We as a company have been on record for a long time all over the globe that we have a strong view that surcharging is a very consumer unfriendly thing and people who understand what they're paying for a product to is a transact with a merchant and as you would know, but others may not have hit time. Look at today, if you look at the ruling that the UK government has come out with and if you look at the press coverage of it and you look at some of the groups were commenting on it, it is very much being taken and being seen as a pro consumer action.","So that to us is a really positive step in the UK. There are many other countries across Europe that are in the midst of debates about what to do about surcharging. The way - as you know there's great complexity and the interplay between the EU payment rules and what then gets translated in each country, but certainly we would hope that the UK actions are emulated in many other countries.","It's a good thing for the consumer long term and we think it's a good thing for us. I would say Craig, I don't know the today it has had a material impact on our ability to continue to grow our business. As you know, the UK has been one of our strongest markets. This quarter I cited its growth again being at 15% in terms of volumes and it's been growing at those kind of levels quite some time. But over the longer term, we think this is just good policy and is helpful to us as well.","In terms of charge offs, I am - I think we've remained very comfortable that what we're seeing on the credit side is right within the balance of what we would have expected given the growth we're seeing in lending. We do not see any signs of a broader economic change that is causing any change in the credit. Profile side, I would say we are performing exactly as I would have expected. We are growing loans a little faster than we had in the original plan. And so that will also drive overtime a little higher mix of new accounts going through a seasoning process.","So I think our real focus is making sure we stay with best in class metrics and we grow lending at good economics within the plan ranges we have, because our goal is to grow lending as fast as we can. Within that I might be cautious about guiding you to a specific number on write-offs, but I would just say we feel really good about where we are today.","Craig Maurer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Just the rewards competition, suggested - Steve Squeri suggested and so did David norms at recent conference that they thought that the rewards competition had peaked, I know obviously in aggressive level, but seem to a peak. I just wondered if you - if you're seeing that still month and a half, months, month and a half later, if you feel that's the case or not? And just also just on a cost base, how close are you to being done with the moves you need to make to hit the $1 billion?","Jeffrey Campbell","Let me take those in turn Bob. I guess on rewards, I would say well gosh, I hope that Steve and David are correct. But look we don't run the company making any assumption other than it's going to be continue to be a very competitive environment. We're going to continue to have to innovate and find new ways to offer value to our customers. And look you know the value enhancements we did with platinum were significant. They're being very well received by customers in driving just the kind of increased engagement and increase new Card Member acquisition that we wanted.","But we will continue to follow the competitive environment and continue to make sure that we offer great value propositions relative to what others put in the market. Always mindful of the fact that we have some very unique and differentiated assets to offer and we're always going to focus on trying to leverage those as opposed to the things that are perhaps most easily replicated.","On the cost question, look it's July 19th so we have I would say 100% of our plans clearly in hand well laid out. They are not all executed, but they are all partially executed and we're working towards being done with all of those things as we get into the latter part of this year. So at this point, I'm very confident in our ability to get more than a $1 billion of growth cost out of the company.","As I did say in our remarks that progress combined with the revenue performance is allowing us to reinvest in a few areas those savings. So for example, we are doing some things with our call centers to drive more revenue in new Card Members that have been extremely successful for us and frankly the savings we've generated elsewhere in the way we run our call centers have allowed us to do those kinds of things. And of course there is always things that I try not to talk about on calls like. We also have to cover with these cost savings. And my favorite so far this year that is the $60 million or $70 million of hedge and effectiveness started though we've taken thus far this year.","Really I try not take about that stuff because that's why we're taking a billion dollars out of the cost structure. So you don't particularly notice the increases that come from things like that. So I feel good about our progress, but to be clear, there is work to do but is just execution, it's not gee we still need to find another $100 million. It's very clearly in ourselves.","Bob Napoli","Great, thank you. Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Go ahead please.","Rick Shane","Thanks for taking my question. Look, one of the unique growth drivers here is the wallet share gains in terms of getting your existing customers to borrow. Two questions relating to that in both credit, how do you prevent adverse selection when you are offering a customer who's been offered the opportunity to pay overtime for years? How do you know that you are not getting sort of picked off at exactly the wrong time to make a loan that customer who said no before?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, Rick, you know it's a good question and one we think a lot about in many ways I would point to our track record which is several years of steadily growing above the industry will still retaining by far the best in class credit metrics. How do you do that? Well you do that by focusing on your existing customer base to a great extend where we know our customers extremely well and we know a lot about them and have a strong ability to make the kind of judgments you are pointing out we have to make.","We do it by we believe having best in class data efforts that both involve the way we use our own data, the way we use every bit of data across the industry and we combine it with what we think are best in class data science experts and efforts to be really thoughtful.","Do we get right 100% of the time? No, we don't. But do we get it right enough for the time so that we are able to retain best in class credit metrics? Absolutely. And look, we are very mindful of the broader environment and what all of our competitors are and are not doing. And I would say we are constantly evolving our tactics in this area a very real time as we see other things happening in the industry with our competitors with the economy.","Rick Shane","And Jeff, did those loans season in same way that a de novo customer does?","Jeffrey Campbell","No. So you certainly see different behavioral patterns as you take on a brand new customer versus as we grew lending balances with existing customers. Then there can still to your point be a seasoning process but they follow different patterns which we of course track based on our historical experiences.","Rick Shane","Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell","Yep, thanks Rick.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Go ahead please.","Chris Donat","Thanks for taking my question Jeff. I wanted just to go back to the Card Member services because as we look back historically thinking about Card Member services is a percentage of discount revenue, it's been growing, seems like it should be growing more as you lay around the Uber credit baggage some of the Delta co-brand changes more the Centurion lounges. I am just wondering should we be thinking about that as a - that line for Card Member service is really as a percentage of discount revenue or are you getting more kind of fixed fees in there with the lounges? A little bit of guidance on that.","Jeffrey Campbell","It's a good question. We've made a conscious pivot I would say to even more than we have historically on our value propositions emphasis the things that are hard for others to replicate and a lot build on our scale, our global reach, our brand. And so the lounge access is a great example of that. We have to scale to both build our own Centurion lounges as well as collect an unequalled amount of access to lots of other lounges around the globe and that is high valued by our Card Members. And all that runs to cost of Card Member services and as you should goes up, it drives the cost up. The Uber benefit is another great example.","In many ways Chris, the reason why starting I think back at Investor Day, I began to talk collectively about our marketing and promotional rewards and cost of Card Member cost is because it is important that people realize that we think of those as three tools we are using to drive more revenue. And particularly right now, the fastest growing in terms of - in percentage terms, fastest growing tool is cost of Card Member services and I'd expect it will stay that way because of this pivot to really want to emphasis the things we can do uniquely.","I think it's a little tricky to, so most of those things are not going to be directly tied in any ways to billing or discount revenue. The way we think of it is you are creating an overall value proposition for your customer that's why we feel really good about our fee revenue increases continuing because it's those kind of experiences whatever the point proposition is that we have to make really appealing to our customers to build loyalty overtime.","So that may not be as helpful as you would like in terms of how you might model this, but that's really how we think about the things that are appearing in that line from a business perspective.","Chris Donat","That's helpful. And just if I can tag on that, anything on that - any surprising seasonality we should be thinking about there that I don't know baggage fees increase in one quarter or?","Jeffrey Campbell","No, no, that one there really shouldn't be any particular seasonality in.","Chris Donat","Got it. Thanks Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Hey David.","David Togut","Thanks for taking my question, Jeff. Question about the regulatory environment in Europe which you referenced in your comments on the call. How are you positioning American Express to win in environment under PSD2 regulation where we start to ACH based ecommerce payments in Europe within the next couple of years? You know Visa is leaving its options open. MasterCard just buy VocaLink, so I am curious what your strategy is?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, boy, very good and large question. David that I could probably spend another hour taking about, but let me maybe just make a few comments. Clearly Europe is a heavily regulated market that regulation is evolving and regulation evolves in way that aren't always crystal clear. What we do have is a unique business model that gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of how we think about the best way to create value for merchants, who we have to directly negotiate with and convince to accept our card and to their fees and directly create value propositions with Card Members that they will continue to use even in light of all the other changes that to your point are likely to happen in that marketplace.","In some ways if you look at our results in Europe the last few quarters in place like the UK, we have seen tremendous growth with some of the changes drive elsewhere in the market with various aspects of the payment service directly. But it's a long game here and I think there are many chapters still to play out. You will see us evolve our business. You will see a significant reductions in coming quarters in the network aspect of our business in Europe which is a small part of our company, it's 10% of our European business which is 10% of our company. So it's 1% or 2% of billings. But you will see that's really significantly reduce that business in response to somebody evolving regulation. And obviously our opportunity and challenge as we do that is in fact to recapture a good chunk of that business on our proprietary network, which at times can actually generate more profits than we see on the network business.","So as always we are focused on, how do we use our unique business model, our unique brand in assets to create value propositions for both merchants and for Card Members that are very different from what others can offer? And in many ways I actually think it's complicated as it is. The European payment regulations as they evolve may well provide us new opportunities because we're so different from everybody else. But we'll have to see as time goes by.","David Togut","Understood, thanks.","Toby Willard","And Cathy, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And that will come from James Freedman with Susquehanna Financial. Go ahead please.","James Freedman","Hi. Thanks for just taking me into, I have just a quick question Jeff, at the Analyst Day on March 8 you had or Anre had an update about OptBlue, I was just wondering you make any comments tonight about that, but where are we in that journey we closer to the middle of the beginning or the end, how we should think about the contribution to growth things like that? Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell","Yeah, it's a good question James, and I probably should have mentioned it in my remarks. We're in the middle of the game, so we've been clear for a while that we have the company very focused on getting to parity coverage in the U.S. by 2019. We are really pleased now to have all of the large merchant acquirers in the U.S. involved in the program.","I would point out to you that the last of the larger ones have come on fairly recently to the program, and it just takes time given the nature of how the acquirers work with small merchants to cycle across the many, many hundreds of thousands and in fact millions of merchants that we need to cycle across year. But we're making good progress and we remain very focused on our 2019 goal.","As you've heard me say this is a really important goal for the company for the long term. But it is a long term goal. And you know first we have to get to parity then we have to really change perceptions amongst our customers. Those are long, long game. And I don't think if you look at our financial results today that you see a material upside. Today, when you just do the simple math of we have a lot more small merchants than we used to, we get business from those small merchants and that incremental or the revenues we get from that incremental business more than cover the lesser overall amount of economics for getting from all small merchants as we put them on OptBlue, so that's a net positive.","But the real game here is about once we get to parity and once we change perceptions, it's about getting a greater share of wallet because of that and it's about having an ability to be more efficient in our New Card member acquisitions, because of this. And I think we're still a couple of years away from seeing in a really material way the benefits from that. So thank you for the question.","Toby Willard","Thanks everybody for joining tonight's call, and thank you for your continued interest in American Express. Cathy, back to you.","Operator","Thank you.

As you'll see from the results, we are completing a two-year turnaround ahead of plan and getting ready to start a new chapter. Given the progress we're making, I thought this was the right time to begin the leadership transition and I'm very pleased to report that the Board has elected Steve to be Chairman and CEO effective February 1st of next year which will coincide with my retirement.","It has been a great honor to lead American Express and I've treasured every day of my 37-year career. It's been a journey that spanned profound changes in the world of business, the payments industry and the global economy. Against that background we continued the long tradition of reinvention that has characterized American Express since its founding more than a century and a half ago. We shifted our business from a narrow travel and entertainment focused to one that accommodates the everyday spending of our card members. We created one of the world's largest loyalty programs and membership rewards.","We built a global network of bank partners. We transformed our marketing, card acquisition, servicing and risk management capabilities for the digital age. We formed groundbreaking partnerships with a new generation of technology platform. We launched countless new and innovative products and services, built long-term relationships with millions of customers and merchants around the world and elevated our reputation as the gold standard for customer service.","We've navigated through the tragedy of 9\/11, the disruption of natural disasters, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and attacks on our business model and we've come out stronger every time. It's been an absolutely amazing time and I'm delighted that I will be handing over the reins to someone who has played an important role in shaping the company that we are today.","Steve knows the business and the brand. He knows the marketplace. He is an excellent strategist, a strong leader and a great partner. We've been moving the company forward in a very competitive environment and Steve has been there every step of the way. I feel very good about how we are positioned for the next several years. Now Jeff is going to speak to our current results in a few minutes, but I thought it would be helpful to offer a little bit of context on the business and on the succession process.","Those of you who have been following us for a while know that we decided a few years ago to renew some cobrand relationships and in others. We knew that those decisions would involve short-term pressure on earnings and raised questions with a number of you. But given how marketplace economics were evolving we didn\u2019t want to simply stick with the status quo and tie up resources in relationships that wouldn\u2019t make economic sense over the long-term. We believe the breadth of our business model offered better opportunities. Many of you wanted to see the proof and rightly so.","We focused on refashioning the business for a new competitive regulatory and digital environment. We did that by innovating and drawing on our traditional strengths, not by abandoning them. We reorganized the company along global lines of business and we build a leaner, faster, smarter culture. We accelerated our reengineering work and are on track to take $1 billion out of our expense base. We used our investment dollars to transform many of our capabilities and fund the initiatives that are driving much of the growth you see today.","The products and benefits we've added over the past few years, the relationships we've strengthened and the new customers we've acquired have been showing strong returns, cards in force, built business and earnings per share are back above where they were before we began to reposition the business.","For the last few quarters we've been generating strong growth across our consumer and commercial payments business here in the U.S. and in a range of international markets. You'll be hearing more about that from Jeff. But let me also offer some context on succession which is something the Board and I have been focused on since the day I became CEO. The critical phase of the process has been underway for five plus years. We considered potential candidates from both inside and outside of the company. It has been a very thorough process and involved every member of our Board. They all agreed that Steve is the best person to build on the progress that is now underway.","I know many of you have spent time with Steve over the last few years and there will be many opportunities to meet with him in his new role. Before you hear from him I thought I'd offer a little personal background. Steve caught my attention early in his career back in the 1990s and we've worked closely since the start of my tenure as CEO. He had been responsible for two of our core businesses; merchant services and commercial payments. He had a background in dealing with technology including managing our Y2K transition.","Technology has always been important to American Express and I believe digital innovation was going to be even more important in the years ahead. I also believe Steve was going to be more important in the years ahead. So I asked him to head up our technologies group. I told him this was all about focusing on the future and that it was a big opportunity for him and for the company. Under Steve's leadership the tech organization became the engine that drives almost everything we do today.","So it worked out well for us. It worked out pretty well for Steve too. As he accomplished more and more we asked him to do more and more. That included overseeing the global service network. It included reorganizing commercial payments into one of the fastest growing businesses at American Express. It included leading the company wide effort to improve our operating efficiencies. He has been a great partner and I am delighted as someone with a large ongoing financial interest in the success of this company to turn the reins over to him.","Stephen Squeri","Thanks Ken. I'm honored and humbled that Ken and the Board of Directors have asked me to be the next chairman and CEO of the American Express Company. I've been privileged to work here for over 32 years and through it all I have been constantly reminded how great and truly special this company is. Ken Chenault is one of the most respected business leaders in the world. Working for him for the past 13 years has been an incredible learning experience for me and I plan to draw on that experience as I move forward. When I look ahead I'm very excited about where we are and what our future holds.","We're coming out of a period of transition and moving into a period of growth with tremendous momentum across our businesses. We have a strong leadership team that has instilled a sense of purpose and collaboration across the company. We have talented and engage people in every business all around the world who are resilient, creative and focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders.","Of course there are challenges to face including fierce competition, rapid changes brought about by technological advances and regulatory pressures. However, I've never felt better about our ability to take on those challenges. Our underlying fundamentals, our brand, and our business model is strong and we have no shortage of growth opportunities. Our next chapter will be about building on the momentum we have generated with a special focus on innovation, expanding our core product offerings, enhancing our brand and our customer relationships and partnering with others to stay ahead of the curve in the evolving payments industry.","We will continue pursuing many of our current strategies that show great growth potential and will look for new avenues of growth that can help us extend our leadership position for the long-term. I want to build on what Ken has accomplished without forgetting that the status quo as he often says doesn't cut it in a fast-changing and competitive environment. I'm looking forward to spending time with many of you in my new role.","For now, I want to give you a sense of the items that are front and center in my agenda and where I believe sustainable growth will come from. First we aim to strengthen our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver personalized benefits to customers through the expansion of our closed loop data advantage, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and building our premium lending portfolio through broader relationships with existing customers and industry leading risk management expertise.","Second, we will look to extend our leadership in the commercial payments space globally by leveraging and investing in our unmatched global footprint and commercial capabilities and continuing our emphasis on small and midsized businesses globally by expanding our existing products and services to help them fund and grow their business. Third, we want to continue to make American Express an important part of our customers' digital lives by expanding our digital partnerships and through targeted acquisitions.","Finally, we will focus on becoming the most innovative network by leveraging the fact that we are one integrated business model. We'll help merchants navigate the convergence of online and off-line commerce with cutting-edge fraud protection, marketing insights and digital connections to higher spending card members and we will offer expanded products and services to our GNS partners.","Developing long-term sustainable relationships is key to our business. In every interaction we will continuously strive to provide the world's best customer experience through our best in class global service network. This is a great business model, a world-class brand and extraordinarily talented group of people. I feel very good about our capabilities, what we've accomplished and where we are today.","However, the worlds of commerce and payments are not standing still. As I've learned from Ken, if great businesses don't keep moving forward they fall behind. If great brands don't evolve they lose their luster. If talented people don't innovate they lose their edge. Or said in my own words, you can't seize the future if you are stuck and are wedded to the past. I will continue to challenge our people to think what if, to rethink the possible and to innovate.","Now, let me turn it back to Ken.","Kenneth Chenault","Let me close with a few short comments. First, we're completing one chapter with results that show the upside of managing this business for the moderate to long-term. Second, we're starting the next chapter from a position of strength and third, as I said earlier, it's been a great honor and privilege to lead this company. I've worked alongside some of the best and brightest talent anywhere. I've had the opportunity to partner with some of the world's most innovative and respected companies.","I've been inspired by the thousands of employees around the world who deliver for our customers every day. I owe all of them my sincere thanks. There is always going to be more work to do, but I believe our best days are ahead of us. I will likely see many of you over the next few months, but for now let me say thank you for joining us and turn the call over to Jeff, who is going to discuss the results in more detail and take your questions.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thank you, Ken and Steve and thank you for getting the company to where we are today. Now as all of you might imagine, Ken and Steve have a lot of people to talk to about this news, employees, customers, partners, the media and many more. So we're going to let them go off to attend all of these discussions and Toby and I will stay here to talk to you about our latest financial results and outlook.","I would start by building on what both Ken and Steve said in their remarks and you can see in our performance that our simple financial model is working. We are driving revenue growth across our diverse business, leveraging our fixed cost base to drive expense efficiencies and steadily returning capital to shareholders, all of which are combining to drive the type of steady EPS performance for which American Express has long been known. ","With this as context, let's turn our attention to Slide 3 of our investor presentation where we will jump into our third quarter results. Revenue of $8.4 billion was up 9% versus the third quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of FX where the dollar weakened a bit and versus the prior year for the first time in a while adjusted revenue growth was 8% consistent with the adjusted revenue growth rate from Q2 2017. I'll come back to the drivers of revenue growth in a few minutes, but we are pleased with our steady performance across the different customer segments we serve and the different geographies in which we operate.","Net income grew 19% in the quarter while earnings per share was $1.50 up 25% from the third quarter of 2016 as we continue to steadily buybacks shares. Looking at the income statement many of you will have noted that we had an unusually low tax rate of roughly 26% this quarter. The lower tax rate results primarily from the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current quarter as well as an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. In the quarter we also incurred discrete charges related to our U.S. loyalty coalition business, our U.S. prepaid business and the recent hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. I'll provide a bit more detail on these later in my remarks, but the aggregate impact of these discrete charges equates to approximately $0.12 of earnings per share.","So looking at both the lower tax rate and these discrete charges together the net impact to EPS is minimal and we believe the third quarter EPS of $1.50 is a good indicator of the underlying core performance of the business. These results brought our return on equity for the 12 months ending in September to 23%. This ROE performance is below our historical performance primarily due to the uneven quarterly earnings we experienced last year in 2016. If you simply look at our expected earnings range for the full year 2017 and our equity position, our ROE should trend back towards our historical level as we end the year.","Moving now to our metrics starting with billed business performance trends which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 6. Worldwide FX adjusted Billings grew 8% in the quarter versus the prior year consistent with the adjusted growth rate over the last few quarters. And when we look at the segment view on Slide 5 you see consistent performance across the segments this quarter.","Moving to Slide 6, we have added view of billings growth bringing together several ways we have talked about our broad ranging growth opportunities in recent years. Before we get into the details, let me remind you that our global commercial and global consumer segments are roughly the same size representing 40% and 43% of billings respectively. Global Network Services makes up the remaining 17% of billings.","Within the global commercial segment the first two bars represent customers who are small and midsized enterprises or SMEs defined as clients with less than $300 million in annual revenues. We have consistently seen strong growth of SMEs and this continued in the third quarter. U.S. SME billings grew at 10% in the third quarter while international SME which has been one of our highest growth areas recently was even more robust with FX adjusted growth of 15%.","The large and global customer segment grew at 5% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter up modestly from prior quarters. This customer group represents just 10% of our overall billings but is critical from a scale and relevance perspective, although we expect this segment to show more modest growth rates. Within global consumer the U.S. represents around 31% of the company's billings and is growing at 7%.","Although the U.S. consumer premium space remains competitive, we are seeing strong results in our U.S. consumer platinum franchise. U.S. consumer platinum volumes and the card member numbers continue to be at record levels since we rolled out new features and benefits starting in Q4 last year.","International consumer is up 13% on an FX adjusted basis driven by our operations in countries such as Japan, the UK and Australia all of which are up 18% to 19% adjusted for FX. Keep in mind that these volumes represent our proprietary cards with a closed loop model enables us to offer strong value propositions that are driving billings moment.","Finally, FX adjusted billings growth for our network business was 4% a modest slow down from last quarter and in line with our expectations. As we've said before with evolving regulations in Europe and Australia, we expect network volumes in those geographies to decline over time. As we adapt to these new regulations, we would expect our proprietary international billings to grow faster the network partner billings.","Overall, we feel good about all the diverse sources of growth across our business segments and geographies. Although we have some headwinds from regulation in markets around the world and intense competition in the U.S. we are particularly excited about the opportunities we have in high growth areas like SME and international consumer which reflect the diversity of our business model.","Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7, our loan growth accelerated to 14% on a reported basis and to 13% on an FX adjusted basis. Once again more than 50% of the new loans added to our portfolio are coming from existing customers this quarter in line with the strategy we first laid out in early 2016.","Before we get into our lending metrics, I thought it would be helpful to take a step back and review our overall lending strategy which as a reminder drives just a modest portion of our overall revenues with net interest income coming in at 20% of our total Q3 revenues. Over the last several years and in particular with the portfolio sales last year, the mix of our loan book has changed with cobrand card loans representing a smaller portion of the portfolio and AMEX branded card loans making up a greater portion of the portfolio.","This shift in our portfolio leads to higher yields and as we have said before also higher lost rates. Taken together this generates attractive lending economics and you see the individual dynamics playing out across both our yield and lending credit metrics. For example, on the right side of Slide 07, you can see net interest yield increased again sequentially to 10.7%.","The shift in the portfolio I just described is one of the drivers of this steady sequential increase along with a few other factors we mentioned last quarter, including a shift in the mix of revolving loans towards higher APR\u2019s including having a smaller portion at introductory rates, pricing actions taking in recent quarters, and benchmark interest rates increasing more than our overall funding costs. We are pleased with our progress here, though at some point we expect net interest margin to stabilize and as a result we expect the year-over-year growth in net interest income to slow from current levels.","Turning next to credit metrics, on Slide 08 you see the upward trend as expected consistent with the same shift in the portfolio I just described. The worldwide lending write off rate was 1.8% for the quarter. Let me remind you that if you compare it to last year, the write off rate in Q3, 2016 was slightly elevated due to Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. In the third quarter the delinquency rate was 1.3% in line with our expectations and again higher than the prior year due primarily to the mix shift in the loan portfolio.","Moving to Slide 9 provision expense for the quarter is $769 million and you can clearly see that we continue to build reserves to account for the growth in loans which has exceeded our expectations as well as the related seasoning in our loan portfolio and the mix shift towards AMEX branded products that I just discussed.","A small part of the reserve build also relates to the hurricanes which we estimated at around $20 million in the quarter. This does include an estimate for Puerto Rico where we have a more limited amount of information available. We are of course doing many things to support our card members and merchants and we'll closely monitor the situation in the coming months.","Looking forward, we continue to expect provision to grow at a higher rate than loans as we progress on our lending strategy. So I would expect the year-over-year growth rate in Q4 to move down towards the average for the full year. We feel good about the trade off between risk in the portfolio, profitability and growth and believe we have a long runway to grow our share of our customers' borrowing behaviours.","Turning to our revenue performance, on Slide 10 FX adjusted revenue was up 8%. We are pleased with another quarter of strong revenue growth coming from a broad range of diverse business opportunities.","Looking now at the components of revenue on Slide 11, first discount revenue was up 6% driven by the strong growth in billed business. Net card fees growth was 5%. If you look back to the third quarter last year we had a small non-recurring benefit that we are growing over this quarter.","Considering this, our growth this quarter remains consistent with our recent trends. This quarter also had a very small impact from the platinum fee increase for existing U.S. consumer card members since the results would only show a one month impact for card members whose anniversary date is in September. While it is still early we are pleased to see strong card member engagement, acquisition and renewal trends with the refreshed U.S. consumer platinum value proposition.","Other fees and commissions grew 11% in the second quarter while other revenues declined by 10%. The decline in other revenues was primarily driven by prior year revenue from a small business we sold in Q4 of last year. Net interest income grew by 26% driven by the higher net interest yield, we discussed earlier and higher adjusted loan balances.","Turning to discount rate, on Slide 12 the reported discount rate was 2.42% down five basis points from the prior year and the ratio of discount revenue to billed business was 1.76% down four basis points from last year. You will remember the right side of Slide 12 from our Investor Day this March where we talked about the factors driving erosion in our discount rate.","The biggest drivers of erosion in the third quarter were merchant specific negotiations across the globe and our OptBlue efforts in the U.S. consistent with what we described at the Investor Day in March. In addition to the drivers we described in March, we did see a slightly larger than expected impact from mix in part due to strong growth outside the U.S.","Turning now to expenses on Slide 13, performance varied across the lines and I'll discuss changes to the marketing and promotion rewards and card member services expenses when I come back to spending on card member engagement in just a minute. But first let me cover operating expenses. Total operating expenses were flat to the prior year; however, as I mentioned earlier, there were discrete charges impacting operating expense both this year and last year. In Q3, \u201916 we incurred a restructuring charge related to our initiatives to remove $1 billion from our cost base. In Q3, \u201917 we took discrete charges related to our U.S. loyalty coalition business and our U.S. prepaid business.","In the U.S. loyalty business, you may have recently seen announcement from certain founding partners of Plenti regarding their future loyalty plans. Given these changes, we are in confidential discussions with the few remaining Plenti sponsors regarding the future of the program. As a result of these partner announcements and the evolving state of the U.S. program, we have taken an impairment charge and a related restructuring charge for the U.S. loyalty coalition business this quarter.","Before moving on, I would remind you that we run a similar program Payback in five other countries with a particularly well established long running program in Germany. In the U.S. prepaid business, the charges were related to the recently announced distribution agreement with Inca [ph]. Total operating expenses adjusted for these discrete charges in both years declined by 4% consistent with the year-over-year change on an adjusted basis that we saw in Q2.","We are making solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives and we remain confident that we will remove $1 billion from the company's cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have previously mentioned, given our revenue performance and accelerated progress on our cost savings initiatives, we have taken the opportunity to selectively reinvest into areas of the business that we believe will help drive continued revenue growth going forward.","Finally on Slide 13 as I previously discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% down from 34% a year ago due primarily to the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current year and an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of earnings. Going forward, we estimate our ongoing tax rate will be approximately 32% given the changes to our geographic mix of earnings. Of course the rate in any given period can be further impacted by discrete tax items as we saw in Q3.","Moving to the summary of our card member engagement spending on Slide 14, total engagement spending in Q3 was $3.1 billion flat sequentially and up 11% versus the prior year. Looking at the components of that spending M&P was down 12% versus Q3 \u201916. As a reminder, we expect marketing and promotion to be down significantly for the full year relative to 2016 as we realize efficiencies in our marketing spend and move beyond the unique investment opportunities we had in the second half of 2016.","I would point out that given our overall strong financial performance year-to-date, we have chosen to selectively reinvest into growth opportunities for the medium to long term. As we look at the effectiveness of our marketing spend, we continue to see good progress in attracting new customers. In the quarter, we added 2.6 million new proprietary customers globally. In our global consumer business over two thirds of new customer acquisition came through digital channels and over 35% of new customers were Millennials.","Rewards expense increased 21% in Q3 while proprietary billings grew by 9% versus last year. This growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost proprietary billings of 84 basis points which is up from the prior year, but down two basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in rewards expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S. platinum products that we implemented in Q4 \u201916 as well as strong growth in our Delta cobrand portfolio.","Cost of card member services in the quarter increased 31% reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and cobrand benefits such as first bag free on Delta as well as usage of the new Uber benefit on platinum. This remains an area where we offer differentiated benefits and we plan to continue to invest in Card Member Services.","Turning now to of capital in Slide 15, we continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We've returned 97% of the capital we've generated thus far in 2017 to shareholders which has driven a 5% reduction in our average shares outstanding versus the prior year. The third quarter common equity Tier 1 capital ratio moved down sequentially to 11.9% in line with our expectations and driven by growth in the balance sheet and the fact that we've returned 115% of the capital generated this quarter.","We are confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios in accordance with the annual CCAR review.","To summarize, over the past few years, we've embarked on a series of initiatives to reposition the company and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. These efforts have been targeted at providing a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer term. We are seeing the payoff in our 2017 results with the strong and consistent performance over the first three quarters.","Given these strong results and where we are in the year, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.80 to $5.90. we are pleased to be able to both raise our earnings expectations while also funding some incremental investments aimed at driving moderate to long term results.","It has long been our practice to balance the financial commitments we have in the short term which we take very seriously with the opportunities we see to invest and build for the longer term. As we go forward, we are focused on delivering steady and consistent earnings growth, building upon the range of growth opportunities that we see across our diverse customer segments and geographies.","With that, let me turn it back over to Toby as we move to Q&A.","Toby Willard","Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question. Thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions for Jeff on the quarter's results. Cathy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good results and congratulations to Stephen and Ken, if they catch the replay or read the transcript. Jeff, I wanted to make sure I understood your comments on the provision. It sounds like this quarter's elevated levels were related to a little bit of an expectation of higher charge offs in the future as you expect the provision to come down next quarter in terms of the growth rate. Can you just help us think about, where you see the net charge off rate going over the next 12 months?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, so thank you Sanjay for the question and a couple of comments. First, I'd remind everyone that I've often said there's a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter in the provision, so I encourage people to think a little bit about the longer term trends. If you look at year-to-date the provisions are up 37% loans are up 14% and as I said I would expect the year-over-year increase provision to look more like that year-to-date number in Q4.","Next thing I'd say is, remember there's a real tie here if you think about this shift that has occurred in our loan portfolio between the yields, the write off rates and so one of the inflection points in our growth rates was around 18 to 24 months ago and we were very focused on all the changes occurring as we went through the transitions around our cobrand portfolios.","A lot of the newer accounts that we acquired in that time are just hitting sort of a key point in the seasoning timeline 18 to 24 months and frankly that's part of what's driving yield up as they come off introductory rates and start paying off, and frankly that's also what's giving us a little visibility into what the right future expected write offs are and that's a little bit of what drove the provision up this quarter. So I think it's very important to keep those two things in mind we're getting attractive economics overall.","As I think about net write-offs going forward, I think Sanjay if you think back we in early \u201916 seeing all the changes we were making began to say that we'd expect to see modest steady upward drift as we grow a little bit above the industry and as that drives the inevitable seasoning of the portfolio any bigger portion of the portfolio being lower tenure, that actually didn't happen much in 2016 has now begun to happen in 2017 and I really expect similar trends to continue as we get into 2018. So hopefully that helps on the provision.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Mauer with Autonomous Research. Go ahead please.","Jeff Campbell","Hi Craig.","Craig Mauer","Yes, thanks. Hey how are you Jeff? And I'll add my congratulations if they're listening, but I doubt it.","Jeff Campbell","Yes, you are right. They will read every word of the transcript.","Craig Mauer","So they have it okay. You're talking about reinvestment where appropriate. I was hoping you could be more specific because the read we seem to be getting on the U.S. consumer market is that there's certainly been a plateauing effect in rewards. In fact it seems like some of the most aggressive players over the last few years have been rationalizing their investment because the returns might not have been what they thought they were going to be or that consumers outsmarted them to a degree just at a time when platinum is accelerated. So are you pushing the gas pedal down further in that part of the business or are there other parts of the business that you're finding more attractive right now?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, it\u2019s an excellent question Craig and I think this really goes to the unusually broad range of both customer segments and geographies that our business encompasses. And so yes, as we have had stronger financial performance than we've expected this year we are putting a little bit to the bottom line and that's the increase in guidance and we're also putting a little bit into the M&P line and a little bit into some things that are in OpEx. And if you think about that, where the particularly high growth areas that we've seen lately, well in particular I called out in my remarks, the small and medium sized enterprise space both in the U.S. and internationally as well as the proprietary international consumer space.","And so, those are - we see those as particularly good growth opportunities for us and as we have thought about where might there be a really good return over the medium to long term spending a little bit of incremental resource is those kind of areas and some of that goes into M&P and some of it also goes in OpEx. Right?","When you start talking about the commercial space you're often talking about sales people who run through OpEx, you\u2019re talking about how we use our call centers to help drive more volumes that time and that runs through OpEx, so it's a mixture. But we are as you would expect being very thoughtful about putting incremental dollars only in those places where we think there are particularly good returns for us right now and where we have a unique position or unique advantage.","Craig Mauer","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good evening, Jeff and congrats to Ken and Steve. I guess just in terms of the guidance you noted that you are raising the guidance, it seems like the business momentum is strong revenue growth has remained over 8%. I guess you made some remarks about NII over time and the growth also, but can you just talk about your ability to sustain these levels of growth both top line and bottom line as we move into '18 given that you're making some incremental investments which in theory should drive revenue growth over the short and intermediate time or would you expect some more time to move more back to the interim goals of 6% top line and 10% bottom line? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Yes, so boy there's a lot there in that question and I think. Let me start with revenues and then work my way to the bottom line. We're really pleased by the 8% revenue growth that we've seen the last two quarters and we have tremendous momentum across all of our businesses just like they did last quarter. I have pointed out that at some point the tremendous sequential growth you've seen in our net interest field will start to plateau and slow down a little bit and that will have an effect of slowing the revenue growth rate a little bit.","Not calling out exactly when that turn happens it sort of didn't happen this quarter, but at some point it will slow us down a little bit. Similarly in 2017 thus far you've seen a particularly nice uplift in the U.S. from both the consumer and the business platinum value proposition changes we made late last year and early this year.","At some point again, you will begin to lap those, although I would remind you on a consumer platinum product that is a long lapping process because the fee increase for existing customers only went into effect beginning with customers who had their renewal dates in September, so it will actually play out over the next, the way the accounting works, the next 24 months. So those two things over time will put a little bit of downward pressure on the current momentum you have at 8%.","Now you also something\u2019s next year that will go the other way, so we are really pleased with the announcement we made along with Hilton a few months ago that point we will have an expanded partnership with Hilton in 2018 and we will become the sole cobrand provider and that will certainly provide some incremental revenue opportunities for us in 2018. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that as you would expect for cobrand renewals in recent years that also comes with the margin compression we're very pleased with that opportunity.","So exactly were all that comes out in 2018 in terms of revenue growth we'll give you an update on the January call, but we feel good about the momentum and those are probably the three things that at the margin to move it a little up and a little down as you get into next year. And I guess I should also point out I'm making all my comments ignoring any changes that new rev reg rules might cause which would just be geography anyway.","Bottom line look I think we have a long track record that we are showing renewed vigor on this year in that our model let's us get tremendous expense leverage and the kind of spend centric model we have does not require a lot of capital support balance growth each year which lets us do lots of share repurchase and payment of dividend. So that's the model and we should consistently be able to turn good revenue growth into even better EPS growth exactly what that looks like for 2018 we'll let you know as we get into the January earnings call.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for the color, Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.","Betsy Graseck","Hi good evening.","Jeff Campbell","Hi Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Could we talk a little bit about the funding side, I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about deposit growth bills, it's been very strong this quarter, just wondering if you're looking to first continue that kind of growth rate or do you feel good about where your loan to deposit ratios are today and what kind of pricing, you feel you need to attract deposits and where deposit base are going over the course of next year if there's another one or two rate hikes?","Jeff Campbell","So just the level set for everyone it\u2019s for us if you think about the 100 basis points that the Fed has raised rates over the last almost two years, we\u2019ve as they have gone up, as the Fed has gone up 100 basis points we\u2019ve raised rates on our personal savings programs about 35 basis points, so that certainly has been a big positive for our results.","Now I would not expect the beta if you were to remain at 0.35 forever going forward. On many occasions in these calls, I have talked about a 0.7 beta over the longer term that we use in a lot of our modelling. Obviously, you will have to see exactly where the industry grows, our goal would remain competitive.","In terms of balances, for the last couple of years Betsy, we've said we're kind of comfortable where we were because we want to remain very active in both the asset backed securities market as well as the unsecured market and being active in all three markets is an important part of our funding strategy.","I would say as we get into the latter part of 2018 and beyond, I would expect to see us growing personal savings again at levels that we haven't in a number of the years. And so that\u2019s not something you'll see next quarter or early 2018 but I would say over the course of the next 12 to 18 months you will see some significant growth there exactly how much will be a little bit of a function of where the rate environment goes both in terms of the base level of what the Fed does as well as what the competitive market does for these kinds of online accounts.","Betsy Graseck","You are trying to get the loan to deposit ratio up perhaps is that the reason for that?","Jeff Campbell","Well, the way we really think about it Betsy is I come back to given our mix of business, we probably think of it less as a loan to deposit ratio and we think of - we want a funding strategy that creates a balance of being diversified across different sources in different markets so that from a security and installment perspective no matter what happens in the capital markets, we have good access to capital and we want to do that while also being efficient about funding our diverse business model.","And I think what people forget sometimes is because we have a big international business, because we have a corporate card business, our funding structure requires that we access different sources of funding in different places that our funding is not all fundable. So that\u2019s really how we approach it and what I say is the personal savings rate or number which has been in the $30 billion number for a while range that is a number that I would expect to go up over the next 12 to 24 months.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Don Fandetti","Thank you. Congratulations to both Ken and Steve. So Jeff on that note, how do you make sure that a big management change like this doesn't have any impact on negotiations around let's say the Starwood deal?","Jeff Campbell","Well there's probably two questions there. First, gosh I'm going to go back to the thing Ken and Steve said. Steve's story has worked hand in hand with Ken now for 32 years and has been intimately involved in every change that we've made in particular over the last couple of years. So I don't think we missed a beat on any aspect of running the business. As I say that I also think it's important to remind you Steve\u2019s words that we fully understand though that doesn't mean you don't constantly have to change, you can't stand still. So I feel really good about all that.","In terms of Marriott and SPG, look we said for a long time that there are three possible outcomes here. Right? Marriott chooses to keep two cobrand partners they go with the other cobrand partner or they go with us.","I will acknowledge we are the smaller of the two partners, on the other hand Marriott has made a lot of public statements here about the fact that they want to bring the two programs together next year, that our contract doesn't expire until 2020, the other cobrand bank, their contract expires next year.","So we have been working really hard to demonstrate the tremendous value that the range of travel assets we have consumer travel agencies, business travel agency a huge membership reward program, a premium oriented customer base, we think goes a really tremendous assets when you're talking about a travel cobrand we think they've been a really important part of what has made SPG a really powerful program and I think Marriott is very focused on making sure they keep the loyalty and the engagement of all those SPG card members and we would love to be a part of it. So still we will have to see where it goes but I don't think we'll miss a beat there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Yes thanks. Jeff when I studied your conference last month it sounded like you saw the NIM was already kind of at a level where it might have plateaued, yet you had another big step up this quarter and it also sounds like you are not necessarily closing the door of an ocean that could have a little bit more upside there.","First I just wanted to get your reaction, am I recalling that correctly and if so what if anything has kind of changed the outlook and kind of what specifically really was the driver of the strength of this quarter?","Jeff Campbell","Well you are completely accurately recalling my comments, the public comments from your conference a little bit ago. I think the important word here which they tried to replicate in my remarks earlier this afternoon are that at some point obviously you can't raise your net interest yield forever.","At some point it has to plateau now we\u2019re working hard to try to continue to do smart things that are consistent with building long term customer engagement and loyalty that will continue to drive net interest yield up, but at some point it will plateau, now we're wI\u2019m not calling exactly when that happens and it certainly did not happened this quarter and we're really pleased with the momentum we have.","Mark DeVries","Okay, thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you, we'll go next to Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Go ahead please.","Chris Brendler","Hi thanks, good evening and thanks or taking my question. Jeff, I wanted to talk to you or ask about discount revenue and the trajectory there, if I look at discount revenue net of rewards it is actually still shrinking about 3% and 5% including the services line. And I know we faced some challenges at Costco but we\u2019re kind of beyond that and you've got some renegotiations in Europe and other things that are weighing on discount rate, but is that a lot and it should start to grow again as we go forward because and I would think that's something that would be a focus of yours, instead of growing the discount revenue net of rewards is kind of my area of question? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well, believe me it is a focus and yes, I don't know the exact math, you just yes directionally you're correct, the thing you need to remember we made a very conscious decision late last year, early this year to make some significant value proposition enhancements in the U.S. in both the business platinum card and the consumer platinum card and those are both very substantial and material franchises for us.","So it worked tremendously well, we've really exceeded our own expectations even in terms of card member engagement and new card member acquisition as well as continued really de minimis attrition rates.","Until you are done lapping that increase in rewards cost, you get the effect you just described on discount revenue overall. So look there it is a competitive environment in all the markets we serve, but particularly competitive in the U.S. consumer space, but once you're done lapping these, you should begin to see a little different trend when you do the calculation that you just described and certainly our goal across the globe is to get that discount revenue net of rewards number growing consistently.","Chris Brendler","And I would think that would \u2013 So Jeff are there some one-time costs associated with this, I would think those rewards costs would be perpetual if you're increasing the value of the products and the value of the spending you wouldn't necessarily have an anniversary. There may be some one-time costs that you\u2026","Jeff Campbell","Yes, but when you're looking at year-over-year growth remember you have a big step-up in the rewards cost this year and a kind of what I'm going to call standard step up in discount revenue and what we would expect to see once you've done lapping that as you're still on the same somewhat similar trajectory in terms of your gross discount revenues but growing but your rewards costs don't have the huge spike in growth that they have this year.","If you think about it that the in my remarks I think the numbers I called out were or its costs are up 19% well the 21% while the associated billings are up much less. So that relationship as we go into the next quarter or two will get much more aligned again and that will change the phenomenon you described.","Chris Brendler","Excellent, I'm looking forward to that, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.","Ken Bruce","Thank you, good evening and congratulations to Ken and Steve. My question really relates to reserving obviously the loss rates for American Express are quite low relative to the industry and you've kind of talked about that the increase that you're looking for. I guess I'm trying to understand kind of the reserving that you're anticipating sometimes companies use 12 months, sometimes little longer. Can you give us any kind of sense as to how you're thinking about that reserve because it looks like a very large build, no matter how you want to look at it this quarter.","Jeff Campbell","The reserving process can [indiscernible] went through in great detail and as it is both a heavily regulated process not just by the usual accounting standards you would expect but also heavily by our regulators and some what we do is very much driven by them. Look there's no question this was a big reserve build this quarter. What I keep coming back to is the when you put aside there's a little quarter-to-quarter volatility and you look at this over any given couple of quarters we're trending as we would have expected.","We are pleased with the loan growth we are seeing overall. The shift in portfolio mix is an important part of what is driving tremendous growth and net interest yield and that comes with some growth in the write offs and we are getting as I explained earlier to this point where A significant number of the newer accounts we brought on 18 to 24 months ago are getting to be a key part of the time line as they season and so we're building some reserves for that and that's part of what's driving the yield up as well.","So there is really not a lot more to the storey. I mean, yes we certainly look at what kind of coverage we have going forward, although we've made different judgments and charts versus lends in different parts of the world. But we feel good about the reserves. We think they're conservative and we feel good about the overall economics that we're getting from our lending.","Ken Bruce","Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Hi, great, thanks. I wanted to come back to Chris's question about the rewards costs and you had mentioned that it was down a couple of basis points from the second quarter in terms of the rewards costs and maybe I saw in the notes here that the ultimate redemption rate was stable. Did you discuss whether that was an impact from the cost per point or something else that's going on and how that might kind of move around going forward?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, so I you know, yes you're right most of the - there was a small sequential decline, I think what you're calling out is the ratio of the rewards costs to the billings, there's a little quarter-to-quarter volatility it\u2019s a very complex calculation that of course is not just US calculation but it involves lots of other international markets that you\u2019re doing the calculation by market. So you get a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter. I would not want anyone to leave the call thinking that 84 basis points is exactly what you should expect forever going forward it'll bounce up and down a few basis points each quarter.","In general though, that's the range I would expect to be in given all the value propositions that we have in the marketplace today and I wouldn't point to any particular business change or anything that drove that 2 basis points sequential decline Moshe.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead please.","Rick Shane","Thanks for taking my question and obviously congratulations to Ken and Steve both well deserved. I wanted to talk a little bit about incentives and one of the things we've seen over the last several years is there's been a distortion between I would describe rewards and loyalty and as the rewards sort of war of being it's a little bit, are you starting to see brand loyalty become more and important again and are you seeing any shift in terms of wallet share amongst your existing customers based upon that?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I guess Rick, let me make a few comments and they may or may not be responsive to exactly where you're going. Certainly we believe both Ken and Steve in their remarks talked about the fact that we think we have a particularly strong brand in our customers given our long standing reputation for service attach to our brand and we take that loyalty really seriously and really value it and work very hard at it.","And one of the things that we've talked about on many of these calls is that sometimes people will do a pure mathematical calculation of different products that are out there in the marketplace and say gee, American Express you can't possibly compete because let's use this simplest category because your cash back card doesn't seem to be as rich as somebody else's. And yet our response to that is often well our cash back cards are doing really good in terms of new customer acquisitions. They're growing nicely and they're producing really good economics for us.","And one of the things I like to point out internally is we do believe there is value in the brand. We do believe there's value in the range of services we provide and so by gosh, we should be able to get those things valued by customers and we shouldn't have to necessarily mathematically match every other aspect of the value proposition that\u2019s some of our competitors put in the marketplace. So I think frankly Rick we see that longstanding view we have, our longstanding experience, this proves that brand does matter and loyalty does matter we work really hard at doing things that build upon that.","If you think about the platinum refreshes that we've done there, very much focused on some of the aspects, the experiential aspects of the product that we think are more difficult for others to replicate in build upon some of our reputation. So that\u2019s what we're trying to do every day. We think is what we've historically done and we think it gives us some unique advantages that are not easy for others to replicate.","Rick Shane","Jeff, look I agree with that, and I'm specifically curious if you're seen as that sort of distortion normalizes specifically any pick up in wallets I know that's been a big focus for you guys?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, well, you know, gosh in a company with over $100 million card members major trends evolve slowly. Yes we're very focused on attracting more wallet share. We're also in our consumer business very focused on attracting more borrowing share and so we have clearly been making huge strides for the last several years and driving more borrowing share in terms of our card members wallets and spending sure you kind of have to look at it by market by commercial versus consumer.","I often say Rick, our goal is to ultimately maximize our financial returns and to maximize our revenue share and we pay attention to our wallet share. We pay attention to our share of billings. We pay attention to our share of lending and certainly in the U.S. consumer space we're growing share like crazy in our share of lending. But we're not always trying to maximize every one of those if we don't think it's economic. So we feel good about our revenue performance and we think it's building on a good economics for us so.","Rick Shane","Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Rick. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Go ahead please.","Bob Napoli","Thank you and congratulations to Ken and Steve, not a big surprise I guess after my last conversation with you guys. But just on page six, very helpful just on going through that. I'd just like little more color on the growth in your presentation there looking at the SME, U.S. SME, international SME, international consumer we have some pretty high growth rates and then the deceleration in Global Network Services. Is that - are we - is there a multiyear opportunity in each of these that are much larger that I mean I think the opportunity seemed to be very large, but do we have a long way to go, long runway in the growth of these higher growth segments and should we expect GNS to continue become less important?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, so couple comments. Yes, we see tremendous growth opportunities that will last a very, very long time in the SME space because the point we try to make over and over and over to people as far as you know is that in that space we\u2019re often competing against just trying to get small and mid-sized enterprises to put more of their payment needs onto the card and it's frankly less about the competition, less about some of the highly competitive rewards competition we face elsewhere and the growth rates you\u2019ve seen in both the U.S. and international SME segments have been very high for some number of years.","They're driven by our continual ability to work with small and mid-sized enterprises to drive more spend onto the card and we think despite that we've only captured a small fraction of their spend and we can keep at this for years. Similarly when you go outside the U.S., but because of evolving regulation in Europe, in Australia for some time let's see exactly how long it takes because there is a little bit of a wind down of the network business in those two parts of the world. It\u2019s still growing really nicely everywhere else and it's still globally an important part of the American Express network. Right? So I don't want anyone to walk away from this call thinking it's a less important part of our company, it\u2019s really important to the global network.","You're just going to see modest overall growth rates because of the step down in Europe and Australia. That very step down though in the evolving regulatory climate is part of what's helping fuel some tremendous growth rates in places like the U.K. and Australia in our proprietary card business where of course we also get a much greater share of the overall economics. So that\u2019s a pretty good trade for us.","Bob Napoli","That international consumer segment as well Jeff, longer term what you know has that had the same growth opportunities as SME?","A - Jeff Campbell","Absolutely, absolutely because remember outside the U.S., our consumer businesses are still in what I often call Bob an earlier stage of growth. We're growing faster than the market in every of the major countries that we do business in with the exception of Canada. And yes, we still have pretty small market shares, we have value propositions that are very difficult for others to match, we're very bullish about that business.","Bob Napoli","Great, I appreciate your comments, thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thank you, Bob.","Toby Willard","Hi Cathy, we have time for just one more question, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.","David Togut","Thanks Jeff and congrats to Steve and Ken as well. I\u2019m curious for your thoughts about any additional cost takeout you might have in 2018 in addition to the $1 billion run rate you expect to hit at the end of this year?","Jeff Campbell","So look, we feel really good about the hard work that it's been over the last two years to take yet another billion dollars out of the run rate of the company and we're on track, we\u2019ll get it. when you go beyond that David, what I always say is what you can always take cost out of the company, it\u2019s not always prudent though and I think when you go beyond 2017, the way to think about it is in a world where we're seeing the kind of revenue growth now we can support that and we will support that with very little growth in operating expenses and so that\u2019s a tremendous ongoing story of operating leverage.","For now, I think saying that we're going to take out another billion dollars would probably not be prudent and we would lose more revenue than we would gain. But steady operating leverage, you should absolutely expect from us.","David Togut","Understood, thank you very much.","Jeff Campbell","Thank you.","Toby Willard","Thank you everybody for joining tonight's call and thanks for your continued interest in American Express.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) And also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead, sir.","Rick Petrino","Thank you and welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s other reports already on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our Web site at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to be here today to report on another solid quarter of financial results by American Express. Our performance this quarter reflected higher spending by our card members, solid growth in loan balances, credit indicators at or near historical lows, disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the past year.","Our earnings per share growth of 12% outpaced revenue growth, once again reflecting the benefits of disciplined operating expense control and our share repurchase program. We also made progress on several newer fronts this quarter attracting additional partners to our OptBlue program, acquiring new card members on our EveryDay product and participating in the upcoming Apple Pay Global Wallet launch.","Also during the quarter SAP announced its proposed acquisition of Concur Technologies, which as it closes will produce a significant gain for us given our long-standing ownership position in and operating partnership with Concur. I'll discuss each of these items in further detail later on the call.","Stepping back a bit. On a year-to-date basis we have been able to drive strong EPS growth within our 12% to 15% long-term target range despite having adjusted revenue growth remain below our long-term targets at approximately 5%. As we have shown over the last two years, the different levers we have to drive earnings performance in a relatively slow growth environment have been a huge asset. We are beginning to see some modest acceleration in our volumes but revenue is not yet growing as fast as we and I suspect you, would like to see.","Our challenge will be to continue to deliver in an environment that may be characterized by modest global economic growth and more intense competition. While this quarter did not include the many significant items related to the business travel joint venture that complicated our Q2 results, it is the first quarter that business travel was not consolidated within our P&L. You will notice that this change particularly impacts the year-over-year comparisons for both our revenue and expense lines which I'll discuss in further detail as we review the results. To help you reconcile these impacts, I would point you to annex 6 at the back of our slide presentation which provides the historical P&L performance of business travel by quarter.","Now turning to our summary financial performance on Slide 2. FX adjusted billed business growth increased slightly to 10% during the current quarter including some acceleration in international markets. Reported revenue was flat to last year but was up 5% if you adjust for business travel and it rounds to 6% when you also adjust for FX, given the strengthening dollar we saw as the quarter progressed.","Pretax income rose by 12% during the quarter while net income was only up 8% due to the lower tax rate we experienced last year. In contrast to this year-over-year tax challenge, helping our EPS is the fact that over the last four quarters we have repurchased $4 billion of common shares. This translated into a 3% decrease in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. Altogether, these factors drove diluted EPS of $1.40 which is 12% higher than the prior year. I will note that these quarterly results do include some ongoing transition expenses related to the business travel joint venture. Although this impact was partially offset this quarter by a small gain related to the transaction that was not realized until this quarter. These results also brought our return on equity for the period ended September 30 to 29%, well above are on average and over time target of 25%.","Now turning to a more detailed review of our key performance metrics, I'll begin with billed business on Slide 3. Billed business growth increased to 10% on an FX adjusted basis versus 9% in Q2. Due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar that is of course impacting many companies this quarter, billed business growth on a reported basis remain consistent with the prior quarter at 9%.","In the U.S., total billings growth improved by 80 basis points versus the prior quarter but the overall rate still rounded to 9%. U.S. corporate and small business is spending both accelerated and had double-digit growth rates during the quarter. Outside the U.S. our volumes continued to grow at a faster pace than the total company. Billed business growth increased to 11% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis, up from 9% of quarter. The improvement was primarily seen in the JAPA region where volume growth was 16% this quarter. We continued to see very strong volumes in China and also saw improved growth in Australia and Korea.","Moving to billed business by segment on Slide 4. GNS continues to be our fastest growth segment with volumes increasing by 17% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis. The strong performance in GNS was primarily driven by the growth in China and Korea that I just mentioned. I would also remind you that the marginal contribution from each dollar of GNS billings can differ significantly by international markets. For example, all foreign payment players currently operate at little to no margin on spending in China. But for longer-term strategic reasons, China is clearly a market we will remain focused on and we are pleased with the presence we are building there.","Moving to Slide 5. Loan growth remains consistent with last quarter and was up 5% versus last year on a worldwide basis and 6% in the U.S. Our loan growth continues to outpace the industry with the differential remaining relatively constant as industry loan growth has also improved recently. We are continuously focused on spend growth while also accommodating our customers borrowing needs. As part of our initiatives to have the American Express brand to become ever more welcoming and inclusive, we are reaching out to a broader demographic of potential customers. For some of these new card members, the ability to revolve a balance may be a more significant consideration.","Importantly, we think we can attract these new customers without significantly changing the overall credit profile of the company. Our new EveryDay product is an excellent example of this strategy. The product is focused on driving every day spending behavior while providing the ability to revolve a balance if needed. We are not changing our credit standards for EveryDay. These customers would generally have qualified for our products but did not believe we had a card that met their needs. It's still early days for the EveryDay product but it has performed better than our initial expectations since its launch earlier this year.","Moving to our P&L performance on Slide 6. As you mentioned, reported revenue growth was impacted by the business travel joint venture. Excluding business travel revenue from prior year results, Q3 adjusted revenue growth was 5%. As you would expect given our spend centric model, this growth was primarily driven by greater discount revenue from higher billed business volumes. We did see billed business growth exceed discount revenue growth by a bit more than in recent quarters. This was driven in part by our lower discount rate which was down 3 basis points versus the prior year and continues to be driven in part by our ongoing mix shift in volumes towards more retail and every day spend which tend to have lower discount rates.","We are also beginning to see a modest impact on the discount rate related to the OptBlue program. During the quarter we made excellent progress adding new OptBlue partners including Wells Fargo, Elavon and TSYS. At this point, eight of the top ten U.S. merchant acquirers are now part of the program. OptBlue merchant acquirers are actively signing new merchants onto the American Express network. This has resulted in some modest incremental pressure on the discount rate. But I would remind you that a portion of this impact is offset through reduced operating expenses as we eliminate some of the various incentives we previously paid to the acquirers and the OptBlue merchant acquirers assume both servicing and credit responsibilities. We continue to believe that OptBlue will bring incremental volumes onto our network and provide attractive economics for our business.","Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was the accelerated growth of our GNS business, where we share the discount revenue we earn from merchants with our issuing bank partners. Last, faster growth in contra revenue items including corporate client incentives and strong growth in our cash rebate rewards products, also contributed to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth.","Turning to other revenue lines. Net interest income was the other primary driver of revenue growth. Growing 9% as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an increase in average loan balances. Finally, as expected, travel commissions and fees declined significantly this quarter as the revenues associated with business travel were no longer consolidated in our P&L.","Turning now to credit performance on Side 7. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain near or at historically low levels. Worldwide lending write-off rates declined further during the quarter to 1.5% while delinquency rates remained relatively constant with recent periods at 1.1%. As a reminder, our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics on our portfolio. Therefore at some point we would expect that write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels.","Slide 8 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels. Coverage levels were relatively consistent with prior periods. We believe the remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.","On Slide 9, you can see that the total amount of provision has been very consistent over the past several quarters. The fact that our overall credit performance has become more stable and our loan portfolio is growing, resulted in a smaller reserve release this quarter than a year ago which was the primary driver of the 16% year-over-year increase in provision.","Moving next to total expenses on Slide 10. On a reported basis expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year. Excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year, total expenses increased by 1%. As you can see, operating expenses were down 11%. But this reported growth rate benefited, of course, from the impact of the business travel joint venture. Excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year, operating expenses were flat to 2013. Clearly, maintaining disciplined control of our expenses, particularly operating expenses, remains a key driver behind our earnings growth. I will come back to operating expenses and to the marketing and promotion line where expenses were relatively consistent with last year, in a few minutes.","To touch first, however, on a few other items on Slide 10. Rewards expense grew by 5% which was slightly lower than reported billed business growth. We would not usually expect rewards to grow at a slower rate than proprietary billings as this quarter's results were impacted by the true up of certain rewards related reserves.","Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 34.2% which is higher than the 31.8% rate that we experienced during the third quarter of 2013 but in line with our prior expectation that our tax rate for 2014 could be closer to the mid-30s.","To return now to our efforts to grow the business through marketing and promotion. Slide 11 shows that these expenses were $809 million this quarter and around similar to the levels seen in the second half of last year. As expected, these expenses are down sequentially versus Q2 since marketing and promotion was higher during Q2 as we reinvested a substantial portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives. We continue to believe that we have a number of attractive investment opportunities across both our core businesses and from newer initiatives.","Looking forward, you will likely see an increase in marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 due to the dynamics associated with our investment in Concur. So let me provide you with some background about our relationship with Concur. Back in 2008, we entered into an operating agreement with and made a strategic investment in Concur. The relationship enables us to offer corporate customers an integrated system to make their expense and business travel reporting easier. Importantly, it also provides Concur with the opportunity to significantly grow the scale of their business. Our relationship has been highly successful and has created significant value for our shareholders.","During September, SAP announced that they would be acquiring Concur in a deal that valued the company at $129 per share. If this proposed transaction is completed, it would result in a sizable gain for American Express of approximately $700 million. Currently, Concur and SAP's public expectation is that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2015. Our operating agreements with Concur will continue after the transaction is completed and we look forward to partnering with both Concur and SAP in the future.","Given that the proposed Concur acquisition was just announced a few weeks ago, we are still in the process of determining exactly how we can best utilize the gain from the transaction. But looking forward, as we have done with similar items in the past, we do plan to leverage the favorable impact from the gain to invest in business building activities and initiatives designed to improve operating efficiencies. Potential growth initiatives could include incremental customer acquisition activities across our core businesses as well as investments to strengthen partner relationships.","In line with our evolving customer and business needs, we would also likely fund initiatives designed to improve our efficiency and contain operating expenses going forward. These investments will provide valuable flexibility to deal proactively with the global regulatory and competitive environment that is rapidly changing, particularly in economies that may continue to grow at only a modest pace.","Turning now to our operating expense performance on Slide 12. As I mentioned, operating expenses were down 11% on a reported basis and were flat versus last year when excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year. The results clearly demonstrate that disciplined control of operating expenses remains a top priority for us and we continue to seek ways to increase the efficiency of our organization. The impact of business travel varied somewhat by operating expense line. While the majority of the prior year expenses were within salaries and benefits, the impact is sufficiently spread across all expense categories such that line-by-line comparisons are difficult.","I'll also note that operating expenses in the current year include a small amount of ongoing transition another expenses related to the joint venture. We have an agreement with the joint venture whereby they reimburse us a portion of these expenses as business travel transitions to its new operating structure. These reimbursements are recorded within other revenue. On a year to date basis, operating expenses remain well-controlled and on an adjusted basis are flat to 2013 as shown on Slide 13. I'll remind you that while our annual target was for operating expenses to grow by less than 3% during 2014, our year-to-date performance suggests we are on track to come in well below that.","We also continue to achieve our reengineering and cost targets while not just maintaining but actually improving the level of service provided to our customers. As a result of these improvements, customer service remained a key competitive differentiator for American Express.","Now let's turn to capital. The substantial amount of new capital we generate provides us with significant flexibility, as shown on Slide 14. This quarter we were able to return 89% of the capital we generated to shareholders while also maintaining our strong capital ratios.","Turning than to Slide 15, which shows the impact of Basel III on several minimum capital ratios. As you know, under Basel I the minimum threshold for the tier 1 ratio was 100 basis points lower than that for the minimum tier 1 common ratio. As a result, for American Express the tier 1 ratio historically has never been a binding constant in our capital planning. But as you also know, the requirement for the tier 1 ratio under Basel III is now 150 basis points higher than the common equity tier 1 ratio. Given this relationship, we believe that our capital structure should ultimately include eligible preferred to fund this 150 basis point differential.","When you look across the industry, you see that a majority of large financial institutions have included preferred stock in the non-common tier 1 component of their capital structures. Most importantly, the Fed has started using these new minimums to assess capital adequacy and approve capital actions in the CCAR process. As a result of all these changes, or 2014 CCAR submission included the planned issuance of some preferred shares. We anticipate that this issuance will occur over the next two quarters subject to market conditions.","Looking forward, we continue to plan for a 2015 CCAR submission and remain committed to maintaining our strong capital position while leveraging that strength to create value for our shareholders. I will also note that we just entered into parallel run under the Basel III advance approaches in Q1 and it is too early for us to provide a reliable estimate of its ultimate impact on our capital ratios. As you know, the advanced approaches rules are highly complex and we continue to work with our regulators to clarify certain aspects of these rules.","Leaving capital than let me provide an update on a few other items before concluding. First, the highly speculated upon launch of an Apple Mobile Wallet occurred this quarter with the rollout of Apple Pay which Apple expects to go live later this month. We are participating in the wallet because we want to be everywhere our customers are and millions of them are devoted Apple users. The mobile wallets have had the potential to change consumer behavior for some years but it's unlikely to be an overnight shot. It will take time even with Apple's innovative technology and customer base. The pace of consumer and merchant adoption will depend on the benefits, protection and overall value proposition that participating issuers and networks can provide. That plays to our strength.","With Apple Pay we are keeping our closed loop advantage intact and the retaining direct relationships with card members and merchants. In addition, the capabilities that we will be integrating into Apple Pay are a foundation that can be used to fuel our growth in mobile payments more broadly in the longer-term.","Next, I wanted to touch on the pending loss of our relationship with Costco in Canada. While we are disappointed that we will longer continue this partnership in Canada, we are excited about the launch of our new cash back product in the Canadian market and are focused on retaining many of our customers. I will note that we have separate agreements with Costco in each of the several markets where we maintain a partnership and have a longer and more significant relationship with Costco in the U.S. dating back over 15 years.","As with any long-term partnership, we work with Costco on an ongoing basis to find ways to drive value for both parties going forward, never losing sight of the fact that we are serving the same customers. Many of you are aware the environment for co-branded products has become increasingly competitive. From our side, we remain focused on developing attractive value propositions for our card members and co-brand partners that still drive strong economics for our shareholders.","Finally, as you are aware, our trial with the DoJ concluded last week when both sides presented their closing arguments. We are now waiting for the judge to issue his decision, which could take several months or longer to complete. There will then be a lengthy appeals process in all likelihood as either side has the right to appeal. Much as we would like to, I don't think it's appropriate or beneficial for us to speculate or offer any color commentary on any of the specific testimony. We believe that our legal defense is a strong but ultimately that will be up to the courts to decide.","So in summary. Coming back to results we feel good about our overall performance in the current economic environment. Revenue growth adjusted for the impact of the business travel joint venture and FX increased to 6% reflecting the growth we saw in billings and loans this quarter. This revenue growth combined with historically low credit metrics, disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong capital position, allowed us to generate strong growth in EPS.","So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, so that we can ensure with you as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","A couple of questions. One is on the discount rate and the different programs. You did a great job of outlining the puts and takes on what's driving the discount rate down broadly, and then talked through how those programs also drive down lower operating expenses. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of, all in, where the pretax margin goes, including not only the discount rate side but the operating expense side as a total package.","Jeff Campbell","So if you go back, Betsy, to when we first talked about the economics of OptBlue which I believe was at the financial community meeting in February. We pointed out that, you are correct, there is a partial offset to the decline in discount rate because certain other payments we have been making to the merchant acquirers which run through operating expenses we would no longer be making. Now that is not a complete offset, it's a partial offset. Our strong belief in the overall positive economics of the OptBlue program depend upon our belief that with expended merchant coverage, and over the course of the next several years we believe this program in the U.S. has the ability to make significant strides in the remaining merchant coverage gap we have. We believe that that will have very strong overall billings and revenue impacts that will more than offset the remaining negative impact on the margin when you just offset the discount rate decline on existing business versus the saving payments to the merchant acquirers.","That will take time as merchant coverage grows and as our customers begin to learn and understand that it grows. But I would say we are really pleased with the progress we have made with the merchant acquiring community and are very bullish about the long-term prospects for the program.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And then separately follow-up question, separate topic on preferred. You indicated the 1.5 percentage point gap that you might be taking advantage of with preferred issuance, indicated over the next couple of quarters. But maybe you could give us a sense as to how much over the next couple of quarters. I'm wondering if you are intimating that you would fill that entire 150 basis point gap in that period or if that's over a longer period of time?","Jeff Campbell","I think our view, and of course some of this will depend a little bit, Betsy, on market conditions. But sitting here today, our view is we will probably begin to fill the gap. And, of course, the way the CCAR process works as you know, we are committed to filling a portion of the gap that we put in our CCAR 2014 submission. But it would not take us all the way to filling the entire gap. We do believe in the long run, given the way the rules work, that the right, permanent long-term capital structure will eventually get us to that level. We probably won't get there with the first couple of issuances.","I would also point out that, I don't want to drag everyone throughout the map, but it's a fairly complex calculation because what you really focus on is getting to that 150 basis points in a stress scenario through the CCAR process, because that's really where it would potentially become a binding constraint for us.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right. So this should be over several, more than a handful of quarters, I would expect.","Jeff Campbell","Yes. I don't want to speculate on just how many quarters because, again, it's tricky always to predict market dynamics and we will also be making some calls about how the market for these securities evolves and how the overall market evolves, particularly considering today's events. But it will certainly take more than the two quarters that we talked about in my prepared remarks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","I guess I wanted to go back to your opening comments on revenue growth not being in line with your long-term targets for a bit. And I was wondering what sort of initiatives or plans you have to get that going some. I guess one area that could I think of is some of these investments that you have made or reinvestments of the gains you have made, what is the payback time period? How do we assess whether or not the efficacy of those dollars are working? And I guess second question, just on the macro picture. Obviously it's a point of debate across the markets, and I was just wondering if you have seen any discernible trends this month specifically because just the magnitude of deterioration has been fairly significant. Also maybe tie in any travel related impacts that you might see because of the virus? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Well, let me try to take those kind of one at a time, Sanjay, and I would start with your revenue growth questions. And I think I would preface my remarks by saying, we have a number of long-term targets. We have a EPS target in the 12% to 15% range, a return on equity 25% or better and revenue growth at 8% or above. Certainly our number one focus as we think about those targets is achieving the kind of very consistent EPS growth that you have seen us create quite a good track record of over the last few years. And when we think of the 8% revenue growth target, that is a facilitating lever to help us achieve those EPS targets. But one of the things that we began to talk about a few years ago and that I think we have really demonstrated over the last few years, is we have other levers to use in varied economic environments to get to our 12% to 15% EPS target even when we can't get to the revenue environment we would like.","So when you say what would we do to continue to get revenue up, well, we think about investments across the short, medium and long-term horizon. And of course we could probably get the revenue growth up in the near-term higher than it is today if we abandon some of the things we're doing that we think are quite important for the longer-term. And two of the things you have heard us talk a lot about in the last couple of years are loyalty partner and loyalty coalition investments, along with the things we're doing in the reloadable prepaid markets. We continue to believe in those long-term investments but they are not in the near-term going to return as strong or as high a return as what you would get if we plow the funds we put in to those products into our core businesses.","We think we have the balance about right although there is an art to it and in many ways we would suggest that the bottom line test is, are we hitting the EPS targets given where revenue growth is. And also just to remind you that for our business the real correlation is with year-over-year GDP growth. We went into this year with the consensus forecast in the U.S. for GDP growth to approach 3%. The latest consensus is down at about 2.2% year-over-year for all of 2014, and it's anyone's judgment who is listening to this call what events of recent days might mean even to that number. So we are actually pretty pleased with our EPS performance given that environment. And we are quite committed to the balanced approach we take across thinking about our spending and investments in terms of short term, medium term and long-term investments.","The last comment I would make is when you think about an event like the June quarter increase in our investment spending. I think you have to put it into a little bit of perspective. We talked on last quarter's call about doing perhaps an incremental $300 million or so of marketing and promotion. I would remind you that we spend over the course of the year $3 billion to $3.5 billion of marketing and promotion. So when you think about that increment over the course of the year, it's a fairly modest increment. For the portion of that spending that is targeted at near term initiatives, you would expect to see the results as you get into the second, third and fourth quarters subsequent to the spend and we're pretty pleased with what we have seen thus far. But it's a fairly modest component of the overall spend.","To go into your last question on macro trends. In general we don't like to comment a lot on intra-quarter billing trends because there tends to be a fair amount of volatility just depending on day of week, when holidays fall etc. So I wouldn't comment on that. And in terms of recent events, I think it's just too early for us to say what will happen to either billing or travel related bookings given all the media news of the last few days.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays","The first question is on Apple Pay. Can you comment on whether you had to make any concessions around the discount rate to be included and also just contextualize how the role there fits in to your broader strategy to build your own proprietary mobile wallet?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I don't think, Mark, that anyone is likely to comment on any of the contract terms here. I would point out, we don't really comment on contract terms with any of our partners. More broadly our philosophy is, we want to be everywhere that our card members want to be. And there is a real affinity between the Apple brand and what it means in our card member base. So we are very excited to be a part of this launch. We think it fits very well with our brand and card member value proposition and as we have said for a long time, form factor is not particularly important to us. We have tremendous share in online products, we have a tremendous partnership with someone like Uber where, of course, you don't see any physical card presence and it really takes advantage of some of our unique digital and customer capabilities.","The closed loop gives us an ability to, in Apple Pay and in any other digital setting, do some things for both the card members and the merchants that are challenging for others to emulate. So we are very excited about being part of this launch and think over time it can really be helpful in the continuing trend towards less use of cash and more use of card payments. And that's a very good thing for us and, frankly, a very good thing for the industry.","Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays","Okay, great. Next question is just a follow-up on the timing of the preferred issuance. Was the Fed essentially forcing you to trap capital here, kind of leaving you at ratios well above the longer-term economic capital targets? Why issue now instead of later when you are closer to being able to get to levels that are consistent with your long-term targets?","Jeff Campbell","Well, the short answer, of course, is we are issuing now because we committed to issuance in our CCAR submission. The longer answer for why we put it in the CCAR submission is that when you think about our capital constraints, you do have to consider them in the context of the stress scenarios that the Fed runs which can produce very very different results from what you may see when you look at our balance sheet. And the judgment we made is we submitted CCAR, our CCAR submission in 2014, was that the most prudent route to ensure that we continue to do the kinds of very aggressive returns of capital to our shareholders that we have been doing. And I would remind you that are -- we have been amongst the highest of any of the CCAR banks in terms of the amount of capital that we have been returning.","The way to ensure we could continue to have a strong platform to do that given the evolution in the rules, given the way the process works, best way to do that was to put a portion of preferred into our capital structure. And that's what we committed to and therefore the will see us execute. As I said in answer to Betsy earlier, you won't see us get all the way up to the full level until some later point in time. But what our judgment was, it's prudent to begin that process now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","The first thing I just wanted to go back to was the effect or the impact of OptBlue on your discount rate. And specifically, what I was curious about is, it was a meaningful enough impact for you to call it out and you have a 3 basis point decline year-over-year in your discount rate overall. So that seems to suggest that in a short period of time there has been a lot of uptake in terms of the amount of volume coming through your OptBlue partners. So am I thinking of that incorrectly because on a proportional basis, I need to work out the exact math, but it does seem like it probably had a significant impact in a relatively short period of time. So could you help us size that a little bit in terms of maybe volume coming through your OptBlue partners or merchants incrementally that have signed up, etcetera?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think it's a still very early days for the program. And I would remind you that there is really two aspects to this. One is, that we will get expanded merchant coverage over time as the acquirers go out and find merchants who do not take American Express today and are very attracted to a simple product offering that gives them the ability to expand the range of customers they can reach. Those acquirers will also take some of their existing customer base and put them on these simpler, and we think more attractive, OptBlue program. And so there is a mixture of both of those things going on right now. And the expansion in the spending at the new merchants will take some time because our card members will take some time to even realize when merchants get added and what the benefits are of that expanded coverage.","So for all of those reasons we are quite comfortable, in fact quite pleased, with the early days of the program. And the fact that the acquirers have been signing on a little quicker than we expected, is why the modest impact has hit us a little bit more quickly than we had in our plan. We actually see that as a good thing, however.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, thank you. And then just another question I had, and I am not sure if this is something you have tracked recently. But I know in the past, Ken has talked about the migration up-market in terms of more premium cards or the movement between card products as an indicator of what's going on with the underlying consumer that you are targeting. So I was curious if that's something you have looked at recently to look at migration upwards or downwards to give you a reading on what's going on with the health of consumers. Are we seeing a slowdown in the improvement or any sort of read throughs from that? I was just curious if you had any more recent data?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think the short answer is, of course we look very closely at all the trends across all of the many products. And one of the hallmarks I think of our business model is that we strongly believe that we have a broad range of products because we want to have the right product for the right card member and people have very very different needs. Well, I'll tell you, when we look across our portfolio now, we see some very strong performance in some of our premium products. We are very pleased, and in fact have exceeded our expectations on the take-up with our new EveryDay card which is clearly targeted at a very different demographic, customers who value the revolve feature.","As you mentioned in my script, you see some of our cash back rewards for our products growing particularly strongly right now and that contributes a little bit to some of the difference between billed business growth and discount revenue growth. So when you look across our portfolio, there is no particular trends that we can point you to that show migration patterns that are different than what we have experienced historically.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you. And I know I have exceeded my quota, but just a quick last one. The Concur gain this quarter, did you quantify how much that was that flowed through your income statement?","Jeff Campbell","Well, so remember SAP hopes or expects that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter and we would expect that it will generate a gain for us of about $700 million.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. Because I thought in one of the, in the supplement it talked about some small gain flowing through this quarter as well. So maybe [through it] (ph)?","Jeff Campbell","Yes. So as you know we have for many years have been selling off at a modest pace very large gains we generated some years back from our investment in ICBC, the Chinese bank. The sale of those shares came to an end in the September quarter and we are now completely sold out on that position. We have been considering a range of alternatives as we reached an end of that ICBC investment sale, one of which was to begin to sell modest bits of Concur. That plan was beginning to be executed and thought about and SAP came along and changed our trajectory. So there is really nothing more than that going on with a very modest sales that you see referenced in the document.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","I apologize for going back again to the capital question with the preferred, but I'm trying to make sure that I understand the reason for including the preferred issuance in your CCAR submission. So from an academic perspective, I get that it makes sense to fill that 150 basis point gap between total capital and common equity tier 1 minimums under Basel III. But in reality I thought of CCAR as the real binding constraint for most card issuers, given that losses tend to be quite high for unsecured credit card loans under a severely adverse scenario. And so if you have to run at, call it 12% common equity tier 1 levels for CCAR purposes, haven't you already filled the preferred bucket with common equity and so what's the benefit of the preferred? Maybe if you could just speak to that, it would be very helpful.","Jeff Campbell","So that's exactly the right question, Bill. The thing you have to remember is, your binding constraint in CCAR is whatever your absolute low point is over and nine quarter period. So in CCAR 2014 you were running into 2015 when the new minimums come into effect. You are running a severe stress scenario where the Fed does the modeling and you are sustaining your capital payouts. So one of the realities for us as a bank which has made very aggressive requests for share repurchase along with dividends. That means when you sustain those right through a severe stress scenario, particularly when you have a company like American Express, which if you look at our payouts lately, we're paying out over 25% of our regulatory capital base each year. The math quickly takes you from what on the surface looks like a very highly capitalized company, and we of course believe we are very highly and well-capitalized, to one that actually begins to in that severely stress scenario where you, I might suggest, unrealistically sustain your capital payouts right through that severely stress scenario, you begin to approach those minimums.","And as we thought about how do we make sure we don't trip those minimums, our choice was fill it with more common or fill it with some preferred. And we clearly chose to fill it for our shareholders with preferred because it's more economic buffer.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","I see. That's very helpful. Thank you. Separately, as you discussed earlier, you guys have been able to, despite a lackluster growth environment, deliver EPS growth at the low end of your on average and over time target range by pulling on all the levers that you have available to you. And I guess when we pull together all of the comments that you have made on that issue tonight, is it reasonable to take away from that, that you continue to have confidence in your ability to generate results that are in line with at least the low end of your on average and over time target? Even if it's just at the lower end of that range?","Jeff Campbell","I think what you should take away from all of my comments is that our track record, we are using the range of levers we have to meet our EPS targets are pretty good. Our track record is very good and we have a lot of levers. And our job and our focus is on using all the levers we have to continue to achieve that kind of performance. It is more challenging in a modest economic growth environment where everything from the capital rules to the regulatory environment to the competitive environment just gets tougher every day, but that's our job. That's what you pay us to do. And we are committed to using every lever we have to stay focused on meeting those EPS targets.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","One of the important ingredients in being able to do that has been the positive operating leverage. And I think your commitment to keeping operating expense growth below 3% through the end of this year has given really the market a lot of confidence in your ability to generate that positive operating leverage. Is that something that would you be willing to consider extending that beyond this year? And that was my last question.","Jeff Campbell","So we are not -- we are in the middle of our planning process right now for 2015, and so we are certainly not ready on this call to talk about what our targets are on operating expense going forward. But I would make a few obvious comments which is, we are in a business where we get some benefits from scale as our company continues to grow. And while I was calling our 5% revenue growth quite accurately less then we and probably you had hoped for, I would remind you that for a company of our size to have revenue growth in a 2% growth economy of 5% is actually, if you look at other industries, is not a bad number. That gives us the benefit of scale which is a helpful thing as we try to control operating expenses as we continue to grow. And we are also in businesses where technology helps us every year find new ways to be more efficient and where the behavior of our merchants and our card members every year is more and more about us finding ways to engage them digitally. Quite frankly, that's also a less expensive and more efficient way for us to engage with them.","So we are not ready to give targets yet on expenses for next year but what we are ready to say, is we are very committed to using all the levers that are at disposal to meet our financial targets. And we have some natural advantages given our growth and our business model in finding ways to continually control operating expenses and get that very important operating leverage that you talked about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman - Susquehanna","I will just ask my two upfront, Jeff, to respect the constraints of the call. So first one is housekeeping. The salary and employee benefits, this is Slide 12, at $1.29 billion. Is that a good run rate moving forward for the rest of the year? Obviously, there's been a lot of movement in that. That's my first question. And my second question is, a couple of the networks, MasterCard and Visa, have introduced fees related to tokenization. You guys were there at the authoring of tokenization. My question about tokenization is, do you have a revenue model associated with that? So the first one is about salaries, the second is about tokens. Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Well, let me maybe work those in backward order here. We are constantly looking at ways to add value through innovation, technology, scale or closed loop. We are constantly looking to find ways using all of those tools, add value to our merchants. Frankly, we also expect when we find ways to add value that there will be reasonable compensation. Now that's a very general statement and we will have to see on any particular subject, I don't want to comment on tokenization in particular, where the market goes and what kind of value we can deliver to our partners. But certainly our general view is that we add value in a lot of ways and we should get compensated for it.","On the salary and benefit point, there is always some quarter to quarter volatility so I'm going to be a little cautious on giving you a line item specific bit of guidance. I would make the point that salary and benefits are half or a little more of our overall operating expense. We are very committed to maintaining the trends you have seen thus far. And while you can't maintain the trends you have seen over the last few years without maintaining a very tight control around all of our employee related costs. I just want to point out that you do get a little bit of quarter to quarter volatility, sometimes particularly in the fourth quarter as you true up things at your end.","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Thank you. ","Jeff Campbell","So, operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And that will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","I wonder if you could talk for a minute about the potential impact on billed business and maybe revenues from the decline in gas prices we've seen and the further step-down in the value of a couple of currencies that you're exposed to late in the third quarter and as we've moved into the fourth quarter?","Jeff Campbell","Well, let me maybe work those in reverse order. On the currency side, we actually, if you go back to Q1, we put a slide into our earnings call deck to help people understand a little bit which currencies we have significant exposure to. And I would also remind you even on that slide we have exposure at the revenue and billings line, there is some natural hedges to that because in many of the countries where we have the largest billings and revenue exposure, we also have just substantial operations. And so those provide some level of natural hedge. When you look at the range of currencies that matter for us, it's also a general truism that you seldom find all of those currencies moving in the same direction. Even if you look at our third quarter, the UK is a very significant country for us but it was actually fairly flat versus the U.S. dollar versus some of the other currencies.","So this is a headwind for us. I would say it's generally a modest and manageable headwind unless we see an almost unprecedented across the board strengthening of the dollar. And given the events of the last few days I certainly wouldn't want to say that won't happen, but in general it's a manageable effect for us.","In terms of gas, obviously our gas sales in terms of our overall business are not particularly material part of our billed business. I would just make the obvious point that for many other things in our economy that people to spend more money on, lower gas prices are generally a good thing. I guess I am an ex-airline CFO, so lower gas prices are generally really good thing to travel. But, boy, you certainly have some pretty tough to read challenging counter trends on travel right now when you look at all the news about turmoil in the world and Ebola. So it's hard to know how all that will play out. And so we will just remain committed to using all the levers we have to manage through whatever the economic environment brings for us.","So I'd like to thank everybody for joining tonight's call and participating in the Q&A session. I'm going to wish you all a good evening but I'm going to turn it back over to Rick Petrino who will provide a brief overview of the investor conferences we plan to participate in during the fourth quarter. Rick?","Rick Petrino","Thanks, Jeff. So as part of our commitment to provide investors with exposure to company's management, our executives plan to speak at several events in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead through the balance of 2014, Jeff plans to speak at the Merrill Lynch Banking and Financial Services Conference in New York on November 13. In addition, Ken Chenault plans to participate in two upcoming conferences. The first will be in Las Vegas on November 4 as part of the Money 2020 Conference and the second will be also in New York on December 10 for the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference.","Live audio webcast of each of these events will be made available to the public through the American Express IR Web site at ir.americanexpress.com.

(Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.","Rick Petrino","Thanks and welcome. We appreciate everyone joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s other reports already on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2013 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss the solid results across our businesses that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013.","Our performance in the quarter reflected healthy billed business intense revenue growth, a continuation of credit metrics being at historic lows, disciplined controlled operating expenses and as a result, solid earnings performance. ","Since this quarter does mark the end of the full year, I will be discussing our full year results, which we are also pleased with, as they help illustrate some important trends.","During the quarter, we made several significant announcements in particular around signing new GNS partnerships and reaching separate settlement agreements with our merchants and regulators. In addition, we helped support small business entity for the fourth consecutive year. I will discuss some of these initiatives in more detail later on the call.","I would say that there was some complexity to understanding our financial results this quarter. While the merchant settlement is the most significant new item, we also have a number of previously disclosed items that make the year-over-year comparisons more complex, including last year\u2019s fourth quarter items, the sale of our publishing business at the beginning of October and the few other specific items which I will walk you through as I discuss our results.","To begin with the summary of our Q4 results, you can see on Slide 2 that FX adjusted billed business growth was 9%. Given our spend centric business model, this was in the primary driver of our FX adjusted revenue growth of 6%. Both of these rates of growth are modestly above our full year growth levels, reflecting the uptick in the economy and our business that we saw as 2013 progressed.","This level of revenue growth combined with our continued strong operating expense control this year drove net income to $1.3 billion in the quarter. This was up sharply from the prior year of course due to the items we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Our strong capital position allowed us to continue our share repurchase efforts, over the last four quarters we have spend $4 billion buying back shares, which cumulatively resulted in our average shares outstanding declining by 4% versus the prior year.","To more meaningfully review the impact of these solid operating results and our share repurchase efforts on EPS, it\u2019s important to realize that year-over-year comparisons are impacted by the three items recorded during the fourth quarter of last year, as well as this year\u2019s merchant settlement.","Regarding the settlement which we announced in late December, it resulted in expenses that lowered fourth quarter EPS this year by approximately $0.04, adjusted for this merchant settlement this year and the three items from the prior year, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter increased from a $1.09 to $1.25.","These solid results helped bring ROE for the period ending -- for the period ending December 31st to 28%. Overall, we feel good about our performance in the quarter, especially considering the continued moderate pace of the economic recovery.","Turning now to the full year results for 2013 on slide three. For context, as we enter 2013, there are number questions about our ability to grow revenues and earnings per share in a slow growth environment.","As you recall, billings and revenue growth have slowed over the second half of 2012 and there were concerns about the impact of tax increases and the microeconomic environment on our card that were base.","In fact, 2013 did turn out to be a year of only modest economic growth. While we are encouraged by the recent strong sequential increase seen in the U.S. GDP growth rates, it is important to remember that the year-over-year increase in U.S. GDPs are in the first three quarters of 2013 was just 1.3%, 1.6% and 2.0%. It is this year-over-year increase that relates historically to our billed business growths.","Given this challenging economic environment, we were please to be able to generate FX adjusted billings growth of 8% over the full year and FX adjusted revenue growth of 5%. Importantly, both of these metrics exhibited improving trends over the second half of 2013.","Another key focus of our organization during 2013 was on disciplined control of our operating expenses. On our fourth quarter earnings call last year, we disclosed our goal of growing operating expenses excluding the Q4 \u201812 restructuring charge at less than 3% annually during 2013 and 2014. We more than met this goal during 2013.","The strong control over operating expenses has enabled us to fund greater investments to grow our business and resources to meet our growing compliance demands, and to have increased financial flexibility in the face of a slow growth environment.","You will recall that at our financial community meeting in February of last year, we laid out several scenarios illustrating our ability to achieve our on average and overtime earnings targets in a variety of economic environment.","Given the slow growth GDP environment we experienced this year, our strong capital position and disciplined control of operating expenses were particularly important contributors to our financial performance.","We were able to drive full year EPS of $4.88, which was 25% higher than last year. Our EPS has now grown at a 13% to compound annual growth rate since 2010 in line with our on average and overtime target to grow earnings per share by 12% to 15%.","Over the same multi-year time period, our revenue CAGR has been 6%, well below our on average and overtime target of 8%, we generally feel positive about this performance given the slow growth economic environment. ","I would also remind you that back in 2010 there were concerns about the growth potential of our existing card businesses, particularly in an environment with lower levels of consumer spending and borrowing. Since that time, however, our performance has given us greater confidence in the continued growth prospects of our card businesses.","Let\u2019s turn now to the more detailed trends starting with billed business on Slide 4. Our billings growth rate remained healthy given the economy and improved slightly on a reported basis from 7% in Q3 to 8% in the current quarter. Billed business overall grew by 9% on an FX adjusted basis, so it\u2019s consistent with the prior quarter. ","The USCS segment, which constituted about half of worldwide billed business, saw growth increased from 8% during Q3 to 9% in Q4. Open small business volumes have been a particularly fast growing part of our U.S. business and ended the year having achieved four consecutive quarters of double digit growth. ","As many of you know, we will be featuring a discussion on our open business as one of the topics at our upcoming financial community meeting. ","We were also pleased to see a modest uptick in growth rate in our GCS segment from 7% to 8% on an FX adjusted basis. We continue to see particularly strong volumes in GNS, which grew by 16% year over year on an FX adjusted basis. GNS volume growth continues to be highest in the JAPA region, powered by strong growth in China and Japan.","Looking at billed business by geographic region on Slide 5. Consistent with our focus on expanding our business globally, total international volumes continued to grow at a faster pace than the total company and were up 11% year over year on an FX adjusted basis. ","Billed business growth within the U.S. region also improved from 8% to 9% during the current quarter. EMEA continues to be our slowest growth region given the lower rates of economic growth within Europe. ","Moving on to loans, the other key revenue driver. We continue to see steady growth in loan balances as shown on Slide 6. Worldwide loans grew by 3% versus the prior year, up from 2% last quarter. Our growth rate in the U.S. was 4% which is up slightly from Q3 and continues to outpace the industry average. ","Putting it all together down in the revenue slide, you see on Slide 7 that overall revenue growth was 5% on a reported basis and on an FX adjusted basis was 6%. Consistent with our spend-metric model, this revenue growth was primarily driven by higher discount revenue from increased spending volumes. ","Secondarily, revenue growth was aided by net interest income increasing 11% versus the prior year as we experienced lower funding cost year over year along with the increase in average loan balances. The sale of our publishing business depressed the growth rate of other revenue and impacted total revenue growth by approximately 1% during the fourth quarter.","For this quarter, this impact on total revenue was largely offset by the greater amount of card member reimbursements recorded in the prior year. Going forward, the loss of publishing revenue in and of itself will depress total revenue growth by a similar percentage point or a little less over each of the next three quarters. ","You see on Slide 7 that the two biggest components of our revenues -- discount revenue and net interest income as well as total revenues were all stronger in the fourth quarter than in the full year, reflecting the modest sequential strengthening we saw in the economy and our business. ","Turning now to provision where overall our credit metrics remained at all time low levels. Looking at the metrics highlighted on Slide 8, you can see that worldwide lending write-off rates, which were already at historically low levels, declined further during the fourth quarter and remained best in class. The delinquency rates remained consistent with the prior quarter. ","Now as a reminder, our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics when we make investments. Therefore at some point we would expect that lending write-off rates will increase from today\u2019s historically low levels. ","Slide 9 shows that our lending reserve coverage levels also remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter after considering the normal seasonal increase in loan balances. We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.","Finally, as you can see on slide 10, for the full year, provision increased by 6% as the benefits from reserve releases were smaller during 2013 than they were in 2012. While write-off rates have continued to improve and are at historic lows, the rate of improvement in 2013 was slower than what we experienced during the prior year.","In the fourth quarter, provision was lower by 17% this year, which is somewhat out of pattern with the full year results as we benefited from a modest reserve release in this year\u2019s Q4 which is a modest reserve build than in a prior year Q4.","Turning now from the revenue side to the expense side on slide 11, story gets a bit more complex because of the three items we recorded in Q4 2012 and the merchant settlement this quarter. As of this, I will walk you through each individual line item in subsequent slides.","I would make the overall comment that a key to our 2013 results was maintaining disciplined control of our expenses, particularly within operating expenses. This allowed us to achieve solid financial results, while continuing to invest for both our current and future customers.","One item I would like to talk about while still on slide 11 is the tax rate. You see that our tax rate during the quarter was 34%, a bit higher than we\u2019ve been trending and expecting. As we closed the year, the final geographic mix of where we generate income came in a little less favorable than we\u2019ve been expecting and drove the higher rate for the quarter. This brought the full year effective tax rate to 32.1%.","Let me now start the more detailed expense discussion with operating expense since controlling operating expenses to make our business more efficient has been key to providing additional resources for growth initiatives, and by any measure our teams did a great job this year of more than meeting our ambitious operating expense goals.","Slide 12 shows you some of the details of our operating expenses during both the quarter and the full year. And clearly a number of individual lines here were impacted by specific items both this year and last. So, I won\u2019t take the time to go in all of those details but I do want to call out two items.","First, other net expense in the quarter includes approximately $66 million of expenses related to the merchant settlement I discussed earlier in which we announced on December 19th. As part of the settlement, we agreed to pay a reasonable attorney fees up to a maximum total of $75 million plus up to $4 million to notify merchants of the settlement terms.","A small portion of these costs were accrued for in prior periods, resulting in a net impact of $66 million in the fourth quarter. Second, I would note that sale of our publishing business depressed operating expense growth by little more than 1% in the quarter.","So putting it all together on slide 13, you see that excluding the Q4 \u201812 restructuring charge, full year 2013 adjusted operating expenses were flat versus the prior year and remained well below our commitment to grow operating costs at less than 3% annually during 2013. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving our goal of having operating expenses grow by less than 3% again during 2014.","So moving to rewards expense, a key source of value for our card members. After excluding the cost of the enhancements to the URR or ultimate redemption rate estimation process for U.S. card members in the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted rewards expense were like 13% during the quarter as illustrated on slide 14.","This 13% growth rate in adjusted rewards expense is somewhat higher than the volume growth in our MR and co-brand products due predominantly to two items, a benefit in the prior year due to a decline in the weighted average cost per point and an increase in current year quarter due to an enhancement in the URR estimate process in our largest countries outside the U.S.","With this enhancement, the global URR will remain at 94%. As a reminder, loyalty and reward programs are one of our major competitive advantages. Based on their success, we have expanded them during the last few years to offer broader opportunities for cardmembers to earn and redeem points. ","Turning then to Slide 14 in our marketing and promotion line where significant amount of our investments in growth are. You see expenses up 12% in Q4 as we took advantage of opportunities to invest in the business while still delivering solid EPS growth. ","We were pleased to be able to invest more in this area as the economy and the business strengthened as the year progressed. We continue to see many attractive opportunities in the marketplace, including those for new customer acquisitions. ","During the fourth quarter we were particularly pleased to support the Fourth Annual Small Business Saturday. Momentum for this event continues to grow led by local businesses around the world. During the current year we supported Small Business Saturday in six countries, including the launch of the event in Australia, Israel and South Africa. ","Importantly this event helps us build relationships with all businesses across both our merchant network and our cardmember base. This is critical to both the continued strength we see with small business cardmembers and our continual efforts to expand small business merchant coverage.","So more broadly, we believe that we continue to have a number of attractive investment opportunities across both our card businesses and from newer initiative. These opportunities exist across our existing card business -- these opportunities, excuse me, across our existing card businesses include increasing our penetration of B2B, middle market and small business spending continuing to deepen our relationships amongst affluent customers, continuing to expand our reach to a broader segment of consumers and expanding our merchant network particularly among smaller merchants. ","While all of these areas represent sizable opportunities within the U.S. market, we believe that the long-term potential of these opportunities is even greater internationally where our relative share position today is still significantly lower than it is in the U.S. ","As I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we also target a portion of our investments for longer-term opportunities, including many initiatives in the digital space. Over the past several years we have increasingly focused our efforts on two large initiatives: reloadable prepaid, our products that help you move and manage your money as well as our Loyalty Partner rewards coalition program.","Both of these efforts continue to ramp up, and we believe that they provide significant opportunities for growth. This growth, however, will occur over a longer period. ","Last, a common theme across all of these new initiatives is that they improve our ability to reach new customer segments and help make our brand more inclusive. ","So given the breadth and depth of opportunities that we have which are financially sound, one of the challenges we have is how to balance our investments with our performance against our on average and over time financial targets.","As I mentioned earlier, you did see us increase our investment spending in the latter half of 2013 as the economy and our business improved. Historically this approach has led to fluctuations in our investment levels over time. For example, during 2010 and 2011 our operating and marketing expenses increased as a result of our strategy to re-invest a portion of the Visa MasterCard settlement gains and the benefits from improving credit performance back into growing the business.","We are completing our planning process for 2014 currently and well as always, be thoughtful and prioritized which investments we will fund. Of relevance here are our plans to create a joint-venture to accelerate the transformation of our global business travel division. ","As an update, the negotiations for the joint venture continue to advance as we had planned. Our best estimate for closing date remains the second quarter 2014. Upon closing, it is expected that our partners will infuse a $700 million to $1 billion capital contribution into the new joint venture. American Express would contribute the assets of our business - travel business. As a result, we would expect to realize a meaningful P&L gain upon the close of the transaction. This could offer us some additional financial flexibility during 2014.","So turning now to capital, our strong capital position and the sizeable amount of new capital we generate through net income each quarter provide significant flexibility. This allows us to balance the capital needs in our businesses, our desire to remain strong capital ratios and the potential for significant capital returns to our shareholders.","The benefits of our strong capital position were on display all year as we returned 81% capital generated in the year to shareholders. We did this while modestly strengthening our already strong capital ratio year-over-year as you can see on slide 16.","As usual, you do our capital ratios decline slightly sequentially during the fourth quarter due to the seasonal increase in our loan and receivable balances. We did, of course, complete our submission for the 2014 CCAR process earlier this month and we will expect to hear back from the Fed about our submission in March.","Like the rest of the industry, we have worked hard to continue to strengthen aspects of our capital planning processes which supports this critical effort. While it is too early to know how this process will play out for 2014, I will say personally that going through this planning process for the first time has furthered my own confidence and the strength of our business model and capital structure.","Part of the strength has been our continuing efforts to evolve the mix of our funding sources which you can see on slide 17. We have worked hard to improve the diversity of our funding sources by driving a significant increase in the contribution from deposits over the last several years.","At this point, we believe our funding mix should be relatively stable going forward. Overall, our liquidity position remained strong and we continue to hold enough cash to cover our next 12 months of funding maturities.","Turning to other events of the last quarter, let me first make just a few more general comments on the two settlement announcements we made the financial aspects of which I have already touched on.","During the quarter, we announced that we agreed to settle two antitrust class actions filed by U.S. merchants that challenged specific provisions in the company\u2019s card acceptance agreements. The settlement agreement if approved will address certain merchant concerns while helping to ensure that American Express card members are treated fairly at point of sale.","We also expected to limit the company\u2019s exposure to future legal claims and ensure that any credit and charge, surcharge on American Express card transactions would be no more than the surcharge charge on competing credit for charge card products.","The settlement is presently under-review by the court. Some of the merchants that have cases pending against the company have objected to the settlement. Any objections or concerns will be considered by the court as it determines whether to approve the settlement.","During the quarter, we\u2019ve also announced that we had reached settlements to resolve previously disclosed reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several discontinued products that were previously offered to card members. Marketing of the products included in these settlement was discontinued more than a year ago.","Most of the card member reimbursements have already taken place and most of the cost associated with those reimbursements, as well as the fines were provided for in prior periods.","The regulatory environment has evolved significantly and has heightened the focus that all the financial companies must have on their controls and processes. We take our regulatory obligations very seriously.","As we have discussed, we continue to scrutinize and improve our card practices, regulators wants companies to be clear, transparent and fair to their customers, a goal that is very consistent with our own objective.","As previously reported, American Express continues to conduct internal reviews designed to identify issues correct them and ensure that our products and practices need a high standard of quality.","Before I conclude, I wanted to touch on one other item that has been getting a lot of attention. The recent data breach at Target. We continue to work closely with Target and law reinforcement on the investigations and we are closely monitoring the situation as it evolves.","We have sophisticated monitoring systems and internal safeguards in place to protect cardmember accounts and to detect fraudulent activities. We have the appropriate broad controls in place on affected accounts and are continuing to take targeted actions as needed. We have seen minimal exposure thus far. ","The closed loop is a big advantage for us, especially in situations like this. Our relationships with cardmembers and merchants represent one of the reasons why our fraud rates are the lowest in the industry. ","So in summary, coming back to our financial results, we feel very good about our overall performance in the current economic environment. During the quarter we saw healthy billings growth and modest growth in loan balances which drove FX adjusted revenue growth of 6%. This revenue growth combined with historically low credit metrics, disciplined control of operating expenses, and a strong capital position allowed us to generate a healthy growth in EPS while still investing in the growth opportunities we see in the marketplace.","Looking forward we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) First, we\u2019ll go to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries - Barclays","So with the stock having traded up a fair amount recently and also revenue growth still kind of below target, does this increase your interest in all and using excess capital to do acquisitions versus buying back stock here?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think when you look at the company\u2019s history, we have selectively used acquisitions over the years when we see an opportunity to either enhance our capabilities or build upon an existing strength of the company in an area. And certainly as we think about our long-term strategies, we are always looking for opportunities to do that. ","All that said, when you think about our policies on using our capital while on average and over time we\u2019ve said we will return about 50% of our capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and use the other 50% for other growth initiatives or acquisitions. Acquisitions are the kinds of things that you can\u2019t really predict and you really need to be very thoughtful about when you find the right opportunity. And when we don\u2019t have those opportunities, we\u2019re very committed to returning capital to shareholder and that\u2019s what you saw us do in 2013. ","And so when you think about the future it\u2019s very hard to predict and I think our commitment is to be thoughtful about anything we do on the acquisition side and be very consistent in returning capital to shareholders when they\u2019re are not opportunities that we think are great opportunities on the acquisition side.","Mark DeVries - Barclays","And then just to follow up, I was hoping I can get you to quantify what you meant by meaningful P&L gain from the closing of the JV and comment on whether you included that in your capital plan submission?","Jeff Campbell","So two separate questions. So the size of the gain -- I will tell you, beyond saying it will be a material gain, there are still so many moving pieces as we work through the last part of this, that I am probably not comfortable giving you a number. I would point out that if you think about the math it\u2019s pretty simple. If the partner puts in $700 million to $1 billion, we\u2019ve got 50% ownership and re-contribute our assets, that will define the value, if you will, of what the joint venture will be worth and then what gain will drop out will be a function of what is on our books as we contribute the business travel enterprise to the joint venture. ","So it will be a material gain. I can\u2019t really give you a range today. As we thought about our CCAR submission what I would say to you is that what we convinced ourselves though and made the point of to the Fed in the submission is that in any circumstance, even though there is still a range of outcomes here, we would see that the transaction will be accretive or positive to our capital ratios. And so while we can\u2019t quantify, it\u2019s all upside and then we built our CCAR submission on an assumption that it would be neutral to positive. But we didn\u2019t -- the way these things work, we want to build a share repurchase plan based on the certainty that it would happen.","Mark DeVries - Barclays","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we will go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Yeah. Following-up on that last comment, I guess when we think about your CCAR submission, are you anticipating, just keep a -- targeting a flat capital ratio and basically paying out consistent with what you did in 2013? And then could you have built in a contingency that upon the sale if that were to happen, you would use that excess capital towards capital management activities? And then I guess, secondly, just on the tax rate, could you just tell us how we should think about the level going forward? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","So on CCAR, I would say, we certainly did not build in a contingency. I don\u2019t think that really fits with the way the CCAR process have evolved to thus far as run by the fed. More broadly, when we think about our CCAR submission, we clearly do a tremendous amount of work internally and have a tremendous amount of discussion and debate amongst the management team and with our Board of Directors. And it is really all aims are trying to balance the views of our regulators, the views of our shareholders and our own views about the strength of our capital structure and our future performance.","I think that leads you to what we submitted and I don\u2019t want to get into the details of what we submitted. But I think our history would show that we are pretty committed to consistently being shareholder friendly. We believe that our capital structure is strong and within that set of thoughts, we submitted what we thought was a very balanced submission and we\u2019ll see how it goes.","On the tax rate, geographic mix does vary a little bit. If you look over the last few years, our tax rate has consistently been in the low 30s, but it\u2019s varied a little bit between about 30% to 32% on a full annual basis. And we don\u2019t necessarily see anything that we learned this year that suggest we will be outside that historical range. Beyond that, probably is a little hard to predict exactly what will happen in terms of the mix and other items next year.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Good evening. Thank you. Could you spend a little time and may be discuss some of the seasonal factors that impact the discount rate. You\u2019ve had several fourth quarters where you have a significant reduction in discount rate. It tends to snap back in the first quarter. Can you just remind us what those seasonal factors are if you can quantify them that would be helpful as well?","Jeff Campbell","Yeah. It is probably tough to specifically quantify, but the basic trend is pretty simple. If you think about the fourth quarter, you have a little spurred upwards in retail spend and a little decline in some of the more business-oriented spend. And that mix shift is quite consistent each year and drives the discount rate down very, very modestly and that\u2019s why you see it pop back up in Q1.","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And are there are any other just either pricing or deal related factors that are more first quarter seasonal or fourth quarter seasonal that impact then?","Jeff Campbell","No. No, it\u2019s really just that simple mix shift..","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And maybe just lastly, you had mentioned that you\u2019re going to balance out essentially the gain that may be taken from the sale of the Business Travel. I just want to make sure I understand this right. So basically, you\u2019re going to look to keep your investments at an elevated level in terms of just driving future growth. But you\u2019re possibly going to have some of that fall of the bottom line, is that the way to think about the balancing act that you have got to look out there?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I want to be a little careful because this is a potential joint venture. I think the point I was trying to make in my prepared remarks is we have a long track record of being very thoughtful about how we balance our on average and over time financial targets, with steadily investing in the many growth opportunities that we see. And it is certainly possible that as we get into 2014 and as we execute on the business travel joint venture, you may see an elevated level of investments depending on how all the final economics work out. And we will be as we always are thoughtful about making those investments in things that are going to produce very good returns for our shareholders, and we will be very transparent about what we are doing and why.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","A couple of questions. First, the Target breach. Do you think this is a potential accelerator to EMV adoption, and could you see regulatory involvement pushing that along?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think it\u2019s early for anyone to know exactly what all of the impacts of the Target breach will be. Although there is obviously already a line of regulators and other oversight authorities who have expressed interest and understanding what\u2019s going on. I think from our perspective, we have a tremendous dedication to the security of everything that goes on between our merchants and our cardmembers. We have the lowest fraud rates in the industry. Our closed loop gives us some real advantages here in helping to manage things. ","And there are many things we can do with our merchant partners frankly that help lower fraud rates. Moving towards new technologies like EMV is one of those things. But frankly, there are many others and they all have different costs and difference trade-offs. Certainly, it has long been our goal to work ever more closely with our merchant partners to lower rates of fraud. We think that this may spur greater interest in doing that. The exact form it takes, I think, is probably anyone\u2019s guess at this point.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Secondly, thinking about the cardmember services expense line, it\u2019s been in the press that the American Airlines lounge relationship has left American Express. I was wondering if we\u2019re going to see any type of either adjustment lower for that, the end of that relationship or a ratchet-up in spending to account for replacing that service whether that\u2019s through Centurion Lounge construction or other things?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think we probably start by thinking about this from the customer or cardmembers\u2019 perspective. And we have a long track record of doing lots of things that make all of our products valuable propositions for the customer. In the specific case of the Platinum Card, that is a card really targeted to people who travel a lot. There is a wide range of benefits that people get from the Platinum Card, including I would point out, even post once the American Airlines announcement goes into effect, which I believe is March, we will have access to three different sets of lounges - Delta as well as two others, Priority Pass and Airspace. ","We have a variety of credits that we offer to customers on cost of global entry and other airline fees. You are correct that we are experimenting with building our own lounges and they\u2019ve met quite a rousing reception thus far, in the two that we\u2019ve opened in Las Vegas and Dallas. And we\u2019ve announced plans already to open a couple others at LaGuardia in New York and in San Francisco. So, we see and we also feel that we remain very competitive, because if you think about it with the consolidation in the airline industry, and I would remind you as someone who was the CFO of American Airlines 12 years ago, there were a lot more airlines when I was the CFO there. ","As the airlines have consolidated, you\u2019re really left today with sort of no card is going to give you access to any broader set of lounges than what our Platinum Card does, and that\u2019s sort of what airline consolidation has done. So we feel very good about the customer proposition and we think we have a long track record of being innovative about how we continually evolve that proposition. So it is a great value to customers and that is, that will drive all of, I think ultimately, yes, that will fall into our P&L and have an impact on the cardmember services line. But I think, frankly, the best way to think about that is, I would not expect this to have any material impact one way or the other as we continually find ways to provide value to our customers.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go through line of James Friedman with SIG.","James Friedman - SIG","Hi. Thanks. I want to ask about an update on the Wells and U.S. Bank partnership. Jeff, how should we think about sizing that say in the year ahead in terms of cards-in-force?","Jeff Campbell","Well, so we are very excited about both the Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank relationships, and we see it as a really great commentary and the many things we can bring to our partners in this kinds of relationships.","Now it is a long and complex thing for large institutions to launch new products. The first thing, I do want to point out as well. Wells has begun to launch a few small test markets. These deals will actually take several years to fully rollout and reach some level of maturity.","We\u2019re clearly very excited about the longer term potential of both of these partnerships and we think for both of those institutions we can really help them achieve any of the business goals they have and further their penetration particularly amongst their own customer basis and help them grow their card businesses to be more commensurate, frankly, with the broader size of those two institutions. But this will play out over a longer time period and so, I probably don\u2019t want to size it beyond those general comments.","James Friedman - SIG","Okay. And then, if I could a follow-up on, with regard to Serve and Bluebird, if you could talk in general terms about what we should expect with the revenue mix between fee and transaction revenue overtime, how does the company think about the revenue generation from those products?","Jeff Campbell","Well, clearly, on the prepaid products you have both a range of fee revenue. Although, I would point out to you that we have worked very hard going back to some ways my comments about the Platinum Card. We have worked very hard to start with the customer proposition and I think you would find that we have two of the lowest fee products in the market with the widest range of functionality and features for the consumer and that\u2019s exactly where we want to be on the continuum here.","When you think about the economics, you have a range of both revenues from fees, as well as, of course the point-of-sale or discount revenue. And you also have to think about it in the broader context of the family of products in the many different customer segments that American Express targets reaches.","So we look at all those things as we look at the economic model for Serve and for Bluebird and we are still in early stages, I would point out to you, we just re-launched the Serve product for example a few months ago. But we\u2019re encouraged by the early signs and we think this is a market that over the years will grow to be a very significant market.","James Friedman - SIG","Thank you so much.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Thank you. For my first question I was hoping to revisit the points that were raised regarding the closing of the JV. So just to put balance around the potential magnitude of gain, if hypothetically there was a zero book value to the assets on AmEx\u2019s book spend, since this is a 50-50 JV and the partners contribution is valued at somewhere between $700 million to $1 billion, and presumably AmEx\u2019s contribution would be valued at the same level. So at zero book value then the maximum theoretical gain would be between $700 million to $1 billion?","And then, I guess, if we looked at that in terms of let\u2019s say the book value was not zero, but if the book value was $500 million, then would that suggest the maximum gain is $200 million to $500 million, am I thinking about that the right way?","Jeff Campbell","Yeah. You\u2019re thinking about it exactly the right way. The two things I\u2019d remind you about are, these kinds of quite complex transactions do not come without a tremendous amount of effort and cost by both internal and external resources.","And then, I\u2019d also remind you that our Business Travel business is a highly global business, which produces a very complex structure and will produce a very complex tax outcome, which is part of what we are still working through. But with those two editions, yes, it really is as simple as what you just took us through.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up question, if I may, it has two parts, the first part on revenues, the second part on expenses. So on the revenue part, I was hoping that you could touch on the 4.5 times multiplier effect that AmEx has historically enjoyed relative to GDP and billings growth, relative to that relationship, is that something you still believe in? In other words, I guess I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any reason to believe that that\u2019s 4.5 times multiplier effect will continue to hold?","And then finally on the expense portion of that, it was good to hear you guys reaffirmed your commitment to keeping operating expense growth below 3%, I guess, separate from that, I was wondering your expense ratio I believe was at 70% this quarter, should we still expect that ratio to continue to work its way down towards the more normal 2007 levels that you guys have talked about of 67%?","Jeff Campbell","Yeah. So, on the 4.5, the interesting thing is if you look actually at the data we have this year, we don\u2019t have GDP data, of course, for Q4. The 4.5 historical relationships still seems like a pretty good metric when you look at the most recent quarters and just to make sure everyone on the call is clear that\u2019s applying that 4.5 ratio to year-over-year real GDP. I had to train myself a little bit since I joined American Express six months ago, much of the media talks about sequential rates of GDP growth, but what we\u2019re talking is the year-over-year number.","And I would say, we\u2019re not saying -- we are not necessarily actually trying to make any commentary on correlation but we are saying when you just look at the math that historical relationship has existed.","To go to the operating expense ratio, you\u2019re right, I think it\u2019s for the full year of 2013, we ended at 70%, I believe we were at 71% last year, if you exclude the restructuring and other charges.","The point I would make is we are very committed to the operating expense goals that we have laid out very publicly for over a year now and that is keeping our operating expense growth in 2014 to less than 3% as we did in 2013. Beyond that, I would say we want to be a little cautious about driving to other expense ratios because what we are always trying to do is meet our bottom line on average over time targets, particularly around EPS, while still being really thoughtful about how we can most productively and with the highest returns invest in growth opportunities for our shareholders. ","And those growth opportunities come in different forms. Sometimes it takes just traditional advertising and promotional spend, other times it means hiring sales people who runs our operation expense. And you get different impacts depending on which ratio you want to manage. And so, and I would say our real commitment is to working towards continuing to meet our on-average and over time bottom line targets and for 2014 meeting that operating expense target.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Chris Donat - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Thanks for taking my call or my question. I wanted to just explore one other point on the JV, and I respect the complexity here. But trying to understand the cost basis, is it safe to think about this as parts of the cost basis have really been in place for decades, and so it would come in a pretty low book value, but other parts like newer technology are much more modern? Is that sort of wide parameters for thinking about it?","Jeff Campbell","I\u2019ll tell you the complexity of this is great, because you are correct. There are some parts of this business that are quite old. I would also tell you they\u2019re very, very intertwined. We have, for most of our long history in the travel business, run it in a pretty integrated fashion with other parts of our company that we\u2019ll retain. I\u2019d remind you that over the years we have done a number of acquisitions, which adds complexity. It is a highly global business. So, maybe this goes a little bit to the point I made in response to the earlier question about, there are deal costs, there are transaction costs. And part of them go to just sorting through how do we really cleanly create a separate entity and how do we make sure that we understand all of the financial and legal and tax implications. ","And I\u2019ll stop there because I don\u2019t want to sound overly apologetic. But for all of those reasons it\u2019s just difficult to give you a better estimate at this point.","Chris Donat - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Understood. Just to kind of appreciate what all is involved here. And then to shift gears on to the settlement announced on December 19, I was a little surprised that the word \u201csurcharge\u201d appeared as frequently as it did in the summary of the terms and is the right way to look at this as sort of an abundance of legal caution for an outcome in the United States that has more [surcharging or is this] saying that we are going to be in a world where surcharging is more common? I am just trying to put this in the right context.","Jeff Campbell","Well, I certainly would quickly say we do not expect the outcome you had at the end of your statement there. So, let me step back for a minute. So I\u2019ll make a few points. And I might almost start with, look we are out there every single day working to build relationships with our merchant partners. And we are really all about helping them grow their businesses, we\u2019re not about being in litigation with them. ","And so part of what we are trying to do here is find a way to put this litigation behind us and begin to work more productively with all of our merchant partners. What we get out of the agreement is a clear commitment that our card members will be treated fairly relative to other credit and charge card customers of any other institution. That is very important to us. We think there is tremendous value there. ","We also believe and we are long on public record about this that surcharging is a very consumer and customer unfriendly practice. I\u2019d remind you that surcharging is outlawed in a number of states in the U.S. And I\u2019d also remind you that there are many countries all around the globe of course where we do business, which have all many different regulatory regimes. And In those where surcharging has been allowed, it has not become a rampant practice, we think because merchants recognize that it is just not a customer-friendly practice.","So when all is said and done, we thought this settlement was a good think for our shareholders, was a good thing for our merchant partners and allow us to get back to running the business and building relationships.","Chris Donat - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Don Fandetti with Citi.","Don Fandetti - Citi","Jeff, you would mentioned in your commentary about China benefiting your G&S business? I was just curious if that\u2019s just normal growth or if you are gaining market share that would seem like that could be a good opportunity to sign up other banks? I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and just confirm that the economics are generally the same from region to region at G&S.","Jeff Campbell","Yeah. Well, I do think it is important to be very clear about what I said about China. So, our China growth in billings has been tremendous and has been a significant, though not the only part of why you see particularly high growth rates when we breakout billed business for you either by segment, it\u2019s in the GNS segment or by region where you see it in the JAPA region, and we\u2019re very pleased by that billings growth.","But I would remind you that in China as you would really see for all foreign payments players, today we earn very little revenue on the domestic spend within China and then we do much better on what we would call the outbound spend and that\u2019s just due to the regulatory environment in China.","So longer term, we think it\u2019s really important that we establish as larger presence as we can in China and we have a number of different business things that we\u2019re doing in China. One of which is reflected in the great growth in billed business that you see, I just want to be a little cautious in saying that that billed business does not today generate particularly material amounts of revenue or earnings.","Don Fandetti - Citi","I understand that, I was just curious, if on your cross-border out of China, if you feel like there\u2019s room to sign up for other banks to grow that business and are the economics similar to what you\u2019d see in another region even though knowing it\u2019s a small contribution to revenue?","Jeff Campbell","Well, we are continually exploring different opportunities in China. I certainly don\u2019t want to get into exactly who we are talking to and what our strategies are in China. Let me just say that we see it as a very exciting long-term market. We think our brand carries into China very well. I think the billing growth that you are seeing demonstrates that and we think that it is creating a number of interesting opportunities for us, but I really don\u2019t want to comment beyond that.","Don Fandetti - Citi","Okay. Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","We probably have time for about one more question, operator.","Operator","Okay. And that will come from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli - William Blair","Thank you and good afternoon. The spending growth accelerated nicely in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. It had a small acceleration, but important and I was wondering if you could give a little more color on that if the online spending growth, which I think is about 20% of your spend if that there was an outsized acceleration in online spend. And then just related to that, I mean, you seem to think that the economy was helpful, how does -- what is American Express\u2019s view on how the economy going into 2014?","Jeff Campbell","Well, so let me -- maybe answer those in reverse. Certainly in terms of the economy, we don\u2019t profess to have any greater insights, our business is not necessary a leading indicator. So, I would tell you, we build our internal plans around a consensus economists forecast of what GDP in the U.S. and many other markets around the globe is going to be. And I think we are pretty transparent about our sensitivity to what economic growth actually ends up to be, and so we hope that it turns out to be frankly as strong as sum of the consensus economists are saying.","When you look at Q4, certainly like all payment forms, we see tremendously high growth rates in online spend. We\u2019re not going to provide today any specific numbers about Q4, I would just make the obvious point that like other players, the growth rates in online spend are quite high. It still remains a more modest piece of the total. ","I think the most important thing though for us as we think about trends and what we saw over the course of 2013 does come back to the point I made earlier that we are pleased by the fact that when you look at the back half of the year, you saw an acceleration across billings and across revenues versus what you saw in the first half. So, we think that\u2019s a good trend as we head into 2014, whatever the economic environment may be. ","Bob Napoli - William Blair","Great. Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Great. So I\u2019d like to thank you all for your time and Operator, I think we\u2019re done. Thanks for your interest in American Express.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Head of Investor Relations at American Express, Toby Willard. Please go ahead, sir.","Toby Willard","Thanks, David. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the Company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to the comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we\u2019ll move to a Q&A session.","And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell","Well thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we published our first quarter results and we are up to a solid start to the year 2018. Our FX adjusted revenue growth was 10% in the first quarter and earnings per share was $1.86.","At our Investor Day in March, we took you through our plans to build on our strengths and to continue to invest across our four key focus areas to drive growth and capture opportunities across our business. When you look at our first quarter results, you see our focus and these investments paying off.","We are expanding our leadership in the premium consumer segment, showing strong growth globally. We are building on our position in commercial payments, particularly with SMEs across the globe. Our digital efforts are accelerating as we integrate recently acquired digital capabilities and make steady progress on digital engagement with our customers. And our network is bringing it all together, powering revenue growth across our many customer segments and geographies.","So with this context, let me turn to the financial performance on Slide 2. First quarter revenues of $9.7 billion grew 10% adjusted for FX and reflected solid growth across billings, loans, and fee income. Net income was $1.6 billion, up 31% from a year-ago. Earnings per share was $1.86 for the quarter, up 38% from the prior year.","I\u2019d remind you that our first quarter results reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate, which resulted in a significant reduction in our tax provision. And like many U.S. companies, we expect to see some modest adjustments related to the Tax Act throughout the year. However, if you take a step back from the tax impact and we're to just simply apply our lower Q1 2018 effective tax rate to the prior year, adjusted EPS growth would still have been in the double digits.","I'd also point out that despite the suspension of our share repurchases for the first half of 2018, our EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in shares outstanding, stemming from the $3.5 billion in share repurchases we have done over the last four quarters.","Looking at the details behind our performance, I'll start with Billed business, which you see several views of on Slides 3 through 5. In total, worldwide Billed business growth accelerated sequentially to 10% on an FX adjusted basis. As you can see on Slide 4, the growth continues to be solid across all of our segments.","To get more specific on Slide 5, you see a view of billings by customer segment. This slide also serves as a helpful reminder that our global commercial and global consumer segments are roughly the same size comprising 41% and 42% of Q1 billings respectively, while global network services makes up the remaining 17% of billings.","Starting on the left, our small and mid-sized enterprise customers or SMEs continue to represent some of our highest growth opportunities. U.S. SME billings growth was 10%, up sequentially from last quarter's 9%, and international SME billings growth was 20% for a second consecutive quarter on an FX adjusted basis. The large and global customer segment growth rate was up to 8% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter compared to 6% last quarter.","On a related note, you can see in our earnings tables that for the Company overall both our global airline volumes and U.S. T&E spending were up sequentially compared to Q4. We also saw continued growth in B2B payments.","Moving to U.S. Consumer, which makes up 30% of the Company's billings, growth was 11% up from 8% in the prior quarter. This quarter we completed the acquisition of the portion of the Hilton portfolio that we did not already own, which contributed around 80 basis points to U.S. Consumer billings growth in the first quarter. We also continue to see strong growth in our U.S. Platinum franchise, but I would remind you that we will fully lap the value proposition changes we made in 2017 beginning with the next quarter.","More broadly, we saw acceleration in spend by our existing customers this quarter, reflecting both our continued focus on customer engagement and an increase in consumer spending and confidence within our premium customer base in the U.S. and around the globe.","In fact, moving to the right, you do also see an uptick in sequential growth at international proprietary consumer which is up 16% on an FX adjusted basis compared to 14% in Q4. We continue to have robust proprietary growth in key markets, such as, Australia up 27%, the UK up 20%, and Japan up 15% all on an FX adjusted basis.","Global network services is the one place where billings growth rates declined sequentially as they were up 3% on an FX adjusted basis in Q1 versus 6% in Q4. As we have said for some time, we expect the regulation in Europe and Australia to continue to impact volume in this business. Outside of these two markets, our GNS business experienced double-digit growth. Overall, we feel good about all the diverse sources of growth across our business segments and geographies.","Turning next to loan performance on Slide 6. Our total loan growth accelerated 16% in Q1. Here again, I would point to the acquisition of the remaining Hilton portfolio as a contributor to the sequential acceleration. This acquisition contributed about 140 basis points to our total loan growth this quarter.","On the right hand side of the slide, net interest yield was 10.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially. As you know, we typically see a seasonal increase in yield in the first quarter compared to the prior year yield was up 50 basis points.","As we've been saying for some time, we expect net interest yield, which has been steadily growing sequentially to stabilize somewhat. As a result, we expect the year-over-year growth in net interest income to slow from current levels as we progress through the year.","Now before we turn to credit, I want to take a few minutes to talk about our interest expense and funding costs in more detail than I usually do as we have been getting some questions in this area. You all know that we are liability sensitive given that our asset mix includes charge card receivables that are not interest-bearing.","Our funding strategy is to be active in three markets; deposits, asset backed securities, and unsecured debt. We have about $67 billion of deposits with about $32 billion coming from sweep accounts and CDs, which tend to move in line with market rates. The remaining $35 billion in deposits is coming from our online personal savings program. In a rising rate environment, this is generally our least expensive source of funding.","We expect to continue to grow our online savings program steadily over the next few years facilitated by the recent consolidation of our two U.S. banks. In terms of rate sensitivity, since the Fed started raising rates back in mid-2016, our beta has been about 0.45, but trending up.","Of late, our beta is closer to 0.6 roughly in line with the 0.7 that we are using for our own internal planning. When you look at our other floating rate debt, we have recently seen some compression in the spread between our funding rates and prime, which is putting more pressure on net interest yields than we had originally anticipated in our planning.","Here, I would remind you of the sensitivity communicated in our 10-K that a 10 basis point change in the spread between prime and one-month LIBOR will have about a $33 million impact on our net interest income over the following 12 months.","Stepping back, I would just remind you that a rising rate environment generally represents a modest headwind for us usually mitigated in part by a stronger economic environment. As I think about the balance of 2018, the latest consensus for steady rate hikes by the Fed represents the modest, but growing challenge as we go through the year.","So let\u2019s move on to credit metrics, which you see on Slide 7. Starting on the left with the lending portfolio, the loss rate for the quarter was 2.0%, up about 30 basis points from last year, and as you know from a sequential perspective, there is usually a seasonal increase in the first quarter. We have been saying for some time that we expect an increase in lending write-off rates primarily due to the mix shift of our portfolio over time towards non-cobrand products and the seasoning of loans.","On the right side, you can see loss rates in our charge portfolio as well as the global corporate payments loss ratio. Our loss rate on charge was 1.6%. Now we often look at our charge performance as one useful indicator, the macroeconomic environment given the short duration of these assets. While there is a movement from quarter-to-quarter due to seasonality, the charge write-off rate is in fact down from a year-ago, which we see as a positive reflection on the broader status of our tenured premium customer base.","Given these credit metrics and moving to Slide 8, provision was $775 million and we built reserves of $124 million in the first quarter. We have said that we expect provision growth for the full-year 2018 to be in the mid-30% range, which is exactly where we were this quarter at 35%.","The provision growth reflects the acceleration in loan growth and the increase in lending credit metrics, all of which were within our expectations. We remain focused on capturing more of our customers borrowing activities on attractive economic terms and believe that our provision outlook remains appropriate for the year. So we may have some variability in the growth rate from quarter-to-quarter.","Turning now to revenues on Slide 9. FX adjusted revenue growth was 10% in the first quarter. I would remind you that this is the first quarter in which we are reporting under the new revenue recognition standard. As we said at Investor Day, for us the new standard drives changes in P&L geography with minimal change to revenue growth rates or earnings. To be clear, all of our historical numbers that we are discussing today have been recast, so that they are on a comparable basis to our Q1 2018 numbers. I\u2019ll spend a little time on the areas most impacted by the change in a few minutes.","Moving to Slide 10 for the revenue drivers, we see solid performance across all components of revenue. I would point out that we are benefiting from FX in our reported numbers across many of these lines. Our total reported revenue growth was 12%, 200 basis points higher than the FX adjusted growth rate of 10%. Discount revenue was up 9%, which I'll come back to in a minute. Net card fees growth was 11% driven by key international markets as well as Platinum and Delta in the U.S.","Others fees and commissions were up 10%. Other revenue was up 4%, returning to positive growth this quarter as we have now lapped the sale of a small business in Q4, 2016. And net interest income was up 23% driven by the growth in loans and yield that I just mentioned a few moments ago.","Now knowing that many of you have been focused on our discount revenue trends, I wanted to provide a bit more color around them on Slide 11, as this is our largest revenue source. I\u2019ll start by noting that the new revenue recognition standard moves certain items from contra-discount revenue down to expenses. While this impacts the absolute levels of several of the numbers on the page, it does not materially change trends or themes.","Starting on the left, discount rate in Q1 was 2.37%, down 6 basis points from a year-ago, right in line with the expectations that we shared at our Investor Day. As you may recall from our Investor Day discussion, we are focused on driving discount revenue growth not on maximizing the discount rate, which has led us to selectively adjust the rate in order to drive higher volume growth and overall economics.","The results of this strategy are illustrated on the right side of Slide 10 where you see the benefits of such trade offs. In the last three quarters, our discount revenue growth has accelerated even as discount rate has declined with discount revenue reaching 8% FX adjusted growth in Q1.","We believe that our decisions to selectively adjust the rate to drive volumes by expanding merchant coverage and deepening relationships with key strategic partners have been important to achieving such strong discount revenue momentum. And more broadly, we are particularly pleased in Q1 to see that roughly 6 of the 10 points of FX adjusted revenue growth came from spend and fee portions of our business model. If you think about this in the context of the total P&L, 81% of our revenue in Q1 was driven by card spending and fee income illustrating the spend in fee centric nature of our business model.","Turning now to expenses on Slide 12. I\u2019ll cover the components of Customer Engagement, Marketing and Business Development, Card Member Rewards and Card Member Services on the next slide. Now let me cover our operating expenses first. Operating expenses were up 5% on a reported basis, but only up approximately 2% on an FX adjusted basis in the quarter. The quarter contained a number of discrete items, such as the loss on a transaction involving our prepaid operations that we were expecting and that we first discussed last year.","These recharges were partially offset by valuation gains on our Amex ventures investment portfolio, stemming from the implementation of the new accounting guidance for financial instruments. Most importantly, we expect full-year growth in operating expenses to be consistent with our historical ability to drive operating expense leverage.","So now let's turn to Customer Engagement where you can see on Slide 13 that a $4.1 billion in the first quarter, it is up 12% from the prior year. As I talk you through the components, I\u2019d remind you that there are several impacts to these numbers from the new revenue recognition standard. Starting at the bottom, we have the new Marketing and Business Development line. As we covered at Investor Day, it has two components. Our traditional marketing and promotion expenses and then payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks, and cobrand partners. This line in total is up 5% versus the prior year.","Our traditional marketing however is actually down a bit year-over-year as we continue to make great progress underwriting steady acquisition efficiencies as we highlighted at Investor Day. Even with this spend down a bit; we acquired 3.5 million new cards during the quarter compared to 2.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.","Now obviously this quarter\u2019s number includes cards coming from the recent Hilton portfolio acquisition. But even excluding Hilton, we still saw double-digit year-over-year card acquisition growth despite the lower marketing spending. So the increase in the overall marketing and business development line is driven by partner payments, primarily related to investments in our recent cobrand agreements as well as growth in our corporate business.","Moving up to Rewards. As I said at Investor Day, rewards are expected to grow roughly in line with billings which you saw during Q1 as rewards expense was up 14% from the prior year just slightly higher than the 13% growth in our proprietary billings. As a reminder, as a result of revenue recognition changes, our rewards line now includes all our rewards costs including those for cashback reward.","Moving then to the top of the Slide, Card Member services costs were up 29% driven by engagement with our premium services, such as airport lounge access and first bag free on our Delta cobrand. As I said in Investor Day, I expect card member services to continue to be the fastest growing expense line on a percentage basis, given our focus on providing differentiated services for our customers and others would find difficult to replicate.","Looking forward to the balance of the year, I do see Q1 as the low point for marketing and business development spend primarily for two reasons. First, as we talked about on our Q4 earnings call in January, we increased investments for 2018 by $200 million for the full-year as a result of the impact of the Tax Act. Given the late timing of that decision, we chose to allocate all of that spending to the latter three quarters of the year.","Second, I hope that all of you have by now seen that we have launched a new global brand campaign this month. We are excited about the long-term prospects of this campaign. But as you would expect, as a result we will spend significantly more on media and brand in the balance of the year than we did in Q1.","Turning last to capital on Slide 14. As we announced on our January earnings call given the $2.6 billion charge we took in Q4 related to the Tax Act, we suspended share repurchases for the first half of 2018. We are rebuilding capital and our common equity Tier 1 ratio has increased to 9.4% at the end of the first quarter.","Looking forward, we have now made our CCAR 2018 submission. Our CCAR ask is consistent with our aim to restore capital to our target levels and distribute capital to shareholders while supporting business growth.","Over time, we plan to move back to a steady state common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10% to 11%. We will hear back from the Fed on our CCAR submission in June. We expect to continue deploying capital to support our organic asset growth and feel good about our ability to generate capital well in excess of those business needs.","Based on what I know today, I would conclude by saying that we feel confident that we will resume share repurchases in the second half of the year. So that brings us to our outlook and then I will take your questions.","You have by now read in our press release that we now expect full-year revenue growth of at least 8%. Given our solid performance in the first quarter, we now expect full-year EPS to be at the high end of our EPS guidance range of $6.90 to $7.30.","To put this into context, let me make a few comments. First, we are only 90 days into the year, it is still early. Second, as we've said before, moving forward on the revenue side we well over time lapse the impact of our U.S. Platinum refreshes see a moderation of the year-over-year increases in net yield and face the likely modest headwind of a steadily rising interest rate environment.","On the expense side, you will see higher marketing in business development spend as we go through the year for the reasons I just went through a few minutes ago. So we feel good about our plans for the year and believe that as always they will allow us to balance the short and long-term growth goals of the Company while meeting our commitments to shareholders. We have a differentiated business model that positions us to win and we are focused on delivering steady and consistent revenue and EPS growth.","One final point, which relates to our Investor Relations team here at American Express, after three years leading Investor Relations, Toby Willard is moving to a new role within Amex as the CFO of our Global Merchant and Network Services Business. I'd like to thank Toby for leading the IR function during a pivotal time for the Company.","The last few years have been particularly challenging and Toby has faced them with an impressive show of steady and calm insights, wisdom and advice that we have all come to value. He has also picked a good time to take on his new role given the solid momentum that we have built as a Company and that you see in our first quarter results.","I'd also like to welcome Edmund Reese, our new Head of Investor Relations. Edmund was most recently the CFO of our U.S. Consumer and Global Consumer Lending Business and has had a number of key finance positions over his nine years with the Company. Edmund knows a tremendous amount about our business and brings towards every day a passion for making sure we succeed. I know I will enjoy working with Edmund, as I\u2019m sure will all of you.","With that, let me turn it back to Toby one last time.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Jeff and thanks for those kind words. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I\u2019ll ask everybody in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. And with that, I'll turn it back over to you David. You can open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. And congrats Toby, and welcome Edmund. Jeff, it seems like you think that you can get the type of leverage you saw in Card Member acquisition cost as we saw this quarter going forward because of the cobrand renewal impacts and a slightly maybe more benign competitive environment relative to the past. Is that a fair statement? And then maybe just on the T&E spending, you mentioned the higher airline and T&E. Is that a function of businesses reinvesting money as a result of tax reform or do you think it's just improved sentiments?","Jeffrey Campbell","Let me take those in order Sanjay. On the acquisition side, really the biggest thing I would point to are the themes that Doug Buckminster in particular spend a lot of time on at Investor Day and that is our relentless focus over the last couple of years on constantly driving more efficiency into our new Card Member acquisition efforts particularly by getting better every quarter, every year in terms of our digital acquisition efforts.","And that is really the largest most important and most sustainable aspect of what is allowing us to moderate marketing and promotional spend while still getting really terrific results in terms of acquiring new Card Members, and I really look to that as opposed to any particular change in the broader competitive environment, and as you know we believe we have a long run, we have continued improvement in those areas.","On the subject of T&E spend, certainly in many areas we saw a tick-up sequentially in what we would call internally organic spend growth, so the rate of growth amongst our existing customers. We saw that in U.S. consumer. We saw it in consumers spending outside the U.S. and you see it when you look at the airline volumes as well as the T&E spending.","So there's clearly something going on amongst our more premium oriented customer base. The only thing I'm reluctant, Sanjay, to go further on is, it\u2019s difficult for us. We can type lots of anecdotes from discussions with individual consumers or individual corporate clients.","It's harder for us to comment on what's going on in all of their minds that\u2019s driving this increased confidence. As you know, when you look at the broader external economic indicators right now, it's hard to see a big inflection point in economic growth or confidence. What I will tell you though is what we see in our numbers is when you consider the nature of our consumer and commercial Card Member base is not necessarily broadly representative, but it\u2019s more premium oriented. There is clearly something going on with increased confidence and increased spending.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thanks Sanjay.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey Campbell","Hi, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi. And Toby thanks very much for all the help over the years. I really appreciate it.","Toby Willard","Great.","Eric Wasserstrom","Jeff, thanks very much for the explanation on the cost of funds, but would you mind maybe just going back through for this period maybe doing an attribution in terms of how much of the increase was attributable to change in yields or what was occurring in terms of the asset side and maybe what was occurring on the deposit side more specifically intra quarter?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well let me take a stab, and if I\u2019m not answering exactly what you are after maybe we\u2019ll let you stay on and follow-up, even though we\u2019re trying to follow Toby\u2019s rule of one question. Most simplistically if you think about this at start at the top, we had 23% growth in net interest income on 16% growth low.","So you've obviously got a 7% added lift there from what's happening on yield, net interest yield was up 50 basis points. When you look at that net interest yield increase of net 50 basis points in the quarter year-over-year for us, the impact of rising rates was fairly close to neutral.","So the 50 basis point increase in rates is really coming for us in this quarter from the evolving mix, so we have fewer people on introductory rates, more people who are paying full rates, as well as the continued effect of various pricing actions that we've been talking about for over a year now as we more thoughtfully price for risk and as we more thoughtfully price competitively. So that's really what drove the 50 basis points and the effect of interest rates in this particular quarter was pretty neutral. Is that helpful and is that what you're after?","Eric Wasserstrom","Yes. That's very helpful. And just if I can just clarify one component of that. So as we think about the dynamics around deposit beta, which you\u2019ve underscored and this \u2013 the issue of higher rates starting to take effect beginning presumably this quarter. Do I understand your guidance to be about a net-net year-over-year improvement over the course of 2018 in terms of net yield or is there some risk of a compression year-over-year?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well let me be clear on what I said. So certainly if the Fed in fact raises rates as the current consensuses would call for, the pure interest rate component given where betas have been most recently is likely to become a modest headwind for us. So that then leaves you with the impact of the pricing actions, we will continue to be thoughtful about as well as evolving mix.","Now I clearly expect the 50 basis point year-over-year increase to begin to moderate. Our job Eric is to do everything we can to manage the Company in the way that the moderation is as small as possible and that\u2019s what we're seeking to do as a team. So we'll have to see just how successful we are making the moderation very small versus large.","Toby Willard","So operator, maybe we'll go to the next question. Thank you, Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Hey, Mark.","Mark DeVries","Hey, thanks. So my question has to do with \u2013 I just want to think through the pace of the moderation in the business growth that was \u2013 we should see a couple things there to deconstruct. I think you've alluded to several times, Jeff, the lapping of Platinum.","But I'm assuming that's not going to be \u2013 that's going to be kind of a gradual thing, right because you've probably had ramping engagement, you also had the delay and the imposition of the increased fee for certain customers. And then you also in response to Sanjay\u2019s question, alluded to obviously some change in the organic growth. Are you seeing that continue to accelerate and potentially providing a bit of a tailwind to that lapping effect?","Jeffrey Campbell","So good questions, Mark. First off, look on Platinum, I'm just being factual in that value proposition changes we made on the consumer side, we're all in by March of last year. So next quarter will be the first quarter where you completely lap them. The changes we made on the business Platinum side we've already begun to lap.","So look we've had tremendous performance in our Platinum portfolio and on the consumer side, where you saw us put a lot more value into the card and price for that value. We are now well over six months into applying the new fee to people as they renew the card and I will tell you the attrition rates have not moved at all. So we feel really good and I think our customers feel really good about the value proposition.","Now certainly as you fully lap all the changes, we would expect some moderation in some ways I'm going to give you an answer a little bit like I just gave Eric. We're doing everything we can to try to make that moderation in growth rates as we fully lap the value proposition changes as modest as possible, but there will certainly be some moderation. We\u2019ll just have to see how great it is as we get into next quarter.","The other thing I would flag is I think at this point have been pretty clear that there was clearly something going on with organic spend growth across our customer base as you look at this quarter.","And here I guess I just point you back to my \u2013 we're only 90 days into the year. If there's one thing that probably surprised us a little bit in this quarter's results, Mark it would be that increase while we have been steadily seeing that number increase for many quarters now due to the things we've been doing.","There seem to be almost a little bit of an inflection point this quarter that well I\u2019d like to take credit for it I think it's probably a little greater than anything being driven by our steady continuous effort. So 90 days into the year, I'm a little cautious about exactly what's driving that, is it going to sustain itself, we\u2019ll just have to see. So those are probably the two biggest uncertainties I would say in our minds as I sit here on April 18 and think about the billings and volumes trends that we might see in the coming couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Hey, Craig.","Craig Maurer","Hey, good evening and let me add my congratulations for Toby. Just forward to the long-term question, if memory serves correctly, a few years ago you talked about in a steady state 6% revenue growth environment, OpEx \u2013 you felt you could hold the line on OpEx growth at 2% or less. Is that still something we should be thinking about with revenue growth higher; right now does that change, so just your long-term thinking on OpEx would be helpful? Thanks.","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, Craig I\u2019ll make a few comments. First off, our number one focus is driving steady and consistent revenue and earnings per share growth and we have lots of levers to achieve that. Second thing I would say is as you know we have a tremendous 10-year track record of steadily getting leverage on the operating expense side. And in many forums we will talk about the fact that if you look at the last 10 years, you've seen our operating expenses grow at a CAGR of 1% or 2% when volumes were growing at tremendous rates.","And I'd also point out to you that Steve Squeri in addition to his many other areas of focus and strength has always been a particular believer in the power of our integrated model and our ability to build scale economies given the nature of our integrated business model. So we are very confident in our ability to get steady operating expense leverage.","All I'm going to resist a little bit is being real precise about the exact number in any given year because there will be times when it will make sense to put more money into things like our digital capabilities, into things like the many, many sales forces that we run in many of our businesses across the globe.","At times those are things that will cause us to increase operating expenses frankly and allow us to pull down things like marketing expenses and get a better result. So I'm going to be cautious about giving you an exact number Craig. But under any circumstances, you should expect to see us continue to get steady operating expense leverage.","Craig Maurer","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thanks Craig.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Hey, Don.","Donald Fandetti","Yes, Jeff. I was curious if you saw any benefit this quarter delinquencies from the consumer tax reform? I think at the Investor Day, there was some commentary about possibly seeing some benefit? And then secondarily on credit, you've been growing an SME international consumer? How do you sort of compare and contrast the forecasting a rescue of those areas versus U.S. consumer?","Jeffrey Campbell","Don, just sorry, can you give me a little more color on your second question and just what you're after and then I'll hit them both?","Donald Fandetti","Sure. So you've been growing the SME small business has been growing pretty rapidly on the lending side, also international consumer and as you sort of think about forecasting credit and variability, how do you sort of think about those areas versus U.S. consumer and are they tracking in line with your projected loss curves as well?","Jeffrey Campbell","Good. So let me start with the tax reform. It\u2019s always a little careless, I think, Don, for us to speculate on what drives particular consumer behavior. Certainly the facts are that we saw in the U.S., a clear sequential uptick in spending by consumers and you can speculate on whether that's confidence or greater economic growth or something to do with the Tax Act.","When I look at the provision, I would tell you that relative to our expectations, while the provision on a percentage basis came in about exactly like we would have expected year-over-year. In fact the rate \u2013 the delinquencies, the rates were probably a tiny bit better than we\u2019ve expected in our lending volumes were a little bit higher and they netted out to give you a provision that was right in line with what we expected. So those are the facts. I guess I'd be a little reluctant to try to draw direct lines between the Tax Act and any of those specifics.","Now you are correct. We're getting nice to grow in both our international consumer lending portfolio as well as our corporate lending, which mostly mean small and mid-size enterprise lending portfolios. I would point out to everyone remind you all that the U.S. consumer business is still the predominant portion of our lending.","But the SME lending is also still predominately in the U.S. and I\u2019d say we really feel we have the same exact insights in handle there that we do on the consumer side. The only things I make on international consumer is that of course is done in multiple markets, which have very different characteristics. So there are some markets we operate in that are extremely attractive, but have by nature higher write-off rates and generally much higher yields that compensate for that and produce really good economics.","And so within any given market, obviously we feel we have a very good handle on the risks in the forecast and where we're going. When you look at that aggregate international number, I will say of the average of a lot of very different things. So it's a little tougher to generalize about it. So that's probably the way I would take you through the landscape.","Donald Fandetti","Thanks Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thanks Don.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Shane","Thanks guys for taking my questions. And Toby, it's really been a pleasure over the years. So thank you very much.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Rick.","Richard Shane","Jeff, I\u2019d love to ask sort of \u2013 a little bit of a strategic question. Our view is that the reduction in tax rates is probably likely going to change the competitive landscape to some of those excess returns or completed the lag. One of the places is that at least historically and more recently we've seen that is on the reward side, which frankly when rewards raise really heated up, I think it adversely affected American Express. How do you see this evolving over the next year if the rewards will raise really picks up again?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, Rick, I guess I'd say a few things. We are focused on driving steady revenue and earnings per share growth for our shareholders. We\u2019re focused on providing tremendous value propositions for our Card Members, and we think we have a lot of tremendous value propositions out in the marketplace today.","As I said here today, I feel really good about our value propositions. I don't feel the need to do anything dramatic in response to what else is out there. We feel fabulous about the progress we've made on Platinum and when you look at our growth rates in every customer and geographic segment this quarter, I think you have to conclude that we have great value propositions.","We have also really focused the last couple years on evolving our value propositions in ways that try to leverage the unique differentiated assets we have. And the growth you see in the Card Member services line is a part of that, but our global scale, the size of our premium customer base, our brand, we closely model, all of those things allow us to do things with a variety of partners and to do things like our global lounge program that are we believe difficult for others to match.","And as an aside, Rick I'd say it's often difficult for people to quantify in the many reward comparisons that people sometimes do. So our job is to do provide great value propositions to Card Members to produce steady returns for shareholders.","Frankly, I don't see anything about the Tax Act that should change strategies we are implying to do either of those two things. Obviously we'll have to see how the environment evolves, but we feel good about where we are today and we feel good about the results we just posted.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. Congrats to Toby and maybe some condolences over to Edmund. I guess maybe just following up on that point, in the last couple days we saw some new info both from yourselves and from Chase on the Marriott and Starwood\u2019s programs, and I mean I guess the way it looked is that Chase is going to have kind of a head start of a few months and it's kind of going out with \u2013 back with 100,000 points which certainly something that grab some headlines. Can you talk about how you think about the competitive dynamics in that context both for that specific portfolio and whether that might kind of ignite a trend over the course of the next year?","Jeffrey Campbell","I\u2019d say couple things Moshe. First, we feel great about our relationship with Marriott, which is a broad multifaceted relationship cuts across our travel business, our cobrands, our merchant acceptance relationships, things we do with MR, very broad relationship produces a lot of value for us. We believe it produces a lot of value for Marriott and we believe it offers some great value to Card Members. We\u2019ve run the company for the long-term in the grand scheme of things. We don't worry too much about a couple months in the marketplace one way or another.","Next thing I\u2019d say is really broadly speaking; we have more different value propositions in the marketplace by far than any of our competitors. And we do that very thoughtfully because we believe that every Card Member has a little different set of things that they value and so that's why we have different tiers whether you want to look at our proprietary charge products, whether you want to look at our different proprietary credit products, that\u2019s why when you look at many of our largest cobrand partnerships you see us offering multiple products because people do not all issue the same things.","And in particular with all of those products, our ability to offer a differentiated set of assets meaning on our brand, meaning on our global scale, meaning on some of the unique assets we can bring to bear, we think make our value propositions tremendously strong.","So the particular competitor you mentioned certainly made a lot of noise in the marketplace with some offers that lot of people thought were pretty extreme about two years ago, we just finished the year 2017 with the highest number of Platinum card members we've ever had with the most spending by those Card Members despite raising the fees if we paid for that card. So we feel really good about our value proposition. We feel really good about the partnership we have with Marriott and we think that the marketplace over time will really recognize the value that we're putting into our Marriott value propositions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Robert Napoli","Thank you, and Toby, thanks for all your help, and Edmund, look forward to working with you, really appreciated Toby. On the international business and international small business, and consumers getting close to 20% of your business in the growth rates are \u2013 I popping in some regards, I mean Australia 27%, UK 20%, SME 20%? Can you just talk a little bit more about what you expect for those businesses, obviously you not those types of growth rates? Are you benefiting from regulation and not being you know having American Express regulated or is it merchant coverage? What do you think \u2013 what do your expectations for those businesses over the long-term, other growing very fast just still relatively small relative to the TAM that's out there?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, let me maybe take those one at a time and let me starts Bob with the small and mid-sized enterprise business. We have as you know in the U.S. a tremendously valuable franchise with small businesses. We see ourselves as being the first into that marketplace. We're very focused on providing all the kinds of specialized services and products that are value in that marketplace and that\u2019s been tremendous thing for us.","I would say over the years, we probably haven\u2019t replicated that level of focus outside the U.S. in that marketplace, until we made that decision as part of the many things we did to help reposition the company over the last few years to combine under one leader at the time, it was Steve, all of our global small and large commercial businesses. And it's really at that point that we began to refocus on taking all the learnings frankly that we have from the U.S. and bring them to the SME market in many other countries around the globe.","And outside the U.S., I would say we view this is still a pretty underdeveloped market, where \u2013 well in varies and each country that we're in, the competitive environment is probably not quite as developed as it is in the U.S. So we feel great about the 20% growth you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters and we would see a very long runway even focus we now have in this area to continue it.","Now on the proprietary consumer side, the bottom line as we also see a long runway to continue to grow above the market. If you look at the most recent quarter, it's too early to have all the comparative data. But I would suspect that in probably all of our top 10 markets now we are growing faster in the industry we're still small - those markets though and we actually put those two things together and say that's part of our gives us a long runway to continue to grow a little faster than the market and it's our ability to offer really differentiated value propositions versus the competition in all of those markets.","Now, I will say Australia you have some dynamics because Australia we are in the process of shutting down our network business and that is helping to create opportunities for us to find people who really value the American Express brand and what we can offer and put great proprietary products into their hand. But we more broadly see a long runway to grow outside the U.S. both with small businesses as well as in a consumer marketplace. So thanks Bob.","Toby Willard","David, do you have any other question?","Operator","Okay, I believe if we have time for one more question. We'll take one from the line of Ken Bruce from Bank of America.","Kenneth Bruce","Thank you for sliding me in here before the end of the call. Toby, good luck. Thank you very much for all your help over the years. I am going to pick up really where you left off, Jeff, if I may. As I look at the proprietary businesses, you've had some fantastic growth rates. And obviously, the reorienting of the strategy back towards proprietary has had a lot of success and I think that's got momentum to it.","As we look at GNS, it looks like it's about to go into negative growth, you\u2019ve pointed out Europe and Australia. I remember back when we first got into the network business and more size, it was always pointed out as to be a very high ROE business. And I'm interested in what you think the terminal size of that business may ultimately look like and what the impact will be on the overall ROE of the business or you think it\u2019s just gets lost in the numbers at some point?","Jeffrey Campbell","Yes. Well, Ken the real answer is what you just said, which is that we are focused on driving steady returns, no matter where we find them across the business. The GNS business, because of regulation in Europe and Australia will be a little smaller year from now than it is now that will not have any material impact on the overall companies ROE. And as I just pointed out in response to Bob\u2019s question, there are some really great growth opportunities that we're pursuing in light of the shrinking of that network business in a few places.","So GNS is an important part of our broader long-term strategy and plays a critical role in many, many places around the globe, but it will continue to evolve. And we will not get locked into any one strategy, but we will always be looking for where we can find the best opportunities to deploy capital efficiency and produce great differentiated returns.","End of Q&A","Toby Willard","Great.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)","And also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference call over to your host Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead, sir.","Rick Petrino","Thank you, Tony. Welcome, we appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company's other reports already on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell ","Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. Our performance this quarter showed strong earnings per share growth driven by disciplined controlled of operating expenses, another quarter of write-off rates near historical lows and a strong balance sheet that has allowed us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the past year.","We delivered 16% EPS growth despite having modestly lower revenue growth sequentially. And these results highlighted once again the flexibility of our business model. During the quarter, we took several important strategic steps including rolling out our OptBlue program to expand the coverage amongst smaller merchants, launching a new credit Amex EveryDay designed to capture a greater share of everyday consumer spending; and expanding Loyalty Partner by introducing the program in Italy. All of these steps are part of our broader strategy to reach new segments of the market and make the American Express brand more welcoming and more inclusive. ","Additionally, in the quarter we were pleased that the Fed did not object to the capital plan included in our 2014 CCAR submission. And we were also pleased to sign the formal agreement for the Business Travel joint venture that we announced last year. I'll discuss each of these items in more detail later on the call. ","To begin now with our financial results for Q1. As you can see on Slide 2, FX adjusted billed business growth was 7%. This increase was the primary driver of FX adjusted revenue growth of 5%. Both of these growth rates represent a modest deceleration versus Q4 levels which occurred predominantly in the U.S. market and was more pronounced among our U.S. small business and corporate card members. ","Net income of $1.4 billion was up 12%. The increase was driven by a combination of greater revenues, continued tight control of operating expense. Over the last four quarters we repurchased more than $4 billion of our common shares that translated into a 4% decline in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. This then allowed us to grow our diluted EPS by 16%. These results call to mind the presentation we made at our Investor Day in February of last year when we laid out several scenarios illustrating our ability to achieve our on average and over time earnings targets in a variety of economic environments. Given the slower revenue growth we experienced during the first quarter, our strong capital position and disciplined control of operating expenses were particularly important contributors to our financial performance and helped to drive 16% increase in earnings per share to $1.33. ","These results also brought our ROE for the period ending March 31 to 28% above our on average and over time target of 25%. ","Let's turn now to a more detailed look at several trends that will give you a better sense of the quarter starting with billed business on Slide 3. Overall billings remained solid with an FX adjusted increase of 7% versus 9% last quarter. The sequentially slower growth was primarily in the U.S. where billings rose 6% in Q1 compared to 9% during Q4. I said a minute ago this decline was more evident among our small business and corporate card members. Additionally, volume growth rate appeared to be influenced in part by the severe winter weather. I would add that while we are always cautious about drawing conclusions from intra-period trends, we were encouraged to see that U.S. billing growth increased over the second half of the quarter as the weather improved. Outside the U.S. where volumes continue to growth at a faster pace than the total company, billed business was up 10% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Overall, growth rates across international regions were generally consistent with the prior quarter and we did see a small uptick in EMEA from 6% in Q4 to 7% in the current quarter. ","Turning to billed business by segment on Slide 4, volumes continue to be particularly strong in GNS, up 15% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. GNS growth continues to be highest in the JAPA region powered largely by China and Japan. You do see across both the regional and segment view of our billings that the stronger U.S. dollar continued to put downward pressure on our billings and hence revenue growth as has been the case for the last five quarters. To give you a better sense of the drivers here, we have provided on Slide 5 some background on the major concentrations of our billed business by international currency. ","The first row shows the approximate range of billed business in each market as the percentage of total billed business. While the bottom row shows the year-over-year change in that foreign currency compared to the U.S. dollar. Overall, in Q1 this mix translated into approximately one percentage point reduction in both billings and revenue growth. ","Moving on now to loans, the other key revenue driver. We see on Slide 6 that loan balances grew 3% globally. U.S. loans were up 4% from a year ago. Both of these growth rates are consistent with what we saw in Q4. I\u2019ll also note that the total level of loans declined $3.2 billion versus Q4 which is in line with normal seasonal trends. We are pleased that our loan growth in the U.S. continues to outpace the industry average. Putting all the pieces of revenue together you see on Slide 7, the total revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX adjusted basis. Consistent with our spend-centric model this growth was primarily driven by the discount revenue growth that was generated by increased spending volumes. The other primary driver of revenue growth was an 8% increase in net interest income as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding cost and an increase in average loan balances. ","Another point I would make about our revenues was that the sale of our publishing business last year continues to depress the growth rate of other revenue and impacted total revenue growth this quarter by a little less than 1%. ","Turning now to provision. You can see on Slide 8 that our credit metrics remain near all time lows. Worldwide lending write-off and delinquency rates increased slightly in the quarter, consistent with seasonal trends. As a reminder our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but is instead to achieve the best economics on our portfolio. Therefore, at some point we would expect that lending write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels. ","Slide 9 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels. We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate even the risk level inherent in the portfolio. The fact that our delinquency rates have become more stable and our loan portfolio was growing resulted in a smaller reserve release in the first quarter and a year ago. The smaller reserve release more than offset the benefit from lower write-offs this year and grow total provision up 17% compared to a year ago as you can see on Slide 10.","The increase in the charge card provision in particular is primarily due to a reserve billed in the current year versus a reserve release in the prior year along with higher card member receivables. I'll also note that beginning this quarter we have reclassified fraud losses from provision for losses to operating expenses in order to be more consistent with industry practices. This had the effect of lowering provision and increasing operating expense, so we have reclassified prior periods for this change to keep everything comparable. ","Turning now to expenses. On Slide 11, you can see the total expenses were down 1% versus the prior year. Clearly, maintaining disciplined control of expenses particularly our operating expenses was the key driver behind our strong earnings performance during the quarter. To comment on a few specifics, you see that while marketing and promotion was relatively flat in this quarter, going forward we do anticipate that investment levels will increase as we move into Q2. For rewards expense, you see growth that was relatively consistent with our billed business growth during the quarter. ","The key story around expenses is obviously operating expenses. And we provide more detail on these on Slide 12 which shows a 4% decline in total operating expenses versus the prior year with lower expenses seen across every line. We did benefit from the timing of certain items this quarter. But also remind you that the sale of our publishing business continues to suppress operating expense growth by a little more than one percentage point. That said, our operating expense decline this quarter went well beyond our goal for the full year of keeping growth to less than 3% as you can see on Slide 13. ","Of course we remain committed to our annual target. But we would not expect to see similar declines in the remaining quarters of the year. ","To turn more broadly now to our marketing and promotion efforts to grow our business, Slide 14 shows that these expenses were relatively flat versus a year ago in Q1. As you can see on the chart, marketing and promotion is typically lower during Q1 and ramps up beginning in Q2. We continue to see many attractive opportunities in the market place including those for new customer and merchant acquisitions. To be specific, during the quarter we launched Amex EveryDay, a new credit card that rewards card members for how often they use the card not just how much they spend. The reward structure intends card member to use the card for everyday purchases at the places they frequent most. We are excited about the potential of the product to attract new customer segments to our franchise. At our Investor Day in February, we introduced OptBlue, the next step in the evolution of our merchant acquiring program in the U.S. OptBlue give small merchants the convenience of working with our network of third party merchant acquirers who have the flexibility to give them one pricing construct, one monthly statement, one settlement process and one contract that covers all of the major card brands the merchant chooses to accept. In February, we reported that we had signed six merchant acquirers to the program. Since then we have continued to add partners and believe OptBlue will provide a significant lift to our small merchant acquisition efforts as it is rolled out. And we continue to target a portion of our investment for longer term opportunities, in particular focusing on two large initiatives. Reloadable Prepaid, a product that help you move and manage your money and Loyalty Partner, our rewards coalition program. These initiatives continue to ramp up as evidenced by this quarter's launch of our Loyalty Partner program in Italy where we now have over 3.5 million collectors as of the end of March. A common theme across all of these new initiatives is to have the American Express brand be more welcoming and inclusive; to be meaningful to more people and more merchants. ","To return now to the financial. Turning to Slide 15, you see that during the first quarter our effective tax rate was 35.1%. This is the second quarter in a row that our tax rate has been somewhat higher than the recent past. Tax rate as you know often fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to a variety of discreet items. More importantly over the longer term we have seen modest increase in our average effective tax rate primarily because of the changes in the geographic mix of where we generate income. Additionally, in 2014 we are being impacted by certain changes in tax laws including the delay in the renewal of the active financing exemption and the loss of the R&D tax credit. In the past, we've mentioned that we expected our average effective tax rate to be in the low 30s range. When you look at the trend, we now believe that our rate for the full year could be closer to the mid 30s. And a last note on tax, I would point out that our tax rate at Q2, 2013 was just 29.6%. It was unusually low and was driven by certain discreet tax items. A challenge we will face in this year second quarter where will be growing over the impact of this lower rate. ","Now let's turn to capital. The substantial amount of new capital regenerate provides us with significant degrees of flexibility as shown on Slide 16. This quarter, we were able to return 73% of capital to shareholders, while also strengthening our already strong capital operations. And we have worked hard to continue to strengthen all aspects of our capital planning processes. In last month we were pleased that the Fed did not object to capital plan included in 2014 CCAR submission. The good news from the Fed underscore both our balance sheet's strength and our ability to remain profitable under hypothetical severe stress scenario while also reflecting the strength of our overall planning processes. In fact, in the Fed severe scenario we have the highest pretax income as a percentage of assets among all bank holding companies and our Tier 1 common ratio both before and after capital actions were in the top quartile as you can see on Slide 17. ","These results give us a leeway to increase our dividend by 13% beginning in the second quarter and to repurchase up to $3.4 billion of shares during the last three quarters of 2014 with up to an additional $1 billion during Q1, 2015. That represents a payout ratio that would be among the highest of all the CCAR participants. Our capital plan focused on three important priorities. Supporting our growth strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning a significant amount of the capital regenerate to our shareholders. One aspect of a strong balance sheet is maintaining a good mix of funding sources. And as you can see on Slide 18, we have improved the diversity of funding sources by building a significantly larger deposit base over the last several years. At this point, we believe our funding mix should be relatively stable going forward.","Before concluding I want to provide an update on the plans for our business travel joint venture. It's a reminder; our global business travel organization provides corporate customers with 24x7 support for travel in more than 135 countries. The agreement we signed this quarter entails our partners investing $900 million and the company contributing the assets of our business travel business to the joint venture. The new structure should provide greater resources to grow the business as a separate entity while maintaining important linkages with American Express. We still plan for the transaction to close by the end of the second quarter. However, as is the case with most sizable transactions there are regulatory aspects that could delay the transaction closing date. That we could receive regulatory approval very late in the second quarter which due to the complexity of the closing process could push back or second quarter earnings release date. We will keep you posted on the timing as we progress through the second quarter. More importantly, we expect to realize a sizable pretax gain which we currently estimate to be between $600 million to $700 million prior to considering any cost related to the transaction. As we have said before we plan to use a substantial portion of any gain net of transaction cost to position the company for the future. This will include supporting some of our newer growth initiatives including Amex EveryDay and Serve, as well initiative to increase the efficiency of the organization among other efforts. When we release Q2 results, we plan to provide additional detail to give you a clear understanding of our underline performance, the resulting gain on the transaction and associated cost, incremental spending and growth in other initiatives as well as the expected impact the JV will have as we present our results in the future. ","So in summary, coming back to our first quarter result. Our strong earnings performance makes us feel good about the flexibility of our business model. We generated EPS growth above our on average and over time target driven by disciplined control of operating expenses, our strong capital position and continued low write-off rate. While billings and revenue growth slowed modestly from the first quarter, our financial performance was solid.","Looking forward we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enabled us to deliver significant value to our shareholders. ","With that I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with only one follow up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions).","Our first question will come from Craig Maurer with CLSA. Please go ahead. ","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Yes, good evening guys, thanks. I wanted to understand your thought process on the spending trend in the quarter and how the shift of Easter into April affected the year-over-year comparison? ","Jeff Campbell ","","Well, I guess I would say couple things about the spending trend. As I said the sequential decline was clearly stronger amongst the small business and corporate card member segment. I think it is also important to point out that the sequential trend across the quarter and well that's something we are always very cautious as you know Craig to draw too much attention to because there is inherent volatility when you look at any short term period. But we did see the second half being stronger than the first. And I would say in the first few days of April, we haven't seen anything that contradicts that general trend. We do lots of internal analysis where we make a number of adjustments to how we look at our spending considering exactly what the days are or the week are in this period, trying to use historical patterns around holidays to make adjustments so when I make comments about trends they are considering all of those adjustments. All that said, there is clearly some art to doing something like an adjustment for a holiday like Easter that moves around quite a bit from year-to-year. So we take what we think is a fairly sophisticated approach to those adjustments but there are some subjectivity to it. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead ","Don Fandetti - Citi","Yes, good evening. Jeff, it looked like the March data suggest some slight uptick in year-over-year loan growth in the U.S.? Are you seeing any signs of increase consumer appetite for debt or are we just still in a holding pattern?","Jeff Campbell ","Well, when you look at our loan growth Don it is actually been pretty consistent for the last few quarters at around 3% to 4%, globally it was 3%, this quarter little higher in the U.S., 4%. And when you look as you know at the industry data the industry has been bouncing around flat, sometimes down little bit. I think the February year-to-date numbers were up about half a point in the U.S. So we have certainly been pleased by the fact that our loan growth was holding steady at a little bit above that industry average. But frankly you don't see anything in our first quarter result that suggest any particular acceleration of that trend or do we see it yet in the industry data we\u2019ve looked at. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Mark DeVries - Barclays","Yes, thanks. Jeff I know you indicated that we shouldn't expect to see OpEx remain at this kind of down 4% year-over-year level going forward. But if you don't see a meaningful acceleration of billed business growth particularly with the modest headwind we have now from kind of higher tax rate is it reasonable to think you\u2019ll have to remain kind of well below the cap of 3% growth, if you want the hit the on average over time targets for EPS growth this year? ","Jeff Campbell ","Well, I think Mark that's a very good question, really goes to the flexibility of our business model. As I said in my earlier comments, I would actually take you and other folks back to the February FCM when we showed that we have a quite a number of levers that we can pull and have a history of pulling. So certainly I would stick to the remarks I made a few minutes ago that the 4% decline year-over-year you see in the first quarter is not indicative of what you would expect -- should expect the next couple of quarters, there were some timing items. But we are very committed to using the flexibility of our business model to achieve our earnings targets. I think we have a pretty strong track record pulling various levers and how much we let operating expenses, and other expenses grow over the remainder of this year will certainly be heavily influenced by the economic environment we see. We don't try to out-guess the economic forecasters and we build plans based on consensus GDP forecast. The consensus has actually come down slightly in the last 90 days but we certainly hope that that\u2019s wrong and we hope the economy shows strong acceleration from here, but we think we have the flexibility in our business to react to whatever environment we face.","Mark DeVries - Barclays","Okay, that's helpful. In the earnings supplement there was comment that indicated U.S. consumer travel sales declined 7% year-over-year. The question I have is, is that trend you expect to continue? Were there any signs that weather affected that? And do you generate higher fees on the consumer side than you do on business travel? ","Jeff Campbell ","You have very sharp eyes for somebody who has only had an hour or two to stare at the voluminous amount of material we put out, so yes you are correct. The consumer travel business shows a decline of about 7%. That's actually driven by the fact that we\u2019ve sold a small part of that business that provided the packaged vacation, it was such a small transaction not particularly material so we didn't bother to call it out last year but that actually is what the loss of the revenue associated with that business or what drove the 7% decline. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. ","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Thank you. I guess just focusing on the volume trends going forward. I mean when we think about and maybe even revenue growth, when we think about the trends going forward, are there any investments that you are making that might start paying their dividend sometime from second quarter onwards? And I guess broadly speaking, when I look back in time it seems like that 8% target hasn't been hit for a while and I guess over the past several years if not more it is probably only been hit once. So can you just talk about conceptually how you guys think about that revenue growth target going forward? Thanks. ","Jeff Campbell ","Well, we continue Sanjay to think that the 8% revenue target is an appropriate target on average over time and a non-average and over time economic environment. You are quite factually correct but if you look at the last few years our revenue has -- tends to be a little bit below that level. I would point out that despite that we have shown much better performance on the EPS side due to the flexibility of the business model I just talked about. We certainly have an economic environment over the last year that has not gotten to the global economies or in particular the U.S. economy\u2019s long term average trend. Certainly when you look at the original GDP consensus forecast for this year, there is target to approach those long term averages. It appears based on what economic data is out there so far that's probably not going to be the case the first quarter. And that is probably reflected somewhat in our results. But we would not in any way want to back off from the appropriateness of that 8% target and we continue to believe that as the economy returns to more normal growth rates, you will see us head towards that. ","The other part of your question, we certainly are always balancing across our investment portfolio, things that are going to help us in the near term to medium term and the long term. And we have made a number of incremental investments and did some stepped up investing towards the latter part of last year and those are things that as you \u2013 if we follow normal patterns will help us as we get further into 2014 and beyond. You also as I mentioned in our remarks saw us launch a few \u2013 a new product in the U.S. market EveryDay just at the end of the last quarter. We just re-launched Serve at the end of last year, those are things that again as you get later into 2014 and beyond, you will begin to see meaningful contributions. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next in queue will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead ","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Hi, thank you. I had a question follow up on the JV thing. I believe that your reported expenses were decreased significantly once you deconsolidate that business travel segment and started accounted for it under the equity method. So I guess my first question is that right? And then more broadly how would that JV gain impact? How we should think about your commitment to that operating expense growth below 3% through the end of this year? ","Jeff Campbell ","Those are both very good questions, Bill. So first just may be to it sounds like you got and may be I should be making clear for everyone. So as we execute on the joint venture transaction that will shift our accounting to the equity method which means that all you will see in our P&L will be are proportionate 50% share of the joint venture's earnings each quarter. We won't report any revenues, we won't report any expenses. So that means you will see the travel and other commissions revenue line come down significantly into that line predominant thing within that line today is our revenues from the business travel joint venture. And then most of the expenses of business travel appear in the operating expense category. So both of those assuming we hit our current timeline beginning in the third quarter, you will no longer see the business travel amount in those rows. We will as we get close, as we get to in actual close give you the real specifics on that. But that's the structure or the methodology if you will but everyone should keep in mind as they think about what our finance statements will look like going forward. ","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Okay, thank you. If I may with one follow up. Can you talk about whether it is reasonable to expect that you are fully complete buybacks up to the full amount that was in your capital submission and then along those lines, can you talk about how are you thinking about the stock at these levels? I think in the past you guys have thought about capital return as capital return haven't I believe in a so much focused on the price. But I wanted to see if may be you could update us on the thought process. ","Jeff Campbell ","So let me those two questions. So certainly we are committed to the amount that the Fed did not object to in our CCAR submission. There is a very small portion of the total each year that is a little tricky at the end because what the Fed actually approves, not to get too in the details here, is a net repurchase amount net of the proceeds we get from option exercises. So as we go through the year and we get to the fourth quarter of CCAR year which is really the first quarter of the calendar year, we make an estimate of what we think the option exercise is going to be that year and then we conservatively size our share repurchase in that last quarter to match that, so if you did all the math, you do see we grew about $60 million or so below for the fourth quarter period what was approved in our 2014 CCAR. That's just sort of not to get into detail too much as I said. That's the mechanics of the process we do our best to estimate what's going to happen but option exercises are not always the easiest thing to exercise. More importantly and more broadly, you are correct and we do very much remained committed to the philosophy that we believe we should have a well capitalized and strong balance sheet. We believe we should pursue all the internal capital spending and external opportunity that we think are prudent and offer good return to our shareholders, once we are done with those two things, we don't believe we should sit on excess capital and so we will return capital once we have hit those first two objectives to our shareholders through a mixture of dividends, and our dividend for the factoring for our profile we think is a competitive dividend, and then we use share repurchase to return the remaining capital. We think we have a tremendous track record of growth over many, many years as a company. We continue to believe we have many growth opportunities going forward. And so we believe that is a good financial proposition for our shareholders to continue to return capital to our shareholders and we are not therefore very indifferent to modest swings in the price. I would also just make the observation that our stock in a normal economy environment is not a particularly volatile stock. And so just not figure greatly in our repurchase efforts I guess is the last comment I just remind you that mechanically as a public company these all kinds of constrains under which we buyback shares so practically you end up with more of an averaging in approach when you are returning a large amounts of capital that we return to our shareholders. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead. ","Bob Napoli - William Blair","Good afternoon. Question, at the GNS business continues to show very strong spent growth 15% then trending is at that level, but the revenue growth is only showing this quarter at 5% in that segment and I just like I mean do you think that GNS can continue to grow with those types of rates? And shouldn't revenue, why is not revenue growth matching the spend growth? ","Jeff Campbell ","","Well, couple of comments. First just a mechanical comment. Remember what you actually see in our statements is what we refer to as GNMS which is a mixture of our GNS business and the proportionate share of the little over 20 countries where we do the proprietary acquiring of the merchant portion of the economics. So it's really the GNS growth rate are not the same as the GNMS growth rate. All that said and we don't break the GNS growth rate out publicly separately. All that said, when you look at that GNS billings number, I try to always remind people that while we are really pleased with that 15% number, a portion of that high growth is driven by China. And China as you know is a market where because of the regulatory environment; it is very difficult for any player to get a lot of economics out of the billings. We are pleased with what we have been doing in China because we think without any capital expenditure we are building awareness in presence in brand in China that we believe we will find ways to monetize over the longer term. But in the near term, China is the market that produces a significant number o billing in our GNS business and very, very little revenue. So the GNS revenue is below that billing's number but you can't see it when you look at the GNMS number. ","","Bob Napoli - William Blair","","Okay, then my second question is just on the OptBlue. And we've heard from some contacts that product is very well received by the market and it is only handful of merchant acquirers offering it today. But can you comment on what's your expectations are for OptBlue? Do you expect to have that in the hands of most merchant acquirers? At some point and then it does offer lower discount rate and are you comfortable with the economics and the strategic value of OptBlue as you seen operate now for a few months? ","Jeff Campbell ","Yes, good question. So the first, let me start on the facts, so when we first talked about this in February, we talked about the fact we had six merchant acquirers on board and we have been very pleased since then to add several more, and we think we are on a track to really get most of the industry on board and we are very excited about that. It is very, very early in the process. So we all need to watch and see how this plays out in the coming quarters and couple of years, but I would say all of our early experiences are positive and very reinforcing of the plans we set out at that February financial community meeting. And you are correct that there are some trade-offs here but what we also pointed out that we are in a fact offering a sort of my term a wholesale discount rate to the acquirer. There are also certain incentives that we have traditional paid to acquirer that go away, so that helps on portion of that wholesale rate that will just show up in a different place from financial perspective but helps offset it. Here the much more important thing is that we believe this program has the potential in the U.S. over the next several years to make very, very material dent in the coverage gap that we have in the U.S. And we think that is very powerful for our issuing businesses and can drive incremental volumes that will make this a very positive trade off for the company and for our shareholders. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Just a follow-up on the topic we were just talking about. You indicated the discount rate is a little bit lower but I'm just wondering lower than what, because when we look at your all-in discount rate obviously you would skew -- I would expect to some larger merchants. So are you suggesting the overall company discount rate is negatively impacted by this or just the like for like small merchant?","Jeff Campbell ","Yes, that's a good question, Betsy. So to be very precise my comments are really directed at the economics with the very small merchants who are part of the OptBlue program. Now obviously any change with any merchant does affect the company's overall rate. But it is important to realize that while in merchants that we believe we will gain through this program are very important from a coverage and a perception of coverage perspective. In terms of the percentage of our total billing that these very small merchants generate that is very, very modest portion overall of our whole billings and therefore the impact on the company's overall discount rate is changes is very much moderated by that mathematical reality if you will. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay and then separately you indicated earlier in the call that the US billings growth rate was negatively impacted by weather and you ended the quarter better than the first couple of weeks of the quarter. Could you tell us what January, February, March was in terms of the year and your growth in billing year?","Jeff Campbell","Well, if you will, we don't like to break it out that specifically by month. I would just stick to the comments that the second half of the quarter was certainly stronger than the first half and we haven't seen anything in the early part of April that contradicts that trend. I'll also just make the observation that partly because of the closed loop, we have a tremendous amount of information by merchant by type of merchant, by industry, by city, by day, that allows us to do quite a detailed analysis of the impact of some of the most severe weather by city by day that you saw in a country and that's what makes us quite comfortable in my commentary that there certainly was weather impact in January and February.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay and lastly on the expenses you indicated that there was some timing issue there and we shouldn't expect obviously to have this sub zero, 4% shrinkage in OpEx on go-forward basis. Is there anything that you have planning now to do that would be incenting incremental billings growth for Q2 and 3Q or really to get into that the kind of activity we have to wait for the closing of the global trouble business?","Jeff Campbell ","Well, I guess I would say we generally are not targeting our spend decision in terms of the benefit of spending, we do quite is precisely as you just suggested by so that we know the benefits and how they're going to appear by quarter. We generally are making investment choices that we think will help us over longer time period. Certainly as I pointed out in my remarks, as you get into Q2, you would expect to see some incremental spending in a number of areas supported by the business travel. We did just launch the EveryDay card at the end of March, so we are really just in the introduction phase of that. The Serve product is in its very early days since we just re-launched with vastly improved functionality towards the latter part of last year. And there are probably a few steps you will see us taking that are just another step on our journey of the coming days and ever more efficient company with a really good solid cost structure and some of the things would drive some one time charges. So all of those things are targeted at helping us as we move into the latter part of 2014 and beyond. But I wouldn't want to suggest that there was precise thing help us in any specific quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group","Thanks. I had a follow-up to Betsy and Craig' question again about the trends in the first quarter of spending. And can you tell us the recovery in the second half of the quarter bring you back to sort of fourth quarter growth rates in the USCS or -- is there any other comments you have in terms of where the spending was weak in the first half aside from geography?","Jeff Campbell ","Well, certainly so couple of comments. I gosh I don't want to get so specific that I am calling out specific numbers based on a few weeks. To step back for just a second and try a little bit context, I mean if you look over the last several years and our billing rates and our revenues rates, you will find some modest volatility quarter-to-quarter where we go up or down a point or two and it is not necessarily indicative of a long term trend so that's why we are cautious about even now talking about within a quarter or within a couple of weeks trends that overly specific. In terms of the specific geographies and industries I think it is all the things you would expect so if you pull out a weather database, you will see specific days in Europe and Boston and Chicago, in St. Louis of extreme weather and when we look at what happened in those places you see some pretty extreme results in those cities on those days, when you look at things like airline billings, it is lots of lots of public commentary about the massive, in fact that we record number of flights, that might whole industry manage to cancel in January and February, that's lost revenue to the airlines which is why they are talking a lot about how much revenue they lost, frankly it is also lost business to us. So those are the couple things I probably call out that are in these specific things we looked at. ","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group","And the travel aspect of that would be the reason you call out small business and corporate spend as opposed to consumer in the quarter?","Jeff Campbell ","Well, that certainly a logical connection, I mean at some point all of that start, we can't understand the psychology of everyone of our card members, so at some point I want to be careful here because it gets to us making some educated judgments and we can't prove that to you but those have -- that fact pattern would appear to fit together to us.","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group","My basic question was I just wonder if you could share any incremental thoughts about the European regulation, and given that we have been through now the parliament process, what is your thinking in terms of vulnerability of GNS business in Euro zone or UK?","Jeff Campbell ","Well, certainly the -- those discussions are something that we are following closely. We are very engaged in and we spend a lot of time trying to help all of the players involved there, understand the real economics and the real competitive dynamics of that market place. Just to level set for everyone I would remind people that we are somewhere to use -- may be I use a cricket term but yeah we are in somewhere in the middle innings right because they first the commission published their draft proposal, the parliament came out just a few weeks ago with their version of the recommendations, the next thing is that the European Council recommendations and then there is sort of the equivalent of a conference committee in the U.S. where they all come together. We are very engaged and certainly there are some things we think in the regulation that are -- have the potential to have some real untended consequences and achieve results that are probably not what the regulators intended. Those are the kinds of things we have a lot of dialogue with them amount. All that said, we do business in many, many countries around the globe with many different types of regulatory regimes. And frankly our business model varies from country to country. So we are used to and a little experienced that dealing with evolving environment and evolving our business models. This is the situation that is very important to us. We are watching it very closely. We are going to just have to see how this all plays out which we think will continue to take some time.","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group","You don't expect final resolution this by summer or something? ","Jeff Campbell ","No, not to go out on limb and guess politics but we don't. We would say at this point and you are correct that originally they were trying to get this done by April or May that is clearly not going to happen. Our view would be the earliest you could get to a resolution is probably much later this year and certainly could extend beyond that. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital. Please go ahead. ","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","","Thank you. Jeff, I do understand the cricket terminology so just stop over to -- ","Jeff Campbell ","Well, you'll have to educate me on what I just said. ","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Well, I do have a couple of questions. So first one was just to clarify the re-class of fraud losses out of provisions into operating expenses looking at I don't know if you disclose a specific number for this quarter but looked like the run rate was $70 million or so a quarter. Is that correct? Or maybe you disclosed the actual number for this quarter and I just missed it.","Jeff Campbell ","Well, you are correct that the run rate tends to be $70 million to $80 million a quarter. I think we often talk about fraud on a basis point level because our fraud rate when you just look at industry data or as you know about half the industry were just for 70 to 80 is good run rate. I don't know, did we disclose a specific number more specific; it doesn't vary that much from quarter-to-quarter usually. ","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. Then just the other question was in terms of the amexoffers.com there was the program where you can basically just go online check for offer, save them to your card and be able to redeem them. It looks like AMEX offers are basically ranked on individual relevant. So I'm kind of curious if there was anything that from a timing perspective or technology perspective that resulted this in kind of coming together relatively recently. I mean is this tied into your big data projects and trying to mine some of your consumer data to make more relevant offers? That was one question. The second part of it is how big do you see this program becoming potentially?","Jeff Campbell ","Well, certainly we think that our ability to put together an offer eco system is particularly strong because of our close loop and a particular source of value both for our merchants and for our card members and of course card members value at the more we can customize for them, what we offer them and of course we are getting better that every month including using your location to be very specific to what we offer you. And we have seen growing interest on the part of merchants in using that eco system to help them drive business. So we are I think quite excited about our ability to continue to expand our efforts in this area and our ability to use it is one of the many key tenets we have to create value across our entire network of both card members and merchants. ","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay and then I'm getting a little bit specific here, but just on a different note here with your EveryDay preferred credit card, you're referred to this program. And I was looking at some of the rewards associated with the preferred card and they do seem somewhat rich depending on how you use them. But is this a sign because I think some other card issuers also have been ramping up the rewards if you will and some of the card offer, Wells Fargo is clearly indicated they want to grow their card business. So I mean Is this a sign that we are seeing competition at this point now that is going to eventually just reduce the profitability, the products across the board or do you see these are just very specific to certain target demographic and so as a result of that we shouldn't read into this more broadly that there will be rational competition?","Jeff Campbell ","Well, certainly I guess I made the couple of points. One, remember that our goal is to engage our card members in the reward program because that is really how we generate the most loyalty, the most spend and the best bottom line result. So feel an irony here is as a general statement it can be a very positive thing for us when our rewards expand goes up. We've also done a lot of work over the last years and you continue to see as every quarter really expand the range of redemption offers because people have lots of different preferences and lots of different likes and dislikes and we have found great receptivity amongst our card members to that growing range of offers, which I think someone may trying to do the kind of comparison you just described. A little trickier because you don't necessarily know the redemption pattern and some ways you can look at our rewards cost each quarter. And that does give you a macro view of how it is trending relative to billings. On EveryDay preferred, clearly we think we have a proposition here that is going to be very attractive to a segment of the market that fits our long standing risk profile that we are after but frankly a segment of the market we probably didn't have the right product for it. And certainly offering the right product to that demographic has to include having a competitive set of rewards, but I guess I will be a little cautious about extrapolating from that one data point anything overly broad about rewards in general. ","Jeff Campbell ","I think operator we probably have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our question will come from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies. Please go ahead","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies and Company ","Great. Thank you for the opportunity here. Earlier in the prepared remarks you said you were working on products that are more welcoming and more inclusive. And focusing on new customer segments. The way a layman should read this is simply that you're looking to move slightly down the credit spectrum as the economy has improved or how should we read those comments?","Jeff Campbell ","Well, I don't if I used focus on the word credit. I like to think as I said if you look at this company over the last 30-40 years, we started out with a credit card with target our charge card, that was targeted in a very, very small group of customers who travel a lot in State at certain types of hotel. And there has been a steady evolution over decade of us moving beyond that initial very narrow customer demographic, moving beyond the very narrow merchant demographic and moving towards EveryDay spend, moving towards the broader customer base, we added lend products etcetera. And so when we look at things like the EveryDay card, the prepaid products, and the OptBlue program to expand merchant coverage, all of those things to us a part of long running trend in this company to extend the franchise and the brand which we think is so powerful. But that doesn't mean that we are changing the risk profile or the credit profile of the company. We think it means having the right product for different parts of the market. And matching that with ways that we provide value and merchant. So I -- yes we feel real opportunity here to continue to expand the footprint of our brand but this is not about changing our risk profile. For the EveryDay card, this is for people who already would have qualified for other products. And frankly we didn't really have a product that they thought was relevant for them. That's what we are trying to do. ","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies and Company ","Okay, great. Thank you for the opportunity. That was my only question. ","Jeff Campbell ","So thank you all for your time and your interest in American Express. Have a good evening. ","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the American Express Q3 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Rosie Perez. Please go ahead.","Rosie Perez","Thank you, Alan and thank you, all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's slides and on our reports on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.","We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Jeff Campbell, CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to the Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff.","With that, let me turn it over to Steve.","Stephen Squeri","Thanks Rosie. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us.","As you saw in our release earlier today, our third quarter results are a continuation of the consistent steady performance we've been delivering over the last few years. We had strong FX-adjusted revenue growth of 9% in the quarter and our EPS of $2.08 was 11% higher than last year.","Consistently high levels of revenue growth we are delivering is the result of the focused approach we've taken in executing our strategy and the strength of our differentiated business model.","This was the 9th straight quarter where FX-adjusted revenue growth was 8% or higher. I'm especially pleased that our revenue growth continues to be driven by a well-balanced mix of spend, loans, and fees.","Card fee revenues were particularly strong, growing 19% and exceeding $1 billion this quarter for the first time. Nearly 70% of the cards we've acquired this year are fee-based products, providing us recurring subscription-like revenues. The trends we saw in the business remain consistent with an economy that continues to expand, albeit at a more modest pace than last year.","Our FX-adjusted proprietary billings grew 7%, led by strong growth in our U.S. and international consumer businesses. We continue to deliver healthy loan growth, and our credit performance remained at industry-leading levels. In fact, better than the expectations we had at the beginning of the year.","So, as you can see, even with some uncertainty in the global economic and political environment, our strategy of investing in share, scale, and relevance is enabling us to deliver steady solid results.","With that in mind, I'd like to discuss our progress on the three company-wide initiatives I laid out at Investor Day. As a reminder, these cut across all of our strategic imperatives. They are focusing on our customer as a platform for growth, expanding and leveraging our network of strategic partners, and prioritizing our investments in international to drive growth.","Let's start with customers as a platform for growth. Our global diverse customer base has become a major source of growth for us. One of the ways we're deepening relationships with existing customers is through the disciplined strategic approach we've taken to continuously refresh our products. These refreshes are not just cosmetic changes.","We're redefining membership by adding innovative, experiential, and rational value that our customers respond well to, and we're pricing for that additional value. In the third quarter, we continued the refresh of our Platinum Card portfolio across several international markets, and we're following a similar playbook with our Gold Cards. Now, we're updating our iconic Green Card.","A few weeks ago, we introduced a new Ocean Plastic design; and later this month, we'll announce an array of changes to the product, including new benefits, broader payment flexibility, and a digital focus. And just yesterday, we announced the major refresh of our Corporate Card program, which includes a number of new features, including newer enhanced benefits with Uber, Hilton, and CLEAR, which is the biometric identification system that expedites the airport security process.","As part of that announcement, we introduced an extension of our Corporate Card program designed to meet the needs of start-ups with features that include corporate liability and dynamic spending capacity.","As I've said on prior occasions, we typically see a significant increase in spending, when our customers add an additional Amex product to their wallets, and our Corporate Card members represent a great opportunity here.","For many of our customers, the Corporate Card is their first American Express product. To encourage them to add a personal card, we're creating ways that provide benefits for carrying both, such as a new program that offers an incentive for Corporate Card members to obtain one of our select consumer cards.","These initiatives are proving to be a terrific platform for growth. We're seeing a lift in spending and engagement on our refreshed products. Over 60% of our total loan growth is coming from existing card members, and we're earning a steady stream of revenues as more customers move to fee-based products, which are priced to the additional value we're delivering.","Our customers have also become one of the best and most efficient ways to bring new card members into the franchise. Through our Member-Get-Member referral program, we've acquired over 250,000 new customers this year so far. In addition, successful referrals have increased 35% compared to last year's third quarter.","Turning to partnerships. The third quarter continued to demonstrate the benefits of our powerful network of partners who help us deliver enhanced value across the enterprise. As I've said before, partnerships are essential to each of our strategic imperatives, and they take many forms from the over 50 co-brand relationships we have around the world to our recent digital partnerships to expanding our merchant network. When we talk about partnerships, we have to start with Delta, our largest, deepest, and longest-running relationship.","At the end of September, we announced seven refreshed Delta SkyMiles co-brand cards as part of our renewed 11-year agreement with the airline. The new cards, which will be available in January in the U.S., will feature a range of customized travel benefits for both consumers and small business card members.","Also in the third quarter, we launched a new small business credit card in the U.K. with British Airways and one in Singapore with Singapore Airlines, and we announced refreshed consumer cards in Canada with AIR MILES and Scotiabank. In addition to co-brands, we've been expanding our digital partnerships.","Earlier this week, we announced two new offerings with PayPal and Venmo for U.S. consumer card members. First is the ability to pay for purchases made through PayPal with membership rewards points. And we're also introducing with the bill functionality within the Amex mobile app. On the merchant side, with the help of our OptBlue partnerships, we remain on track to achieve virtual parity coverage in the U.S. by the end of the year.","In international, our strategy of selectively increasing our investments to drive share, scale, and relevance through a country-by-country approach is delivering strong results. Despite political and economic uncertainty in some regions, international remains the highest growth area of our business.","Third quarter results showed continued strong growth across both consumer and small business segments, driven by results in our top strategic countries where we've allocated incremental investments. Since the beginning of the year, we've launched 18 new or refreshed proprietary cards, three co-brand cards, and 30 network cards across international.","As a result, we're taking share and generating strong billings growth in most of our proprietary countries, with overall FX-adjusted Consumer Proprietary Billings, up 14% in the quarter, and FX-adjusted SME billings up 18%. And finally, we're making good progress on expanding merchant coverage, which is key to our overall international growth strategy.","As you can see, we've made a lot of progress in each of our three priority areas since March and there's more to come. In summary, I feel very good about our performance in the quarter and year-to-date.","As we look ahead, I expect the consistent trends we've seen to continue into Q4, translating into revenue growth of 8% to 10% in the quarter and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of adjusted EPS between $7.85 and $8.35.","Our performance reinforces my confidence in our ability in today's environment to sustain high levels of revenue growth and consistent double-digit EPS growth, which creates value for our shareholders. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress.","Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone.","It's good to be here today to talk about yet another solid quarter of steady and consistent performance. Let's get right to our summary financials on Slide 3. Third quarter revenues of $11 billion, grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, with this growth driven again by a well-balanced mix of spend, lend and fee revenues.","We continue to see a spread between our reported revenue growth of 8% and FX-adjusted revenue growth of 9%. Although the U.S. dollar has strengthened recently, the spread between our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth has lessened slightly relative to Q2.","As you recall, the year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar began in the third quarter of last year. Assuming the dollar stays roughly where it is today, you should see reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth levels more similar to each other in the fourth quarter 2019.","Our strong topline revenue performance drove net income of $1.8 billion, up 6% from a year ago, and earnings per share was $2.08, representing EPS growth of 11% in the third quarter. This EPS growth was supported by the 4% reduction in our share count enabled by our continued prudent management of the capital generating capabilities of our business model as we returned $5.5 billion in excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the last four quarters.","Turning now to the details of our performance, I'll start with billed business, which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 6. Starting on Slide 4, our FX-adjusted total billings growth for the third quarter was 6%.","We think it is important, though, to continue to breakout the billings growth between our proprietary and network businesses due to the differing trends as we exit our network business in Europe and Australia. We expect to fully lap the billings impact from these exits in 2020.","Our proprietary business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 7% in the third quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. The remaining 14% of our overall billings, which comes from our network business, GNS was down 2% in the third quarter on an FX-adjusted basis.","Turning to our proprietary billed business growth on Slide 5. The trends this quarter continue to be consistent with the economic tone. The U.S. consumer continues to show solid growth with even some modest acceleration as we have gone through 2019. The international consumer shows even higher levels of growth and our commercial customers are lapping a particularly strong 2018 with spending trends that have diverged a bit from the consumer segment.","You see this as you turn to Slide 6. We first spoke last quarter about potential signs of caution in commercial spending trends relative to the strong and steady growth we see in consumer. Over the last few months, the headlines and macro data, which suggests that these trends continue, particularly among the larger corporations within our customer base.","We see these dynamics in our large and global corporate card trends, where we had a 1% decline in billed business on an FX-adjusted basis in the third quarter. So, adjusting for the reduction in spending from just two large customers, where we saw some client-specific decreases, the growth rate would have been a bit above 1% this quarter.","In contrast, spending from our U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs grew a solid 6% in the third quarter with importantly relatively stable growth throughout the three months of the quarter.","We continue to feel great about the long-term opportunities with both of these customer types. And as Steve highlighted a few minutes ago, we are making investments that leverage our strong leadership position and differentiated business model to take advantage of these opportunities.","International SME remains our highest growing customer type with 18% FX-adjusted billings growth in the third quarter. Given our focus on this segment and the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products, we believe we have a long runway to sustain this strong growth.","Moving to U.S. consumer, which made up 33% of the company's billings in the third quarter, billings were up 8%. And taking the number out of decimal, actually a bit stronger than Q1 and Q2. This growth reflects continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers. These trends also highlight the continued strength of the consumer in the U.S.","Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the teens at 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. As we mentioned earlier, we continue to have widespread growth in our proprietary business across key markets, despite the mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.","While growth in Australia and Mexico moderated to the high-single digits this quarter, we continued to see strong growth of 19% in both the U.K. and Japan as well as double-digit growth in our top markets across the EU, all on an FX-adjusted basis.","Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 2% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia, where we are in the process of exiting our network business.","Although network billings are down in these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia, the remaining portion of GNS was up 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall then, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate.","Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7. Total loan growth was 9% in the third quarter, with over 60% of that growth again coming from our existing customers. We feel good about our lending strategy, which is focused on taking advantage of the unique opportunity we have to deepen our share of our existing customers borrowing. We believe we have a long runway to continue this strategy.","Moving to the right-hand side of Slide 7. Net interest yield was 11.1% in the third quarter, up 30 basis points relative to the prior year, reflecting continued positive impacts from mix and pricing for risk.","We remain focused on optimizing our lending capabilities and pricing constructs, and we have seen lower loan balances on promotional offers, as we have shifted towards more premium products. The combination of loan growth and yield increases are contributing to the 12% growth in net interest income that we delivered this quarter.","Slide 8 then shows the credit implications of our strategy. As you can see, the trends on both write-off rates and delinquencies continued to be stable and benign, reflecting in part the low unemployment rate in relatively stable economy. We see these trends across both our consumer and commercial segments. The GCP net loss ratio remains lower than last year.","And as you've seen in the tables that accompany our earnings release, both consumer and small business credit trends also remained steady. These trends lead to the same conclusion we have reached in each quarter so far this year. We do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment, both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these portfolios are performing much better than we expected at the beginning of the year.","This brings us to provision expense. In the third quarter, provision expense growth was 8%, reflecting the greater stability in our credit trends that began in the second half of 2018. Clearly, as we've gone through the year, credit performance for us as well as for others in the industry has been better than expected. That's what we saw again in the third quarter and as a result, we now expect full-year provision growth of around 10%. While we are on the subject of provision though, let me take a few minutes to talk about CECL.","We are making good progress on our efforts to prepare for implementation on January 1, 2020. We stick with our comments last quarter, based on our work so far, we estimate that if we implemented CECL today, our current total reserves of $2.8 billion would increase by roughly 25% to 40%. This estimate includes a roughly 55% to 70% increase in lending card reserves, somewhat offset by a significantly lower charge card reserve, given the extremely short life of a charge receivable.","Stepping back, there are three important takeaways on CECL that I would like to leave you with. First, we believe that the capital impact of the one-time implementation increase in reserves will likely be very manageable, given our strong balance sheet, 30% plus ROE and spend-centric model.","Next, it is important to keep in mind that CECL will have an impact on our provision expense going forward. Although the ultimate impact will be heavily dependent on many factors, we will likely have higher provision expense under CECL relative to the current accounting methodology, as we continue to grow our loan book. Since we are currently finalizing our CECL models and working on our 2020 plan, we'll provide more color on the expected 2020 impact from CECL on next quarter's call.","Finally, CECL is merely an accounting-driven acceleration of estimated losses. There is no change to the underlying economics, our view of the risk profile, or the ultimate expected losses in our portfolios. Given this as well as our strategy of investing for growth, we do not intend to change our investment plans because of the impact CECL will have on provision expense growth in 2020.","Now, let's get back to our results and turn to the strong revenue growth of 9% on an FX-adjusted basis that you see on Slide 10. The consistent execution of our strategies and our focus on investing in share, scale and relevance has driven topline revenue growth of 8% or more for over two years. This consistent revenue performance has occurred in both the robust economic environment of 2018 and the somewhat slower growth environment of 2019.","And despite the modest sequential deceleration in volume growth we saw this quarter, our revenue growth of 9.4% in the third quarter was relatively flat to the 9.6% growth we delivered last quarter. This revenue growth was again driven by broad-based growth across spend, lend and fee revenues as you can see on Slide 11. And importantly, the portion of our revenue coming from spend and fee revenues remained at 80% in the third quarter, in line with those both recent history and a much longer view of our history.","Discount revenue was up 6% on a reported basis and was up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis, which I'll come back to on the next slide. Net card fee growth accelerated to 19% and as Steve said surpassed $1 billion in the third quarter for the first time. This is the financial outcome of the disciplined approach to product refreshment and our unique value propositions that Steve also talked about in his opening remarks.","We are really pleased by the confidence that our customers place in our value propositions when they choose to pay these subscription-like fees. And as Steve mentioned earlier, but I think it bears repeating, we continue to see that the majority of our new card members, around 70% so far this year, are choosing our fee-based products as well.","Going forward, we feel good about our ability to maintain strong growth in these membership revenues, given the breadth of products that are driving this momentum across geographies and across customer segments.","Net interest income grew 12% in the third quarter, driven by the growth in loans and net yield that I just mentioned a few moments ago. So let's come back now to the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue, on Slide 12.","On the right, you see the discount revenue grew 7% on an FX-adjusted basis, in line with the last two quarters, making this the eighth consecutive quarter with discount revenue growth above 6%. We see this as continued evidence that our strategy of focusing on driving discount revenue, not the average discount rate, is working.","Moving on now to the things we are investing in to drive our strong revenue growth. Let's start with our customer engagement costs, which you can see on Slide 13, were $5 billion in the third quarter, up 11% versus last year. Starting at the bottom, marketing and business development costs were up 11% in the third quarter and were in line with Q2.","Remember that this line has two components, our traditional marketing and promotion expenses and then payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners.","Also remember that this is the second quarter, where we are seeing the impact of our renewed agreement with Delta, which increased our marketing and business development costs by $200 million relative to our original outlook for the full year.","Continuing on to rewards expense, you can see that it was up 9% relative to the prior year, a bit higher than our billing trends, given our evolving value propositions. Moving then to the top of the slide, Card Member services costs were up 22% in the third quarter.","We continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category, as it includes the cost of many components of our differentiated value propositions such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based products.","Moving on then to operating expenses on Slide 14. We saw a 5% increase in the third quarter, consistent with a long track record of getting operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues. I would offer two comments here.","First, as I mentioned last quarter, some of the investments we are making to deliver continued strong revenue growth, growth in sales force, premium servicing, digital capabilities, these will cause us for this year to see more growth in this line than we have seen in recent years.","Second, as a reminder, through our Amex Ventures group, we have a strategic investment portfolio of over 40 investments. This quarter's OpEx included a net benefit of roughly $0.05 related to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on our strategic investment portfolio, which is somewhat higher than the benefit we saw last year. Altogether, I would just sum up by saying that we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to grow our operating expenses more slowly than our revenues.","Turning to capital on Slide 15. Our CET1 ratio in the second quarter was 11%, at the top end of our 10% to 11% target range and we returned $1.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. As we've said, our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the governor of our capital distribution plan.","We've historically been very focused on maintaining capital strength, while aggressively returning excess capital to our shareholders and we will continue with that philosophy going forward.","So that brings us to our outlook, and then we'll open the call for your questions. With each quarter of this year, we've demonstrated consistent progress against our objectives of delivering high levels of revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth. Now looking ahead, given today's economic environment, we see a long runway to sustain this performance.","In the near term, to give you a bit more color on the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to continue with the strong levels we have seen and to be within our 8% to 10% guidance range for the quarter. And if FX rates stay where they are, the headwind from the strong dollar should lessen in the fourth quarter.","We expect the stability we have seen in our credit trends to continue; the full-year provision growth of around 10%. And given the consistent operating performance trends we have seen throughout the first three quarters of the year, we expect our Q4 EPS results will be very much in line with our year-to-date results, excluding the $0.05 mark-to-market benefit our investment portfolio that we saw in the third quarter and of course, any other contingencies that may occur in the fourth quarter, which would bring us to reaffirm our adjusted earnings guidance of $7.85 to $8.35 for the full year.","In addition, we are working towards having a 2020 plan showing high revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth off of the middle part of our 2019 EPS guidance range. Of course, this assumes we do not see a material deterioration in the economic environment versus where we are today and given my earlier comments around CECL, it does not factor in any potential impacts from CECL in 2020.","To close, our year-to-date performance and expectations for the full year demonstrate consistent execution against our strategies as well as the financial growth algorithm I shared with you at our last Investor Day. We remain focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth and in today's environment double-digit EPS growth.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rosie.","Rosie Perez","Thank you, Jeff.","Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the lines for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research. Go ahead, please.","Craig Maurer","I have a question on net card fees that basically what I'm trying to get as you showed some acceleration in net card fee growth, cards in the U.S., basic cards-in-force has been largely range-bound throughout the year. So, can net card fees continue to accelerate if cards remain somewhat flattish and should card growth in the U.S. accelerate again or how should we think about that?","Jeffrey Campbell","Craig, as you recall, we tend to discourage people a little bit from looking at that gross cards-in-force number because what's really important here is the quality of the cards you have and the quality of the cards you're bringing in. Both Steve and I talked about the fact that 70% of the new card members we're bringing in are on fee-based products.","We've talked for a couple of quarters now about bringing in generally more premium oriented mix of card members and that cards-in-force number is also influenced by our periodic efforts, frankly, to go back and cancel some inactive card members. So, we feel tremendously strong about the breadth of the products that are driving card fee growth and I think there is a long runway to continue.","Stephen Squeri","Yes. And I think just to add one other point, I think the other thing that's really important is the recent strategy of consistently refreshing our products is critically important to not only growing card fees, but it's also what we've seen is we see an uptick in spending even from existing cardholders.","So again, I think the number is a little bit deceptive, because you've got a clean out and you also have a switch, you've got a lot of upgrades in there as well. So we feel really confident about the strategy we're on.","Operator","We'll next go to the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Go ahead, please.","Bob Napoli","A question on your B2B payment strategy. You acquired ACOM Pay during the quarter, and it does automated AP. You have a lot of different partnerships there and so it's an area that massive market TAM, it could move the needle I would think for American Express. Can you update your thoughts on your investments in the B2B payment space in AP and AR automation and if that can move the needle materially for Amex over the long term?","Stephen Squeri","Yes, I think, look, Bob, I think as we've said, and we said this at Investor Day as well, our belief is this is a long-term opportunity. Having said that, we are - we've entered into partnerships with people like bill.com at the real small end of the market. We've done MineralTree and WEX in sort of mid-space, we've done Tradeshift, we've done Ariba.","We have now an investment in ACOM to help sort of automate those processes. But one thing I will point out is, while it is a long-term play, most of our spending in an SME segment today is B2B spending and that continues to grow. So we feel really confident about what we're doing, but as I've said before, the integration into the procurement process, it's a tough integration and it takes time and that's why we do these partnerships, that's why we make these investments and that's why we still believe it's a long-term play. But we are seeing value just from a B2B perspective, especially in SME, where the majority of our spending is B2B, not C&E.","Operator","Our next question, we'll go to the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.","Rick Shane","Just want to sort of delve into the divergence between acceleration of billed business on an account basis at the consumer level and a deceleration on the commercial business. Historically, has that provided any signal that we should be paying attention to?","Stephen Squeri","No, not necessarily. I think if you look at the last recession, you would have seen sort of the reverse, you would have seen consumer coming down first and then commercial. So, I don't think that is a signal at all. As Jeff pointed out, our consumer business has grown slightly in the U.S. quarter-over-quarter, really strong across all segments as it relates to international, whether it's SME or whether it's consumer, mid-teen double-digit growth.","Let me comment on where you may be seeing some softness as we look at the numbers. You've seen a 1% decline as it relates to global. A couple of adjustments in there with maybe some jet fuel or things like that, but you also have to realize, we're coming off a high. It was almost 10% growth in the third quarter of last year.","So, to me that's almost stable and when I think about large and global, I haven't been involved with this for real long time, I'm pretty comfortable about that.","When you look at our SME in the U.S. and we're about 6% up year-over-year, again, off of a double-digit high. You got to delve into it and when we look at it, we look at sort of three components of that billing.","We look at are we continuing to acquire and that has been steady for us, are we losing accounts either from a competitive perspective or from the perspective of losses account to just go out of business and that has been steady, where we're seeing sort of a softening a little bit is in the organic spend. If you think about it from a retail perspective, you would think of same-store sales. But even that, again, we came off a high in the third quarter of last year, and that's still a positive trend. ","So, what would concern me is if that same account spending had gone down, it is not, it is still in positive territory, albeit, not in the same sort of significant growth that we saw. And to be honest, that was growth that we had not seen before.","So, the sustainability of that was questionable on our minds anyway. And so, we feel pretty good about it. And again, as Jeff mentioned, the credit quality, credit quality is still pristine.","Operator","We'll next go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Go ahead, please.","Bill Carcache","I had a follow-up question on your fee-based products. Some innovative fintech players like Square are enjoying some success in targeting the unbanked and underbanked customer segment, for example, with their Cash App and goal of getting customers to use it as their primary bank account through direct deposit. You guys were well ahead of this trend years ago when you identified an opportunity to generate fee-based income in the segment with products like Bluebird and Serve. Can you give us some general color on how you guys are thinking about those products today? Do you still see the growth opportunity there as attractive? How focused are you on growing those products as continued innovation and enhancement of the underlying app, something that you guys are investing in? And just in general, are you seeing some customers use Bluebird and Serve for direct deposit? Thanks.","Stephen Squeri","We're not focused on it at all. In fact, we sold that last year to InComm. That's not a segment that we see as an opportunity for us. We took a run at it and the theory of the case was that you would be able to upgrade those customers into our product - into our traditional product set. The reality is that was a bridge too far to cross.","And so we sold off that portfolio of Bluebird, [indiscernible] and Gift Cards to InComm last year. And I think InComm's really happy with that transaction, and we are really happy with that transaction. We do not see that as a growth opportunity for us at all.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Recognizing that credit, no sign of deterioration, in fact, actually is probably improved over the course of the year. Any sense as to how to think about just the impact of CECL on ongoing provisions relative to that kind of 50-ish percent increase on the credit piece as we think about the growth of provisions into next year?","Jeffrey Campbell","Yes, obviously, Moshe. That's a very fair question that we're still not ready to quantify. I do think the range we've given for the one-time impact, you can sort of do some back of the envelope math off of that, but there are so many complex pieces to CECL. Obviously, CECL will also require us to incorporate into our accounting provision forward-looking economic forecast amongst the over 100 other variables that will be part of the 150-plus customer segments and models that drive this.","So directionally, I am very comfortable saying there is some - given our levels of growth, some higher provision expense you would expect in a normal economic environment under CECL. I'm just not ready to give an exact number. I really want to emphasize though what I said in my earlier remarks, which are that from our perspective, this is pure accounting-driven acceleration of losses that ultimately would have run through our financial statements anyway. It has zero impact on real economics.","It has zero impact on our view of risk and that is why as we think about 2020, we think we are going to make a series of decisions about what we're willing and what we think is prudent to invest in continuing to drive the business for the long term, and then we'll let the CECL changes to the region fall where they will.","Operator","We'll go now to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Betsy Graseck","So I just wanted to dig in a little bit, Steve, to the comment that you were making earlier around the opportunity to penetrate your corporate card customers with personal card. And the reason I ask the question is, I would have thought this was something that was well done and already was maxed out but your comments suggest it's not. So I wanted to understand is this - is the go-to-market strategy different and what kind of opportunity set you could get?","And then, Jeff, if you could just reiterate the mark-to-market benefit that you had and where we're supposed to strip that out? I'm getting a couple of questions in on exactly where we're supposed to strip that $0.05 out of. Thanks.","Stephen Squeri","Yes. The reality is we really have not focused on penetrating our corporate card base with our personal cards for pretty much forever. We did some test last year. Part of it was a reluctance in our - with our corporate card customers for us to access the base, but the tide has changed. The tide has changed, we've had companies come to us and ask us as they look to bring more value to their employees, can we do that.","And so, this is a welcome opportunity for us. So I would say it is absolutely new territory for us. So it's not been maxed out at all. Let's not to say that our corporate card holders do not have personal cards, but it is to say that we never utilized our corporate card distribution opportunities within the corporate card - companies that have our corporate card.","So we're excited about the opportunity and think that it's going to provide another opportunity to lift our overall cards.","Jeffrey Campbell","On the mark-to-market, Betsy, I'll make two points. Just to remind everyone beginning last January, we and all companies began to have to mark-to-market various investments for us that really means the 40 or so investments we have through our Amex Ventures Fund. In general those margins have not been material. This quarter they were a little bit more materially it netted to about $0.05 positive.","We see that as an ongoing part of our business. My only reference to the $0.05 in terms of, to use your phrase Betsy not mine stripping out. Was that when I talked about Q4, I made the observation that we feel really good about the \u2013 consistent operating performance of the company. And we expect Q4 to look very similar to the first three quarters. So as you think about the pure operating performance of the company in the first three quarters.","In Q1, I take the merchant litigation charge out. So that puts you $2 a share. In Q2 it's $2.07 a share and again going back to this operating performance concept in Q3 that takes you to the about $2.03 level. So that's the only context in which I was trying to bring up the $0.05. Thank you for the question.","Operator","We will move on to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead.","Mark DeVries","I don't imagine you've gotten this question in a while just given how strong your revenue growth has been and it sounds like you're pretty confident. And the outlook for 2020 as well around revenue growth, but I have been getting some questions from investors asking how much room you guys have to control and further growth of OpEx should revenue growth. So Steve, I guess is the guy who is responsible for getting those OpEx under control when revenue is weak and mentioned here in your comments \u2013 on thoughts there?","Stephen Squeri","Yes I mean, look I think if you look at sort of how we've controlled OpEx over the last eight years. I think it was an aggregate growth probably about 6% or so. As we look at it as we've sort of changed philosophy a little bit to look at, high revenue growth. It made sense to not walk away from some of these OpEx opportunities that we had. As Jeff said, I don't think this is a consistent playbook that we're going to run, but I have all the confidence in the world in our ability to control to control OpEx.","We're still providing operating leverage when you think about sort of nine to five here, which is what we've done. The problem is when you're growing revenue at four and you're growing revenue of five if you want that leverage, you got to grow OpEx at about one. So the Delta is really \u2013 relatively similar to what we've been doing. And we're looking good investment opportunities, but you're right.","I was known as the OpEx guy here for \u2013 a lot of years and still am. I still drive people crazy about it. And I will continue to do that, but we're not going to make any foolish decisions. And I believe that we still have operating leverage opportunities as it relates to OpEx and revenue.","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead.","Stephen Squeri","David, you there.","Jeffrey Campbell","David?","Operator","Please check your mute feature on your phone.","Stephen Squeri","All right.","Operator","We will move on to the line of Chris Donat with Sandler & O'Neill.","Chris Donat","I had a question about marketing spend \u2013 as I think about this year and even last year you had some elevated marketing spend with the brand refresh in 2018 that's built into 2019. And then you had the Delta agreement, which also led to the 200 million of elevated spending. And then you got all these product refreshes. I'm just wondering as we think about 2020 do you come up against some easier comps on spending or are there things in the pipeline that will likely absorb marketing spend in 2020. Just think about how to compare 2020 to 2019?","Jeffrey Campbell","Yes in many ways Chris, I think the examples you cite are wonderful illustration of why a few years ago. We began to encourage people to focus on broadly what we call our customer engagement costs, right. Because we pull different levers at different times in the rewards category or to your point, in the traditional marketing category around brand spending or and spending we do in the payments department partner area with Delta.","And at other times we use to put resources into Card Member services. So the trends in anyone of those lines may vary a little bit from year-to-year or from quarter-to-quarter. The broad group of all of them however, is what we're using to drive high levels of revenue growth. And we've been very consistent for some years now Chris. In saying, we do expect that collectively those costs are going to grow a little bit faster than revenue. But that's what's going to enable us to drive in today's environment 8% to 10% revenue growth.","It's why the OpEx leverage Steve just talked about is so important to help mitigate that margin compression, you get from customer engagement because OpEx to grow more slowly than our revenues. You combine that with our strong balance sheet and that's how we have a model that is consistently producing double-digit EPS.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of [Dominic Gabriel] with Oppenheimer. Go ahead please.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, thanks so much for taking my question. Look, the diversity of the revenue growth is really strong. For sure, and I think one thing that is taking some investors by surprise is not only the fee for card or the NIM expanding this quarter. But to some extent, but really the discount rate has been on quite a nice trajectory. And I know that you talked about not managing to the discount rate.","But your strategy has shown at least over the last number of quarters that the discount rate is moving up as well and that's a nice benefit as well. Can you just talk about what you've lapped and what's going into the discount rate expanding just as a natural piece of the puzzle here? Thanks so much.","Stephen Squeri","Yes and as you know and I always say this, I really don't focus on the discount rate all that much. Yes it's been, it's been consistent. It's a little bit up, but I think you've got a couple of things going on. I mean you've got there some strategic and renegotiations that we lapped there was activity in Europe. There was activity in Australia, in any given quarter, there is a mix of business and so all those things contribute.","What I really focused in on is that consistent discount revenue growth. And if you want to project this out \u2013 reality is, is that as you expand into B2B, you're not going to have the same kind of discount rate in B2B. But again there, what I'd like to focus on is what the margin is right and so, if you look at a lower discount rate. You\u2019ll also look at lower rewards cost and things like that. And so, ultimately what we really focused in is the margin between the discount rate and the costs that go along with those billings.","But we're really pleased with the way discount revenue has gone. And when all the numbers come in the discount rate is \u2013 it\u2019s flattish to up and that's okay, too.","Operator","We'll go to the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna for your question. Go ahead please.","James Friedman","I just wanted to ask Jeff with regard to the GNS Slide 6 up 3% adjusted. I think you made \u2013 in your prepared remarks you said that we were lapping that in 2020. It might be, this might be over meaning like the tough compares. Is 3% what we should be thinking about as kind of the new norm when we contact business?","Jeffrey Campbell","Yes, so couple of questions or couple of comments James first. Remember in many ways the most important aspect of our GNS network these days is driving coverage in 170 or so countries around the globe. And we rely on a network of great partners to do that for us in many countries and that's priority one. Second thing is that not all GNS billings at the same. In general, as you know, the financial contribution from GNS itself is more modest than its billing contribution.","That contribution also varies a lot from country-to-country and we have a few large countries to drive a whole lot of billings, much more modest economics and those billings can be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarter. So I don't \u2013 I wouldn't take the 3% as a mark of what you will consistently see once we finish lapping, Europe and Australia. I think you'll see it probably trend back up a little bit from there. But the most important thing to keep in mind is the GNS network around the globe is really about coverage.","Operator","We have a question in queue from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Go ahead please.","Jason Kupferberg","And Jeff just wanted to put a finer point on your EPS math there, because I know you didn't formally narrow the full year EPS range. But it sounds like you're pointing us to around two or three or so for Q4, which I think would get us to around 819 or so for the full year. So I just wanted to clarify that. And then do you think that we've troughed in terms of large enterprise volume growth, just the down one this quarter. I know there were some moving parts there but...","Jeffrey Campbell","Let me make a few comments on guidance, maybe including philosophy, Jason. And Steve, you can comment on the large and global customers. Look our philosophy, which we have tried to be true to this year as we come out at the beginning of the year and we tell you here is our expectation for the full year and we give you some color around that. And then our expectation is, as we report our results each quarter we're going to tell you if something is happened so dramatically that it takes us out of that original range.","But beyond that, we're just going to give you some color about how things are going. We also really want to emphasize that we are running the company for the long term. We're certainly not running it to produce quarter-by-quarter results, but we will be true to our annual kinds of earnings commitments.","So, that's just I think important background. As to the specific math, look, I think, Jason, due to your math, I'm not going to confirm or not confirm your specific math, but I think I was trying to be very clear that our operating performance has been really consistent across the first three quarters. You can measure that at $2 a share, $2.07 a share, probably two or three for this quarter and we expect the fourth quarter to look, something like that.","Stephen Squeri","As far as global and large accounts, global and large accounts in 2018 had a really terrific, terrific year. And so going into this year, our expectations weren't the same expectations as they were last year. As we think about sort of planning forward, I would think about sort of the 0% range for the fourth quarter for global and large accounts. And then I think it gets back to historical levels for us, which is anywhere between 1% and 4%.","I think it's just because a lot of that is T&E. As we start to penetrate more into the B2B space, then I think you'll see that go up, but as I've said, traditionally I met with CFOs and so forth they are not driving to move their T&E spend up what you're looking for us to do is actually to help them manage their T&E spend down.","And so it's a very interesting business in that our value proposition is, we help you manage your cost down. And we do that through benchmarking. We do that through helping them negotiate and we do that by providing insights and so it's an interesting business where the retained count - to retain accounts you actually help them shrink a little bit. And so, then you need to go get some more account.","So we're very comfortable with sort of the traditional levels, I think what you saw last year was just people getting out a lot more including ourselves actually and just spending a little bit more on T&E, but I think it's fair to think about this in sort of the 0% to 3% range going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please.","Don Fandetti","So I wanted to dig in a little bit on the small business, year-over-year spend growth rate, I mean, there's a couple of factors, obviously, you've got potentially like weaker or more caution on the core business front. But I assume you're still getting that secular penetration, I want to know if that's still happening at the same rate. And then also your position in small business is remarkably higher than your peers. Is there any change in competition, are you holding share or is this all just sort of normal caution and tougher comps.","And then lastly around that same thing, when does B2B kick in as the small businesses automated accounts payable accounts receivable. I think you had said you get a 42% uplift in spend as that happens. I mean is it just so early in that process. What we see in 2020, 2021? Thank you.","Stephen Squeri","Yes. So, Don. The last question first, I think it's still early in the process. You know, automating, automating that spend and what you do with someone like ACOM or what you do with some of the other providers, these are interfaces to whatever sort of accounts receivable procurement systems that they have and it's not always their priority to do that.","So that takes a little bit of time. So you'll see a little bit uptick in 2020, 2021, so forth and so on. Look, I think that - let's just talk about sort of secular penetration. I think we are still acquiring counts and we don't look at so much of accounts as we look at acquired bill business. We're acquiring billed business at pretty much the same rate we've been acquiring it.","As I mentioned before, we're not losing accounts at any higher level or lower level than we've had probably for the last eight quarters. We're pretty consistent on that. As far as our overall position in the market, I think it's really, really consistent and hasn't really changed. I think I'll point you back to what I said before, I think the downturn that we've seen in our growth rate here is really around what we would call organic.","And not that it's not growing, it's just not growing fast enough or is not growing at the same rate it did last year when it had a lot of momentum, especially from the Tax Act. Having said all that, there is more competition in this space, than we've seen in a long, long time because much like banks found after sort of the great recession that the consumer credit card business was an attractive area banks have now found that this area is attractive as well.","Having said that, if you added the next five largest issuers up in the small business space, I have the same refrain that I've had for the last two years we're bigger than them all put together. So we're really comfortable where we are, we don't see anything from a competitive perspective that is any different other than it keeps to step up the competition.","But, and we continue to add to our rate of products, whether it's working capital terms, whether it's merchant financing, cross border and obviously the continued enhancements to our small business products. So we still feel really good about where we are in this small business perspective.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Maybe just to follow up with some of the lines of questioning previously. When you guys think about your comfort in delivering the high levels of revenue growth next year, which I assume is within the range of what we saw in 2019, how possible is it to hit those numbers with some more moderation and build business volumes?","Is your level of comfort because you feel like some of the investments you've made will sustain that type of build business growth or do you expect the high levels of fee income growth will persist. Given the Delta fees, come on in 2020. Any color would be helpful. Thanks.","Stephen Squeri","Yes, I mean look, I think you know when you're making - here's the issue right, so many investments that you make this year don't pay off this year, they pay off as it goes next year. And so you've hit the nail on the head. When you think about sort of what we've done from a delta perspective when you think about the cards that we've acquired, when you think about some of the investments that we've made in some of the digital properties. When you think about sort of the consistent high discount revenue that we've had, yes, even would to tick down in billings that still will be positive and yet our fee revenue due to our continued maniacal focus on Card refreshes.","The other thing I would point out is that this is a growth story globally. This is not a growth story just in the United States. And so when you think about 14% billings growth in consumer internationally, 18% SME growth even a tick or two down there is not really going to hurt you all that much and we've been pretty consistent from an SME and consumer perspective.","So I think when you think about the three-legged stool that we have from a revenue perspective of fees, interest income and discount revenue, we feel really comfortable, and that's why, as Jeff said in his sort of at the end of his remarks in this same economic environment we feel good about 8 to 10.","Look the billings issue weren't exactly what we had projected and look where we are from a revenue perspective. So, yes, our comfort level is there.","Rosie Perez","With that, we'll bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jeff.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.","Rick Petrino","Thank you, and welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining us for today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s other reports already on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be on the call this afternoon to discuss another good quarterly performance by American Express. As you know, we are holding this call a little later than usual this quarter due to the complexity of the Business Travel joint venture transaction which closed on the last day of the second quarter.","The gain resulting from the creation of the joint venture and the related incremental investments impacted our reported results across a number of P&L lines this quarter. We\u2019ll walk you through these impacts in just a few minutes to provide a better understanding of our underlying performance.","Overall, we are pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance as the momentum seen at the end of the first quarter continued into Q2. We believe that our underlying operating performance continues to demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business model and you will recognize some familiar themes in the quarter including higher spending by our card members, modest growth in the long portfolio, credit indicators at or near historical lows, disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends over the past year.","You will also see some significant and largely offsetting items related to our Business Travel joint venture. I\u2019ll come back to each of the moving pieces in a moment, but our bottom line came to $1.43 earnings per share on a fully diluted basis.","To begin, I\u2019ll read the financial results for Q2. As you can see on Slide 2, card members spending build business growth up 9% on both the reported and FX adjusted basis year-over-year. These growth rates represent a modest acceleration versus Q1 with the improvement seen predominantly in the U.S.","While volume improved 3 points overall versus last quarter, we saw a smaller increase in reported revenue growth which increased to 5% during the current quarter from 4% in Q1. I\u2019ll discuss the drivers of revenue growth in a few minutes.","Pre-tax income rose 16% during the quarter while net income grew 9%. This net income growth rate was lower than the 16% growth in the pre-tax income due to the unusually low tax rate we benefited from during the second quarter of last year.","Over the last four quarters, we have repurchased $3.9 billion of common shares. That translated into a 4% decrease in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. This then helped to drive diluted EPS to the $1.43 I mentioned a moment ago which was 13% higher than the prior on a reported basis.","These results also brought our ROE for the period ending June 30th to 29%, above our on average and overtime target of 25%.","So now to provide context for these overall results, let\u2019s review the gain from the creation of the Business Travel joint venture and the related incremental investments. As a reminder, American Express and an outside investor group each have a 50% ownership interest in the new joint venture.","Our partners invested $900 million of cash into the joint venture while we contributed the assets of our Business Travel operations. We will continue to have a close working relationship with the joint venture. We believe that the additional resources provided by the new investor group will supports to develop products, create capabilities and attract new customers.","On Slide 3, you can see that the closing of the joint venture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $626 million, in line with the estimates we provided you earlier this year. We incurred associated transaction related cost of $79 million. And I would note that we will incur a modest amount of transaction related cost in the next several quarters.","As we first began to discuss at the beginning of this year, we used a substantial portion of the gain to fund incremental initiatives to better position the company for the future. First, the gain gave us the flexibility to absorb $133 million in restricting costs as we continue to focus on further increasing the overall efficiency of our organization, in line with the evolving nature of our customer and business needs.","Second, we made an incremental contribution of $40 million to the AXP Foundation to support our future philanthropic activities.","Last and most significantly, we step upped our investments in support of many growth initiatives. There\u2019s obviously some subjectivity involved in determining just what was incremental. As you can see on the slide, it was a significant amount.","These investments were primarily in marketing and promotion, although, there were smaller amounts in a number of other P&L lines including operating expenses. These investments primarily consisted of media spending to support some of our newer products such as Amex EveryDay and Serve in the U.S. as well as incremental customer acquisition activities around the world.","I\u2019ll provide more detail when we review our quarterly expense performance in a few minutes. Overall, we estimate that the total impact of the Business Travel joint venture this quarter after netting out all of these items was a small net benefit of approximately $0.05 to quarterly EPS.","Let\u2019s turn now to a more detailed look at several trends that will give you a better sense of the quarter starting with billed business on Slide 4. Total company billings growth increased from 6% in Q1 to 9% on Q2 on a reported basis and from 7% to 9% on an FX adjusted basis.","Moving to Slide 5, which shows the billing trends by region, you can see that the accelerated growth was seen predominantly in the U.S. for our consumer, small business and corporate volumes all accelerated from the lower levels we saw in the first quarter.","As you might remember, we mentioned that U.S. billings growth improved during the second half of Q1 and we saw that momentum continue during the second quarter. Overall, international billings growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter declining slightly to 9% in Q2 versus 10% in Q 1 on an FX adjusted basis.","We did see a decline in growth rates in the JAPA region driven primarily by slower growth in China as we laughed at the rollout of new partners and products by our GNS partners during the prior year. We also saw slower growth in Australia, consistent with an overall slowdown in industry credit card volumes seen in the country during Q2.","Turning to build business by segment on Slide 6, you can see that the moderation in volume growth in China and Australia also had an impact on GNS performance during the quarter. Our GNS remained our fastest growth segment in terms of billings, up 13% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis.","Moving on to loans, the second key revenue driver. We see on Slide 7 that loan balances grew 5% globally. U.S. loans were up 6% from a year ago and continue to outpace the industry. Both of these growth rates improved by 200 basis points versus the prior quarter.","It\u2019s probably worth noting that our loan growth continues to come primarily from greater spending by our card members and is not due to any significant change in our underwriting strategy.","I\u2019ll also note that the new EveryDay product has performed well relative to our expectation since its launch a few months ago. But it is of course far too early for the product to have any meaningful impact on our overall levels of loan growth.","Putting it all together then, our billings and loan performance helped drive total revenue growth of 5% on both the reported and FX adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 8.","Consistent with prior periods, this growth was primarily driven by greater discount revenue from higher build business volumes. During the quarter, discount revenue growth did not accelerate as fast as billings grow due primarily to a 4 basis point year-over-year in the reported discount rate.","Now on this point, I would remind you that in any given quarter, the year-over-year discount variants can be influenced in part by the timing of certain items. This can lead to some volatility in the variants from quarter to quarter. For example, as you will recall, our discount rate was flat year-over-year during Q1 before being down 4 basis points this quarter. On a year-to-date basis therefore, the discount rate is down 2 basis points which is roughly in line with our expectations.","Moving on from discount revenue, the other primary driver of revenue growth was a 9% increase in net interest income. As we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding cost and an increase in average flow of balances.","Turning now to provision. You can see on Slide 9 that our credit metrics are near or at historical low levels. Worldwide, lending write-off in delinquency rates decreased in the quarter with our delinquency rate reaching an all-time low at 1%.","As we\u2019ve said previously, our goal is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but is instead to achieve the best returns on our portfolio. Therefore, we would continue to expect that lending write-off rates will increase somewhat from these low levels at some point.","Slide 10 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels. Overall, our coverage levels remain relatively consistent with the prior quarter and we believe are appropriate given the risk level inherent to the portfolio.","Finally, as you can see on Slide 11, provision was down 6% versus the prior year reflecting lower lending write-offs in the current period.","Charge card provision increased by 14% driven by a larger reserve release in the prior year. While the charge card delinquency rate declined versus Q1 during both years, we saw a larger sequential decline last year.","Turning now to expenses on Slide 12, total reported expenses increased by 2%. In understanding this increase, it\u2019s important to note that both marketing and promotion and operating expenses were significantly impacted by the Business Travel joint venture game and related incremental initiatives.","Turning to marketing and promotion first, the vast majority of the incremental costs encourage to support our growth initiatives or within marketing and promotion driving a 25% year-over-year in this line. There were some incremental costs that hit other lines.","Second, as you can see, operating expenses were down 8% on a reported basis primarily as a result of the gain from the Business Travel joint venture which was recognized as an expense for adoption.","On the operating expense line, this gain was partially offset by transaction related costs, the restructuring charge and the incremental contribution to the AXP Foundation.","Turning to rewards expense, we saw an 11% increase relatively in line with reported billings growth.","Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 33.9% which was significantly higher than the unusually low 29.6% tax rate that we experienced during the second quarter of 2013. This quarter\u2019s 33.9% was in line with our prior expectations, though, that our tax rate could be closer to the mid-30s.","To provide more context now on marketing and promotion expenses which include the majority of the investments to grow our business, Slide 13 shows that these expenses were at $985 million this quarter. We continue to believe that we have a number of attractive investment opportunities across our core business and from newer initiatives.","The gain from the Business Travel joint venture transaction this quarter provided the opportunity to increase our investments in some of our growth initiatives and better position the company for the future.","The incremental investments included some media spending you may have seen in the U.S. to support the launch of the Amex EveryDay card and the relaunch of Serve. We also included some less visible investments including incremental card acquisition activities across the U.S. and international partners.","During Q2, we also made progress on other important strategic initiatives including our OptBlue program with small merchant coverage. During the current quarter, we announced that four new merchant acquirers were added to OptBlue including First Data. And we continue to add new partners to the program.","We also continue to be at the forefront of connecting consumers and merchants in new and innovative ways through digital capabilities. Our recent partnership with Uber which creates an elegant, seamless experience for U.S. card members to earn or redeem membership rewards points within the Uber mobile app is the latest example of how we are leverage unique technology to create value for merchants and consumers.","While it is still early days for many of our digital initiatives, we are excited about the new capabilities we are developing in this space.","Moving to operating expenses now on Slide 14, let me provide a bit more detail about the impact for the Business Travel joint venture. On a reported basis, total operating expenses decreased by 8% versus the prior year during the quarter.","They were heavily impacted by the Business Travel joint venture transaction and related items including the gain which is recorded in other net expense, the restricting charge and the incremental charitable contribution.","After taking into account these impacts, adjusted operating expenses increased by 4% versus the prior year. The higher adjusted growth rate compared to earlier this year is due to a number of smaller items. I\u2019d also remind you that we are now growing over the second quarter of last year which did experience the lowest levels of operating of any quarter during 2013.","Let\u2019s turn now to the efficiency initiatives which drove the $133 million restructuring charge this quarter. The actions we are taking here are primarily related to positions that do not directly impact revenue including some actions that will be taking place over the next year. These initiatives are designed to improve our efficiency, better align us with changing customer preferences and behaviors and contain operating expenses moving forward.","More broadly, I would also remind you that going forward, Business Travel revenues and costs will no longer be embedded in our financial results. We will report only our share of the joint ventures earnings as we will account for it using the equity method.","To help you with modeling this, Business Travel cost constituted approximately 11% of our total operating expenses during full year 2013. On the revenue side, Business Travel revenues constituted approximately 80% of our total travel commissions and fees during full year 2013.","To conclude now with operating expenses on Slide 15, on a year-to-date basis, operating expenses remain well-controlled. After taking into account the specific items this quarter, adjusted operating expenses were flat versus the prior year.","We remain committed to our annual target to have the operating expenses grow by less than 3% during 2014. We will adjust our target for the balance of the year to account for the Business Travel operating expenses that will no longer be reflected in our P&L.","Now let\u2019s turn to capital, the substantial amount of new capital we generate provides us with significant degrees of flexibility as shown on Slide 16. This quarter, we were able to return 87% of capital to shareholders while also maintaining our strong ratios.","As you can see on Slide 17, we have also improved the diversity of our funding sources by building a significantly larger deposit base over the last several years. Our funding mixture in Q2 was consistent with the prior year. And we believe that the mix should be relatively stable going forward.","Let me now turn to one more topic before I conclude and take your questions. As you are aware, our trial with the DOJ began earlier this month. The government is currently presenting their case. We will then present our defense and call witnesses on behalf of American Express.","The trial is expected to end later this quarter and will be followed by the issuance of a decision which could take several months or longer to complete. There will then likely be a lengthy appeals process.","As much as we might like to, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate or beneficial to offer colored commentary on any of the specific testimony. We will make our argument were it matters in the court room. We believe that our legal defense is strong, but ultimately it will be up to the courts to decide.","To remind everyone of the context, we decided to fight for three key reasons. First, it is unfair to allow merchants who have agreed to honor our cards to then discriminate against American Express and our card members.","Second, it is fundamentally unfair to interfere with the consumer\u2019s right to choose how they want to pay at the checkout counter.","And third, the result of Justice Departments seeks would provide no benefit to consumers. Instead, it would weaken competition.","So to summarize now on the quarter, while there are some complexity in our reported results this quarter from the gain related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and our incremental initiatives, we feel good about our underlying performance during the quarter.","Reported EPS was up 13% versus the prior year driven by accelerated billings and loan growth, write-off rates that remain at historical lows, disciplined control of our operating expenses and our strong capital position. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Certainly. (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, good evening. Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on loan growth, obviously, a little bit of an uptick this quarter. We\u2019re seeing a similar trend with some of the other issuers. Can you put into some context? Are you seeing a little bit better demand? Or is this something that is more onetime issue?","Jeff Campbell","Well, it\u2019s good and an important question. And certainly, we have been pleased over the last number of quarters to see loan growth in the 3% to 4% range at a time when the industry numbers were flattish to in some quarter down a little bit.","And when you look at that growth over the last year, so it really has been driven by spending of our card members. And as we look at the sequential acceleration from 4% to 6% this quarter, we still see it pretty much just driven by spend levels of our card members that certainly one can speculate goes along with just continued levels or growth and levels of confidence about the economy.","So there\u2019s certainly nothing unusual in terms of timing or accounting or any of those items. I mean we think that the sequential pickup in growth rates is very solid, and assuming the economic environment stays the same, we would hope that it continues at that trend.","I think the other thing I really do want to emphasize that I mentioned that I mentioned in the earlier remarks is it just increased spend that has driven the loan growth. We are very focused and very comfortable with our current risk profile and so you haven\u2019t seen us make any significant changes in the various decisions we\u2019re making around risk.","Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on some of the spending trends, understanding everything that you\u2019ve gone through in great detail about how the sale of the \u2013 or the formation of the JV influencing the spending trends in the period. How should we contemplate some of these line items going forward particularly, of course, the marketing and promotion line and as well as the salaries and employee benefits line as a consequence of some of the restructuring actions you\u2019ve undertaken?","Jeff Campbell","So I\u2019d probably break that into two parts, Eric. On things like marketing and promotion, as we\u2019ve said for a couple of quarters now we clearly saw the opportunity with the business travel gain to increase spending levels this quarter but I would expect to see them go back towards what I would call more normal or normalized levels beginning next quarter. There\u2019s some seasonality in that and you see that seasonality quite clearly in the chart on Slide 13, but that\u2019s what I would expect to see next quarter on the marketing and promotion side.","In terms of the restructuring charge that we took, you are quite correct in that that will drive some economies for us in the coming quarters. However, you can imagine that given the size of the charge, there is some complexity to the changes that we will be making and so it will take us into 2015 before you will see the economic benefit on the operating expense side of the restructuring charge we took and the changes that it will facilitate us making to our operation over the course of the next year or so.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","Okay, great. And if I could just also follow up, I think in the footnotes it mentioned that you took a charge for a change in the membership rewards alternate redemption rate and is that distinct from the restructuring charges that you called out and if so can you give us a sense of the magnitude of that figure?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, it\u2019s completely distinct from anything we called out. And the way I would think about this, Eric, is you have seen us over the last couple of years make a couple of all-related incremental improvements in the methodology we use for estimating this liability. This was one of the last remaining pieces of that change. We made earlier changes in the more material markets. And so that\u2019s why this was smaller charge but it was still significant enough to call out for you that I believe now brings us globally to where we have adopted a new and we believe a better methodology for how we calculate URR around the globe. But that is all completely separate from the discussion we had around the incremental investments we chose to affirmatively make in the quarter to help grow the business.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","And the magnitude?","Jeff Campbell","The magnitude, it\u2019s probably worth a couple of pennies.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Next question from the line of Vincent Kentek [ph] of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Vincent Kentek \u2013 Macquarie","Yes, thank you. Just one quick question and one more follow up question. On the spend growth this quarter, it\u2019s very, very strong. I was wondering if you could kind of guide us on to whether to expect that spend growth for the rest of 2014 or if we should be kind of thinking about the first half of \u201814 as the loan growth.","And then, kind of on the incremental growth initiatives investments made this quarter and understanding it\u2019s early days, but when should we be thinking about, say, the revenue opportunities that come from those investments? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Well, on spend growth going forward, boy, we are always really cautious about trying to project forward, because as you know it\u2019s in our \u2013 results are tied to a number of things but including what happens economically. And I would say, as we look at the June 4% to 9% billing growth rate, we are reasonably pleased with that number given the fact that the economy is with the very, very big slow down that we saw in Q1. When you look at Q2 and you look at year-over-year growth in the economy and I\u2019d remind everyone that\u2019s really what our year-over-year billings growth is more correlated to and not necessarily the sequential trend in GDP but the year-over-year trend.","The latest forecast that I look at for the June quarter and we\u2019ll all see the numbers in the coming weeks, make an estimate that the year-over-year growth in GDP is probably down in the 1.2% to 2% range. So when it\u2019s given \u2013 if that in fact turns out to be the case, they have 9% billings growth, it\u2019s actually something we\u2019re fairly pleased with.","Obviously, what happens going forward is going to be heavily impacted by what happens to that year-over-year economic growth number, particularly in the US economy which is still the largest chunk of our billing so we\u2019ll have to \u2013 have to see where that plays out. I would just make the observation that as we\u2019ve looked at our June quarter results and billings trend, there\u2019s nothing particularly unusual or one time oriented to two of those numbers. I think they\u2019re reflective of the core underlying run rate of the business in that quarter, in the economic environment.","In terms of when the incremental investments pay off, as we always do and we think about investments, we invest in a range of things that have payoffs from very short to medium term to a few things that have very long-term payoffs. When you look at the restructuring charges, there is a very detailed set of plans for the changes we will make and when we will get the benefits and they will be mostly fully played out or mostly in place by the time you get out 12 months from now.","If you look at the spend on growth initiatives, when you think about things like the EveryDay Card launch and our card acquisition efforts, those will begin to show more of an impact as you get in to the second, third, fourth quarters from when we make those investments.","The one long-term thing we did is as we\u2019ve said for quite some time on Serve, that is a long-term proposition for us that we believe in. And this is the first time we\u2019ve ever really done any media on Serve and I\u2019d remind you that that is an area where we really are trying to in some ways create a new category, and we have to help our customers understand how to use that product and how it can really help make their financial life better. That\u2019s a longer-term prospect.","So that\u2019s how I would think about the range of investments from close-in to medium term to longer term.","Vincent Kentek \u2013 Macquarie","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thank you. Good evening. I don\u2019t want to ask about anything relating specifically to the DOJ case, but I had a broad question surrounding the notion of market power. One of the key points in prior cases involving AMX is that I don\u2019t believe you guys have ever been found to have market power. And that\u2019s been a key reason why you\u2019ve been able to avoid direct regulation in places like Australia.","But as we look ahead at the investments that you continue to make in the business, the share gains that you\u2019ve enjoyed since the Great Recession and the anticipated continued growth that should continue as we look ahead, how do you think about the risk that it could just be a matter time before you\u2019re viewed as having market power? And I guess, is market power simply an outcome and you\u2019ll deal with it if and when the time comes that you\u2019re found to have it or is it something that you don\u2019t anticipate becoming an issue anytime soon because your biggest network competitors have so much more share than you? Maybe if you can just speak broadly to that notion of market power, that\u2019d be great.","Jeff Campbell","I\u2019ll \u2013 though, I will make just a few very brief comments. Of course, just to be clear, as you stated, there is no finding anywhere that we have market power around the globe.","Two, we work really hard every day because of the unique nature of our closed-loop network to demonstrate the value we provide to the merchants and the value we provide to our card members and none of whom has to have our product or have acceptance of our product, and we work at that every single day.","Third, I would just make the factual statement that once you leave the US market, our market shares are very, very small in other countries around the globe. So I think given, as you prefaced your question with the tendency of the DOJ trial though I probably should limit my comments to those, but these are all issues we, of course, feel very strongly about.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","I appreciate that completely and understand. Maybe as a follow up, unrelated. Can you discuss the rationale underlying the Serve initiative at Wal-Mart? I guess I was a little bit confused by just from a high level, I thought that the strategy was that the Bluebird product was going to be kind of the primary platform used at Wal-Mart but that Serve would kind of be used elsewhere, but it sounds like Serve and Bluebird are both available at Wal-Mart. Maybe you could speak to that?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I guess, I\u2019d make a couple of comments. If you draw an analogy to our card or credit business, we have many different products in all of the countries around the globe in which we do business because they all serve different target segments and we think there is tremendous value in having the right card for the right customer.","And so, I think Wal-Mart as they think about what they want to offer to their customers, similarly believes that there should be a range of choices and that different products will provide different sets of capabilities and features to customers and that choice is a good thing. And so we\u2019re both \u2013 our philosophy and Wal-Mart\u2019s philosophy are quite aligned on this. To us it seems very natural to put in the end the consumer in the drive seat so that they can make a choice.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Jeff Campbell","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays","Yes, thanks. My main question is around expenses. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts here. And the first part of it relates to the salaries expense. I think Eric asked about this but I didn\u2019t hear a response to it. I think you indicated in the supplements that salaries were increased 7% year-over-year predominantly due to restructuring charges. Were those for the recurring severance-related expenses or are those investments that\u2019ll lead to a continued kind of year-over-year increase in salaries? I mean, just the second part of that is your broader 3% \u2013 sub 3% annual year-over-year growth target. I think you indicated Jeff that you\u2019re now kind of lapping some of the best quarters from expense reductions and you\u2019re now kind of growing off of that. Should we expect some operating expense growth in the back half of the year?","Jeff Campbell","So, let me take those one at a time. And, Mark, your question makes \u2013 I think, perhaps, we weren\u2019t as clear as we should have been. So when you think about the $133 million restructuring charge that we took, that amount will appear in the salaries and benefits line predominantly. There\u2019s a very small piece that relates to some facilities but most of that charge is for a number of cases around the globe where we will be making changes to our operation and it is for severance for several thousand people as we make those changes and get the right people with the right skill sets and the right places to provide great service for our customers. So that\u2019s what drove the salaries and benefits line up this quarter. And that\u2019s where as you go out over the course of the next four quarters and we execute on these plans, you will see the savings or benefits, if you will, of those restructuring, in the salaries and benefit line. So hopefully, that clarifies that point.","In terms of operating expense, you did see a particular low point in last year\u2019s second quarter, and so that\u2019s the only point I was making when I noted that I think in the first quarter our operating expenses were actually down a little bit year-over-year whereas this quarter they were up 4%. We are very committed and I think have demonstrated a really good track record of controlling operating expenses. So there is no particular plan in place to sequentially begin to grow operating expenses again as we go in to the back half of the year. We remain very committed to hitting that less than 3% target for the full year.","Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Great. And then just one other question if I could. Could you give us some color on where your pipeline is for potential new GNS partnerships? Is there enough there where you think you might be able to sustain kind of a low-to-mid teens year-over-year growth and billings that you had there?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think \u2013 I certainly don\u2019t want to comment on specifics of partnership discussions we may be involved in. But I think the more important point is that when you look at the growth that we have consistently shown in GNS, that growth is not necessarily drive by the steady addition of new partners. It\u2019s driven by the fact that we have a lot of great existing partners who, in fact, operate in some of the higher growth markets around the globe and\/or operate in certain markets like China where our presence is still in \u2013 I would call it, it\u2019s earlier stages in therefore much higher growth.","And so, the sustainability of that higher growth level, well, one element that help support it is signing new partners; far more important really is the performance of the partners we have around the globe and we feel very good about that performance and about the continue opportunities for growth.","Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ken Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good evening. My question really relates to the incremental growth initiatives and thank you for providing a little bit of color in terms of how you\u2019re using those investments or how you\u2019re making those investments. And I think one of the challenges that investors have in terms of some of these gains historically that have been used to support growth is that it\u2019s very difficult to really understand where the tangible benefits ultimately are going to come from. And maybe there is a way to help us dimensionalize how we should be thinking about where this is going to materialize whether it would in terms of just average spending growth or if you think that ultimately it\u2019s going to drive cards enforced growth first and ultimately will begin to work its way in to the billings patterns, and what the real kind of timeline we should be expecting these initiatives to ultimately pay us back. And I recognize that you make a series of investments and I\u2019ve \u2013 you kind of understand from historical discussion, but anything, given this large nature of spend in this quarter would be very helpful.","Jeff Campbell","Well, that\u2019s a \u2013 Ken, a fair and very important question. I\u2019d make a couple of comments. Certainly, we have detailed works and analysis we do here to determine how to prioritize the spending we do on growth initiatives. Let me talk about the efficiency initiatives separately in just a second.","And so on those growth initiatives we continue to believe even in the quarter we just finished that as we look at our acquisition efforts we actually still have more ROI-positive opportunities than we are able to fund while still meeting our earnings targets. We clearly could go further this quarter but all of those initiatives are closely tracked. We have a quite analytical understanding of what happens as we do various kinds of acquisition activities around the globe and feel very good about the payoff that will come on those investments.","I would note however that the incremental spend in the context of the overall size of our company and the overall size of spending we do is fairly modest. So this did not double our spending for the quarter or for the year. It\u2019s a much \u2013 if you think about this on an annual basis, this is adding 5% or 10% to our spend. So you will clearly see it in growth in revenues over time; practically, it is hard to break that out of the consolidated level. At a very detailed level, we will be tracking it very closely.","When you look at the media spend on the EveryDay Card which is the largest chunk of the media spend, which should be fairly obvious if you watch TV hopefully, that is harder to measure. On the other hand we have a very clear way to measure the success and growth of the EveryDay Card and we\u2019ll see that, we believe and hope, grow to be a very sizeable and profitable product for us in the coming quarters and years. So that\u2019s the revenue side of the equation on the efficiency initiatives, a very clear pathway to getting far more benefit than what you would need to justify the restructuring charge and we will begin to see those benefits fully phased in as you get in to 2015.","Again, the challenge and you\u2019re seeing them from the outside, and the P&L is one of scale; when you think about the overall magnitude of our expense base, we do lots and lots of things everyday to continually find ways to be more efficient so that we can achieve the kind of control of our operating expenses that you\u2019ve seen us achieve over the last couple of years. This is a piece of that. And you should see it in continued strong performance on the operating expense line.","So I realize that may not be as specific to these initiatives and I will make a note here and we should think a little bit about how we in future quarters try to take some of our own ability at more of a micro level to think about how these initiative is doing and give you a little bit of color into them","Ken Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thanks. That would be appreciated. One follow up, fine tuning or maybe two fine tuning questions. There is a reference to a Community Reinvestment Act portfolio, fair value adjustment or valuation adjustment. I assume that was an impairment; can you give us what the size of that was if it was material? And then secondarily, if there is any way to give us some sense as to how the Wells Fargo roll out is going?","Jeff Campbell","Well, let me take those maybe in reverse order. So Wells Fargo, we\u2019re certainly very pleased with our broader relationship with Wells Fargo and it\u2019s a growing relationship. But it\u2019s very early days in terms of the GNS launch. What I would say is we certainly are pleased though to see some of the comments that John Stumpf made just a few weeks ago about the partnership and, gosh, rather than me commenting on it, I love the fact that John came out and said they\u2019re very pleased and see the partnership with us as being off to a very, very good start. So I supposed he\u2019s a better judge in some ways that we are. And so we\u2019re thrilled to see that.","On the Community Reinvestment Act, as with many accounting issues, we are constantly ensuring that we have the best methodologies for estimation and this is one where we have a revised approach to how we estimate what we should be booking and that\u2019s what we switched to this quarter and it did drive an incremental expense amount that you see called out in the release as we made today.","Ken Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for your comments.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Thank you. I got a couple of questions. One on the revenue yields. When we think about the net interest yield going forward, that cropped pretty significantly sequentially. I\u2019m not sure if that was seasonal or something but how should we think about its progression going forward. Same thing with the discount rate, I know you addressed it but maybe you could just talk about the migration going forward, will there be stability in that discount rate going forward. And then, second question is around the $0.05 gain that you guys recognized this quarter; when we think about how you guys assess yourselves relative to your targets, I assume that will be inclusive of that $0.05. Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","So a couple of comments and I\u2019ll take those one at a time. First, on the net interest yield, you are actually correct Sanjay in one of your comments which is there is some seasonality. And if you go back and look at the slides we have, you actually see that year-over-year the net interest yield is up a little bit. And that, of course, is predominantly driven by the continued steady averaging down of our interest expense rates give the rate environment. And so, there is no \u2013 in terms of the sequential trend, I wouldn\u2019t focus on that. I\u2019d stay more focused on the year-over-year trends.","On the discount rate, as I said in my remarks, we had a number of timing items that actually impacted both the first quarter making the first quarter essentially flat year-over-year and in essence some things that would have caused it to go down a little bit in the first quarter, slipped into the second quarter and you saw a 4 basis point decline.","More broadly, we said for a number of years that you should expect to see discount rate decline 2 to 3 basis points a year, and that\u2019s because of our continued focus on driving more EveryDay spend. It\u2019s a function of location. It\u2019s a function of our merchants growing and hitting volume-based triggers steadily over time. It\u2019s a function of a very competitive environment and it\u2019s a function of evolving mix. So all of those things, those are the long terms trends that have been in place for many, many years and you can look at the trend over the last five, six years and see how we\u2019ve done historically based of all of those trends and managing the discount rate.","So when you look at the year to date numbers, we\u2019re pretty much in line with the trend. You just have to take that noise out of having the first quarter look unusually good year-over-year and the second quarter look unusually bad. That\u2019s first.","And the second comment, I think your third question was how we think about the $0.05 of EPS, is that \u2013","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Yes, that\u2019s right. When we think about the targets that you guys have outlined in terms of long-term targets, will that $0.05 be included in that?","Jeff Campbell","Well, of course, we never provide guidance. We\u2019re very public about our long-term targets being out there at 12% to 15%. And our goal, Sanjay, is to drive our earnings in the second half as much as we can. What I would say is that you heard me mention in my earlier remarks that there are some transaction-related costs that are going to lag into the third and fourth quarter. And so, as we think about the full year, the incremental cost that are going to lag into the back half of the year are going to offset some portion still to be determined precisely of that $0.05. So yeah, I guess, as we think about the full year, we are likely to think about the $1.43 because the full year impact of all the elements of the JV are likely to be more of a watch.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","All right. I got it. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. I guess the first question I had was the \u2013 it seems like if you take the gain and you x out the kind of one-time items, you have about $300 million left that you reinvested, and it also seems like starting in Q3 you\u2019ll have roughly $200 million less in revenue from the travel joint venture, from the accounting, for the travel joint venture. So how long do you think it would take before those $300 million of extra investments were able to replace kind of that $200 million revenue?","Jeff Campbell","Well, remember, Moshe, we also lose $200 million of expense relating to travel business.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right.","Jeff Campbell","Quite well \u2013","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just thinking about the revenue growth.","Jeff Campbell","Yes, yes. Right. So when you think about the kind of things we\u2019re investing in as you get into as I said earlier quarters two through six is when you should really see the card-related spend on EveryDay and the acquisition efforts begin to have a material impact. Now, of course, our bottom line goal here is to drive earnings for the company, not necessarily to a dollar-for-dollar replace the revenue \u2013","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Sure.","Jeff Campbell","\u2013 of the travel business, but that\u2019s probably the framework I would use for thinking about it.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right. And the second \u2013 the kind of the follow, a couple of people have talked about the discount rate. You mentioned just some of the components, I thought that also cash back rewards is netted out of the discount, merchant discount and has that been factor? Because that\u2019s been area in which cash back rewards has kind of grown as an industry issue. Could you talk about that a little bit?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, so it\u2019s probably worth clarifying, Moshe, exactly what\u2019s in what number. So the discount rate that we provide is a calculated discount rate meant to represent what we get for economics from merchants where we are acquirer. And so that calculation which we do and then report out on every quarter is the one that went down 4 basis points this quarter.","There are other people who do a very simple calculation. They look at our GAAP financial statement and they divide discount revenue into billings and that gives you a discount rate that is significantly lower. And neither of those things is reflective of the economics we\u2019re getting at the merchants which is why we pull them out of our calculated number. But it is why you see growth in the different between our calculated discount rate that we report and the simple calculation that you get when you divide up the GAAP income statement discount revenue into billings.","All that said, you are correct that cash back products have been very strong products for us, and that\u2019s a very good thing. It does drive up cash back rewards cost at a little higher rate than revenue growth. And since account [ph] to revenue it has the effect I just described. So hopefully that clarifies for you the way these pieces fit together.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Mostly though because \u2013 but you had said that the \u2013 I thought you had said that your discount rate included some of the payments to merchants for the contract signings and now you just said that some of those are not included.","Jeff Campbell","No, it\u2019s not \u2013 I didn\u2019t mean to say that. I don\u2019t \u2013 so what\u2019s not included in our calculated discount rate to come back to it is the economics we have with GNS partners which we pull out, and the cash back rewards cost and the client incentives. There\u2019s a few other very, very small things but those are the large timings [ph].","With merchant signing, an example would be that we\u2019re constantly every day out there competing for the business of our merchants. And as we\u2019ve \u2013 particularly with some of the larger merchants and in any B2B negotiations sometimes you might have a contract that expires in one quarter but you don\u2019t get around to actually finishing the renegotiation until the next quarter. You\u2019ll make the contract retroactive to the prior quarter when the prior contract expired. That would be an example of where you\u2019re going to get a timing impact as you look at the discount rate quarter to quarter that\u2019s not reflective of the ongoing rate.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thank you. And I beat a dead horse I guess on the incremental growth initiatives. It\u2019s a little confusing as to \u2013 you have so many opportunities, why would you spend it all in the incremental cost in one quarter? I mean, are you under-investing versus your opportunities overall and so therefore \u2013 I mean, you have more \u2013 you should be driving more expense through the year and forget about this year\u2019s earnings growth target to drive long-term value for investors or should have that investment \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t you have any spread of that \u2013 spread that over a couple of different quarters to support growth. So I\u2019m just a little confused by why \u2013","Jeff Campbell","Yes.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","\u2013 all those incremental investments are in this quarter. And if you have so many additional positive ROI growth initiatives why are you not spending more longer \u2013 not only this quarter but the next several quarters?","Jeff Campbell","Oh, boy, those are great questions, Bob. Let me take it in two parts. If you think about over the medium to long term how we manage the company, we\u2019re trying to balance lots of different things. We\u2019re trying to balance achieving these steady, consistent financial performance that I think all of our shareholders have come to expect from us with a reality of the competitive world we live in that makes it challenging to get to our near-term financial targets with the need to investment for the medium and long term and make sure we\u2019re positioning this company to be a successful five years from as it will be next quarter.","So as we try to balance all of those things, you are correct that one of the things we are trying to maximize is making sure we achieve that steady financial performance. And that does force us to prioritize how we make investment choices and when we make those investments. And it does cost us at times to defer going down the path on certain growth initiatives to a future date because we think that\u2019s the right balance between that steady financial performance, short-term investments and longer-term investments. That\u2019s the longer-term view.","If you think about this quarter, I guess what I would point out is in many ways you had a confluence here of the reality that we have been on in a reengineering journey for several years and it was very logical for us to take the moves that drove the restructuring charge this quarter. We\u2019ll actually enact those over the course of the next year but we think it just made sense to pair it up with the gain.","Similarly, it just was a nice coincidence that we launched the EveryDay Card at the end of March and early April, so it coincided very nicely to do a big blitz of spend on Everyday, right, at the time of the second quarter. Again, somewhat similarly we just re-launched Serve late last year and felt this was a good time to do the first ever really media blitz.","Lastly, I just remind you the business travel transaction is one we have been working on for a very long time. We knew well in advance the timing of when it was likely to happen. And that really allowed us to be thoughtful and planful in all of our marketing and operational plans this year to take advantage of the timing. So we don\u2019t we suboptimized how we used that gain. We actually think that it allows us to \u2013 in a very planful way do a lot of things that we have had on our plate for awhile and will pay off for our shareholders in the coming quarters.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Great. And just a follow-up question \u2013 thank you for that \u2013 is on the travel joint venture, is there a new strategy that\u2019s being embarked upon and, I mean, you still have the $1 billion \u2013 nearly $1 billion of value in that business and it is still, I think, important to American Express, is there a new acceleration of growth strategy? I mean, is it looking to compete in a different area of travel to \u2013 I mean, is it the idea here to accelerate growth and then how does American Express still benefit from that business?","Jeff Campbell","Boy, to be very clear, we created this joint venture because we are excited about the prospects for it to grow and to use the capital that is now in the business and that focus that is now on the business to create better products, to grow faster, to create better technology, to improve customer service. And, of course, we will continue to work very closely from a business perspective with the joint venture to serve our mutual customers in a coordinated and combined way. I would remind you it will be called American Express Travel still, so we\u2019re all in and very excited about the fact that we think this is not just a good transaction in the short term for our shareholders but is actually a transaction that will lead to a much stronger travel company in the coming years and we will benefit in many ways from that","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Great. Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Okay, so I think, operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay. And the final question comes from the line of Chris Donat of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hey. Thanks for taking my question, Jeff. Just one quick clarification on the accelerated spend in marketing. With the recognition of that, is it the case that, say, for something like the production of television ads or radio ads, that you might be recognizing expenses in the second quarter but then the ads might not air for subsequent quarters, so you kind of front loaded the spending as much as \u2013 those who watch television actually see the ads?","Jeff Campbell","No, I think the reality of how we do our accrual accounting is we have put in to our second quarter P&L what we ran during the second quarter P&L and going forward you will see running through our P&L whatever we run going forward.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay.","Jeff Campbell","So we think we were able to get a really strong start for the EveryDay Card and give a strong boost to Serve; and our job going forward will be to build upon that.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And then just quick clarification your comments about the revenue and expenses for the joint venture, you did say that was using operating expenses, not total expenses, right, I think the 11% number.","Jeff Campbell","Yes, absolutely.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay.","Jeff Campbell","So if you take \u2013 and we\u2019re using 2013 as a baseline to help you with modeling about 11% of operating expenses and about 80% of the travel commissions and fees line.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","Jeff Campbell","Okay.","Operator","Okay. Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Well, let me thank you all then for joining tonight\u2019s call and participating in the Q&A. I think, to close the call, I believe, while there\u2019s some complexity in our results, I think the questions demonstrated that from the joint venture transaction. We feel good about the underlying performance of the company and with that I will wish you all a good evening.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And that concludes our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Toby Willard. Please go ahead.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Ryan and thanks everybody for joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures maybe found in the fourth quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that maybe discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to both the quarter and the full year\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. I am happy to be here to discuss our results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2016 as well as our outlook for 2017. As you can see in this afternoon\u2019s earnings release, our earnings per share, was $0.88 for the fourth quarter and $5.65 for the full year 2016. When excluding restructuring charges, consistent with how we provided our 2016 outlook, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.91 for the quarter and $5.93 for the full year. This performance is significantly above the $5.40 to $5.70 earnings per share range we provided at the beginning of 2016 and is consistent with improvised full year 2016 outlook we discussed last quarter. We are pleased that our business and financial performance enabled us to lift our earnings expectations over the course of 2016 while at the same time allowing us to substantially increase our spending on growth initiatives, particularly during the fourth quarter, to take advantage of the opportunities that we saw in the marketplace.","Stepping back to provide some context for today\u2019s call, a year ago in January 2016 on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, Ken and I discussed a number of challenges that our business was facing and provided detailed financial expectations for 2016 and 2017. We also outlined our plans to take significant actions to change the trajectory of the business going forward. All of these actions fell under the three overarching priorities that we outlined at Investor Day of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. 12 months later, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2016 and we ended the year in a stronger position than we started it.","Adjusted revenue growth in Q4 was encouraging. We completed in 2016 a record level of business building investments that will better position us for many years and we are running ahead of schedule on our plans to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base. We are now halfway through the 2-year period of financial expectations that we laid out at the beginning of last year. Our better-than-expected 2016 performance trends have built momentum that we are seeing across our business entering 2017. As a result, we feel good about our outlook for 2017 for earnings per share to be between $5.60 and $5.80. That said there is still a lot of work to do. It remains a challenging economic competitive and regulatory environment and so we are intensely focused on executing the plans we have in place.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the results. Let\u2019s start with a review of our full year financial performance metrics on Slide 2. The full year metrics, of course, were impacted by the end of the Costco relationship in June as well as the large portfolio sale gain during the second quarter. These and other impacts produced the unevenness in our quarterly results during 2016 that we have been discussing all year. As a result, I will provide some adjusted performance metrics for both the full year and fourth quarter to help you better understand the underlying business trends. For your reference, we have included a summary of the adjusted metrics on Slide 20 in the appendix. You may want to pullout and look at as I go through my remarks.","During 2016, we generated $32.1 billion of revenue, which was down 2% year-over-year, but increased by 5% when adjusting for FX and Costco-related revenues in the prior year. Our full year performance drove net income of $5.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.65. Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS after excluding the $0.28 of full year restructuring charges was $5.93, which was within the higher revised outlook range we have provided last quarter. We continue to leverage our strong capital position to return in 2016 a total of over $5.6 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks and our dividend, which we again increased this year in the third quarter. The share repurchase drove a 7% reduction in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. These results brought our year end 2016 reported return on equity to 26%.","Turning specifically to our Q4 results on Slide 3, revenues decreased by 4%, reflecting the decline in volumes and card member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2, but excluding FX and the Costco-related revenues in the prior year, adjusted revenue growth was 6% during the fourth quarter. Net income was down 8% versus the prior year and earnings per share was $0.88 or $0.91 when excluding the $50 million of restructuring charges related to our ongoing cost initiatives during the quarter. As we discussed on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, our Q4 earnings were down as expected versus the prior year quarter primarily due to a higher level of spending on growth initiatives and we also incurred some smaller discrete items within operating expenses, which I will discuss in further detail later in my remarks.","Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 7. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter as you can see on Slide 4. As we have done the last three quarters, we also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rates, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes in all merchants and non-co-brand volumes in Costco on Slide 5. By this measure, the FX-adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was consistent with last quarter.","Our billings performance this quarter reflects a number of trends. In the GCS segment in the U.S., we continued to see healthy performance across our middle-market and small business portfolios and adjusted growth rates improved sequentially in both segments. In contrast, spending by large corporations remained weak with billings declining year-over-year as we have seen in recent quarters. I would say that it is too early to know if any of the changes in corporate and consumer sentiment that have occurred since the U.S. election will impact corporate volume trends going forward. Our U.S. consumer billings performance this quarter was fairly consistent with Q3 and reflected our focus on building long-term relationships with customers, which generates sustainable revenue and profitability.","Turning to GNS, we did see a deceleration of billings growth during the quarter as FX-adjusted growth declined from 10% in Q3 to 4% in Q4. The change was due in part to a decline in FX-adjusted volume growth in China. The volumes were still up in China nearly 20% versus the prior year. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today. We also continue to see lower GNS volumes in the U.S. through to the end of the Fidelity relationship earlier this year.","Finally, turning to international, you see on Slide 7 that our billings growth rate remains strong in both GCS and in our consumer business as we saw our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in FX adjusted terms. This performance reflects an accelerating FX adjusted growth in the UK, which was up 17% versus the prior year and in Mexico, which was up 14% despite the up-tick in the volatility of the currency exchange market since the election with the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against the Mexican peso.","Turning now to our worldwide lending performance on Slide 8, our total loans were up 13% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis, as you can see on the side of the slide, which is relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We continued to grow U.S. loans faster than the industry while maintaining industry leading credit quality and continue to see opportunities to steadily increase our share of our customers\u2019 borrowing. Turning to the right side of the slide, our net interest yield was 40 basis points higher than the prior quarter \u2013 or excuse me, than the prior year and it\u2019s been higher than Q3. As I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s earning call, over the 2 years as our co-brand loans have declined, we have shifted our loan mix towards non-co-brand card members. These card members are more likely to revolve their balances. This change, along with other mix considerations and some pricing actions are driving the higher yield versus last year.","Our credit performance and volume growth during the quarter resulted in total provision of $625 million, which was 9% higher than the prior year, as you can see on the left side of Slide 9. As in recent quarters, this growth rate was impacted by the provision in Q4 \u201815 including costs related to the two co-brand portfolios that were sold in the first half of 2016. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year, as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased 20% versus the prior year. Similar to last quarter, provision growth deferred significantly between lending and charge. On an adjusted basis, lending provision increased 29% versus the prior year, driven by growth in loan balances and as expected, a slight increase in the lending delinquency and net write-off rates versus the prior year due to the seasonings of new loans vestiges. I would note that lending net write-off rate was down slightly versus the prior quarter and remains best-in-class amongst large peer issuers.","Moving to charge card, charge provision was up only 3% versus the prior year as growth in receivables was partially offset by improved credit performance in the current year. Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I emphasize that there has been no change in our credit outlook and the credit continues to perform better than the Investor Day expectations we laid out last March. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect some modest gradual upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members, which will cause provision to grow faster than loans going forward.","Turning to our revenue performance on Slide 10, FX adjusted revenues were down 3% while excluding Costco related revenues, they were up 6%, a modest sequential acceleration from 5% in Q3. Moving to the detailed components of revenue on Slide 11, discount revenue was down 4% due to lower volumes, but increased by 6% on an adjusted basis due primarily to the 7% growth in adjusted volumes I discussed previously, along with the discount rate performance I will discuss in a minute on the next slide.","Net card fees grew by 6% versus the prior year, due primarily to continued strong growth in our U.S. Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios. I would note that the slower growth in card fees sequentially was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollars during the current quarter. Growth in net card fees on an FX adjusted basis was relatively consistent with Q3. The steady growth in card fees is a reminder of the strength of the value propositions we have in the marketplace and our ability to attract and retain fee paying customers even in the face of an intense competitive environment.","Net interest income was down 9% due to lower average loans, but increased 12% on an adjusted basis, driven by the 13% growth in adjusted loans and the higher net interest yield that I mentioned previously. These impacts were partially offset by higher funding costs for charge card due to an increase in interest rates versus the prior year. Now given the recent changes in forward interest rate expectations, I realize there is a lot of focus on the potential impact of rising interest rates. As you are all aware, due primarily to our charge card portfolio, we are liability sensitive. In our most recent annual report, we disclosed that an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce our net interest income by approximately $200 million annually. I would point out though that the math behind this sensitivity assumes a beta of one relative to changes in the Fed funds rate for all of our deposits, including our $30 billion in high yield savings accounts. While future changes in these deposit rates will be dependent upon many factors, the interest rate on high yield savings accounts in fact has remained fairly consistent during the past year despite the increases in the Fed funds rate.","Coming back to discount revenue performance on Slide 12, our reported discount rate increased by 2 basis points versus the prior year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchant negotiations, including those types of new regulations in Europe, changes in industry and regional mix and the continued growth of OptBlue. The ratio of discount revenue to billed business declined by 2 basis points year-over-year this quarter as the increase in the reported discount rate was offset in part by growth in contra revenue items including cash rebate rewards and corporate card incentives. We are now lapping some of the upfront incentives we were offering new acquisitions in 2015, which are also treated as contra revenues. This lapping helps to drive a smaller year-over-year decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed business than in prior quarters.","Overall on revenue growth, we are encouraged by the progress we have made against the four key pillars we laid out at Investor Day last year though there is more work to do and we expect to see some continued unevenness in our revenue growth during 2017. First, our growth trends are strengthening in small business and middle market as we bring together and focus on our sales and marketing efforts targeted at this segment. Second, we are making steady progress on accelerating merchant coverage, particularly in the U.S. and our fourth quarter Shop Small promotion was an early step in raising card member awareness. Third, we have for several years now been steadily growing our share of U.S. lending and we continue to grow well above the industry every quarter in 2016. And last, we are seeing organizational synergies from creating our global consumer commercial and merchant groups as they better leverage best practices from around the globe.","Turning now to total expenses on Slide 13, our expenses were lower than last year, both for the full year and the quarter. For today\u2019s call, I am going to focus on the individual expense line items, which I believe will be more helpful in understanding our underlying performance. Clearly, marketing and promotion was up significantly year-over-year and I will cover that on the next slide. Rewards expense was lower in both the full year and for the quarter versus last year, primarily due to co-brand volumes that came off the network earlier this year. Focusing on the fourth quarter trend and adjusting for Costco co-brand volumes in the prior year, rewards expense would have increased in the quarter by 13% while adjusted proprietary billings in the quarter grew by 5%. We highlighted the shift in trend on the third quarter earnings call given the introduction of higher rewards on our consumer and small business platinum cards in October, and we expect this relationship to continue into 2017. I would also note that we view the enhanced benefits as important component of our initiatives to drive revenue growth.","Moving to cost of card members services, we saw full year growth in this expense line of 11%. We are seeing higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services such as airport lounge access and co-brand benefits such as First Bag Free on Delta. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue to invest through this line as we expand the differentiated features and benefits we offer to our card members. We view this as another important component of our initiatives to drive revenue growth.","Operating expenses for the full year and quarter include a number of unusual items, a few of which I will touch on in a minute. But overall, we are making progress faster than we had anticipated a year ago in our effort to reduce our cost base by $1 billion. This is part of what allowed us in 2016 to invest in higher levels than we had originally planned and it will continue to provide momentum for us in 2017.","Looking specifically at the fourth quarter though, operating expenses were down 13% versus the prior year. I would remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2015 we took a $419 million pre-tax impairment and restructuring charge and that this year we incurred $50 million of restructuring charges in the quarter. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were down 3% for the quarter, continuing the momentum we saw in Q3. I would also point out that there were some discrete impacts in Q4 \u201816 operating expenses, including a negative impact due to the unexpected change in certain benchmark interest rates, driven by the volatility of the financial markets since the election. But the key theme on operating expenses is that we continue to expect ongoing operating expense benefits in 2017. Finally, as we expected, our tax rate for the quarter was lower than the full year average of 33%. We recognized some discrete tax benefits in the quarter related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax items in the U.S. As we look forward, we would expect the tax rate for 2017 to be more in line with our Q3 year-to-date average of 33% to 34%.","Moving to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 14, as expected, marketing costs in Q4 were up significantly versus both the prior year and the third quarter. For the full year, marketing and promotion costs were $3.7 billion, which was 17% higher than the prior year as we invested across a range of growth initiatives that we have been working on for some time. First, we provided increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum card franchise that we have in the U.S. As we discussed last quarter, we rolled out expanded benefits for our U.S. consumer and small business platinum products during October. While it is still very early days, the initial performance trends on both products have been encouraging.","Second, we leveraged our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday in the U.S. to build upon the success that we have had increasing our small merchant coverage in the U.S. through OptBlue. Our fourth quarter promotional campaign helped make card members aware of the many new locations where American Express is now welcomed. Third, we leveraged our digital marketing capabilities to build upon the success of our U.S. and international card acquisition efforts. During the quarter, we acquired 1.6 million cards across our U.S. issuing businesses and $2.4 million on a worldwide basis, which remains above our historical average levels and demonstrates that we have now effectively replaced Costco as a distribution channel with our own proprietary activities. Fourth, our investment mix this quarter reflects the shift towards initiatives focused on driving loyalty and building our relationships with existing card members, which is part of the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year. And last, we supported all of these efforts through an increased brand advertising presence around the globe.","Stepping back, we have been focused now since 2014 on navigating the evolving competitive regulatory and economic landscape. When we made the decision to step away from Costco in early 2015, we told you that we were embarking on a series of steps to reposition the company to be stronger without that relationship. Since then, we have made many changes, including investing in a range of growth initiatives across all of our businesses. In many ways, our marketing efforts in 2016 and particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016 represented the culmination of those efforts. We also remind you that these efforts, including our fourth quarter initiatives, have been targeted to provide a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer term.","In addition, I would remind you that many of the investments that we made to drive growth, including things like the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products and other differentiated services we provide to card members like lounge access are reflected in our P&L and expense lines outside of marketing and promotion. I would also note that as part of our efficiency efforts, certain marketing activities that were previously provided by external partners will be performed in-house going forward, which will move these costs from the marketing and promotion line to the operating expense line going forward. So, as we enter 2017, we are capitalizing on the momentum, capabilities, customer base and efficiencies that our efforts have produced. The combination of all of these things is what we believe will allow us to moderate somewhat our marketing and promotional spend in 2017 while still continuing to generate solid revenue growth.","Turning now to Slide 15 and touching briefly on capital. We again used our strong balance sheet position to return significant capital to shareholders. We bought back $1 billion worth of shares in the quarter and again saw our share count drop by 7% versus the prior year. For the full year, we returned 99% of the capital we generated to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Our capital ratios continue to be strong. Although it did decline sequentially, which is in line with the seasonal pattern we typically see at the end of the year. We remain confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital while maintaining strong ratios.","Before I conclude, let me go back now to where I started my remarks. On our earnings call last January, we provided our financial expectations for 2016 and 2017. And as you recall, we have said that we expected to earn at least $5.60 in 2017. Based on our business performance over the past year, our outlook for 2017 is for EPS to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.80. This outlook is based on what we know today about the economic, regulatory and tax environment and incorporates the current forward interest rate curve and recent changes in foreign exchange rates. We have not factored into our outlook any additional significant changes in these areas. To state the obvious, there is uncertainty about potential changes in the external environment. We will, of course, discuss any specific changes should they arise and help you understand any potential impact on our 2017 outlook. We do believe that our 2017 plans appropriately balance shorter term profitability with the steps we need to take to position the company for the longer term and in particular, our steady growth in 2018 and beyond.","To provide a bit more detail around our 2017 outlook, I would remind you that in our Investor Day last year in March, we laid out one potential scenario for how we could achieve our 2017 EPS outlook, which included a 5% adjusted revenue CAGR across the 2016 to 2017 period as well as significant reductions in operating expense and marketing versus our 2015 base year. As I reflect on that scenario today with the benefit of the full year 2016 results, I would make a few comments. We continue to believe today that a 5% compound annual growth rate and adjusted revenue growth across the entirety of 2016 to 2017 is consistent with the EPS outlook we have provided. We do expect some unevenness in our 2017 quarterly revenue growth rates with lower growth in Q1, in particular, driven by the impact of leap year and some timing factors. To be clear though, we remain strongly focused on driving revenue growth to a rate above 5% and are focused on executing the strategies we have in place to do so.","On the expense side, we continue to make faster progress than we initially expected on reducing operating expenses. And as I said last quarter, we now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017 will be lower than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario. This favorability in operating expenses provides us flexibility to spend more on marketing and promotion and we now expect to have modestly higher levels of marketing spend than in our Investor Day scenario, while the ultimate level will be dependent upon our financial performance and the opportunities present in the marketplace. Last, in part due to the acceleration of benefits from cost savings during 2017, we again expect quarterly earnings performance to be uneven with earnings notably lowest during the first quarter, in part due to the revenue impact I just mentioned. We anticipate that earnings levels will increase across the year.","In summary, we are encouraged by our performance during 2016, which was a year of transition for the company. We executed well on the strategies we communicated early last year and our results validate that we are on the right path. There is of course, more work to do and we are intensely focused on executing in 2017 and achieving the targets we have discussed today. We will provide further details on 2017 and our long-term strategies at our Investor Day scheduled for March 8 and we hope to see many of you there.","With that, let me turn it back over to Toby.","Toby Willard","Thanks Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit your self to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Ryan, back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Don Fandetti","Yes. Jeff, it sounds like you are kind of maintaining that adjusted 5% top line growth in your guidance, can you talk a little bit about the components, I mean specifically on the reported discount rate what is your outlook there and why not sort of build in off with Q4, a slightly better top line outlook?","Jeff Campbell","Yes. Good question, Don and thank you. To be clear, we are giving very specific EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80. And of course, one of the things that I think we have demonstrated over the years is the flexibility of our business model and the many levers we have to pull to achieve a particular financial performance. What I said in my remarks was that if you go back to the Investor Day scenario, which has a 5% compound annual growth rate for \u201816 and \u201817, we are certainly comfortable that you can get to the EPS range we provided with that kind of revenue performance. I would point out that the adjusted number for us in 2016 was about 5.3%. To be clear, that\u2019s not our goal. It\u2019s not guidance. But even if you assume no acceleration in the revenue growth rate on an annual basis in 2017 with the cost reduction efforts that we already have in place, with the several years we have spent working on different ways to be more targeted, more focused and more efficient in some of our marketing efforts, we are very comfortable that even in fact revenue performance were to come to fruition, we are very comfortable with the earning guidance. So we will have to see how things play out. Over the course of 2014, our loan growth has been very steady, very consistent and very strong relative to the industry for several years now and we would expect that to continue to be a real source of growth. Our volume growth has been steady and we see some signs of pick-up in certain segments, like the small business and middle market area and that will help us. And when it comes to discount rate, at this point, we don\u2019t really have an update to what Anre Williams back at our Investor Day provided for 2017.","Don Fandetti","Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Thank you, Don.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, Jeff. I wanted to ask sort of follow-up on the last question or your answer to it. On the small business side, just when you look at the monthly data you have, it looks like your small business loans are growing at 20% annual rate, I guess I am curious if that\u2019s sustainable or do you see anything on the horizon that might slow that growth rate for small business loans?","Jeff Campbell","So I think it\u2019s a good question, Chris. And I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that a lot of our discussions going back to Investor Day and many other forums, we particularly probably talked more about the fact that we are under-penetrated with our consumer card members in terms of capturing what we would regard as our fair share of the borrowing behaviors. That exact same phenomenon exists though with our small business customers. And of course, we have a tremendously strong franchise with small businesses across the globe and in the U.S. We have some unique features to our business model and our capabilities because of our charge card capability that allow us to be particularly effective in helping our customers meet some of their spending needs. But just like in consumer, we have not necessarily traditionally been as focused on capturing our fair share of their borrowing behaviors and so we have been making the same pivot in small business that you have seen us making in consumer and we have steadily been increasing growth rates. A lot of that just like in consumer is driven by our consisting customers. And we feel really good about our ability to continue to grow well above the market there and to maintain really strong credit quality. The one other mechanical point I would make that applies to both consumer and small business is in Q4, a modest piece of the growth is still helped from the fact that we have done better than we had anticipated at retaining some of the former Costco co-brand card member spend and lend behaviors. And if you think about the way we do the adjusted revenues, the adjusted billings and the adjusted loans, that effect helps us a little bit in Q4 and that was actually moderating to be flat with billings and loans to peak of that affect. But that will cause some modest slowing as we get into 2017, but it should remain, we believe, for a very long time well above the industry.","Chris Donat","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Yes. Thanks. Jeff, I understand that when you make some of the investments you made, you do with an eye towards both near-term, intermediate-term and long-term benefits, but you had kind of a record quarter in terms of M&P and we only saw kind of \u2013 we didn\u2019t really see billings growth accelerate sequentially and take adjusted revenue is only at malls, so can you kind of help us think about how you anticipate those benefits coming through over time through things like Shop Small to take you to kind of a reasonable payoff where we see some acceleration in revenue growth?","Jeff Campbell","Yes. So it\u2019s a good question, Mark. I think of Q4 \u2013 and you are correct, it wasn\u2019t kind of a record. It was a record high level of M&P spend as reflective of the culmination of things we have actually been working on for a number of years and they happen to come together in Q4. So we run Shop Small in the U.S. every fourth quarter. It\u2019s been a tremendously effective event for us for our small merchants. And when you think about leveraging that to begin what we have set for a long time will be the long process of getting customer perceptions about our growing merchant coverage in the U.S. to match the actual coverage, we saw a tremendous opportunity to build upon Small Business Saturday and tried to drive our card members to new small merchants. That just happened to come in Q4. We have for quite some time been thinking about the next steps to evolve our platinum products in the U.S. I would remind you, we tend to make some changes to them every year or 2 years. Those plans have long been in the works. They happen to come to fruition in the fourth quarter as well. The fourth quarter in many ways was the last quarter as I think about it in the U.S. consumer market of some of the battle going on for the spending and lending behaviors of the former Costco co-brand card members. So all of those things came together in a way that just happened to coincide with the fact that we also were performing financially well ahead where we thought we would perform and well ahead of where we have committed to our shareholders that we would perform in 2016, so those are the things that allowed us to spend at the record levels. Now, when you think about all of those efforts, they are all about driving long-term relationships with our customers and generating sustainable revenue and profitability. Most of them have very little in quarter impact. And in fact, particularly on the revenue side, when you think about the new card member acquisition efforts, those are things that we long said often take into years two and three to begin to pay off on the revenue and profit side. So we feel comfortable with the decisions we made. We wouldn\u2019t have expected them to have much impact on Q4 metrics or results. But we think they are the right mix of things to drive the company\u2019s results over the next several years. As you know, when we make investments decisions, we make them considering very long-term economics because this is a business where our customer relationships are sticky. Our best customers are people who stay with us and have been with us for many years and that\u2019s really where all of our efforts are targeted at.","Mark DeVries","Got it. Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ken Bruce","Thanks. Good evening. We have noticed a pickup in travel related activity and spending and I am wondering I know you mentioned in your comments around the large corporate that you thought it was too early to talk about confidence levels and it impacting business volumes, but I am wondering if in particular in that segment, if you have seen any increase in activity levels, maybe more broadly and if you could help us understand what the impact of that would be not only on the billings number, but also on the discount rate, that would be very helpful? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","So the tough thing Ken, as if you think about a lot of the changes in sentiment and a lot of the comments that people across the travel business have made in the last couple of weeks, most of them are forward-looking about the sentiment that they are hearing from the customers about the bookings they are seeing for future travel. They are not necessarily things we would have expected to see in the brief six weeks or seven weeks post election in the U.S. appeared where you have got both the Thanksgiving holiday and the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays. So our results through December 31, it is hard to see a noticeable up-tick in large corporate travel spend. There is some modest up-tick and if you dig through the tables in our press release, you will see a modest sequential up-tick in airline spend. I just think we don\u2019t have an update and it\u2019s too early to call it a trend. So we are certainly hopeful that a lot of the other commentary from other players in the travel industry about forward bookings is correct. I just can\u2019t really point to anything in our Q4 results that would suggest in that time period through December 31, there is any meaningful up-tick for us.","Ken Bruce","And any commentary on the discount rates that, that segment has relative to your broader business?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, sorry. Ken, I should have got into that part of your question. As you know, our business over the years has become less and less T&E focused. If you look again back in the tables, you will see this quarter\u2019s number for the percent based in the U.S. of T&E, which someone is looking up here for me. I know it was 24%. Now, that number has steadily gone down and our T&E merchants tend \u2013 there is lots of exceptions, but tend to have higher discount rates than our non-T&E merchants. So one of the reasons why we had said for years that there is a little downward pressure each year on our average discount rate is that because the non-T&E sector is growing faster that mix shift, which is ongoing puts a little downward pressure on the discount rates. So certainly, should the commentary those who say there is going to be a significant up-tick in travel and particularly corporate travel be correct, that would be helpful to our discount rate, I just can\u2019t say that I see anything yet.","Ken Bruce","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks. You mentioned about taking a runway to growth, sometimes 2 years to 3 years for new card member acquisitions, I was wondering if you could talk about the engagement of the new card members, how that\u2019s tracking relative to your expectations and whether or not there could be a boost in revenue accelerations related to that growth that you had over the past year?","Jeff Campbell","So we really rigorously track each vintage year is the term we would use internally of new card members we acquire and we study their behaviors and how it tracks over time and think about how that relates to past vintages. And I would say that while there are really modest changes in the average pattern of how quickly we can engage customers and how their spending plays out over time, the changes are kind of slow when they evolve. You tend not to see across large numbers of customers dramatic shifts in behavior. And of course as a company, we are really focused in trying to acquire new card members with whom we can build a long-term relationship where we can really generate sustainable revenue and profitability. So when I look at the card members who we have brought into the franchise over the past 18 months, all of our experience and data thus far tells us they look not terribly dissimilar to people we have brought in, in the past. The one clear difference, which I did talk about a little bit in my earlier remarks, is that while in the U.S. consumer and small business area, the Costco used to be a significant acquisition channel. We have now replaced all the volume we used to acquire through that channel with other proprietary channels, putting people on other products. That particular shift tends to result in customers who have a little higher propensity to carry revolving balance. That does drive revenue a little bit more quickly, tends to drive a little higher yield, comes with slightly higher credit costs as well, but very, very good economics. But other than that general shift, I wouldn\u2019t really call out any change in the makeup of the new card members we are acquiring as of today we think would drive a different profile going forward on how they come to be both revenue positive and profitable.","Arren Cyganovich","Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Arren.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Jeff Campbell","Hi Sanjay.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Hey, how are you? So I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity on the baseline number for 2016, if we were to adjust for some of the one-time items, I appreciate some of the commentary you have given around the revised outlook, but I am just trying to think through the different ways we can get to the 2017 and the baseline 2016 number, would be helpful?","Jeff Campbell","Sanjay I am happy to go into as much detail as you like. But really, as we think about running the business, if you take 2016 and you say you got a big portfolio sale gain in there that doesn\u2019t repeat and you have got six months of a big co-brand relationship that went away. Those two things you pull out. And look, there is lots of other one-time things and some things that surprised us in Q4 like odd movements in interest rates. But those kinds of things to some extent are going to happen every year. So you make those two adjustments to 2016. You will get when you plug in our guidance range, a pretty darn healthy EPS growth rate between 2016 and 2017, but achieving that growth rate is strictly a matter of sustaining the kind of revenue growth that we have already achieved in 2016 on an adjusted basis. We are trying to raise it, but our guidance doesn\u2019t necessarily count on it. Executing on the $1 billion takeout of infrastructure costs and we thus far are ahead of our plans both in time and dollars to do that. And then moderating our marketing and promotional spend. And we have been pretty specific on the marketing and promotional spend in the past at Investor Day in one scenario I talked about how in 2015, we spent $3.1 billion of marketing and promotion and at the time, I said we probably pulled that down by $200 million or $400 million. Last quarter, I said with the better progress we are making on OpEx, we probably don\u2019t need to pull marketing and promotion down quite that much. And I would also remind you, I was trying to make this point in my earlier remarks that there is many things we do to drive revenue growth. And we have made very conscious decisions for example, that putting financial resources towards improving the value proposition in the Platinum product for both consumers and small businesses in the U.S. is an even more effective use of our financial resources in 2017 than putting that same amount of money towards marketing and promotion. We have clearly done more to provide very differentiated services to our card members. And our lounge network is an example of something that we can uniquely do because of our scale. That runs through the cost of card member services line, not through marketing and promotion. But we are doing more of that now than we were a year ago. And I think you can expect to see us do more a year from now than we are today. And that\u2019s another example of why we are comfortable that we can moderate down the marketing and promotion line, because part of what we are doing is just shifting to other kinds of spending that we think will be even more effective in driving the end goal, which is more revenue growth. So that\u2019s how we think about it. If you just take again the revenue growth rates we are already yet, the cost reduction plan that\u2019s well underway a little bit of moderation in M&P. And then of course, the continued steady returns of capital that we have a long track record of doing and we just completed a year where we returned about 99% of our net income to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase, that\u2019s the simple model that makes us comfortable with the outlook that we provided.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Sanjay.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Craig Maurer","Yes. Hi, I apologize if this has already been asked. But I was hoping you could comment on \u2013 provide some more detail on what you are seeing in the competitive environment, you have seen some interesting moves from Chase recently as they seemingly have pulled back on the promotional offering on the Sapphire Reserve card to fund an increase in the rewards on the Amazon cards, so one might deduce they reached the point of maximum pain, you also could see rising interest rates along with worsening credit, which might lessen the appetite for secondary players to drive easy Cashback programs, so do you see the window improving over the next 1 year or 2 years in relation to competitors?","Jeff Campbell","Well, good question and comments, Craig. Look, we tried to be extremely mindful of all the things going on in the marketplace. However, we are even more mindful of what we are doing to provide the best possible value propositions for our card members, our merchants while still generating real sustainable growth for our shareholders. I think the events of the last couple of years say to us that in the U.S. and I would remind everyone on this call that your question is probably mainly targeted at the U.S. consumer market, which is really the market where we are seeing a real evolution of the competitive environment over the last years, less so in our other markets, less so in B2B, less so outside the U.S., etcetera. I think our experience over the last few years makes us cautious about making any business decision that relies on our competitors deciding to pull back on any benefits or relies on an assumption that the marketplace is going to be any less competitive than it is today and in fact it may become even more so. But even in the face of all that competition, we feel really good about our value propositions, right. We have been growing card fee revenue in the high single-digits all year as driven by fees out of our Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios, the exact premium cardholders and our competition has been targeting at. So we are mindful of all the changes in the marketplace that you went through. Certainly, from a credit and interest rate perspective, we always make long-term decisions based on a through the cycle perspective. And certainly, our history of managing through difficult credit situations is a pretty good one where we tend to come out more quickly and more strongly than others, stay more profitable than others and in fact some like that\u2019s been a good opportunity for us to pick up a little bit of share. But we will have to see. So we have a very clear set of financial expectations we have laid out for you, all of our shareholders and for ourselves. We feel good about our progress midway in. we are very focused no matter what happens in the competitive environment on achieving the results we have laid out.","Craig Maurer","Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Craig.","Operator","And our next question comes in the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good afternoon Jeff. Maybe I can ask a question around rewards, I fully understand that this is baked into your full year guidance of $5.60 to $5.80, but can you maybe just help us understand, particularly as you are enhancing some products how we should \u2013 and the competitive arm that you just talked about in Craig\u2019s question, how can we think about the relationship between billings growth and reward growth, I mean I think you said earlier something like 5% billings and 13% reward costs, do you think we are going to see that type of magnitude for the better part of 2017 or could we start to see some of that growth alleviated?","Jeff Campbell","Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Ryan. To remind everyone, if we go back to the beginning of 2016 when at Investor Day I laid out a couple of different scenarios for growth, at that point, we built into those scenarios an assumption that our awards costs would grow a little bit faster than billings and that was just an acknowledgment of the competitive the environment that in many ways Craig Maurer just did a nice job of laying out. Now, in fact when you look at most of 2016, we have not seen rewards costs growing any faster than billings until Q4 and so that should tell you pretty clearly that what drove that change in trend was the introduction of the different benefits to both the consumer and small business platinum cards in the U.S. With that being what drove it, I think you should expect to see numbers somewhat in the ballpark and what you saw in Q4 and you are correct, on an adjusted basis, I talked about 13 \u2013 I am looking for the number here, but we talked about billings growth of 5 and rewards growth of 13. So you should expect to see something in that ballpark through the first three quarters of 2017 just from actions we have already taken. Beyond that action, we will have to see in the competitive environment, we are always looking to periodically refresh products. When we do that though our goal is to try to refresh them in a way that provides enhanced and differentiated benefits to our card members and frankly often as a result, allows us to capture a little bit more economics from the product. So our goal going forward would be to continue that trend. We also feel good about a lot of our value propositions. Our Cashback products in the U.S. have been tremendous acquisition vehicles for us with the value propositions they have. Our co-brand products we think are extremely competitive in the marketplace. And around the globe, you operate outside the U.S. in an environment where we think we have market meeting value propositions in most of the places in which we do business. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily look to see the trend increase from what you saw in Q4. I do think you should expect to get three quarters of it in 2017. And I think you should see \u2013 look to see us build upon the differentiated service and value propositions we can put into the marketplace.","Ryan Nash","Great. Thank you for the detail answer.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jason Harbes","Hi Jeff, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. So just looking at the charge card receivables that accelerated quite nicely this quarter, I believe it was a 5-year high, to what extent do you view that as a function of some of the Platinum enhancements you put in place this quarter and more generally, how sustainable do you view that sustainment along with the double-digit loan growth that you have demonstrated over the past year? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks for the questions. Jason I think, there is really two questions probably there. From a charge card perspective, look, the charge card franchise is a tremendously strong and unique asset that we have and it cuts across both our commercial and consumer segments, of course. I think it\u2019s probably a little early to say that a couple of months into our introduction on just one product, the Platinum product of new benefits that it had a material role in what you would have seen the quarter end. I think what you saw at the quarter end is really a function of trends across the entire charge card franchise, which is both consumer, commercial and is impacted by lots of things. And certainly, the fact that we were able to achieve that growth while also, in fact seeing improved credit quality in the charge card franchise, because as you recall when I talked about provision, I had pointed out that charge provision was actually up less than charge growth because of improving credit quality. So gosh, we feel really good about the franchise. We see continued growth. The Platinum product in the U.S. is an important component of that franchise. And while it\u2019s too early to declare victory, we do feel good about the early returns. On lending, we are now several years into growing our lending, which is predominantly in the U.S., well above industry rates. And yet several years of doing that really doesn\u2019t even put a dent in the under-representation that we have in our customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors. And that\u2019s why we feel very comfortable that we have a long runway of continuing to grow above the market, both consumer and small business lending, as we just continually capture a little higher share of our own customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors. So I really would say we feel good about both of those trends and the charge business as well as with loans. Thank you for the question Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Campbell","Hi Rick.","Rick Shane","Thanks for taking my questions today. When I think about develop sort of a simple engagement, I think about three components, the sign-up bonus, which basically encourages people to take the card, the ongoing rewards, which is sort of had an inn place decline in terms of engagement and then brand, which has the long-term decay in terms of engagement and I think even your competition will agree that the brand is really your advantage, when you do the analysis of when your customers are taking away or engaged by competitors through either sign-up bonus or rewards and then those rewards abate, do you have any analysis that shows how they return because of the strength of the brand?","Jeff Campbell","That\u2019s a really good question, Rick. I \u2013 let me make a few comments. Certainly, we think the brand is a tremendous asset for us. But I think you have to think a little bit more broadly about what it is that causes our card members to \u2013 and this is my word, really attach to American Express in a way that I think is unusual. And my experience with other brands and certainly other card brands and part of its brand, a large portion of it is service and there is a 160-year-plus legacy of our company being all about service, all about going the extra mile for customers when something goes wrong. It\u2019s about the scale we have, which allows us to offer some differentiated benefits and services that others find very difficult to match, right. And then I am going to come back to something I talked about earlier, which is the lounge \u2013 the breadth of the lounge access that we offer to people who hold our premium products would give them lounge access. It\u2019s very difficult for anyone who doesn\u2019t have our scale to ever match. And the combination of our own centurion lounges, which have been tremendously powerful in terms of strengthening the brand with the lounge access that we get through our great partnership with Delta and then the other lounge networks that we give our members access to, which are probably easier for others to replicate, but not those first two. That breadth that our scale allows us to do things with the levels of service, the long, long reputation for service, that global scale, the brand, those are the things that as we sit around and think about products and product features that we start and those are the things that we think hardest about how we strengthen the unique aspects of them so that we can do things that our competitors won\u2019t be able to match. Now you are right, customers, particularly a subset of customers are going to think about sign-on bonuses and they are going to think a lot about mathematical calculations about rewards and we need to be responsive to that. But our view and I think our history and our performance, which say we don\u2019t need to match necessarily because we have a brand reputation and an ability to deliver service and differentiated benefits that others can\u2019t match. So the trick is what\u2019s our goal is producing long-term customer relationships, which are going to give sustainable revenues and profits for our shareholders as well. And all of our thinking is always targeted and trying to achieve the balance that gets at all of those things. So, thank you for the question Rick.","Rick Shane","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Ho","Hey, good evening Jeff. I just want to circle back on your views on potentially how much of leverage your guidance could have in an environment where you do have an inflection and kind of the organic component of spend you spend for account or a little bit of acceleration inflation, obviously there historically have been very beneficial to your model, but obviously you shifted away a little bit more from the higher \u2013 highest spend to like the more mass affluent maybe middle market, but just want to get your thoughts there on kind of \u2013 any kind of coil spring effect from the better macro environment?","Jeff Campbell","Well, certainly, for some number of years now, we have been operating in a slow growth and really no inflation environment. And occasionally, they would do remind people, as you were just reminding us all, that low or no-inflation environment when you have a spend centric model is more challenging in some ways in terms of achieving some of the historical levels of revenue growth we typically are achieving. So more than anything else, what is good for us are the same things that are good for everyone in the economy, which is more robust growth than we have seen, a little bit of inflation, I think \u2013 I would probably say we are pretty neutral on. We do have to be sensitive to our liability sensitive balance sheet. Although as I tried to talk about in my remarks, while we are more liability sensitive than others, we do have a portion of our funding structure that probably has some lower beta than one rising interest rate environment. So we will have to see. There is so much uncertainty I think economically right now, what our tax policy is going to be, what\u2019s going to happen to growth in some of the foreign markets we serve, what\u2019s going to happen to foreign exchange rates. I guess I just summarized by saying what we are after is steadily, healthily growing economies and stable exchange rates, but we will adapt to whatever environment we face.","Toby Willard","Ryan, we have got time one more question.","Operator","Okay. And that question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jeff Campbell","Hi Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning \u2013 good afternoon sorry, it\u2019s evening over here. Question on how we think about the dynamics in the charge card as you are migrating some of those people to be more on a revolving basis and it\u2019s an opportunity that you are offering to them and certain part of it, I am just thinking how you think through that dynamic on the balance sheet?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I guess I had make a couple of comments. I think Betsy you are getting at it sounds like you understand something that maybe not everyone outside the company always does, which is sometimes I think there is a perception that you got charge card customers, they have zero interest in borrowing money from anyone. And what in fact is the case, both on the consumer and small business side is we have learned over the years that some of our best charge card customers are off carrying balances on our competitors\u2019 products, and that\u2019s why we would become a little bit more focused on from a product perspective and marketing perspective and targeting perspective trying to in fact capture our share of our customers\u2019, including our charge card customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors and we have a number of ways to do that, including other lend-oriented products in hands of charge card customers or we also have \u2013 and not everyone realizes this \u2013 an ability for our customers to borrow on their charge cards with a product we call Lending on Charge. So we actually see that expansion, both on the small business side and the consumer side as a way to strengthen both our charge card and the borrowing relationship we have with the existing customer. It\u2019s a way to grow our lending with customers who we know incredibly well from a credit quality perspective. And it has a side benefit in a rising interest rate environment, I suppose, slightly lessening our liability sensitivity as an overall company, although that is certainly not a driver of the strategy. It\u2019s a bit of an offshoot from the real strategy, which is how do we strengthen and build even broader better relationship with some of our best customers who tend to be the charge card customers. So thank you for the question, Betsy. Toby, maybe I will turn it back to you.","Toby Willard","Great. Thanks everybody, for joining tonight\u2019s call and thank you for your continued interest.

Once Jeff completes his remarks, we'll move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, our first quarter results were consistent with the expectations we've provided just last month at Investor Day. As a reminder, we closed our presentation at Investor Day by highlighting our focus on accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In addition, I made some specific remarks about Q1, including updates on volume trends and several significant quarterly items such as the close of the JetBlue portfolio sale and the modest restructuring charge, all of which came in about as we expected, and all of which I will describe in more detail later in my remarks.","Earnings per share was $1.45 during the quarter, which included a $0.05 impact for the restructuring charge, a $127 million pre-tax gain from the sale of the JetBlue co-brand portfolio, higher revenues and elevated investment levels. We did see an increase in FX-adjusted billed business growth from 5% during the fourth quarter to 6% in Q1, but there were a number of items that influenced first quarter performance, including a benefit from leap year and a drop-off in Costco-related billings as we move closer to the end of the relationship. As expected, we also saw a larger-than-usual year-over-year decline in our reported discount rate and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. The results also reflected healthy underlying loan growth, excellent credit performance and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders.","Stepping back from the quarterly results, we believe that our outlook for fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, and for full year 2017 earnings per share to be at least $5.60 remains appropriate. This outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.","As we discussed at Investor Day, we anticipate that relative to Q1, we will see higher earnings per share during Q2 due to the portfolio sale gain, and then lower earnings during the second half of the year as our relationship with Costco ends and we continue to invest at elevated levels.","As we discussed first on the Q4 earnings call and then highlighted again at Investor Day, there is a bit more uncertainty around the second half assumptions versus the first half of the year. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have a much clearer view of the impact of the end of the Costco relationship as we progress through the year.","Before moving on to slide, I did want to highlight several changes to our earnings material this quarter. As we discussed at Investor Day, we have changed our segment reporting to reflect the organizational changes we made late last year. In addition, to help streamline the financial information we release each quarter, we have consolidated the information included what we call the Earnings Supplement into a single set of earnings tables and slides. We believe this will make it easier to digest the information while not reducing the overall level of information we provide.","To move now to the slide presentation and begin with a summary of our financial results on slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% during Q1, which is up from 2% growth last quarter. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth also accelerated modestly to 6% during the quarter from 5% in Q4. Revenues increased by 2% versus the prior year and continued to be impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar, although the drag from FX was somewhat smaller than in prior periods. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenue growth was 4%, which was relatively consistent with our performance in recent periods. Net income was down 6% versus the prior year as higher revenue and the JetBlue portfolio sale gain were more than offset by a higher level of investment spending and the modest restructuring charge.","We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 69 million shares, which reduced our average share count by 6%. While the absolute dollar amount of share repurchases we did in Q1 was similar to prior periods, the number of shares we bought back was greater given our lower share price. The decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove earnings per share of $1.45 for the quarter, which was 2% below the prior year. Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS, adjusted for the $0.05 restructuring charge, was $1.50. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 to 24%.","Let's now go through the components of results, beginning with billed business on slide 3. Overall, worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth increased slightly this quarter to 6%, reflecting a benefit from leap year as well as slightly higher international volume growth. These benefits were partially offset by a larger year-over-year decline in Costco-related volumes in the U.S. as we move closer to the end of the relationship during June.","To give you a better sense of the underlying trends in the core business, we provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes at all merchants and non-co-brand volumes in Costco on slide 4.","While Costco U.S.-related volumes were growing a bit faster than total company volumes at the end of 2014, they were down 16% versus the prior year in Q1 of 2016, which decreased worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth by more than 200 basis points. So taking this into account, billed business adjusted for both FX and Costco-related volumes, increased by 8% versus the prior year during Q1, which was up from 7% in Q4.","Now, a portion of the increased billings growth has been driven by our efforts to capture the spend activity of current Costco co-brand Card Members. The landscape will change once Citi launches its new Costco co-brand card in June, but we will remain focused on the spend and lend activity of these customers as the environment evolves.","Turning to slide 5, which shows our billing results by the new reporting segments. As a reminder, our small business results are now included in the Global Commercial Services segment, or GCS, and our Global Network business is now included within our International Consumer and Network Services segment, or ICNS. The decline in Costco U.S.-related volumes that I've just discussed has the most significant impact on the U.S. consumer volume growth rate, but it also impacts small business volumes within GCS. Lower gas and airline ticket prices also remain headwinds for both the GCS and U.S. consumer segments though they had a more modest impact this quarter.","We continue, as Steve Squeri discussed at Investor Day, to see differing performance trends within GCS with better growth amongst small and middle-market businesses versus more cautious spending amongst global and large customers. Volume growth remained fastest within the ICNS segment, driven by strong GNS growth and the lapping of the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This lapping also drove the sequential improvement in LACC regional volume growth seen on slide 6.","Looking at billings performance across the other international regions, volume growth remained strongest in JAPA, where billed business increased by 13% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year. This strong growth was powered by significant year-over-year increases in Japan, as well as China and Korea, though I'd remind you that there is relatively little economic contribution from spending occurring within China and Korea. FX-adjusted EMEA volume growth was relatively consistent versus the prior quarter at 8%. With continued strong performance in the U.K., growth rates remained in the low double digits.","Turning to loan performance on slide 7. On the left, you can see that our GAAP total loans were down 14% compared to Q1 2015. This decline reflects the reclassification of the Costco co-brand portfolio to held-for-sale effective December 1 and the sale of the JetBlue portfolio this quarter. To understand the underlying trends, on the right side of slide 7, we have excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios and adjusted for FX. This shows a modest sequential acceleration in worldwide loan growth to 11%. And as we disclosed in our regular monthly credit stats 8-K last week, adjusted U.S. Card Member loans were up 12% versus the prior year, which continues to outpace the industry.","We've also provided a split of the balances between Card Member loans and other loans at the bottom of slide 7. Today, the majority of other loans relate to our merchant financing products. While it makes up a relatively small percentage of the total, other loans have been growing more quickly recently. As we highlighted at Investor Day last month, we believe that there are attractive opportunities to grow in this space going forward.","Stepping back from the quarter's results, we are pleased with the steady acceleration in underlying loan growth we have demonstrated for several years. As you know, the majority of our loans relate to our U.S. card business, where growth has consistently outpaced the industry over the past several years. Industry growth rates have improved in recent years as well, which clearly has also driven a part of our recent acceleration. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending in both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.","Turning now to revenue performance on slide 8. Reported revenues were up 2% and grew by 4% after adjusting for changes in FX. The growth was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by a slowdown in Costco related revenues and a larger than usual decline in the reported discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount revenue performance and the impact from Costco in just a few minutes.","First, though, looking at the other revenue drivers in the quarter, net interest income grew by 9%, given our continued strong loan growth. We also saw an uptick in card fees which increased by 5% versus the prior year. This was due primarily to growth in fees from our U.S. Delta, Platinum and Gold portfolios, all of which goes to the strength of these value propositions.","To now expand on the drivers of our discount revenue performance, we told you at our Investor Day that we would begin to provide some additional information which you see on slide 9. The top line in the chart shows the trend in our reported discount rate which, to remind you, provides insight to our pricing at point-of-sale with merchants. The bottom line in the chart shows our calculated discount rate which is the rate you would derive if you divided the discount revenue that we report on the P&L by total billed business. This includes the impact of other items such as growth trends in our network business, cash rebate rewards, and incentives we pay to both co-brand partners and to clients.","During the first quarter, the reported discount rate declined by five basis points, consistent with Anr\u00e9 Williams' comments at Investor Day about expecting a larger year-over-year change in the discount rate during the first half of this year. In addition to the factors that have traditionally driven declines in our discount rate, such as merchant negotiations and mix changes, we are also seeing an impact from the continued expansion of OptBlue as well as the regulatory changes in the EU that were enacted late last year.","As you are aware, expanding merchant coverage is a key priority for us, and we continue to make progress on growing our merchant footprint this quarter. I'd also remind you that while growth in OptBlue does drive a decline in the discount rate, that impact has been more than offset on the bottom line by the benefits from incremental volumes and lower operating expenses from reduced incentive payments to merchant acquirers.","Looking forward, we expect the reported discount rate to decline by a greater amount than Q1 during the second quarter due to a prior year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals. During the second half of the year, we expect a more modest decline in the discount rate as we will no longer have any spending at Costco where we earn a lower than average discount rate.","Coming back to the calculated discount rate, it was down seven basis points in the quarter, driven in large part by the five basis point decrease in the reported discount rate. The two basis point gap versus the decline in the reported rate was driven primarily by continued strong growth in cash rebate rewards.","At Investor Day, we also committed to estimating our revenue growth rates excluding Costco, which we have included on slide 10. I'd remind you that there is some judgment in this estimation. Based on our analysis, Costco-related revenues were down approximately 11% year-over-year during Q1. As a result, we estimate that our FX-adjusted revenue growth rate, excluding the impact of Costco, improved modestly during the first quarter to approximately 5%. As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on achieving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of this year. I would point out that we had an unusual benefit in discount revenue in Q2 2015 that will impact the revenue growth rate next quarter.","Turning to credit performance, provision increased by 3% versus the prior year, as you can see in the chart on the left side of slide 11. But this result reflects the impact of the held-for-sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held-for-sale portfolios are now recorded through a valuation allowance within operating expenses and are no longer included in provisions. When you also exclude those credit costs from the prior year, adjusted provision increased by 12%, as shown on the right side of slide 11.","The growth in adjusted provision was driven by an increase in adjusted loan balances, including the strong growth of our merchant financing products. Card Member lending write-off rates were slightly lower year-over-year and remained the lowest amongst large peer issuers. Consistent with our comments from Investor Day going forward, we expect that continued growth in loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new Card Members will both contribute to an increase in provision. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic returns.","So now turning to expenses on slide 12, total expenses were up 5% and grew by 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. This reflected a higher level of spending on growth initiatives and was influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Marketing and promotion increased by 19% versus the prior year, reflecting an elevated level of investment spending. In recent years, our marketing and promotion spend was low during the first quarter and then ramped up for the year beginning in Q2. Going forward, as part of our effort to optimize investments, we intend to spread more evenly the spend across all four quarters. We continue to expect that the total full year spending on growth initiatives during 2016 will be consistent with 2015 levels.","As we've discussed, one of the key focus areas for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. issuing businesses during the current quarter, and nearly 1 million more from our international issuing businesses, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods. These results include new cards from Costco co-brand Card Members who have signed up for another American Express product, which has been a significant driver of the higher acquisitions in recent quarters. An increasing portion of the new card acquisitions are also coming through digital channels, as digital represented almost two-thirds of global consumer acquisitions this quarter.","Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance, the year-over-year change in rewards expense was relatively in line with reported billed business growth. Cost of Card Member services grew by 8% during the quarter, which is significantly lower than its 2015 growth rate as we have now lapped the reset impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. Operating expenses were up 2% on a reported basis during Q1 2016 but were influenced by a number of items, including the benefit from the JetBlue gain, the restructuring charge, higher investment levels and some specific benefits in the prior year.","We continue to have a strong focus on controlling operating expenses and remain focused on reducing our cost base by $1 billion on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. Towards this effort, we did incur the $84 million restructuring charge this quarter and expect to incur additional charges in future quarters, which in aggregate, we expect to be significant as we fully roll out our cost reduction plans.","Finally, I did want to highlight that we expect operating expenses to be down significantly year-over-year during Q2 as the estimated $1 billion gain on the Costco portfolio sale will be recorded as a benefit in operating expenses.","Now, shifting to our capital performance on slide 13. During the quarter, we returned 99% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining strong capital ratios. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years, while maintaining our capital ratios, illustrates the strength of our balance sheet, and business model. We did, of course, complete our submission for the 2016 CCAR process earlier this month, and as I'm sure you're all aware, the process continues to evolve each year.","While our 2016 CCAR submission reflected the benefit to our capital ratios from the Costco portfolio sale, I'd remind you that the submission also reflected a number of other changes versus the prior year, including the loss of Costco related economics, our reduced earnings outlook for 2016 to 2017, and a more challenging set of economic assumptions in the Fed's severe scenario.","Our capital plan for the upcoming year will clearly be dependent upon the Fed's view of our capital adequacy, and we expect to hear back from them about our submission in June.","So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and outlook for the balance of the year. Overall, our performance during the quarter was in line with the expectations we outlined at Investor Day. We continue to believe that our earnings per share outlook for 2016 and 2017 remains appropriate. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, and optimize investments including driving new card acquisitions across our global and consumer portfolios, expanding our merchant footprint and increasing our share of U.S. card lending. We also remain focused on controlling our expenses, and the restructuring charge this quarter reflected the initial phase of actions to take $1 billion out of our cost base by the end of 2017.","We recognize that we're operating in a new reality and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.","Toby Willard - Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Jeff. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the Q&A session. Therefore, before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process.","With that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Cathy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Go ahead, please.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for all the detail on Costco and JetBlue. I guess, my one question would be, when you think about the growth rate in the second half of the year, you saw a little pickup this quarter. Do you think that the trends you're seeing in the business, the investments you're making, we can see the billed business continue to accelerate all else being equal? Or is it too early to say at this point?","And also when it comes to the international markets, what do you expect to the interchanges in the EU, has that had the impact on billed business at this point? Or is it only on the interchange on the discount revenue side? Thank you.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Chris. A couple of questions there. So, we tried last month at our Investor Day to lay out some level of detail, both our expectations for 2016 and 2017, as well as the really key initiatives that we are focused on in both the accelerating revenue side as well as the cost side to achieve those results. As I sit here this afternoon and talk about our first quarter results, as I said in my remarks, I'd say we're tracking with all the both initiatives we're focused on, and we're tracking with the expectations we laid out. You are correct that we feel good today about our efforts to accelerate growth, and we feel good, in particular, about some of our ability to put other AmEx cards into the hands of Costco co-brand Card Members. Clearly, in the second half of the year, we will be very focused on maintaining the loyalty of those and other customers. There will be a lot of change in the industry in the back half of the year, and that's why I added just a few words of caution about the fact that we think we've taken a very balanced view as we provide you an outlook for the back half. But we'll have to see. It's still very early, but so far so good.","In terms of the European Union, you're right, the new interchange caps went into effect in December \u2013 early December of last year. To remind everyone, while those don't directly impact American Express, we've said for quite a while now that over a period of time as we, on an ongoing basis, negotiate contracts with merchants, we would expect that to put some downward pressure on our discount rates, to some extent if you think about it, it keeps pressure to keep the differential, because we generally have a premium in most of those markets somewhat in line with its history. So that impact you do see reflected in our Q1 results. It's one of the reasons that you see an unusual decline in the discount rates. By historical standards, it will probably take us a couple of years to work through a negotiating cycle with all the merchants.","In terms of the impact on volumes, we feel pretty good about the volume trends in Europe in Q1, and we feel pretty good about them in the U.K., in particular. We are very focused on using all the aspects of our business model and our closed loop to really create and sustain great value propositions for our customers. We think we have a tremendous ability to do that, and the interchange caps create some competitive challenges for others and perhaps some opportunities for us. So, we'll have to see how all that plays out over time, but right now we're pleased.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Broker. Please go ahead.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Loan growth was definitely accelerated faster than we had expected. Could you talk about perhaps the breakdown of loan growth coming from new card holders versus growing lending balances with existing cardholders? And if there's any change in the credit profile of these incoming balances? Thanks.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks for the question, Craig. Yeah, we do feel good about the last several years. I do want to keep coming back to our performance and our ability to grow our lending book, which is predominantly U.S. consumer, at rates above what you're seeing in the industry is not a new trend. It's something we've been doing for a few years. You've seen a modest increase in the differential between us and the industry, but the whole industry, as you know, Craig, has also trended up a little bit this year.","When you look at the composition of the Q1 increases, as Doug Buckminster talked about it at Investor Day, it's about one-third coming from existing customers and about two-thirds from new customers. And when you look at the credit profile, we continue to feel really good about our success in achieving these growth rates some time ago, sustaining them, and doing it in a way that keeps our average credit profile quite consistent with our history. So we think there's a lot of reasons we've been able to do this, and there's a lot of reasons we should be able to continue to do it for a long time, when you look at the fact that we historically under-index on the portion of our own customers and people who look like our customers' borrowing behaviors. And so we think with our renewed focused on having the right products, the right marketing, the right offers, out in the marketplace to better attract our fair share of those behaviors that we have a long runway to continue to achieve the kind of performance you saw in Q1.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead, please.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. Good evening. So, just a question on the new account conversion, the spending, that seems a little bit slower than years past. And I was just wondering is that because of the core shrinking kind of offsetting that? Or is it just that those new accounts aren't converting the spending as quick as in the past?","And then just a very quick clarification on the caution, Jeff, that you cited in the second half. Is that just that those Costco card holders that have new AmEx card products stopped using that product or are there other items that we should be considering? Thanks.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Two good questions, Sanjay. I think when you look at the cycle, if you will, from when you put a new card into someone's hand to when it begins to get used, when for those who are going to be revolvers, balances begin to build up, there is a historical average that would probably cause us to say you're going to see the real meaningful financial impact begin to \u2013 or positive financial impact begin to happen more in the second year and third year, partly driven by the fact that historically in the industry we have a range of incentives and offers that go with the card acquisition. In the current competitive environment, I would say that's true now.","So one of the factors, as you think, Sanjay, about some of the comments we've made about being very focused on seeing acceleration in our revenue growth, adjusting for Costco, in the back half of the year is as we just look at the sheer math of the various new Card Members that we've acquired in recent quarters as they age through the process I just described, you will begin to see an uplift as we get into the back half of this year.","In terms of my cautionary comments, you're correct, there is nothing more than really me flagging what I think should be obvious to everyone, which is the size and magnitude of the portfolio transfer we are about to engage in on the Costco portfolio with Citi is, I think, pretty unprecedented in the industry. So that just makes us slightly cautious about our own forecasting abilities in terms of how consumers will behave, because we don't have a perfect precedent for all of the conditions that we see changing in the industry. And it would manifest itself as you point out, Sanjay, through what behavior Costco co-brand Card Members who have some other AmEx product which they may have had for a long time, or short time, how their behavior changes if they can't use the AmEx card at Costco. And for that matter, how AmEx Card Members, not Costco co-brand Card Members, but just other types of AmEx Card Members who traditionally do some portion of their shopping at Costco, how their behavior changes.","So all that is factored into our outlook with what we think is a fairly balanced perspective on the ups and downs, but there's probably a little bit more forecasting error than I would say is usual for us.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Go ahead, please.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. The OptBlue program and other merchant expansion programs, as you said, Jeff, have been a huge initiative for American Express. Can you give us some feel for the uplift in spend that you're seeing from the merchant expansion efforts that you're making in the U.S. and in other markets and any update on your progress.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me focus, Bob, mostly on the U.S. You're correct. We're rolling out programs similar in spirit to OptBlue in various other countries. They have to vary because the acquiring landscape, the regulatory landscape varies in every country, but those programs tend to be newer than OptBlue which we've now been at for a couple years.","That said, we've said from the beginning that it's a multi-year effort to get to where we want to get to with OptBlue. One of the targets we laid out for the first time at Investor Day, you know, Bob, a few weeks ago, was saying we think we can get to parity coverage in the U.S. by 2019. And I think we're always cautious in saying you have to get to parity coverage in reality first, and then you have to also take some time to let the perception of that coverage also catch up to the reality.","So this is a long game we're playing. We are pleased with how it's going in terms of our ability at this point to say we have merchant acquirers who are part of the program who basically cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S. Not all of those acquirers, though, a few of the big ones still will be rolling out as we go through the rest of the year. So \u2013 so it's a long game, we think it's going fine, but the really material impacts take some number of years to really be seen in the financials.","In the meantime, the point I was trying to make in my remarks is in the short term, even before perceptions change and perceptions changing will ultimately help you with the acquisition response rate with overall share of wallet, et cetera, but in the near term, you clearly get the incremental spend of the incremental merchants you're signing up. There is the lower discount rate impact fee every quarter. There's also some savings on the OpEx side because we used to pay some fees to our third-party acquirers we're not paying anymore. When you net those three pieces together, ignoring any potential share of wallet or acquisition efficiency benefits, that number turned positive in 2015. It's a very modest number. So it's not a number overall you would go notice in the financials because remember, coverage is about small merchants who are really important to the perceptions of coverage but, in fact, don't drive that many or that big a percentage of the overall spend dollars.","So that's where we are. We feel good about the program. We feel good that it's today on a pathway where it's having a positive impact on the P&L. But the really larger vision and more material impact is clearly some time away.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. The 3 million new account number that you cite, I assume, is a gross number. And I'd like to parse that a little bit. You made the comment that if there's about 2.1 million domestic and that that number is being influenced by the conversion of some of the Costco customers. As I recall, there were about 10 million accounts. So I'd love to get a sense of where you stand, sort of how far along you think you are in potentially converting those customers so that we get a sense of how much of that's organic growth versus how much is retention of those existing customers.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that's a good question, Rick, and I think you're probably not surprised to say I'm a little cautious about giving you precise numbers right now for competitive reasons. But let me try to help you and others think a little bit about the magnitude here. We showed a slide, not this quarter but I think the last two quarters a little bit of his \u2013 two quarters ago, with a little bit of history on card acquisitions and you're right. These are gross numbers. We don't net out attrition through attrition hasn't changed a lot the last couple of years. There's some lumpiness and attrition because there are times when we'll embark on a program where we take inactive accounts and terminate them. But attrition materially hasn't changed much in a few years.","So that slide two quarters ago will give you a little bit of a sense for some of the historical numbers to compare that 2.1 million to. And as I said in my remarks, some good portion of the increment above the standard run rate, though not all, is driven by the success we've had in putting other AmEx products into the hands of Costco co-brand Card Members.","When you think about retention, I'd just remind you, though, of a couple other things we've said over the course of the past year. One is that we talked a while back about how in Canada, where there was no portfolio sale, at one point last year, we talked about retaining a little over 50% of the out-of-store spend. And when we said that, we were very quick to say, and in the U.S., you would expect the number to be significantly lower because there is a portfolio sale. And because we have been and continue to operate under a series of contractual restrictions about how we can market to Costco co-brand Card Members, and once the sale happens in mid-June, those Card Members will no longer be known to us, and they will be customers of one of our competitors. So that should produce a very different result.","Within the box I just tried to paint for you, though, I would say we're pleased with our results thus far. But I will go back a little bit to my response to Sanjay's question and say the real battle for the hearts and minds of our customers is still in its early stages, I would say.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And in the context of the idea that you want to convert existing charge card customers to borrowers, when a card customer elects to have the option to pay over time, does that count as a new card?","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think \u2013 so you're correct, Rick. If you are a charge card holder we have a product, we call LOC, lending on charge, that allows you to carry a balance. And some portion of our loan growth comes from our probably renewed focus on both marketing that product, making it easy for our customers to use, and some of our customers really like that. That would not count as a new card. But it is one of the things \u2013 one of the many things we're doing to help drive a little higher growth in our loan balances.","I think it is important to point out though, Rick, another change though you have seen really over the last couple of years is a little bit of a renewed focus by us on making sure we also have the right lending-oriented products. And I think the launch of the EveryDay card is a good example of that in recent years. Clearly, there's a lot of focus these days on the cash-back market and we think our Blue Cash card is a very competitive and generally lending-oriented card in that space.","So, yeah, we talk a lot about the breadth of our product line and we really believe in the breadth of our product line, because it allows us to have many different kinds of value propositions so we can reach out to many different segments of the marketplace. And I think our efforts around lending, whether it be what we're doing for charge Card Members through LOC, or some new products like EveryDay, or some products that have been around for a little while like Blue Cash are all manifestations of that strategy of having a very targeted and broad product strategy.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Jeff, thank you, as always for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Circling back on, again, the variability and your ability to forecast customer behavior in the second half of the year, and really getting to the Costco card that has been offered, the replacement card, was the value proposition that meaningfully different than what you were expecting? And how does that impact the range of rewards and investment spend as part of your strategy?","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, let me maybe, David, make a few comments. I don't want to make too many specific comments about a competitor's product. I would point out though that obviously we were quite engaged in negotiations with Costco ourselves. And as part of any co-brand negotiations, you talk a lot about the value proposition as part of the negotiation. So I don't think we were particularly surprised.","I'd make a few other points, though, and I'm going to go back actually to something I just said in response to Rick. We really focus on and think a strength of ours is the breadth of our product line and the way that allows us to have different value propositions for different segments of the market. There is not one cash-back market. There's not one rewards market. There's lots of different customer segments, and they value different things. The Citi Costco product will be a good product that will appeal to a certain demographic, a certain segment.","I would point out it's sort of a cash-back product. You can actually only use it, including our co-brand card, at Costco in terms of the rewards. And if you look at our cash-back portfolio, the Blue Cash product, we feel really good about that value proposition. It has been a real \u2013 one of the real engines of customer acquisition for us. It's got good economics. It is a lend-oriented product to some of my comments fairly earlier. And it seems to compete very well in the face of the current competitive landscape, which in pure math probably includes some products that are a little richer than the Costco co-brand. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are. And I wouldn't anticipate that there's anything that we've seen in the latest announcements that will cause us to change our current strategies.","I also want to come back, David, to your comments about the second half. Maybe I want to be a little careful here and not overplay the forecast uncertainty in the second half. The reason I brought it up is I thought I was stating something fairly obvious, which is that it is an unprecedented change in the industry. We are trying very hard to be transparent and balanced in our outlook. And so as we have said for quite some time, the second half by definition includes a little bit more uncertainty. But there's really nothing new about our view there. There's nothing new that we've seen in the marketplace that caused us to be any less certain. And in fact, with each passing week, we know more than we knew the week before.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then your comments about the rewards and kind of the diversity of your programs versus the industry, what do you think are some of the key enhancements? We've seen some merchant-funded rewards that are obviously enabled and facilitated by your closed loop. You've seen a little bit on the coalition rewards. Does part of the strategy entail making certainly the spend activity and lend activity from every dollar of rewards more meaningful than your competitors? Is that something that you're focused on, not just the earn rate?","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think, David, that's a good question. I think I'd actually broaden your statement a little bit. So in our experience, customers make decisions for many different reasons and value different things. And we really try to focus on both having different products that target what each customer segment most values and trying to think about and really leverage the things that we can most uniquely offer. So the strength of our brand is the first thing I think you always have to start with, which is the strength of our brand and its reputation for high-level service, and trust, and really taking the side of our customers is something that I think is hard for others to match, and we think is something that allows us to appeal to customers as something that is difficult for a competitor to copy.","When you look at the rewards oriented customer, the breadth and depth and size of our membership rewards program allows us to offer a range of ways for people to use what's really an alternative currency in some way. It is very difficult for others to match, because they just don't have the size and scale of the program we have.","When you look at our closed loop network, you're correct. It allows us to do some things on the offer side in particular not only do some things that are merchant funded, but also do some things that use our evolving big data capabilities to be very targeted in ways that are difficult for others to match. We have the lowest fraud rates in the industry, which is part \u2013 one part of the advantages of our closed loop, very difficult for others to match. So I could go on, and we should go on to the next question, but the point I'm trying to make is we are all about trying to think about the unique things we can offer to a customer that derive from our unique position as a closed loop global network with a great brand and great reach, rather than just say this is about mathematically competing on one particular aspect of a card's economics.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Jeff, you clearly spent a lot of time thinking about the revenue and spend and lend contribution from Costco. Could you give us a sense, maybe even if it's not a precise number, as to how much of the remainder is actually due to those customers that have taken an AmEx card in replacement of the Costco card? And therefore, what it might have \u2013 what benefit it might have been to the company's growth in the first quarter. And similarly, did you also analyze what the leap year impact was on this year's \u2013 on the acceleration of the growth rate?","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So two good questions, Moshe. So the leap year, there's a little bit of arc but obviously it's somewhere around 1% in terms of billings. You could have an interesting discussion about customer behaviors, so there's an extra day in a month, but it's probably somewhere around 1%. You have other year-over-year factors as you think about the quarter as well. I would point out you have lower gas prices, we're particularly T&E oriented probably more than most, so lower airline ticket prices in my old industry probably impact us as well.","When you think about Costco, as I said in my remarks, when you look at the incremental cards we're acquiring, a significant portion of the increment is driven by those efforts but other AmEx products into the hands of Costco co-brand Card Members. I don't want to be more specific for competitive reasons beyond that. What I would say is that's also part of what drives our statement as I said earlier that we'd expect as you get into the back half of this year and next year, a little bit further uptick in the financial metrics, because as we put those cards in the hands of people, it does take some time before you really see a meaningful financial impact, you've got to put the card in people's hands. They slowly start to build spend, lend takes a while to build, et cetera. So those are probably the added comments I would make about our Q1 metrics, Moshe.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to James Friedman with Susquehanna. Go ahead, please.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. I just wanted to ask about the target, the eventual parity in merchant acceptance. Is all of that incremental parity going to come through OptBlue? And would it make sense at some point to re-compete part of the GMS portfolio with outsourced merchant acquirer processing?","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, let me \u2013 again, let me make sure I know exactly where you're going with the question. The answer to the first part is pretty straightforward. Yes. When you look at our coverage today versus that of the two dominant networks, it's really \u2013 the gap is all about small merchants for the most part with very rare exceptions like Costco which only accepts AmEx today. And medium and large size merchants generally we deal with directly and our coverage is pretty much at parity. So it's really all about the small merchants, and that's where we clearly concluded that we need the arms and legs and help of the third-party merchant acquirers to reach the many, many, many millions of small merchants where there is a fair amount of churn as well to get them into our network.","That's also why as we just look at the sheer math the fact that we now have agreements with merchant acquirers who cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S., we feel pretty confident in saying it's a matter of time before they are able to put us into all of those merchants.","So that's the logic behind OptBlue and how the small merchants fit in with the medium to large merchants. So the question is, are we learning anything in OptBlue that would cause us to change our view about the direct connections we have with the larger merchants? I would say the short answer is no. We really value those connections. I think the merchants value them. We are able because of the closed loop \u2013 this goes to some of the comments I made earlier we think to bring some value to those relationships that are not always easy for others to match and so we very much want to keep those connections.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Howlett with UBS. Go ahead, please.","Matt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Jeff, just a clarification on the provision for loan losses. Has the reserve release fully come out of the Costco sale now? Just want to get a starting point in terms of how we think about building provisions going forward once the Costco is out and that 12% adjusted that you kind of \u2013 will we see any more reserve releases? Is that part of the $1 billion gain? And where should we look at the starting point for that? And then just one follow-up on just interest rates, how do we think about that in your guidance? Thanks.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, let me make sure I \u2013 jump in if I don't quite answer this or your whole question. But I think you're just after \u2013 if you look at Costco, the provision now all appears down in OpEx and is treated in effect as a valuation allowance against the held-for-sale portfolio that is on the balance sheet net, if you will. So that's why in the [storage] slides we had kind of a left-hand side which shows you the GAAP numbers, and the right-hand side were to provide you comparability if we stripped all the Costco-related provision out of the prior year, because that should give you a very clean view into the run rate that you will see beginning in the third quarter, because that will be the first quarter where the Costco portfolio was gone for the entire quarter.","So I think if you just trend off that right-hand side of the slide, that should give you a pretty clean view into Costco. And I think your second question was around interest rates?","Matt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC","Right, yes, just \u2013 yeah, the outlook there, are you just looking at the forward curve, and is that kind of all there is to it?","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know, we certainly don't profess to have any view that others don't that allows us to forecast interest rates. I'd also remind you of two things. Because our company economics are 75% to 80% discount revenue and fee revenue driven, we are far less interest rate sensitive than our competitors and peers, and because of our charge card franchise, we're the opposite of most of our peers in that a rising interest rate environment is not positive for us.","That said, if you looked to Q1, the reality is it takes a while for particularly our funding rates to adjust much, so I would guess that the Fed's December rate rise was probably pretty neutral for us on balance in Q1. I don't think it really had a material impact one way or the other.","Matt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, Jeff, do you have any updated thoughts on the timing of the DOJ case? I know there was some talk around it at the Investor Day. And then in relation to that, how should we think about your 2017 guidance? Do you have enough cushion built in should you lose that case, or is it more of a long-term issue where we don't need to worry about that for guidance?","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, in terms of the case, I'd say we could hear anywhere from tomorrow morning to a year from now. There's just no way to know really what the timeline is, the appellate court finished their hearings some months back. As you recall, very importantly, and very unusually, after or around the hearing, they chose to reinstate a stay on the district judge's order. That's quite unusual for a court to do. But we'll have to see where the opinion comes out and as I said we really just have no insights into the timing.","You know, is it contemplated in our 2016 and 2017 outlook? Obviously, we'll have to see what the judge says. I guess I'd make a couple of comments. One, the district judge's order was fully implemented for some number of months until the appellate court put a stay back on it. So it's not \u2013 there you certainly didn't see any immediate impact in that instance. And clearly, we wouldn't be fighting this case and going to court with the federal government if we didn't think there was a very important and fundamental issue at stake here. I would say it's a very important and fundamental long-term issue.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I got the sense at the Investor Day that was more of a \u2013 you thought you could hear something in the very short term, but I guess that's not the case.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, yeah, that was some weeks ago and we haven't heard a word. And truly we have no insights into when the court might issue. I'm not even sure we get any advanced notice. I think they just posted to their website. We see it as others see it, so...","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Go ahead, please.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Good evening. Hi, Jeff. I was hoping that you could help us think through the Costco gain in a little bit more detail. And I guess when we think about this quarter, we saw that JetBlue gain was entirely offset by marketing and promotion. And that seems very consistent with how AmEx has handled similar types of gains in the past. But as we look ahead at Costco, that's going to be a much larger gain. And you also said that you were going to be spreading out your investment spending more evenly. So should we, putting those pieces together, conclude that we're going to see potentially a bigger portion of the Costco gain next quarter drop to the bottom line? And maybe you'll kind of save some of the reinvestment opportunity for later quarters?","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Bill, I think you got it just right. Just to confirm, and I'd play back what you said using slightly different words. So, yes, we expect the Costco gain to come in, in June, approximately $1 billion. Unlike previous years, we are spreading across evenly throughout the year our investment or growth-oriented spend, the biggest chunk of which appears in marketing and promotion. So to be very granular, that means that if you just look at our marketing and promotional line for all of 2016, you should expect it to look about like it did in 2015. And in fact, you just saw us in Q1 raise Q1 closer to an average level that you will see across the next three quarters.","So that's what you'll see on the marketing and promotional line. And so really, the gain will mostly, to your point, fall to the bottom line in the second quarter although I do think there's one other important caveat to remind people, which is we do expect more restructuring charges, including some, hard to quantify right now, in the second quarter and those would be some incremental offset to the gain as well. And those restructuring charges, just to be crystal clear, because of the challenge in trying to estimate them, we have, as we provided our $5.40 to $5.70 EPS outlook, said that excludes all restructuring charges this year, just to give you a clearer, cleaner view into the performance of the company.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's great. Thank you. And maybe if I could dovetail off of Rick's question earlier. Could you also add what customer acquisition costs looked like relative to history? I just wanted to follow up with that and that's it. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I guess a way, if you \u2013 the way to think about that, Bill, would be to say if you go to Investor Day, I made the point that as you roll into 2017, you should expect to see our marketing and promotional costs come down $200 million to $400 million. And most, though not 100%, but most of our customer acquisition costs appear in that line. And so that gives you maybe some rough sense of the level of elevation. If that line is $3.5 billion this year and you're talking about a $300 million, let's pick a midpoint, decrease that says maybe you're coming down 10% next year, which also implies that you're sort of elevated 10% this year. So it's an important increment in light of the goal we have around the spend and lend of the Costco co-brand Card Members.","It's an important percentage in terms of the competitive environment. But I think sometimes people overplay just how big that increment is as we get ever more efficient with our acquisition efforts every year, and I made the point that two-thirds of our consumer acquisitions in Q1 were digital. It's those kind of statistics that would give us confidence that we can continue to edge that number down without seeing a significant impact on our acquisition efforts.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Toby Willard - Head of Investor Relations","And I think we have time, Cathy, for just one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thanks. I was hoping to get a little bit more color and commentary around the economics of the Cash Blue card, which sounds like it's a pretty meaningful contributor here to loan growth. And also the impact on rewards costs if you factored in cash-backs, I believe you treat those as a contra-revenue. And the reason I'm asking is because it seems like it has the potential to be maybe the most expensive product you have if customers look to optimize. I'm just looking at the current offer and it's 0% on balances for the first 12 months, 10% cash-back on wireless phone service, 6% on supermarket spend, and 3% on gas. So, if a customer really optimized, you could have cash-back expense far in excess of what your blended discount rate is. So, just interested to hear your thoughts on that.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'm going to go back a little bit, Mark, to some of my earlier comments about what we try to do at American Express with all of our products is leverage all of the attributes of the company and our brand. And so, we are not particularly trying to target, to use your term, the gamers. And in fact, we'll work a little bit to specifically not attract the gamers. So, we feel pretty good, I would say, on balance about the economics of the Blue Cash card. And certainly one of the things we watch is the overall portfolio of consumer cards that we have in the U.S. or for that matter in any market. And so when you look at our card acquisitions, yes, the Blue Cash card has been a particular important acquisition engine in recent quarters, but I'd point out to you that's because part of what we're trying to do is put replacement cards in the hands of people who formerly had a Costco co-brand card. And so the Blue Cash card tends to appeal to that segment of the market.","Meanwhile, we've continued our historical acquisition efforts with Gold, with Platinum, the Delta card is going tremendously well, and I think you've heard Delta make some comments about that as well. So, we have a range of products, and Blue Cash is just one of them which appeals to a particular segment is lend oriented and is producing perfectly fine economics for us.","In terms of an overall rewards rate, we don't really look at it that way. I guess what I'd say is certainly rewards costs, the cash rebate rewards costs are growing faster than our company average, because those products are growing faster than the company average. And you see me calling that out a little bit in my discussion earlier about the calculated discount rate. There is still a very modest piece of the overall company's cards and economics, though, is one important thing to keep in mind.","So, look, I'd say this is all part of our strategy of having the broadest product line and offering lots of different value propositions. We make sure that all of the value propositions are economic for our shareholders while providing good value to customers, and I think the Blue Cash card fits right into that vein.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Jeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mark.","Toby Willard - Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call tonight, and we appreciate your continued interest in American Express. That's all for us, Cathy.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Rick Petrino. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard Petrino","Thank you, Kathy. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion.","The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1 and Q2 2012 10-Q reports, already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2012 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides including -- included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. Thanks, Rick. And I'll start on Slide 2, the summary of financial performance. So total revenues net of interest expense came in at $7.9 billion. That's an increase of 4% from a year ago. On an FX-adjusted basis, that's 5% growth. If we look back to the second quarter, reported revenue growth was 5%; FX-adjusted, 7%. So there's a slightly lower growth rate in revenues in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.","Pretax income was $1.9 billion, 9% growth. Net income came in at $1.3 billion or 1% growth. So net income is growing at a slower pace than pretax income, and that's due to a lower tax rate in the third quarter of 2011. Diluted EPS came in at $1.09. That's an increase of 6%. So EPS is growing at a faster pace than net income due to our share buyback program. Return on equity is 26%, slightly above our target of 25%. And shares outstanding decreased by 4%, and this is also related to the share buyback program.","So moving to Slide 3. These are the third quarter metrics. Billed business came in at $220 billion. That's 6% higher than the quarter a year ago, 8% on an FX-adjusted basis. If we compare that to the second quarter, in the second quarter, we had reported billed business growth of 7% and 9% on an FX-adjusted basis. So the third quarter billings growth rates were slightly below the second quarter by approximately 100 basis points, which seems consistent with the broader pattern of decline seen recently by others in the industry.","Total cards in force grew 6%. That's a growth of 2% in our proprietary cards, which is consistent with what we've seen over the last several quarters, and a growth in GNS cards of 13%. Average basic cardmember spending grew at 4%, and this is reflective of strong customer engagement. Cardmember Loans came in at $61 billion. That's a growth of 6%. In the second quarter, we had growth of 4%.","If we move over to Slide 4, so this is billed business growth by segment. And we see a slight decline across each segment in terms of growth rates. If you look at GCS, the green line, which is Global Corporate Services, it previously had a growth rate above the company average over the first half of 2012, and it has declined at a slightly faster growth rate to move more towards the industry average. And we've seen this slower growth rate primarily in T&E categories.","If you look at Slide 5, this is billed business growth by region. And again, here we see a slight decline across each region, although a slightly faster decline in JAPA. And within this segment, we saw a slowdown in the growth rate in Australia, and that's having the largest impact on that region's growth.","If we move to Slide 6, so this is a new slide. The bars are the dollar level of loans in each quarter, and the line is the growth rate in loans compared to the prior year quarter. So while Cardmember Loan growth rate has gradually increased over the past several quarters, loans at $61.8 billion this quarter are well below the peak levels of $77.1 billion that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2007. Loan growth of 6% in the second quarter compares to 8% growth in spending on lending products.","If we move to Slide 7, so this is revenue performance. And if we look at total revenue growth, which is in the bottom right-hand corner, came in at 4%. That'll be 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. If we compare that to the second quarter, reported revenue growth was 5% or 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. So this quarter, we are growing slightly -- at a slightly slower pace than in the second quarter.","Discount revenue is driven by a 6% increase in billed business offset by higher contra-revenues, primarily cash back rewards. I also note that the average discount rate decreased slightly to 2.53%, and that compares to 2.54% in the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012. And as we've discussed before, it's being driven by pricing initiatives, mix and volume pricing.","If we look at net card fees, increased 2%. And this growth matches the growth in cards in force. If we look at travel commissions and fees, it decreased 3% and is reflecting a 6% decline in worldwide travel sales, again reflecting lower T&E spending. Other commissions and fees declined 4% but was flat on an FX-adjusted basis. Other revenue is up 8%, and it primarily reflects a $30-million gain on the sale of ICBC shares. Net interest income growth was 6%, reflecting a 4% increase in average Cardmember Loans and slightly higher net interest yield.","Moving to Slide 8, provision for losses. So the provision increased by $230 million. At a high level, we are seeing lower reserve releases partially offset by lower write-offs. So looking at Charge Card provision, it increased 9%. So this reflects a growth in receivables of 6% compared to last year. Credit metrics, as we'll see in a minute, are relatively stable. We had a reserve build in the third quarter of this year of $17 million, and that compares to a $27-million release last year. So modest changes in reserves.","Cardmember Loan provision reflects loans growing 6% compared to last year. The delinquency rate is flat compared to the second quarter, and we continue to see declines in the write-off rate leading to a reserve release in the quarter. But as you can see on the slide, reserve releases this quarter of this year were $88 million compared to $421 million in the third quarter of 2011. So this has the effect of increasing provision year-over-year. And it was partially offset by lower write-offs. Write-off dollars in this quarter were $328 million, and that compares to $427 million in the third quarter of 2011. So provision is increasing while credit metrics are either stable or improving.","If we move to Slide 9, so this is the Charge Card credit performance. And on the left, you can see the U.S. consumer charge write-off rate. They ticked up slightly in the first quarter of this year but have now ticked down slightly this quarter. I would view this as stable performance over the last several quarters. The right chart is international consumer and Global Corporate Services. As you can see on the chart, the net loss ratio is stable. And also note that these are historically low credit metrics.","If we move to Slide 10, this is lending credit performance. And on the left-hand side, you can see that lending write-off rate continues to trend down in the quarter. Within the quarter, each month was basically stable at either 2% or 1.9%. Our view is that we are at or near a low point for the lending write-off rate. Our 30-day past due billings percentage trended down slightly in this month to 1.3%. And as I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but to achieve the best economic gain where we make investments. These metrics are at historic lows and represent the best credit metrics in the industry.","Moving to Slide 11. This is our lending reserve coverage. And so for both the U.S. and worldwide, reserves as a percentage of loans continue to come down as write-off rates and 30-day past due rates improve. Reserves as a percentage of past due have trended down as well for the same reason. Principal months coverage have ticked up a bit, primarily due to the low level of write-offs in the quarter. We think reserves are appropriately stated based on our credit reserve models.","Looking at expenses, Slide 12. So if you look at total expenses at the bottom right, total expenses are 2% lower than in the third quarter of last year, and that'll be 1% lower on an FX-adjusted basis. Adjusted to exclude litigation settlement payments of $70 million in the third quarter of 2011, expenses would be down 3%. I will cover the individual lines on following slides, but I would note that our effective tax rate is at 33% this year compared to 28% in the third quarter of 2011, when we realized certain foreign tax credits.","Moving to Slide 13. So marketing expense on Slide 12 indicated that marketing expense was $764 million in the third quarter of this year compared to $757 million in the third quarter of 2011. So that's only a 1% increase. So you could ask a question, is that a sufficient increase in marketing to drive our business growth? In fact, we have high levels of spending in both quarters. You can see marketing as a percentage of revenues in this quarter was 9.7%. We have indicated that we think marketing at 9% of revenues will enable us to drive business growth. So we are investing at healthy levels to drive future growth.","If we move to Slide 14, so this is cardmember rewards expense. So cardmember rewards expense, as set forth on Slide 12, in the third quarter of this year was $1.496 billion. And that compares to $1.565 billion in the third quarter of 2011. So rewards expense is 4% lower than it was a year ago. As you can see from the chart, this is a combination of higher expense in the third quarter of this year related to higher MR rewards earned in the current period and higher co-brand expense -- that's the blue section of the bar -- but lower rewards expense related to the change in MR liability for points previously earned. So the increase in the URR in the third quarter of 2012 is lower than the increase in the URR in the third quarter of 2011. The net of these factors is lower rewards expense in this quarter compared to a year ago. The increase in the URR in the third quarter of this year is more in line with historic levels. The higher increase in URR in the third quarter of 2011 resulted from increased redemptions in that period.","So let me remind you that for co-brand products, the co-brand partner has the obligation to deliver the reward. We pay the co-brand partner each month the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability. On the other hand, we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Reward program and have a balance sheet reserve, which was approximately $5 billion at the end of 2011.","So let's move to Slide 15, and let me remind you how the 2 elements of MR expense are calculated each quarter. So at the top, for points earned in the period, we took a look at total spending on products with the Membership Rewards feature, as well as any bonus points related to that spending, and we multiply it times the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point calculated for that quarter.","The second piece is expense for points earned in previous periods. And when we have a change in the ultimate redemption rate or the weighted average cost per point, we apply those to all points outstanding at the beginning of the period. And that's the green portion of the bar. And it happened to be a small amount in the third quarter of 2012.","Now while -- as we have said many times, rewards and loyalty programs continue to be a major competitive advantage for us. They drive billings, they have significant positive impacts on credit quality, and they result in closer, longer-lasting relationships with our cardmembers. We periodically evaluate the process for estimating the ultimate redemption rate and refine this process from time to time in response to changes in cardmember behavior and other factors. We currently have a review of our U.S. ultimate redemption rate estimation process underway.","This review should be completed by the end of the year and will likely lead to a fourth quarter charge. As you know, our current ultimate redemption rate is 93%, a very high assumption for any consumer loyalty program. As with any such program, there are always going to be some breakage when participants leave the program without redeeming all the points they have earned. And as I said, the review of our ultimate redemption rate estimation process is not yet complete. I don't have any estimate to offer you today, but I did want to let you know that we have this process underway.","Moving to Slide 16. So this is operating expense performance. And as you can see in the lower right-hand part of the chart, operating expense in the third quarter of this year is 2% lower than the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted to exclude the litigation settlement, it would be 4% lower than the third quarter of 2011. So this is clearly delivering on our objective of growing operating expense more slowly than revenues.","Looking at salaries and benefits, it is lower by 5%. This is benefiting slightly from FX, and in the third quarter of 2011, included higher reengineering costs. Our employee count this year is consistent with our employee count in the third quarter of last year. You can see that professional services are flat. Occupancy and equipment is up 5%, reflecting higher data processing costs. And adjusted other is lower as a result of expense related to legal exposures booked in the third quarter of 2011.","Now in this quarter, we established incremental reserves for customer refunds within adjusted other net, as well as several different revenue P&L line items. These reserves were not the primary driver of year-over-year variances in any of the single P&L line items that they hit. Earlier this month, the company announced that we had reached settlement with several regulatory agencies. Reserves were established in prior quarters for a substantial portion of these fines and estimated cardmember refunds. We are continuing our own internal review and also cooperating with regulators in their ongoing examination of add-on products in accordance with an industry-wide review.","Let me move to Slide 17. So this is a new slide. We used it at the August Financial Community Meeting. So the green line is the growth in operating expense, the blue line is the growth in revenues, and the dotted green line is the growth in operating expense excluding litigation settlement payments. So let me make several points. The growth rates in 2010 and early 2011 were the result of our strategy to invest in business utilizing reserve releases and the settlement proceeds. In 2012, we stated our objective to grow operating expenses more slowly than revenue growth over the next 2 to 3 years. In the fourth quarter of '11 and the first and second quarter of 2012, excluding the settlement proceeds, we grew operating expense slower than revenues. This quarter, adjusted operating expense and reported operating expense are lower than they were in the third quarter of 2011 and are growing slower than revenues. This demonstrates our ability to effectively control operating expense.","Moving to Slide 18. So this is expense as a percentage of revenues, and it shows adjusted expense. Adjusted expense excludes credit provision. On the left-hand side, we see 5 years of history, and on the right-hand side, the past 5 quarters. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first, through top line revenue growth; and second, through expense flexibility, which includes our plan to contain operating expense growth.","Moving to Slide 18 (sic) [Slide 19], capital ratios. Tier 1 common ratio came in at 12.7% this quarter, which is similar to where we were in the second quarter of this year. We generated $1.4 billion in capital this quarter, $1.3 billion from net income plus $100 million from employee plans. We distributed $1.2 billion in capital, $1 billion in share buybacks and $200 million in dividends in the quarter. Risk-weighted assets increased somewhat due mostly to higher accounts receivable and loans. Our Tier 1 common ratio of 12.7% puts us in a strong capital position and well above required benchmarks.","Moving to Slide 20, the total payout ratio. So this is a percentage of capital generated return to shareholders. The left side is the past 5 years, and the right side are the past 4 quarters. Our capital distribution plan allows for up to $4 billion in share repurchases in 2012. Over the first 3 quarters of 2012, we have repurchased $3 billion. We are maintaining very strong capital ratios while making these distributions.","Moving to Slide 21. So this is a liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities. We have $18 billion in excess cash and marketable securities, and the next 12 months of funding maturities is $16 billion.","Moving to Slide 22. So this is our U.S. retail deposits by type. So we increased total deposits in the quarter by $1.2 billion up to $37 billion. Direct deposits increased by $1.3 billion, and third-party CDs decreased slightly. We remain committed to increasing direct deposits over time.","So with that, let me conclude with a few comments. Given the uncertain environment, we feel positive about our financial performance, including our ability to continue to grow EPS in the third quarter in the absence of settlement payments and with significantly lower reserve releases. Spending growth continues to be healthy despite the uneven economy. Third quarter billings growth rate was slightly below the prior quarters, which seemed consistent with the broader pattern of decline seen recently by others in the industry.","We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year, leading to 6% growth in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates improved to new all-time lows. Despite very strong credit performance, provision expense increased as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year than last year. Revenue growth of 4% or 5% on an FX-adjusted basis slowed somewhat versus prior quarters and reflects the impact of a weaker economic environment. This stands in contrast to many other issuers who still face year-over-year declines.","In the quarter, we demonstrated notable expense discipline with operating expense declining 2% versus the prior year. This is consistent with our plan of growing operating expense more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years. We are still investing in the business, and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in the card base while continuing to build capabilities for the future. This was evidenced by marketing and promotion expense representing 9.7% of revenues this quarter, which is above our historic average of 9%. Our strong capital strength was also displayed this quarter as we were able to elevate our year-to-date payout ratio to 86% while maintaining very strong capital ratios.","Looking ahead, we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead.","Thanks for listening, and we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of billed business, can you give us a sense of how it progressed throughout the quarter? I know that it was 7% at the Analyst Day on a days-adjusted basis, and it obviously came in a little bit stronger than that. And then second, just in terms of the European franchise, it was up 3%. In the quarter, can you give us a sense of how that looked by country? Did you see any weakness beyond Spain and Italy?","Daniel T. Henry","So as you said, we disclosed that on an FX and days mix adjusted. It was 7% in July. So we're up slightly from there. So obviously, the last 2 months were a little stronger than July. But I would say it was pretty even over those 2 remaining months. So there's not a trend going in either direction. In terms of Europe -- sorry, we had some background noise there. In terms of Europe, I think it's slightly slower growth than we saw last quarter. Notwithstanding that, it is down slightly but still at 3%. So again, we're seeing some slowdown, really, across Europe, so no major change in terms of how the various countries are performing on a relative basis to each other.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of -- can you just give us a little bit more color on the review of the IRR [ph], what drove it? What are the some of the key changes in your estimates that lead you to believe that there could be a charge taken?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. The -- I think in the normal course, we periodically think it's appropriate to review the estimation process. It's generally driven by behavior changes by customers or as we collect more information. So in the first quarter of 2011, we made a change in the estimation process. Previous to that, we had only used attriter information, people who had left the program, to estimate the ultimate redemption rate for the active participants. At that juncture, we started to incorporate information from active participants. And so after that, we thought we would monitor it, and we thought it was appropriate at this juncture to do an evaluation of the estimation process.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just sneak one last question in, in terms of the add-on products, can you give us any sense of what percentage of revenue this is? And have you made any changes to the products that you're offering? Have you shut down any of the selling of any of these products?","Daniel T. Henry","So like everybody else in the industry, we know that regulators had a concern about them. So we stopped marketing earlier in the year, and we'll no longer offer Account Protector or ID Protect products as of December 31 of this year. And I'd point out that these products are not a significant source of revenue to us.","Operator","Your next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Back on that URR question, I was just wondering, have you guys considered possibly making changes to your programs, such that to influence the URR lower? I mean, or is it -- is there something that precludes you from doing that, like competition and market share loss? And then, secondarily, I was just wondering on the Walmart partnership and others. I was just wondering what the P&L implications are, just so -- I assume that there's some kind of revenue share agreement. I mean, do those get accounted for in the marketing line? And -- or are they contra-revenue items?","Daniel T. Henry","So Membership Rewards, we view as being a competitive advantage to us. As I said, they are an important part of driving billings. It also is a way for us to have a very close relationship to our customers. So it's a key element. It's not the only element. Certainly, cardmember benefits and superior servicing are all part of our value proposition, but Membership Rewards is a program that we think is the best in the industry. We actually think, to the extent we enhance the program and we have higher redemptions, that, that will have a very positive impact on the long-term health of our business. So at this juncture, we're not thinking of any initiatives -- wholesale initiatives to change the value proposition and drive the ultimate redemption rate down. If it continues to increase and drive billings in the future, then we would view that as a positive. In terms of Walmart -- so Walmart, we will, from that product, earn certain discount rate at the prepaid discount rate. We also will earn some float on the balances. There are no rewards costs related to this. There may be some minimal credit-type losses. There are actually no credit losses, but there could be some fraud losses. And really, what we need to do is grow this so that we can scale this and take advantage of what is a relatively low, fixed-base cost related to this product. So that's what I would say in terms of what you should expect in the future in terms of what lines it will hit.","Operator","We will go next to Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dan, as we get closer to the next CCAR process after a year in which you didn't really deploy any significant capital on acquisitions, is there anything you can share with us about what type of payout ratio might be a reasonable request in light of your strong capital position?","Daniel T. Henry","I think last year, when we made our request, we wanted to remain [ph] flexibility so that if we were to do acquisitions, that we had built that into the submission that we had made, and also have the ability to distribute a significant portion of earnings if we didn't do acquisitions. And I would think we would structure our submission in a similar manner this year to give us flexibility in terms of what we do into 2013. And I think the fact that we have a strong capital base and the fact that we fared very well in the severe scenario that the Fed selected and had our capital drop to a much lower degree than most others, I think, are all contributing factors that put us in a position to actually make that type of submission.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, got it. And another question. Your loan growth has really been consistently better than the rest of the industry over last year. To what do you kind of attribute that outsized growth relative to peers? And also, kind of what do you think the implications are for credit going forward?","Daniel T. Henry","I think we saw in -- throughout 2009 -- the flutter [ph] of 2009, '10 and '11 that we improved sooner on the credit side than most of the industry. And I think loan growth, as we were in 2011, was probably being impacted by the fact that people were deleveraging and we were seeing paydown rates increase over that period. But over the last 4 quarters or so, we've seen our paydown rates stabilize more. And as you know, our paydown rates are significantly higher than the competition. But the fact that those paydown rates are not going up, I think, is a contributing factor to the growth rate in loans gradually increasing over time. And as you know, we are very focused on Charge Card but also premium lending, and so I think all of those things are contributing factors to the growth we see in loans.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And any implications in there?","Daniel T. Henry","In credit? As you know, our credit metrics are at historical lows. As we think about where we go from here, we want to be thoughtful in terms of growing the business -- growing the premium business. Obviously, as you bring on new accounts, they have a somewhat higher risk profile just because they're at an earlier tenure in their life. And quite frankly, I've said this before, if you were to give me a choice of bringing in a group of customers that were going to have a 3% write-off rate, but had better economics compared to a group of customers that had a 2% write-off rate and lower economics, I would pick the group with the 3% write-off rate. Because again, we're not endeavoring just to have a low write-off rate, but good economic decisions when we do our investments.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of questions. So first, back to the URR and just trying to continue to understand the trajectory here versus -- what are you finding when you look at -- you said you started looking at people that are staying in the program versus people that are leaving. How much higher is the redemption rate of those staying in the program versus those you found who have left? And secondly, if I could follow up on Loyalty Partner, we spent a lot of time discussing that when I visited you guys recently, and I know the growth in Germany and India is outstanding and you're coming to Mexico. But when you put that in a broader context of the additional $3 billion in fee income over 5 years that you had suggested, I think it was 3 Financial Community Meetings ago, where are we in that progress?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So in talking about the ultimate redemption rate, in the first quarter of 2011, we moved from using strictly data from people who had attrited to estimate the ultimate redemption rate to using that data plus information related to current participants, and we thought that would give us a better estimate. So that was kind of the change that we made at that juncture. The work we're doing now in terms of reviewing the estimation process is we're looking at whether we can enhance the segmentation of the information so that we can have a refined estimate that's enhanced. So that's the reason that we are looking at that. I fully recognize that saying that we're going to have a charge isn't particularly helpful to you in terms of understanding the amount. But at this juncture, we haven't evolved the models to a sufficient degree to have a reliable estimate. But I guess, in terms of trying to frame it for yourself, 2 things that you may think about is, first, as we disclosed in the annual report, if there was a 100-basis-point increase in the URR -- this is not a forecast. I'm simply quoting from the annual report. If there was a 100-basis-point increase, then, too, we would have a $330-million increase in the liability and there would be a charge to P&L in that period. I guess the other data point that I would give you, that we haven't disclosed before, is that if we had a 100-basis-point increase in the URR, that would have an impact of increasing annual expense by approximately $40 million. So that's in terms of just dimensionalizing it. Hopefully, it's helpful. Now in terms of your second question related to fee-based revenue progress, so we continue to expand the services we offer to cardmembers, merchants and other customers. There has been no change to the target that we put out there. We're about halfway through our time frame and still think our target is appropriate, although $3 billion is an ambitious target in an economy that remains so uneven. There's still a great deal of work to do, but we are moving forward on a number of fronts. Our emphasis will be on organic growth, but targeted acquisitions, such as Loyalty Partner and Accertify, may also play a role if we see the right opportunities. So hopefully, that answers your question.","Operator","Then we'll go next to James Freeman (sic) [James Friedman] with Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Could you share some observations or comments with regard to the fee-based revenue, if you might have an update in that regard?","Daniel T. Henry","So fee-based revenues is -- basically, the update is what I just said a moment ago. We continue to expand our services. We're about halfway through the time frame that we laid out to hit the $3-billion target. We recognize that it's a very ambitious target, given the economy. And we have great deal of work to do, but we're moving forward. I think we'll primarily get it through organic initiatives, but we may do targeted acquisitions as well.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So in that regard, Dan, are you still comfortable with the targets that Ken had set forward a year or so ago?","Daniel T. Henry","We think that target, which is to be at a $3-billion run rate as we exit 2014, continues to be an appropriate target.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, one last one if I could sneak it in. So could you share some observations about APAC? I know it's not huge, but it was a little clunky. Were there any specific observations in markets like Australia?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So Asia Pacific, yes, so I think we -- so Australia is a big market for us within the Asian market and we have seen a decline in business there, particularly in the T&E segment. And we think that's probably a reflection of the fact that China is slowing down and Australia's economy has some pretty close linkages to China. So that's the biggest impact that we're seeing that is influencing the slowdown in the growth rate in billings in that region.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Dan, given the trajectory of loan growth and spending growth that you're seeing, can you just give some commentary around whether you expect spending growth and loan growth to cross, as you look ahead, such that basically loan growth overtakes spending growth? And then secondly, when does the loan growth that you're seeing lead to reserve building?","Daniel T. Henry","So I would not -- I don't want to forecast here, but I think loan growth is driven by 2 things: one, it's the growth rate in spending on lending products; and then the second aspect is customer behavior and whether they are still in a mode that they want to kind of de-lever, in which case, we're going to see higher paydown rates. Or at some juncture, should they move to a space where they're more comfortable and aren't focused on that, in which case, we could move to a spot where the growth in loans is very similar to the growth in spending on lending products. But there's lots of factors that play into that. Certainly, we have never ever had a target for loan growth. So loan growth is simply an outcome of the products we put out there that allow customers to revolve if they choose to and then how that customer utilizes the balance. But it emphasized that we are very focused on premium lending. We are not engaging in balance transfer, and we are looking to acquire customers that are higher spenders. We also have a focus on the fact that there are customers out there who are very good customers for us, are high spenders and carry balances at other institutions. And I think we'd be very interested in acquiring those balances. So certainly, just like Charge Card, premium lending has very good economics, and it will continue to be one of our focuses going forward.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And when does the loan growth that you're seeing lead to some reserve building that -- we've been seeing kind of releases overwhelm everything else, but is that something -- can you give us some color on when you expect that to change?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I think, as we grow the business, we have always maintained the same types of credit requirements. Although certainly, as we look to get deeper penetration into premium lending, you bring on new customers. And any time you bring in a cohort of new customers, at least in the first 2 years of their life, they tend to have higher credit losses. So that could be one element of it. And again, we -- as I said before, we don't target loan write-off rates. We target good economics. Obviously, the percentage of people who are in that lower-tenured group could be a factor, then obviously the economy. If the economy continues to be strong as we grow our business, you'll probably see less of a movement. If we see some deterioration in the economy, that'll obviously influence it as we go forward.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And finally, if I can just do one last one, and going back to the fee-based questions, can you just clarify for us whether you consider bluebird, Serve and just prepaid in general to be part of your fee-based initiatives? And are revenues from prepaid, I guess, included in that fee-based revenue target that you put out there?","Daniel T. Henry","I think certain elements would be. So to the extent we get discount revenue on bluebird, you could look at that as it's a fee, because it is a fee. And certainly, other fee elements related to Serve would fit there. To the extent we have interest income on float, I wouldn't consider that to be a fee. So it may -- certain elements in the product will be fees and others will not. But certainly, they would be part of what we're looking to in terms of achieving our target over time.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, and I'm sorry, but just to be clear on that, so the volume that you're going to get on Serve and bluebird, that's going to get thrown into discount revenues and that will drive fees, but the fees on that will count as part of the $3-billion fee-based revenue target.","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, it is. And I think it's logical because there's really no credit risk associated with those fees. So I kind of view it a little different than we might discount revenue related to either charge or lending products.","Operator","And we now have a question from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Could you just provide a little more color on what you're seeing in the decline in T&E spending? Is it fewer transactions? Is it lower prices on hotels or airline tickets? I noticed there was an increase in airline spending, about 2%, I think, FX adjusted. But I'm wondering if there's economic slowdown occurring in more than just Australia.","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I would say that we are seeing lower T&E spending compared to other categories pretty broadly. It was a contributor to Australia. It also was a contributing factor to the slowdown in growth rate for Global Corporate Services. And I think we see large corporations, in particular, being a little bit conservative here and seeing a drop in spending among some of our larger corporate clients. So it's pretty -- I think it's pretty broad-based.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And spread geographically as well.","Daniel T. Henry","Spread geographically as well, yes, and in some lower levels of transactions. But notwithstanding that, when you consider all those negatives I just said in that sentence, we still are managing to have good business growth on an FX-adjusted basis of 8%.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right, okay. And then I think you referenced higher cash rebates. Can you just give us an idea of how much those are as an offset to discount revenue line?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, it's not an item that we separately disclose. It is one of the items that represents the difference between the growth in billed business and the growth in discount revenues. And I guess it's a reflection of the fact that our cash-back products are being successful in the marketplace, so that pleases us in terms of that product category.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then finally, could you just clarify what you were saying about the regulatory and litigation reserves? It sounds like you didn't take anything additional in third quarter. Is that to say that you don't -- and I guess, you don't anticipate, or it's not a problem, not estimable [ph], what's related to the protection...","Daniel T. Henry","So the majority of the payout we had under the regulatory order had been previously accrued. However, in this quarter, as we continued to do our own ongoing reviews, we did accrue amounts related to those reviews. So they were variable enough to mention but not so large that we would provide the dollar amount.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And I guess, could you give us a sense if they were more or less than a year ago in the third quarter? So was that...","Daniel T. Henry","So in the third quarter of last year -- I think in each of the quarters that we've had, I think they've been manageable numbers.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","You have a big P&L, but just for the sake of...","Daniel T. Henry","That's a good thing.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes. But for the sake of kind of making sense of this quarter's expenses versus last quarter, can you just, since you don't want to tell us the amount, give us a sense of the size?","Daniel T. Henry","As I said, I think if you went back to the fourth quarter through now, there has been some amount in each quarter but none in any quarter that kind of crosses our threshold for disclosing the amount.","Operator","Your next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's been pretty quiet on the DOJ case in 2012. I was just curious, as you look out to '13, do you expect to see any procedural-type moves? Or would you expect it to be quiet again in '13?","Daniel T. Henry","I think what we're expecting is for discovery to be completed sometime early in 2013. And then after that, there'll be some time that elapses before we actually get to the next stage in the process.","Operator","Then we'll go next to Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could you just give us -- sort of turning back to one of the earlier questions on the $3-billion target for fee-based revenues, I guess I'm not sure. At this point, it's been at least 1 year, almost 2, since you laid out those goals. I'm just wondering, what's going well? What's not? It seems like -- I would have thought we'd get a little more detail on Serve and how that's progressing. The bluebird product seems like a very compelling offer. It could be a big part of that pie should -- as you seek to achieve that $3-billion goal. Can you give us any detail on what the major components of that revenue target were and where you stand today in any way, shape or form?","Daniel T. Henry","So I -- there's certainly a broad set of initiatives. Certainly, Serve and prepaid reloadables would be elements where we would expect to contribute to our target. Loyalty Partner is an acquisition that we've discussed with you. We would think that's another notable piece of the pie. I would say, though, that if we were to sit here 3 years ago and think about the progress that would've been made in alternative payments and wallets and the like, you probably would've thought we were further along than we are today. So that's not a comment about American Express, specifically, but really about the industry. We continue to see a fair amount of press releases but not necessarily a fair amount of product that's in the marketplace. And the other thing, as I mentioned, is this is a pretty uneven economy. So it makes the achieving that target all the more challenging, but we do have a number of projects that are under way. And we continue to look at other initiatives as we go forward over the next 2 years, as we head towards the latter part of 2014.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, a follow-up question on the credit card business. The lending margin was up this quarter. I didn't exactly -- understand exactly what was driving that. It wasn't like a huge increase but it looked, by my calculations, to be mostly on the top line yields, a nice little bump in the interest charges you're getting on your lending accounts. Anything driving that? I mean, your lending growth has been relatively impressive. I know it's a byproduct of your spending strategy. Just trying to think about what's causing the yield to go up at the same time the loan growth is picking up.","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, it's -- so as you say, it's only up slightly. It could be a little bit related to revolve rates but not a huge move in revolve rates. So we continue to watch it and make sure that the mix we have is right. Certainly, just a change in mix among products can also have a slight increase in terms of -- increase or decrease, depending on which way it moves. So we watch it closely. We've said that we want that number to be around 9% and that's what it's been largely over the last several quarters, slightly higher this quarter but not by a huge amount.","Operator","Then we'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe we could get you to dimensionalize some of the asset growth, the lending products growth. You kind of pointed out that spending growth is better than the lending growth and that there's a number of factors that are driving that. But could you, in any way, provide us with some sense as to whether this is an increase in traction for the premium lending strategy or if this is just the willingness of existing card members to increase their borrowing?","Daniel T. Henry","So it's hard to tease that out, to be quite frank. We are focused on premium lending. We have developed products to drive in that direction. As I said before, we recognize that there are some of our cardmembers who we know very well and we think have good credit who have balances elsewhere. That's certainly one of the things that we are thinking about. We're staying away from balance transfers and those kinds of initiatives, so we're not going there. And as I said before, we have never had a target for loan growth. It's an outcome of putting products in the marketplace as a design to drive spend and then the consumer deciding to utilize that. And how much they want to utilize that in part will be impacted by lots of things, including how they feel in terms of their confidence and where the economy is going. So there's lots of small moving parts within there. But there's not one overarching driving force that is impacting loan growth. And you could see that it's been a very gradual increase over time. And the fact that is the biggest is that 1 year ago or more, we were really seeing an increase in the paydown rate. And that was holding down loan growth effectively, and that has really -- it's increasing a little bit, but it's really stabilized over the last several quarters. So in terms of a change, I would say that's probably the largest contributing factor.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe if you could discuss in any way the decision to essentially rebrand Serve with a much bigger American Express prominence. I've found that to be quite interesting. I don't know if there's a thought that it just wasn't getting enough traction as an independent brand, and it just needs to effectively ride on the coattails of American Express. But if you could provide some sense as to what drove that decision.","Daniel T. Henry","So I think all new products evolve over time. And I think as a company, we came to the realization that our brand has a lot of attributes which are important to people who would use the Serve product or a reloadable prepaid. We do stand for trust, security and servicing. All those things are important when you think about a product like those. And so the decision was made to make it more prominent, so people who are purchasing those products recognize the linkage of Serve to the American Express family.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And is there any -- I mean, is it essentially targeting, from an aspirational brand perspective, a different demographic now? Or is it still the same and it's just a function of gaining more traction?","Daniel T. Henry","So I think -- obviously, people who are utilizing the reloadable prepaid, in particular, are a different group of customers than some of our premium products. But I think many of the attributes of our company and our brand are important to that customer group as well. And we think we have a platform in Serve, which is what reloadable prepaid is running on, and so we want to leverage that. And we think we can put products out there that can be very competitive in the marketplace.","Operator","That will come from Mike Taiano with Telsey Advisory Group.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","So just wanted to follow up on the bluebird question. So it seems like the obvious rationale here is to push more volume onto Amex's network. But I guess, are there some secondary benefits as well? So in other words, from a data standpoint, do you benefit from getting access to a different demographic? And does that help you with some of your other businesses? And would it also potentially help you on the acceptance front as well?","Daniel T. Henry","So I'd say yes to all of those things, right? So I think it does push more volume onto our network. We think that is a very good thing. We think we can achieve good economics. We also see it as a large market today, I think over $300 billion. And it's forecasted to grow at, I think, 12% to 13% going forward. So it's a growing market. We have the capabilities and skills to be successful here. And so we viewed it as a good opportunity and also helping to grow to -- contribute to our growth in fee businesses.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay, great. And then just one quick follow-up on -- a lot of talk about the fiscal cliff here coming up and just wondering, does that affect your guys -- your planning at American Express in terms of the timing of marketing and your ability to maybe -- if there is a larger impact than expected, to ratchet back on maybe some of your marketing spend early next year?","Daniel T. Henry","So in our planning, we always have a base-case plan, and we have been scenarios. If things were to be better, we know exactly what we'd do. And if things were to be worse, we know exactly what we're going to do. So we will monitor this closely. But at the moment, we're focused on our base plan but do have these other scenarios in case we need to react quickly.","Okay. So thanks, everybody, for joining the call, and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.","Richard Petrino","Thank you. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1 2012 10-Q report, already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In the second quarter 2012 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com, we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I'll start on Slide 2.  Total revenues net of interest expense came in at $7,965,000,000. That's an increase of 5% compared to last year.  On an FX-adjusted basis, it's an increase of 7%. Income from continuing operations was $1,339,000,000.  That's an increase of 3%. EPS from continuing operations came in at $1.15.  That's 7% increase compared to last year. The difference in growth rate between EPS and income from continuing operations are the share buybacks that we've been doing. If you go 2 lines down, you can see that the diluted shares outstanding are down 4% compared to the second quarter of 2011. And return on equity came in at 27%.","So moving to Slide 3, these are our second quarter 2012 metrics. Billed business comes in at $221.6 billion.  That's 7% higher on a reported basis and 9% higher on an FX-adjusted basis. And throughout, you'll see that FX is having a larger impact on reported results than normal because of the strength of the U.S. dollar.","If we were to look back at billed business growth, just to see a trend, if you went back to the second quarter of 2011, on an FX-adjusted basis, we had growth of 15% in billed business.  That moved to 13% in the third quarter of last year, 11% in the fourth quarter. It ticked up to 13% in the first quarter of this year. However, it had the benefit of leap year and came in at 12.6%, so round that up. So I view that more similar to the fourth quarter at 11%. But in this quarter, we're 9%. So we are seeing a slowing in the growth rates over, really, the last 4 quarters. So cards-in-force are up to $100 million, up 6% from last year. GNS cards are growing at 15%, and proprietary cards are growing at 2%.  We again see good growth in basic cardmember spending, which illustrates the high level of customer engagement that we have.","Cardmember loans are $61 billion, that compares with $60.1 billion in the first quarter of this year and 4% growth compared to the second quarter of 2011. Worldwide travel sales increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis.","So moving to Slide 4, this is billed business growth by segment, FX-adjusted. So each business really had a similar slowing in billed business growth for the quarter. Each decreased about 3% or 4%, so really broad-based slowing in the growth rate. GNS continues to be the highest growth rate at 13%.","If we move to Slide 5, this is billed business growth by region, again, FX-adjusted. And here again, you can see that each region has a similar slowing in the billed business growth rate, that ranges from a decline of 2% to 4% and, again, is broad-based.","And as you'd expect, EMEA has the lowest growth rate but still had positive growth at 4%. Just a little information for countries within EMEA, Germany had a growth of 5%, U.K. grew at 4%, Italy was flat with last year, and Spain decreased 5%. JAPA continues to be the highest-growth region.","So moving to Slide 6. So this is providing some information on billed business in international currencies. So we're providing this because of the impact that foreign exchange was having on the reported numbers. So just to take you through the slide, obviously, these are several of our major countries that we operate in. The first information there, so looking at the euro, for instance, the 5% to 7% is the approximate range of billed business in the euro compared to total billed business. For Australia, it's 5% to 6%. If you go down to the next line, this is really the year-over-year change in the foreign currency compared to the U.S. dollar.","So in the second quarter of 2012, the strength of the U.S. dollar drove a 2% reduction in our billed business growth rate. So as you know, in periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, volume metrics and revenue growth rates are negatively impacted when translated back into U.S. dollars, while inversely, expense [ph] growth rates benefit from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","As we have estimated in our 2011 annual report, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to overseas operations for 12 months would be about $175 million. So that's an annual amount if there was a 10% impact. And as you can see for the numbers on this slide that impact is in aggregate less than 10%. So in general, it's our policy to hedge the P&L one quarter out.","Slide 7. So this is lending billed business, which is the solid line, the growth rate in lending billed business. And the dotted line is the growth rate in managed loans. So we still have a gap. We have a growth rate of lending billed business being higher at 9% compared to managed loans, which is growing at 4%. But the gap continues to narrow.","Now paydown increased quite a bit in 2009 and 2010 but has stabilized in recent quarters. In the second quarter, the trust paydown rate was 31.5%, and that's well above industry average.  And as I'll speak to in a few minutes, our credit is behaving very well on loans.","So moving to Slide 8, so this is revenue performance. So total revenues grew at 5%. It's not on this slide, but on FX-adjusted basis, it grew at 7%.","So starting with discount revenue, it grew at 5%, and this reflects 7% billed business growth, offset by higher contra-revenues including corporate incentive payments and higher cash rebates. Average discount rate on the second quarter of this year was 2.54%, which is flat with the second quarter of 2011, although over time, we still expect the average discount rate to decrease slightly due to pricing incentives and mix change.","If we look at the next 3 revenue lines: net card fees, travel commissions and fees and other commissions and fees, on a reported basis, they're basically flat, but on an FX-adjusted basis, they are growing at between 3% and 4%. So if we look at other revenues, that increased 21%, and that includes a $30 million gain on the sale of a portion of our ICBC investment, a favorable revision in the estimate of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in international markets, and higher royalty payments from our GNS partners.","Looking at net interest income, it increased 4%, and that's driven by 4% growth in loans. And our net yield is the same this year as it was in the second quarter of 2011, resulting in 4% net interest income growth.","So moving to Slide 9, so this is provision for losses. Credit continues to perform very well. However, provision increased 29% as lending reserve releases are well below what we saw in the second quarter of 2011. In charge card, we had higher write-off dollars in the second quarter of this year compared to last year, and that was offset by higher reserve releases in the second quarter of this year than last year, all these -- although these are much smaller amounts than what we see in lending. But the net of that is that the charge card provision is flat, as you can see on this chart.","Now in lending, we had lower write-offs in the second quarter of this year. The write-offs this year were $370 million compared to $511 million last year, so write-offs are $140 million lower in this period, so that would drive provision down. However, we had lower reserve releases, as you can see on the chart, and therefore, the benefit of reserve releases were about $230 million less than last year. And as a result, the lending provision is $100 million higher than we had in the second quarter of 2011.","So moving to Slide 10, so these are charge card credit metrics. And as you can see on the left, the U.S. consumer and small business group had higher write-off rates in the second quarter of 2011 at 2% compared to 1.5% in the second quarter of last year. And that's why on the prior chart, we had higher write-off dollars in charge card. But I will note that the 2% is lower than the 2.3% in write-offs that we saw in the first quarter this year.","International Consumer and Global Corporate products, for the right chart, you can see that credit continues to perform very well, and these are -- all of these metrics are at historically low levels.","Next, I'll take you to Slide 11.  So these are lending credit metrics. And on the left, you can see that the write-off rate decreased from 3.1% in the second quarter of 2011 to 2.2% in the second quarter of this year, and it's also down 10 basis points from 2.3% in the first quarter. So in the second quarter of this year, if you look at it by month, in April, the write-off rate was 2.4%. In May, it was 2.2%, and in June, it was 2.0%. So we have an improving trend in the quarter.","If you look at the right side, this is 30 days past due, and this is also improving. So it improved from 1.6% in the second quarter of last year to 1.4% in the first quarter of this year, and 1.3% this quarter. So I'll just remind you that our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but achieve the best economic gain when we make investments. But these metrics are at historic low levels and represent best-in-class credit metrics in the industry.","Slide 12. So this is lending reserve coverage. You can see that both the U.S. card and worldwide reserves as a percentage of loans continue to come down as the write-off rates and the \"30 day past due\" rates improve. So the percentage now for the U.S. card is 2.6%, and worldwide is 2.5%. Reserves as a percentage of past due are similar this quarter to the percentages that we had in the first quarter of this year, and that's true for the principal months coverage as well. So for those people who can hear the thunder in the background, if you're not in New York, it's a big lightning and thunder storm here. So the reserves, we think, are appropriate based on the credit models that we use to set reserves.","Moving to Slide 13, so this is expense performance. So here you can see that total expenses increased 4 -- 2% and on an FX-adjusted basis, which is not on the slide, would have increased 4%. If you exclude the Visa\/MasterCard settlement payments of $220 million that we received in the second quarter of 2011 and which were 0 this quarter, total expenses would have decreased by 2%.","So I'll cover each of the individual line items on this slide and subsequent slides, but I would point out that the effective tax rate this quarter of 29% reflects the realization of certain foreign tax credits this year. And the 27% in the second quarter of '11 reflects the impact of favorable resolution of certain prior-year tax items. A normal tax rate for us would be in the low 30s.","Looking at Slide 14, so this is marketing and promotion. So on the prior slide, we saw that in the second quarter of this year, marketing and promotion was $773 million. And that's down from 3%, from $795 million in the second quarter of 2011, but it is up from $631 million in the first quarter of this year.","So we have said that our target for marketing promotion generally is to be around 9% of revenues so that we can drive growth. In the first quarter, when marketing and promotion was only 8.3% of revenues, we said we had a plan for full year marketing promotion to be approximately 9%. In this quarter, we increased marketing promotion to 9.7% of revenues, and we are continuing to invest in the business at healthy levels to drive growth, and this puts us on track to achieve our plan of approximately 9% -- for marketing to be 9% for the full year of revenues.","If we move to Slide 15, so now we're now covering cardmember rewards expense. So cardmember rewards expense for this quarter was $1,463,000,000, and that's down 9% from $1,613,000,000 in the second quarter of 2011. Now the blue section of this bar represents MR points earned in the current period and co-brand expense. I remind you that for co-brand products, the co-brand partner has the obligation to deliver the reward. We pay the co-brand partner each month for the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability.","On the other hand, we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Rewards program and had a balance sheet reserve of approximately $5 billion at the end of 2011.","The green section of the bar represents Membership Rewards expense related to points earned in previous periods due to an increase in the estimate of the ultimate redemption rate or a change in the estimate of the weighted average cost per point.","The green section in 2002 -- the green section in the second quarter of 2011 represents an increase in the ultimate redemption rate based on customer behavior and an increase in the weighted average cost per point in the second quarter of 2011. Now you can see that there is no green section in the second quarter of 2012 as we had a modest increase in the ultimate redemption rate, much low -- in the second quarter of this year, much lower than the increase in the second quarter of 2011. This quarter is much closer to historical levels of an increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the quarter. But we did have an increase in that we created an expense in the quarter, but it was offset by a reduction in the weighted average cost per point in this quarter, which reduces expense in the quarter, and the 2 items net to approximately 0.","Slide 16, operating expense performance, and we have been very focused on this area. On a reported basis, total operating expense increased 10% in the quarter. But if you exclude the Visa\/MasterCard litigation settlement proceeds that are included in the second quarter of last year but are 0 this year, it would have been a growth of 2%.","Now salaries and benefits decreased 4% compared to last year. And that reflects the fact that in the second quarter of '11, we had a $48 million reengineering charge, and in this quarter of 2012, we had the favorable impact of foreign exchange.","Our total employee count was approximately 64,000 and is relatively consistent with the prior year and last quarter.","If we look at professional services, it's lower by 5% as last year had higher levels of technology costs.","If we look at occupancy and equipment, it's up 14%,  and this reflects higher data processing costs related to software licenses and some higher rent.","If we look at adjusted other net of $422 million in the second quarter of '12, it increased significantly from $92 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting the Visa\/MasterCard settlement payment received in 2011. In addition, the increase includes accruals for refunds to customers as well as investment impairments.","As to the customer refunds, we are discussing matters with our U.S. banking regulators, including those mentioned in the 10-K. Based on those conversations and our own ongoing internal reviews, we have made some changes to our CARD practices at our 2 banking subsidiaries: Centurion Bank and FSB. The expense for these items is largely reflected in adjusted net other in this quarter.","Moving to Slide 17.  So this is 8 quarters of information on operating expense levels. And we are at operating expense levels that we believe will enable us to drive business growth. Going forward, we will continue to implement our plans to contain operating expenditures.","As you can see, operating expense was similar in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter. Now I'm not making a forecast here, but if operating expense stays at the current level, the growth rate for the full year adjusted for the Visa\/MasterCard settlement proceeds would be in the low single-digits, and there's no change to our objective of growing operating expense more slowly than revenue growth over the next 2 to 3 years.","Slide 18. So this is expense flexibility over time, and this slide shows adjusted expenses as a percentage of revenues, and adjusted expenses excludes credit provision. So on the left side, you can see 5 years of history and on the right side, the past 5 quarters. So both the first quarter and the second quarter of 2011 show improvement compared to the quarters in 2011. And while the second quarter rounds to 71%, it is slightly lower than in the first quarter.","Over time, we expect this rate to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first, through top-line revenue growth and, second, through expense flexibility, which includes our plans to contain operating expense growth.","Moving to Slide 19, so these are our capital ratios. Our Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of 2011, that's not on the slide, was 12.3%. It increased to 13.4% in the first quarter of this year as share repurchases did not start until mid-March, after the Fed completed their review of our capital distribution plan.","In the second quarter, we built capital with $1.3 billion of net income and $200 million related to employee plans. And as planned, we made capital distributions of $2 billion, $1.8 billion in share repurchases and $200 million in dividends, resulting in Tier 1 common moving to 2.8%. The Tier 1 common ratio of 2.8% puts us in a strong capital position and well above required benchmarks.","Moving to Slide 20, so this is total payout ratios. The left side, you can see the ratios for the last 5 years, and on the right, for the past 4 quarters. In the first quarter of 2012, as I just mentioned, we didn't start share repurchases until mid-March. So we only repurchased $200 million in the first quarter of this year. The capital distribution plan allows for $4 billion in share repurchases in 2012, and we repurchased $1.8 billion in the second quarter to bring our year-to-date repurchases to $2 billion, so half of the allowed repurchases at the midpoint of the year.","Slide 21 is our liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. So we have $16 billion in excess cash and marketable securities, and the next 12 months of maturities is $15 billion.","So moving to Slide 22, so this is U.S. retail deposits. As we had limited cash needs in the second quarter and we issued $2.5 billion in unsecured debt and asset-backed securitizations, we allowed deposits to decrease in the quarter by $1.7 billion, but we remain committed to increase direct deposits over time.","So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Given the uncertain environment, we feel positive about our financial performance in the second quarter, including our ability to continue to grow earnings in the absence of settlement proceeds and with lower reserve releases. Spending growth remained relatively strong, albeit at a slower pace than recent quarters, and we continue to grow faster than most of our large issuing competitors despite a more difficult prior-year comparison.","We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year, with net yields comparable to the prior year, leading to 4% growth in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates improved to new all-time lows. Despite very strong credit performance, provision expense increased as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year than last year. Our revenue growth of 5% or 7% on FX-adjusted basis reflects the benefits of our spend-centric mode and stands in contrast to many other issuers who still face year-over-year revenue declines.","In the quarter, total expenses were well controlled at only 2% growth or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. We are still investing in the business, and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in the card base while continuing to build capabilities for the future. Marketing and promotion, though down slightly year-over-year, represent 9.7% of revenues, up from 8.3% last quarter. In addition, we are continuing to move forward with our plans to grow operating expenses more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years.","We also wanted to remind you that starting in the third quarter, the impact on operating expense growth rates of losing the Visa\/MasterCard settlement proceeds will decline significantly. Our capital strength was also on display this quarter as we were able to elevate our year-to-date payout ratio to 83% while maintaining very strong capital ratios.","Looking ahead, we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead.","So thanks for listening, and we are now going to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to inquire about performance on billed business so far in July. And also, if you could comment on -- just looking at domestic billed business, seasonality would dictate growth, link quarter around the 10% range, we're a little off from that this quarter. I was wondering if you could discuss any possible specific places where it might have weakened or if it was just general?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I think we're not going to comment on July to-date numbers. I would say, though, that in the second quarter, the growth rate that we saw in June was very comparable to the growth rate that we saw in May. In terms of categories, I would say that we probably saw slower growth in T&E categories than we saw in other categories. But really, the changing growth rates that we saw, as I illustrated on the slides, was really across all of our business lines  and really across all geographies. So yes, I would say it was pretty broad-based.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And if I can ask one follow-up. Regarding the top line, you had mentioned incentive payments as an offset in discount revenue. We've heard that from you guys a couple of times now. Is there any way that we could think about modeling that? And is it worth our time to figure out how to model that as an offset to pure discount revenue?","Daniel T. Henry","So modeling always assumes that the future will be the same as the past, if you use historical information. We have had, over the last several quarters, higher levels of incentive payments. Those are based on new agreements with many of our large corporate clients. That is a business that has very high levels of profitability for us. So despite the higher level of incentive payments, sometimes which are triggered by new agreements, sometimes triggered by corporate customers just spending at higher level. And again, we think they are effectively worthwhile investments because it is a business with very good profitability. But the levels that we have from period to period will kind of depend on the growth in their spending and when contracts are removed.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dan, just a follow-up on the prior question. Just in terms of the spend volumes, are you seeing any changes in terms of spending patterns, both here and internationally, whether it's moves from discretionary to nondiscretionary, were there any changes throughout the quarter?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. I don't know that there was big shift between discretionary and nondiscretionary. I guess I would just point out that last year in the second quarter, we grew 15%. I don't know that any of our competitors grew at that level. So to the extent you have that kind of growth, when you come to the next year, it's just a higher challenge in terms of growth rates. So given those higher comparables, I think our growth rates remain healthy and are reflective of the fact that the investments that we've made over the past couple of years continue to pay off.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the capital, so you've now repurchased $2 billion for the year, and I'm guessing some of this quarter was a catch-up from last quarter, but how do we think about for it over the next 3 quarters, given what your CCAR allotment is? And I know you've talked in the past about having some safer acquisitions, but it seems like we've been pretty quiet on that front. So I just want to think about how we should think about the path over the next 2 or 3 quarters. And second, now that we've gotten the NPR from the regulators, any sense of what the all-in Basel III capital level looks like?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So as you say, from the balance of the year, we have approvement based on our submission to buy back $2 billion more through the end of the year. We could afford to do modest levels of acquisitions and still buy back $2 billion more. If we had acquisitions at higher levels, then we would moderate the buybacks accordingly, which is, I think, very consistent with what we've said our plan would be as we to go through the course of this year. So no really -- no change there. In terms of new Basel information, what I remind you of is that we have our ratios calculated under Basel I, right? We are still in the process of developing what they would be under Basel II, so we don't have that information yet. But the impact in this quarter of going from Basel I to Basel III is approximately 30 basis points. It varies from quarter-to-quarter, but has generally been in the kind of 20- to 80-basis-points range, depending on quarter. This quarter it was about 30 basis points.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dan, I hope you could talk a little bit about, post the MOU merchant settlement, if you can kind of remind us what you allow in terms of surcharging and what the potential impact might be going forward?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So I think, as most people know, we were not party to that litigation. That lawsuit was filed against Visa and MasterCard, and they control about 70% or 80% of the market. A fundamental legal difference is -- between us and Visa\/MasterCard is that they have market power. The courts have recognized this and determined that they used that power improperly. American Express does not have market power. We continue to believe that there's no merit to the separate merchant cases that we are involved in, and we believe that we have strong legal defenses. Now as it relates to surcharging, surcharging is not consumer-friendly. The terms and conditions within the settlement agreement that deal with surcharging are very complicated. So given that complexity, we think it's too early to know what the impact of the rule changes might actually have in the marketplaces, but we obviously will monitor the situation and respond appropriately. Now we've seen different reactions in different international markets where surcharging is allowed by law. In Australia, some merchants have introduced surcharging. It was first allowed there back in 2003, and we've been able to respond effectively and continue to operate successfully. In contrast, in the U.K., we've seen very little evidence of merchants surcharging, and that was first allowed by the Thatcher government many, many years ago. The other thing I'd point out and you should keep in mind is that in the United States, there are 10 states that have laws that prohibit surcharging, and these states represent about 50% of our U.S. billings volume. So the Visa\/MasterCard rule change doesn't change the terms of our contracts with merchants. We do not prevent merchants from surcharging, but we do continue to require parity treatment so that our cardmembers are not discriminated against at point of sale. And by parity treatment, I mean that if a American Express cardmember is surcharged 100 basis points, any other credit card that is presented would be charged -- surcharged the same 100 basis points.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was -- you pointed out in your earlier remarks that the total cards-in-force have been growing quite a bit more in the network partner area, I believe you stated 15% versus 2% proprietary. Can you dimensionalize maybe the differences in the customer base for network partner card versus the proprietary card? What you expect in terms of spend on a partner card versus a proprietary card, anything that we could -- let us maybe better forecast the overall growth on that line.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So GNS partners, when we speak to them, their products are targeted to their more affluent customers. That's really the design of the product. It's designed to encourage spending, so they are more affluent customers. Now I would say that the average spend within GNS partner customers is lower than the average spend in proprietary American Express cards. But we see the GNS business as a terrific business for us in that it brings more cardmembers into merchants, so it makes the American Express network more relevant in more markets. And often, these are customers that we would not be able to reach other than through the GNS partner relationships. Today, GNS has grown over the years to be a important contributor to income. Now while the dollar profit that we earn on each dollar of GNS-billed business is lower than what we earn on a dollar of proprietary billed business, it requires very little capital, and so the returns are good. The other thing I'd point out is that some of the -- that many of the GNS partnerships operate in both -- some markets are developed markets and some are developing markets, so you need to take that into consideration as well. But net-net, we think it is a good business overall in terms of the contribution and mix.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. And so, just as a follow-up, I guess we just need to think about how that's going to impact the discount revenues versus overall spend. Also, I -- if I remember correctly, the network cards are mostly on a credit card platform versus a charge card platform. Is that correct?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. I mean, so their products and our products run on our network, right? The cards that the GNS partners issue are often credit cards, so that's a difference. But they run on our -- they don't work -- run on a different network.  It's the American Express network.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just if I could get one last one. On the refunds that your -- that you took the charge on for in the quarter, can you expand on that at all? We've seen some other peers that have taken similar charges, and I guess I'd just like to better understand what those refunds are.","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So these are -- relate to certain changes that we've made in our CARD practices, and the changes generally relate to items around either pricing, exposure or collections. So that's a -- that gives you a little bit more flavor in terms of the changes we're making that led to the refunds that we're making to customers.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just as you pointed out, billed business during the quarter slowed across the board and across all platforms. So I'm just wondering, you also reiterated the desire to kind of continue to generate positive operating leverage. Just curious how much flexibility there is if we assume a further slowdown in billed business, given the global economic outlook, how much room there is to still continue to cut costs or accelerate the decline in costs?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I think when we talk about our desire to contain operating expense, it's really a long-term view. So it's not just related to this quarter or next quarter or related to a potential slowdown. I think it's really a desire to create operating leverage so that expenses are growing at an appropriate level that enable us to have the investment dollars that we desire so that we can drive business over the long term and achieve our financial targets on an average and over time. So the whole notion of operating leverage is really designed as a long-term objective and not necessarily related to a short-term slowdown. We also could react if there was a severe short-term slowdown the way we have historically when there's been a recession. But I would think of those as really, really 2 different types of focuses on operating expense.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So I mean, given -- assuming a modest slowdown in billed business growth, you'd still expect to generate operating leverage?","Daniel T. Henry","It's our goal to continue to generate operating leverage from where we are today, yes.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, and you mentioned before M&A, if you do anything that's, I guess, not large, you still have limited buyback as well. Where are you seeing -- I mean, you haven't done anything recently, but where are you seeing the opportunities and where are you focused on M&A?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. I think M&A, we would focus on what I'd describe as kind of bolt-on acquisitions, not very large acquisitions. They would be to enable us to achieve our strategic business objectives and\/or be in something that's a very close adjacency. Loyalty partners is a good example of that, where they had a coalition loyalty platform in -- primarily in Germany, but in several other countries, we have a significant amount of loyalty experience and we have global reach, and we thought that was a very good combination. And we'd generally be in areas that would generate fee business going forward. So those would be the general parameters of what we're endeavoring to achieve.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just want to get a little more color, if you can, Dan, on the spending trends. I believe you said that June levels were similar to May levels, and it's a little early to get into July. But just looking at the June and May, I was under the impression that your last public update in June call, I think it was, guided to 9% to10% billed business growth through May. So I'm just trying to reconcile how it slowed all the way down to 7% with just the month of June if June was in line with May. Do I have those numbers right?","Daniel T. Henry","So I think you have the numbers right. But the 9% to 10% that we related to April and May were FX-adjusted.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So right in line, then.","Daniel T. Henry","The comparable number is 9% for the quarter.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. Right in line, okay. And then the second question would be on the expense side, just getting a little more color on the HR costs, salaries and benefits line. The first time you've had a negative growth rate there since '09. I think you did call out the reengineering, but even if I adjust for reengineering, it's still down on a year-over-year basis versus up 7-plus percent in the first quarter. Anything else that helped cut costs this quarter on a personnel side?  Is it lower bonus accruals that go along with this lower spending, or anything else that was one-time in nature that helped the OpEx growth slow so much on the PL -- personnel line?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I think if you back out the reengineering, you kind of get close to flat. And then really we were helped, as all the expense lines were, by FX. So if you look at total -- I don't know if it's exactly in salaries and benefits, but on the total, it took the growth rate from total expense to the growth rate from 2% up to 4%. So if you had a similar relationship on salaries and benefits, it would be up about 2%, which is in the realm of what you would expect if you have a constant employee base. And what we had in this quarter was similar to what we had in the second quarter of last year in terms of total number of employees.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one final one on the spending side again. Some of those growth rates you gave us for some of the countries within the eurozone. Any color you can give us on how much those have changed and how much of a slowdown you're seeing in countries like Spain or Italy or Germany?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. I think we gave last quarter similar numbers, and I would venture to say that the countries in Southern Europe, if I remember correctly -- let's see, I actually have some data here, so let's see. So I would say each of the countries decreased by 2% or 3%, not much different than what we're seeing overall. Spain decreased a little bit more than that compared to last quarter. I think we said Spain was up 2% in the second -- first quarter this year. So not wide variation, other than Spain.  Basically the same kind of trends that we're seeing across the world.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Dan, I believe you said that in the past that you think the 12% range is conservatively the Tier 1 common level that you see Amex operating at, given the uncertainties surrounding Basel II. 12% seems kind of high to me, but I wonder if you can just give us some updated thoughts there in terms of what the right Tier 1 common ratio is that we should be thinking about as your target level going forward.","Daniel T. Henry","So initially, when we're coming out of the recession, we said we want to be at least 10% or 11%. I think over the course of the past couple of years, we've had good capital generation. And really, in 2011, we kind of increased from that 11% range up to the 12% range, because in our submission to the Fed in January of '11, we only asked for $2.3 billion of buybacks on the assumption that we were going to use half of the capital generated to do acquisitions, which would mean we'd do $2 billion in acquisitions. In fact, that year we only did $1 billion. So we effectively wound up as a result of that of retaining another $1 billion, and that took us from 11 up to 12%. I think we taken artificially high in the first quarter because we couldn't do share buybacks in the first quarter of '12 until our plan was approved. That was in the middle of March. So I'd expect to see us to trend back towards where we were at the beginning of this year, which was 12.3%. We think our submission was appropriate in terms of the levels of buybacks that we requested. And the fact that the Fed approved that level, I think, is a demonstration of our financial strength and flexibility. So this will evolve over time, and each year, we'll probably get better insight in terms of where we want to be. And as we move forward with the work that we're doing on Basel II, which we may not have better insights until we get to 2014, but when we get those better insights, we'll have a better sense of where we want just to settle in. Now the other thing, I think, that's important is not just a raw number that your Tier 1 common ratio is, but if you look at the stress test and see where your ratio is after that stress, may start to become even more important. And certainly, if you look at the data from this year, you can see that based on the stress test that the Fed decided the assumptions on, we had very limited drop in where the Tier 1 common was in that stress, which was different than many others. So I think people start to look at that. And that will be something we'll have to consider when we ultimately set where we decide to hold Tier 1 common ratio.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, can you talk about what happened with the bluebird product at Walmart? If you just give a little bit more color there? And I believe you guys have talked about the -- converging all of your prepaid offerings under one platform. I believe that was the Serve platform. Can you update us on where we are on that and whether that's -- bluebird had anything to do with that convergence?","Daniel T. Henry","So we do have a plan to move our reloadable prepaid product onto the Serve platform within the next couple of quarters. That doesn't have anything to do with bluebird, but it is a excellent use of the Serve platform for business that we think will be growing, and a business where we think we have a very good product in the marketplace compared to the competitions. So as it relates to bluebird, American Express and Walmart have a great partnership. Our work together on bluebird has moved to a new phase, and we continue to test different points of distribution and marketing messages while also collecting and analyzing feedback for customers who took part in our pilot. And at this time, it wouldn't make sense to speak about any future plans with bluebird, but we appreciate your interest around the bluebird project.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Have you got any specific plans to reduce the cost per point and how to think about that as we go forward?","Daniel T. Henry","So I think the cost per point is something that we're focused on just in terms of -- so the offerings that we put into the program are designed to create value for our customers. We have over 100 different options within the program that are part of what make it an excellent program. And certainly, as we think about adding customers and options, we do think about the overall costs to us. So it's a balance between value to our customers who participate in the Membership Rewards program and the cost of the program in terms of the overall economics of the products that we offer. So for years, we've been focused on the cost per point and endeavored to manage it, and we will continue to do that as we go forward. In this period, it was really not a result of changing the offerings within the program. It was really driven by customer behavior and a change in mix.  So in this quarter we just had a shift in mix, really, away from the amount that was being redeemed for airlines compared to what we have had in prior quarters. And that's what really drove the weighted average cost per point down in this given period.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I know you said before that you don't strive for the lowest loss rate, but rather kind of an economic answer.  But could you talk a little about why you've got kind 50-, 60-basis-point increase in charge card losses in the first half of this year versus first half of last year?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So our strategy is to focus on growing spend products, so those would be charge cards, as well as premium lending cards. So as we strove to grow the charge business, to see write-off rates go up a bit is perfectly fine with us as long as we're attracting customer groups that have good long-term economics. And as you know, when you're bringing a lending customer, sometimes it takes 12 to 24 months before the portfolio seasons because people can make minimum payments. In charge card, on the other hand, it's a pay-in-full product, so you see it a lot more quickly. So I think that's part of what drove the increase that we saw through the first quarter. On the other hand, we continue to get focused on what's taking place within our portfolio. And I think that focus is what enabled the write-off rate actually to come down in the second quarter compared to the first. But still, all-in, these are very low write-off rates. And if we can drive the right economics and acquire the right customers, having write-off rates being higher than where they are today are perfectly fine.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Just one last very quick thing, and that is the ancillary products that you mentioned in -- are those sold through a third party, or do you sell them directly?","Daniel T. Henry","So which ancillary products?","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The ones that you're talking about having customer rebates before.","Daniel T. Henry","I -- so I know -- so I don't know the specific answer to that question. I know we have been focusing on them, and I suspect that at least a portion of them, I think, are sold through our proprietary process. But I don't have a specific split between what's proprietary and what might be with third parties.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Mike Taiano with Telsey Advisory Group.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","So I just wanted to make sure that I understood your question -- the answer on the surcharging question. So as I understand it, so if Visa and MasterCard were to charge, let's just say, 2% -- or if merchants were to charge 2% on a Visa\/MasterCard transaction, your rules would not allow merchants to charge a higher amount than that, even if your cost of acceptance to the merchant is higher?","Daniel T. Henry","Our provision does not prohibit surcharging but requires that the surcharging be on a parity basis so that our cardmembers are not discriminated against at the point of sale. So if someone was charging 2% to our customers, then our contracts would require that any other credit card that's presented would be required to have the same surcharge.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay. So it's -- they would then have to charge MasterCard or Visa cardholders the same as they're charging you and not vice versa?","Daniel T. Henry","No. So our contracts cover our cardmembers, right? The Visa and MasterCard rules cover theirs. So if a merchant has a contract with us, it requires that our cardmembers be charged on parity, as I just described, with what -- and that other credit card companies -- other credit cards that are presented would have to have the same surcharge.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay, got it. And then just one follow-up on a -- I saw you guys are adopting the EMV standards. Was just curious what you think that impact will be if there is a additional costs that you'll have to incur later this year or early next year on that?","Daniel T. Henry","So we're going to start issuing cards that have EMV enabled, and we will convert cards over, over a multiyear period. So the cost of doing that will not be in 1 or 2 quarters but would be over a several year period.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The -- just a comment on the long-term growth model revenue and earnings growth model, if you can. I mean, obviously, your targets are at least 8% revenue growth and 12% to 15% earnings growth. And I think ken suggested looking at 2010 is kind of a base. As we look forward to 2013 and '14, it doesn't seem like the economic trajectory is going to change all that much from here. It certainly doesn't feel like it today.  But are you able to --  do you feel good about being able to hit those targets? I mean, you're blowing out your return on equity target pretty significantly. But can you hit those -- the revenue and EPS? Do you feel confident in those targets?","Daniel T. Henry","So on average and over time, I would think about a 10-year cycle, not a 3- or 4-year cycle. And clearly, in times where economic growth is slow, you would expect to have slower billed business growth in those periods than when you had a robust period. So when we say on average and over time, I think we've looked at it an extended cycle. And over that cycle, I think we're confident that we can achieve those levels, we can achieve our financial targets.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then on spend growth, I mean, your -- you had Continental. How much of an effect has Continental's switch to United had on your billed business?","Daniel T. Henry","So we had a fair number of initiatives in place last year when the Continental contract expired. We actually were very pleased in terms of what we are able to achieve in terms of retaining customers through those initiatives at the end of the day. And what I would point out is I don't have any specific data on how many customers we may have lost, but what I would say is over the past year, we have continued to build share in the U.S. So in total, we've continued to be successful in the marketplace when you look at the overall population of people who could -- who are using credit and charge cards. And these days, that's our aim is to be successful in terms of financial results and continuing to be able to compete successfully in the marketplace.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just a last question on Serve, if I could. If you could give some update, I mean, you've invested -- I mean, American Express has invested at least several hundred million dollars to date in Serve, and I know that we haven't seen as many new relationships being announced recently, but when can we get some -- I mean, some information on how successful Serve is being? It seems looking at your numbers and the growth of fee income, it really still seems to be pretty irrelevant, and it's hard to forecast any benefit from that significant investment that you've been making over these last several years.","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So I think -- last year was the year we wanted to sign agreements with other businesses that would put Serve in the path of their customers. This year, it's all about getting customers onto the network, and that's what we're focused on. So that's our focus now. In terms of Serve, we are seeing some successful uses of Serve. Certainly by putting our reloadable products on Serve, if we didn't have that platform, our ability to issue the product would have been hampered. We have also entered into agreements in China with Lianlian, where the basis of that is that Lianlian is going to use the Serve platform as part of their mobile pop-up process. So we are seeing spots we're able to use it. I don't think we're at the point yet where we would release financial information, but we continue to make progress against the objectives that we have set for ourselves.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then I guess as that relates to your fee income targets, I mean, it seems like you're still quite a ways away from hitting your targets on fee income, and it seems like you need to make acquisitions to grow that. Or are you disappointed with the level of fee income growth that you've been able to generate, given the aggressive target?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes. So our target is to exit, I think, 2014 at a $3 billion run rate. Last year, we had $1.3 billion in fee income. So we continue to make progress in the fee area and against that target.","So to the operator, I would say I'll take one last question.","Operator","And that would be from Brad Ball with Evercore.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Dan, what was the amount of the accrual for refunds in the quarter? And had you accrued any in prior quarters?","Daniel T. Henry","So we did have an accrual back in the fourth quarter, which we mentioned at that time. As it relates to the accruals in this quarter, we don't plan to disclose the exact dollar amount. We felt that the cost in this quarter were important enough to mention, but not large enough to quantify.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The adjusted other rose by $110 million year-over-year. Is most of that driven by this accrual?","Daniel T. Henry","So I would say that there were 2 items that contributed to it. It was this accrual as well as investment impairments that drove it. So those are the 2 big items that are in the increase.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then separately, you continue to show spending on lending products that are growing faster than your overall loan growth, and at the same time, you've got historically strong credit quality. And I'm just wondering when will you start pushing a little harder on loan growth and driving up your net charge-off ratio to a more economically reasonable level? At down at 2.2%, it just seems too low to drive the kind of returns and spending volume growth that you have the potential to get here.","Daniel T. Henry","So we have never had a target to grow loans, and I don't anticipate that we will in the future. Our focus is to make investments that have good economic returns over time, and they are currently focused on charge card as well as premium lending. So to the extent customers want have the ability to lend and we have the right credit quality, then we want to put investments up against both charge and premium lending, and to the extent we're successful, we will -- may see loan growth increase, but we don't have any specific targets for loan growth. We really target our investments for the greatest economic return over time.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And what would you say is a normalized net charge-off rate?","Daniel T. Henry","A normalized charge-off rate. So that's what we're going to have to wait and see, all right? So over the past 10 years, it was about 4.5%. So I feel pretty confident, not going too much out on a limb, that it will be less than that going forward. But exactly where it will go from here will be very dependent on both our strategy as well as customer behavior at the end of the day.","All right. All right.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Toby Willard. Please go ahead sir.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Gary. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the Company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that maybe discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to quarter\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well. Thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re off to a solid start to 2017. Our earnings per share for Q1 was $1.34 and we\u2019re encouraged by the momentum we see in our revenue performance. As you know, accelerating revenue growth through capturing opportunities across our diversified business model has been a key priority for us.","In addition, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and continue to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs. In many ways, our Q1 results show the steady progress we\u2019re making on the range of growth and cost initiatives that we have put in place over the last couple of years and that we reviewed at our Investor Day last month. These initiatives have been supported by the spending that we did over the last two years. We expect that these efforts will all come together to help us produce steady results during 2017 and position us well for the longer-term.","Going forward we remain focused on delivering improvement in EPS as we progress through 2017 and beyond this, we\u2019re equally focused on our strategies to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth. While it is still early in the year and we have work to do, our first quarter is a positive start to hear.","With that, let me turn to the detailed results, starting with the summary financial performance on Slide 2. Revenue for the first quarter was down 2% reflecting lower discount revenue and net interest income following the Costco portfolio sale in Q2 of last year. When excluding FX and Costco related revenues in the prior year, our adjusted revenue growth accelerated modestly to 7% on a sequential basis. The first quarter also included as expected given the volume growth we\u2019re seeing a greater year-over-year increase in provision and rewards than we experienced in the fourth quarter.","Net income was down 13% versus the prior year first quarter. As we continue to grow over the co-brand exits from 2016. As we move through 2017, we expect net income and EPS to grow due to the benefits from our cost reduction initiatives and the seasonality of revenue. Of course we expect a return to year-over-year net income and EPS growth as we get to the second half of 2017. Earnings per share of $1.34 reflects our net income performance and also the benefits of our strong capital position. Over the last year, we returned $4.1 billion of capital to shareholders through our share repurchase programs, which has resulted in a 6% reduction in average shares. These results brought our ROE for the 12 months ended in March to 25%.","So with that is the summary, let me now turn to a more detailed review of our results starting with billings. You can see on Slide 3 the world wide FX adjusted billings were flat in the quarter versus the prior year. To get a better understanding of the underlying trends on Slide 4 as we have in recent quarters, we show billings growth adjusted for both changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of Costco. Here you can see that adjusted billings growth accelerated modestly to 8% in the quarter. The acceleration was broad based. As you can see in both the segment view of billings on Slide 5 and the geographical view of billings on Slide 6. Across all of these views, I would point out a number of trends in our billings performance this quarter.","In the GCS segment, we continue to see strong growth in the small business and middle market customer segments. Adjusted volumes in the U.S. grew at 11% in the quarter and outside the U.S. volume growth accelerated. In the large and global GCS customer segment spending volumes were up a bit as compared to last year. As we have said for a while now we would expect that this will remain a slower growth segment absent an uptick in travel and entertainment spending by larger corporations, which we have not yet seen.","The U.S. consumer segment growth rate was consistent with Q4 2016. We are pleased with the impact of the initial changes we made last October in our U.S. consumer platinum product. It\u2019s too early to comment on the most recent changes to the product as they just took effect at the end of the first quarter. In the international consumer and network services segment the billings growth rate improved sequentially to 8% on an FX adjusted basis.","Looking at the two parts of the segment, volumes from proprietary cards grew at 11%, reflecting continued strength in several international markets. In GNS, the FX adjusted growth improved from 4% in Q4 to 6% in Q1, as we saw sequential improvements in all of EMEA, JAPA and LACC. GNS plays an important role in strengthening our global network. I would remind you though that going forward as we previously discussed we do expect pressure on GNS volumes due to the changing regulatory environment specifically in the EU, Australia and China. Given the lower margins we are in GNS however, this will have a less bottom line impact.","Moving to international in total, you can see on Slide 6 that our billings growth rates remained strong. As we saw our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit in FX adjusted terms growth and overall international accelerated to 13% FX adjusted growth. The improvement in international is broad-based, with strength in both our corporate and consumer businesses. As we look at a few key markets for example we see continued strong FX adjusted growth in the UK up 17%, in Mexico of 15% and in Japan also up 15%.","Finally I would briefly note a couple of calendar impacts to growth rates in the quarter. As I mentioned at Investor Day, the leap day in February 2016 negatively impacts growth rates this quarter by about 1%. Offsetting that somewhat we did see a benefit in March is the Easter holiday mood from Q1 last year to Q2 this year. In many international markets there is an extended holiday around Easter, which impacts volumes. Stepping back we are encouraged by the momentum we see in the adjusted billings growth rate. The improvement is coming across our segments globally and reflects returns on the investments we have made over the last couple of years. We still have work to do. And the competitive environment especially in U.S. consumer remains intense, but we are focused on driving more volume onto our network from our wide range of growth opportunities.","Turning now to our worldwide lending performance on Slide 7, our total loans were up 12% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis, slightly below the growth rate we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. As we have for several years now, we continue to grow U.S. loans faster than the industry, driven primarily by our success in growing loans from existing customers.","During the first quarter, more than 50% of the growth in U.S. consumer loans came from existing customers, consistent with the trend we described at our Investor Day. As we look forward, we believe that we can continue to grow loans above the industry rate given our unique growth opportunities, while maintaining best in class credit performance.","Looking at the right hand side of the slide, you can see that net interest yield has been steadily expanding and rose again sequentially in Q1 to 10.3%. Yields typically widen in the first quarter due to seasonality. But the steady trend we are seeing is driven by the impact of a number of factors, including a shift in mix to non-cobrand customers, who are more likely to revolve, less revolving loans at introductory rates.","Some specific pricing actions, and of course a benefit from increases in bench mark interest rates without an offsetting change to our personal savings deposit rate. We do expect deposit rates will move up overtime, but we remains to be seeing when that change will occur and how much rates will increase.","Before turning to provision, let me touch on our credit metrics. Delinquency in last metrics across our lending in charge card portfolios continued to be very strong. And the worldwide loan portfolio, you can see that the delinquency rate was flat to Q4 and loss rates increased slightly both sequentially and year-over-year.","The modest increase and lending loss rates versus the prior year is in line with our expectations and consistent with our view, the loss rates would begin to increase due to the seasoning of the new accounts and the shift towards non-cobrand products, which have a slightly higher right of way rate, but also generate greater yield. And this quarter\u2019s lending results reflect that dynamic.","The combination of continued strong loan and receivable growth and modestly higher year-over-year loss rates, including in certain charge card segments, has caused our provision, as expected to grow well above the growth rate in loans as you can see on Slide 9. As we look forward to the balance of the year, we expect that provision will continue to grow faster than loans, a trend that is fully contemplated in our earnings expectations.","Turning to our revenue performance on Slide 10. FX adjusted revenues were down 2%, when we adjust for both FX and Costco related revenues to get at the underlying trend, revenue grew at 7%. I will say that adjusted revenue growth in the quarter outperformed our own internal expectation as in the month of March billings and revenue both came in above our plans.","We are pleased with the momentum in our adjusted revenue growth rate. And we are encouraged to begin the year bit above the full year range, we\u2019ve provided at Investor Day of 5% to 6% adjusted revenue growth.","Looking at the components of revenue in more detail. Discount revenue declined by 3%, but increased by 6% on an adjusted basis. The discount rate in the quarter was 2.45% up 1 basis point year-over-year, due to lower rate volumes coming of the network more than offsetting the impact from merchant negotiations mix and the continued rollout of OptBlue in the U.S.","Well the discount rate increased year-over-year, the ratio of discount revenue to build business declined by 4 basis points, which I welcome back to in just a minute. Net card fees grew by 7% in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in our premium U.S. portfolios including Platinum, Gold and Delta, as well as growth in key international markets like Japan and Australia.","The Platinum fee increases we announced in March are not yet impacting the results as the fee increase for existing customers does not go into effect until September. Other fees and commissions grew 5% in the quarter, while other revenue declined by 16%. Other revenue growth is impacted by the sale of a small business, which provided back office systems to run third party loyalty programs, during December 2016. Net interest income is down 5% due to lower average loans, but increased 15% on an adjusted basis driven by the 12% growth in adjusted loans in the higher net interest yield that I mentioned previously.","Coming back now to the ratio, discount revenue to build business on Slide 12. You can see that this ratio was down 4 basis points versus the prior year, while the reported discount rate was up one basis point. The decline in the ratio, discount revenue to billings this quarter is driven by a shift in billings mix towards GNS and higher incentive payments to cobrand and corporate card partners as the volumes in those categories accelerate.","Turning now to our total expenses on Slide 13. Our expenses were 1% higher than the prior year during the first quarter, though I\u2019d note that performance trends varied across the different expense lines. At Investor Day, we highlighted that are spending on card member engagement is reflected across marketing and promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses. And I\u2019ll discuss the changes in those P&L lines on the following slide.","Moving to operating expenses, total operating costs during the quarter were down 3% versus the prior year. I\u2019d remind you that in the prior year operating expenses were impacted by $127 million gain from the JetBlue portfolio sale and an $84 million restructuring charge. We continue to make progress on our cost reduction initiatives and believe that we are on track to remove $1 billion in the company\u2019s cost based on a run rate basis by the end of 2017.","As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect the year-over-year decline in operating expenses to be larger as we exit 2017 than what we saw in Q1. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.9%, which is below our full year 2017 expectation of 33% to 34%. The Q1 tax rate benefited from some discrete tax items, we continue to believe that our full year rate will be more in line with our 33% to 34% expectation.","Moving to the summary of our Card Member engagement spending on Slide 14, total engagement spending in Q1 was $2.8 billion or 4% higher than the prior year. Looking at the components of that spending as expected, M&P was down 4% versus the prior year. These results are consistent with our comments at Investor Day about anticipating a reduction in our M&P spending versus 2016 levels. We continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our marketing spend by using our scale to consistently drive cost savings from our ongoing marketing operations.","We also continue to shift our focus towards existing card members and increase our use of digital channels both of which can add efficiencies. With all these efforts, despite a lower level of marketing spend, we acquired more new cards during the first quarter than we did during Q4, including 1.7 million cards across our U.S. issuing businesses and 2.6 million on a worldwide basis.","Over 60% of the Global Consumer cards we acquired in the quarter came through digital channel. And digital is particularly important as you know, for acquiring new millennial card members. And going forward, we continue to anticipate that full year 2017 M&P will be lower than 2016 and more similar to the full year 2015 levels. I\u2019d note however, that the ultimate level of marketing expenses will be influenced by our financial performance and the opportunities present in the marketplace.","Moving to rewards, consistent with our Investor Day expectations, rewards expense was up 6% despite a small decline in proprietary billing volumes versus the prior year. Adjusting for the Costco cobrand volumes in the prior year, rewards expense would have increased in the quarter by 20%, while adjusted proprietary billings grew by 6%.","This growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost to proprietary billings of 87 basis points. The greater year-over-year increase in reward expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S. platinum products that we implemented at the beginning of Q4 2016, as well as continued strong growth our Delta co-brand portfolio.","Cost of card member services increased 14%, reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and co-brand benefits such as First Bag Free on Delta. As we highlighted in Investor Day, this is an area where we can offer differentiated benefits and we\u2019ll continue to invest as evidenced by the rollout of the new Uber benefits on our platinum cards a few weeks ago.","Turning now to Slide 15 and touching on capital. We continue to use our strong balance sheet position to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. Over the last nine quarters, we have returned a 101% of the capital we have generated. I think this shows the commitment we have over time to leveraging our business model and capital position steadily create shareholder value.","Now we of course just completed our submission for the 2017 CCAR process earlier this month. And as I\u2019m sure you all aware the process continues to revolve each year. We remain confident in the strength of our business model and our ability to drive shareholder value to capital returns. Now of course, we also use capital to support business building activities such as growth and our loan balances, potential M&A activity.","In addition to returning capital through dividends and share buybacks. I\u2019d also remind you that our capital plan for the upcoming year will be dependent upon the Fed review and we expect to hear back from them about our submission in June.","Step in back, over the past several years we have embarked on a serious of initiatives to reposition the company drive sustainable revenue growth. Those efforts which we covered in Investor Day, include, amongst others, focusing on further penetrating commercial payments by leveraging our small business and middle market assets on our global commercial segments, driving more organic growth through expanded engagement with existing customers, better leveraging our digital and big data capabilities for new customer acquisition and other targeting, growing our merchant network and pursuing lending expansion opportunities. These action for targeted to provide a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer-term.","While the impact from those efforts, we\u2019ll play out over time. We are encouraged with the trend that we have seen in our business metrics and revenue growth over the past several quarters and believe that these initiatives are driving real momentum. As we look out to the balance of the year, we believe that our outlook for the full year 2017 EPS to be between $5.60 and $5.80 remains appropriate. As we discussed at Investor Day we anticipate that EPS will grow through the year and as we have in the past, we will continue to balance delivering earnings to the bottom-line and investing for the moderate to long-term. We do believe that our 2017 plans appropriately balance shorter-term profitability with the steps we need to take to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the longer-term.","With that, let me turn it back over to Toby and we\u2019ll move to Q&A.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Gary?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks and good results. I guess I\u2019m just making sure that the EPS outperformance in the first quarter relative to what you articulate at the Analyst Day was really a result of revenue outperformance as you mentioned Jeff. And I guess when we think about the difference between the $5.60 versus the $5.80 in your range, is the difference how much you\u2019d spend on investments?","Jeff Campbell","Well. Couple comments Sanjay and thank you for the question. You are correct that relative to our expectations early in large at Investor Day. What surprised us frankly in the month of March was how strong the revenue performance came in. And so that is the main driver of why our EPS for the quarter ended up being a little bit stronger than I would have expected back in that first week of March.","On the margins I\u2019d also point out that we had a few tax discrete items, you\u2019re always working on various tax audit settlements and things like that, that are a little bit hard to time, and so those came in and out at a couple pennies as well, although over the course of the year that number is not particularly material. In terms of our guidance for the year, I guess I\u2019d come back to what I said in my earlier remarks. Sanjay we feel really good about the start we\u2019re off to, but, gosh, it\u2019s only one quarter and we have a lot of work to do as we go through the years.","Certainly we are encouraged by the revenue performance. And I would say based on the first quarter, I\u2019d certainly think it\u2019s much likelier that we will be at the higher end of the revenue range that I talked about in Investor Day which was for adjusted revenue growth to be at 5% to 6%. But we like a little bit more time pass before we convert that into what that might be for EPS. I would just include by saying we certainly feel very confident in the $5.60 to $5.80 EPS guidance range that we have reconfirmed again today.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Great. Thanks, Sanjay.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Just to follow-up on that on Sanjay\u2019s line of questioning. You\u2019ve in the past articulated in a various scenarios for revenue growth translating into a \u2013 to certain levels of earnings growth. And so given that you\u2019re now accelerating towards the high end of your range, which is really quite impressive, given the competitive environment. How do we conceptualize the relationship between revenue growth and operating leverage as it relates to the earnings outlook?","Jeff Campbell","Well. You are right Eric. That we have a pretty simple financial model we like to talk about, which all starts with taking advantage of the range of revenue growth opportunities we have and to the extent we can get good revenue growth, the fixed cost nature of our business allows us to get pretty steady operating expense leverage. And the fact that we\u2019re not overly capital intensive in our business allows us to use our capital strength to add a little bit more to EPS growth. It\u2019s pretty simple model, but it all starts with the revenue growth line.","You heard us talk a lot at Investor Day in early March about how focus we are in the objective of getting to a sustainable 6% revenue growth rate and when you look at the business model we have \u2013 we can achieve that, we certainly are then confident we can get to EPS growth of more than 10% steadily. What I would say, this is 1 quarter. We feel really good about the quarter end.","Certainly in 2017 I\u2019d remained you that when you think about prior year including a big game on a couple portfolio sales as well as happy year of earnings from that partnership that, we no longer have. Our EPS growth if you consider those things in 2017 is of course quite high way, way, way above the more than 10% level and that\u2019s because we are getting an unusual amount of operating expense leverage because of our efforts to take $1 billion out of cost structure. And because as we built into our guidance and as we\u2019re off to a good start on we have pretty good revenue growth in the projections we have for 2017. So what all that translates into 2018 and beyond we\u2019ll have to see, but I think we feel pretty positive about the start we\u2019re off to this year.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks very much.","Jeff Campbell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Please go ahead","Craig Maurer","Yes. Hi, thanks. Looking to ask a question on a less glamorous subject. Could you comment on where attrition has been running and how that\u2019s trended over the last 12 months? The new account growth is very impressive, and I just was hoping to balance it with the other side of the equation.","Jeff Campbell","Sure thanks for the question. As you have heard us talk about probably in multiple forms, when you look across our geographies and our customer segments, our attrition rates are modest and actually remarkably stable. They just don\u2019t move that much. I think it\u2019s certainly got a lot of attention when we talked about the fact for a few weeks last year in the U.S. consumer premium segment, when you look that Platinum cards you had a very modest uptick in attrition that quickly came back down. But all of these numbers for attrition across all of our businesses are in the low single digits on an annualized basis.","So we really haven\u2019t seen any change when I look across the different business and the different geographies Craig, in those numbers and to finish of the Platinum story while we saw that one little blip for few weeks, in fact we ended 2016 with more Platinum Card Members in the U.S than we\u2019ve ever had in more spending on the Platinum Card that we\u2019ve ever had in a year.","So we are always focused on providing great value to our customers we very much try to target our value propositions at customers who want to build long-term relationships with the company. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about. And right now we don\u2019t see any signs of any change in our ability to do that. So thank you for the question.","Craig Maurer","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you and now at line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash","Hi, good evening Jeff. I was wondering if I can ask a question on rewards. They were up 20% year-over-year I believe last quarter you talk about something closer to 13%. Is this really just a ramping up of the cost associated with the updated Platinum Card value proposition? Are you still expect to rewards to grow at that pace? Or given the changes that you made, are you now expecting them to grow faster? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","So couple things. It\u2019s a good question Ryan. We \u2013 if you go back probably a year you heard us first day at our Investor day in 2016 that when you just think acknowledge the reality of the competitive environment mostly in the U.S. consumer segment. We said at the time we expected to our rewards cost to grow a little faster than billings. In fact if you look at most of 2015 and 2016 they really weren\u2019t there were growing roughly in line with billings. But our expectation for some time has been that you would in select cases, see us change some value propositions.","In early October of last year, we did make some more significant value proposition changes in both the business and consumer platinum products in the U.S. We\u2019re pleased with the early results on both of those. But that step up is what drove our rewards costs up in Q4 of 2016, I\u2019d say you saw probably the full effect, because you probably in quite get the full effect in Q4. In this quarter and so you will continue to see that ballpark level of year-over-year increase until we\u2019re done lapping those changes as you get to the last quarter of 2017.","All that said, I would remind everyone, we feel good, as a general matter, about our value propositions today. And I think the mere fact that we had another really strong quarter of acquiring new Card Members is a demonstration that across the range of geographies and customer segments and products that we have, we think we have very competitive value propositions when you look at both what Doug Buckminster referred to in our Investor Day as the sort of real \u2013 a table stakes elements of the product, which are about rewards and pricing as well as the experiential value that we work very hard to uniquely offer given the range of unique strengths we have.","So I would expect to see, in some, the rewards cost continue to grow for the next couple of quarters. It is mostly Platinum, although there\u2019s also some really nice growth we\u2019re seeing in a few of our cobrand relationships like Delta that also pushed the number up a little bit. But it\u2019s mostly Platinum, and we should be done lapping it as we get to the end of the year.","Operator","Thank you and now to the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Jamie Friedman","Hi, thanks, Jeff. I just want to ask you it\u2019s on slide 16 of the appendix. If you don\u2019t have it in front of you, I don\u2019t want to disorient you. But the question is the spending per Card Member did decline to $3,297 this quarter. And I was just wondering if you could just give us some context. In fairness, when you look at it, it does look seasonal. But any context that you can give \u2013 if you don\u2019t have that in front of you, that\u2019s fine. But is that $3,297, is that a good or bad number? Should that be going up or down? The context of that will be helpful. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m paging through, James, to be exact with the numbers. But I guess, I\u2019d make a few comments. First off, remember, when you look at average spend year-over-year, the sale of the Costco cobrand has caused some dislocations attempt to on a year-over-year basis actually go in the other direction. Because the average spend per card was a little lower. When you look sequentially in \u2013 Toby just handed me this.","Toby Willard","Yes, so if you look \u2013 now I don\u2019t have the page in front of me. So you see that when you look year-over-year at the 7% increase. When you go sequentially by quarter, you are correct that in Q4, most of us, and I put myself in this camp, tend to spend a little bit more in Q4 given the holiday season than you do in other times of the year. So I don\u2019t particularly see anything in the sequential change that should be particularly meaningful. I think the more significant thing is to look at the year-over-year change where you\u2019re taking the seasonality out. You do see it up a little bit, although, as I said, that is aided somewhat by the shift in the mix of cards because of the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio.","Jamie Friedman","Got it. Thanks for the help.","Jeff Campbell","Thank you Jamie","Operator","Thank you and now to line of Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Don Fandetti","Yes Jeff I wanted to just shift gears to cobrands, briefly. I think you have the Hilton deal that might be coming up. Can you talk about when that renews and size it and also how you view sort of an airline hotel deal versus the retail deal?","Jeff Campbell","Well I think Don as I\u2019m sure you expect me to say, we really value all of our cobrand partners, and I would put Hilton in that category. And you didn\u2019t ask, but it\u2019s probably on your mind. I would put SPG in that category, and we work really hard everyday to create value for our card members, for our partners and for our shareholders.","Beyond that, I can\u2019t comment on specific contract terms for what might be the ultimate outcome of Marriott as they think about what to do with the 2 cobrands that are now offered to both Marriott Rewards and SPG Card Members or what Hilton might choose to do as it thinks about its current 2 cobrand partners. What I would say is that to the distinction you made, we do think that there are certain types of cobrand partners who are interested in building value, and business together.","Cobrand partners who are focused on some of the travel and entertainment oriented strings that we have I would remind you that we run a big consumer travel agency and we have a joint venture to run a big business travel agency and we have a long, long, long, long way to see of being very strong in attracting a customer base that is very travel oriented.","And so we do think that allows us to bring some unique strengths to travel oriented cobrand, that\u2019s quite frankly, probably are at there in certain retail cobrands or often a retailer as we talked about on and off over the last couple of years. And often, the retailer is really after, in many ways, a payment vehicle that will allow their customers to do some level of borrowing.","And while, as you know, one of our strategic initiatives is trying to capture more of our own customer borrowing behaviours as a general matter, we remain a Spend-Centric oriented company and we\u2019re less likely to be real focused on a real competitive on products where the economics are really driven 100% by lending.","So we\u2019ll have to see where things like Marriott and Hilton goal going forward, but we\u2019re focused everyday and providing value to those partners.","Don Fandetti","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Good afternoon. So Jeff 7% growth \u2013 revenue growth in the quarter and March was the strongest and you had the leap year FX. So I guess that would suggest that there\u2019s a possibility that you could have some accelerating \u2013 an acceleration in revenue growth. And I know you\u2019re reiterating 5% to 6% and really to 1 quarter. But looking at the trend it seems like you might be able to go above the high end of that range.","And then partly affecting that it\u2019s kind of I mean I\u2019ve covered this company a long time the international business seems to have more momentum than I\u2019ve \u2013 I can remember. The spend growth accelerating each of the last three quarters. Is that helping to drive that acceleration or why is international? I mean you\u2019re still just scratching the surface of the potential. Why is international? Is it just more investment there? So sorry, it\u2019s kind of two questions but related.","Jeff Campbell","Well. Thanks for the question Bob. Certainly we are encouraged as I said by the momentum we see across our billings growth, our loan growth and our revenue growth. It is early in the year right and I guess I make just a few balancing comment. Yes, March given stronger than we expected in certainly revenue growth even stronger than we expected. We do a little bit of rounding I will point out to simplify in the slide if you go calculate the precise number, you will see that our Q4 revenue growth rate on an adjusted basis was about 6.4% and in Q1 was 6.6%. So it does around 6% to 7%, but you have to put it into a little perspective. Leap day certainly hurt us in Q1.","I will say outside the U.S. and particularly in our business segment Easter going to April probably helped us a little bit and then yes, we feel really good about the momentum we had built over international. So you will see some modest win, so as you get later end of the year first regulatory reasons they talk is going to impact the network business. I\u2019ll have a bigger billings impact in revenue or profit impact. We\u2019d some small revenue impact.","So we\u2019re driving management team on getting to is much revenue growth as we can get to. We are really pleased with the start we\u2019re off to. As I did say earlier it does certainly maybe we should be at the higher end of that 5% to 6% range when I talked about yesterday for the year per adjusted revenue growth. I just think we\u2019d like to see a little bit more time pass and a little bit more performance before we move beyond that number. So thank you for the comments.","Bob Napoli","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of David Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Ho","I appreciate the comments on March. Just curious there\u2019s been a lot of debate on the disconnect between the rising consumer confidence in the U.S. and not translating to overall kind of consumer spend they obviously you\u2019re seeing in certain areas. Your T&E billings for the U.S. are still down year-over-year, but certainly trends are looking better. How much you think upside do you believe based on your new rewards propositions in some of these service-oriented categories travel and entertainment, would you capture kind of in the next cycle if it were to play out. Obviously it\u2019s not really in your numbers and your guidance so far.","Jeff Campbell","Yes. Well, there\u2019s probably a couple questions there David. The first thing I\u2019d say is that through March 31 as we look at our result it\u2019s hard for us to see anything that suggestive of a material uptick in consumer confidence or consumer or commercial spending. Well, we have been gaining momentum as we look at the many different areas gaining momentum. We can see a change that we have made and how we\u2019re running the business and what value propositions we\u2019re offering, et cetera, that seems to be what is driving the change as opposed to us getting the benefit of just in generally stronger economic environment.","So certainly we are as hopeful as anyone that there in fact is stronger economic growth to come in the future. I just can\u2019t say I\u2019d see any evidence of it right now in our results. And so your comment on T&E certainly one aspect of the changes we\u2019ve announced in the U.S. to our platinum products is to position them both for the consumer and small business segment as being the go to products for the premium travel oriented card member. And we do think that positions us even better than we already are for positions us to be in a good spot to benefit from any increase in consumer spending or commercial spending in those areas.","As I say that I would remind you that I think we still consider in going to that latest round of changes as a very, very strong player in the T&E segment. And I think that is the Company\u2019s heritage it remains a tremendous strength of the company. Certainly we have brought in our offerings tremendously over the last couple of decades, but that T&E strength we do think continues and the latest moves we made are just the latest step in ensuring that we don\u2019t lose that positioning. So we\u2019ll have to see. I certainly hope that we see an uptick in spending I just can\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen it. Yes, so thank you David for the question.","Jeff Campbell","Think you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And now to line of Rick Shane from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Rick Shane","Thanks for taking my question Jeff. Just curious I mean it\u2019s been observed to strengthen the international business you talked about the decline. You\u2019ve pointed to some anomalies related to the tax rate. I am curious if one of the things that we\u2019re seeing here is the greater contribution from your international businesses on the tax rate and given potential tax reform something everybody should be thinking about.","Jeff Campbell","What \u2013 you are correct if you just think about the U.S. with the co-brand portfolio sales and really steady nice growth in international. You are correct that we\u2019re generating a little bit more of our earnings outside the U.S. and that does have a positive impact on our tax run rate. And that\u2019s actually why even for the year before any of the discrete items that came in this quarter we gave slightly lower guidance for the tax run rate than what you\u2019ve seen in the prior year results.","Tax reform \u2013 we\u2019ll have to see, as you\u2019ve heard us say in other forms due to the nature of our business we have a pretty darn high effective tax rate and if you dig through the details of our financial statements, you will realize we pretty much pay that full tax rate in cash to the U.S. So we are a very, very significant tax payer. So any lowering of corporate rates in the U.S. we are likely to be a significant winner on because we\u2019re not a particular beneficiary of any of the very and many things that help other organizations back to pay lower rates. So we\u2019ll have to see, certainly we\u2019re not running the company counting on any changes in the tax area, but it would be a great thing if it were to happen.","Rick Shane","Hey, Jeff and just a follow up on that, given that you talk about the tax rate coming back up a little bit through the remainder of the year not to read too much into the first quarter tax rate. Does that suggest that you think that the business mix is going to shift a little bit? Is there an implication there that we should be considering.","Jeff Campbell","It\u2019s really just a math, Rick, if you take the size of the settlements that drove the discrete items in Q1. In a single quarter they were an up to drag your tax rate out of our 33% to 34% range. If you take \u2013 if we don\u2019t have other settlements, which I generally don\u2019t build them into my forward-looking comments because they\u2019re harder to forecast.","Over the course of a full year, they are quite enough to pull you out of your range. They certainly would \u2013 what I would expect will pull us to the lower end of that range, but not necessarily \u2013there\u2019s no differential assumption I\u2019m making about mix.","Rick Shane","Great, thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Thank you. And out of line of Arren Cyganovich from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks. I was surprised at the strength of the net interest yield. You mentioned that there are some seasonal benefit in the first quarter, just curious is, if you think that current mix shift that you\u2019re getting also is the benefit will continue in maybe just your thoughts on the future trajectory of that net interest yield for the card loan business.","Jeff Campbell","Well, you\u2019re correct, Arren. There is a seasonal element. But as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s really quite a number of other factors that have helped us steadily drive the net interest yield up including some pricing actions we\u2019ve taken, including the fact that with the funding mix we have right now personal \u2013 the personal savings rates we have on our deposits haven\u2019t really moved.","So in fact, the Fed interest rates increases so far have been in a positive for the company. Including the mix of customers moving to one where there\u2019s a little bit more revolve, which of course helps the yield. And then we also and this is a benefit that will a bit over time. You\u2019re helped a little bit right now, because we had in our efforts to win back cobrand card members over the last year or two. We had a number of people who were on introductory or promotional offers you were flipping into paying regular rates now. And that\u2019s helping with the rate up a little bit right now.","So a lot of factors there. The seasonality base a little bit and the one time impact from winning back some of the cobrand card members will save it bit over time. But all the other things, we think will hold and we think this continues more broadly to be an area, where there is a long, long runway for steady growth in net interest income, right.","And where we\u2019ve been growing our loans by having over 50% of the increase come from existing customers or those are people we know we understand the risk profile is further cementing the broad customer relationship we have with them. So we feel really good about what we\u2019re doing here.","Arren Cyganovich","Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Okay, we\u2019ll take one more question, thanks.","Operator","All right. And that comes from the line of Jason Harbes from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jason Harbes","Hey guys, thank you for squeezing me on here. So most of my questions were asked and answered already. But I did just want to follow up on a comment you made Jeff about some of the initiatives you\u2019re taking to attract millennials on a platform. Perhaps you can elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re doing within the context of a reason New York Times article on a topic.","Jeff Campbell","Well. Jason I appreciate the question. I think first off, it\u2019s important to maybe that\u2019ll set a little bit of the facts. So if you look at last year in our global consumer business \u2013 get to B2B in a minute, but in our global consumer business over 55% new customers brought in [indiscernible] And in fact that number was up about 16% at versus the prior year. If you look at the rolling of applications and new card members who are coming to mobile channels as you would expect. Almost half of those new applicants and card are millennials.","If you look at the things we do as a company in the digital sphere, we talk a lot about how the unique nature of our closed loop network allows us to be particularly adept at working with company in the social media, digital and payments field. We really feel like we have been at the forefront of how you bring those three worlds of digital, social media and payments together. In the partnerships, we\u2019ve done with Airbnb with Twitter with Facebook \u2013 with Facebook to have an annex spot. When you look at our pay with points program, which is broader than anyone else\u2019s in the industry, it is disproportionately used by our millennial customers.","So we feel really good about our track record of attracting millennials to the franchise. We feel really good about the range of things we do using our unique assets to appeal to millennials. The last thing I\u2019d say though, whether you\u2019re a millennial or a baby boomer or in any cohort. We are however about building long-term customer relationships. And we build products, we build value propositions, we build service experiences that are trying to attract and retain people who are about long-term relationship, not necessarily people who are looking for the latest great thing and they\u2019re going to swap out of it six months.","So, look you can never do enough in this area, so we\u2019re focused every day I\u2019m trying to do better. But I think our track record with millennial strong. And I think our ability to leverage our unique assets is strong. So I appreciate the question, but we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re doing so.","Toby Willard","All right. Great.

Welcome to the American Express Q4 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that the instructions for entering the queue have changed. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Rosie Perez. Please go ahead.","Rosie Perez","Thank you, Liya, and thank you all for joining today's call.","As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the Company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.","We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the Company's progress and results. And then, Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our performance. After that, we'll move to Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff.","With that, let me turn it over to Steve.","Steve Squeri","Thanks, Rosie. Good morning.","I\u2019m pleased to report that our 2019 fourth quarter and full-year results continued the steady consistent performance that we've delivered over the past two years. Our strong top-line growth continued with revenues growing 9% in the quarter. This marks our 10th straight quarter of FX-adjusted revenue growth at or above 8%. Once again, our revenue growth was broad-based, driven by well-balanced mix of fees, spend and lend. We added 11.5 million new proprietary cards in 2019, delivered solid billings growth, and continue to grow loans while maintaining industry-leading credit metrics.","These results show that our strategy of investing in share, scale and relevance is working. This strategy is the heart of our financial model and it gives us confidence that in today's economic environment, we can sustain high levels of revenue growth, which is the foundation for steady double-digit earnings growth.","My confidence in our ability to generate consistent solid results over the longer term is based on several factors. The fundamental strengths we derive from our differentiated business model, the significant growth opportunities we see across our business, and our demonstrated success in executing our investment strategy against the four strategic imperatives I laid out two years ago.","Let me take a few minutes to share some of the highlights of the progress we made on each of these strategic imperatives in 2019. We expanded our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing our disciplined strategic approach of refreshing our premium charge products and upgrading our co-brand portfolios globally.","In all these cases, we've added features that our card members value. Acquisitions remain strong and approximately 70% of our new card members are choosing fee-based products, which help to drive 17% growth in subscription-like fee revenues for the year.","Our new card members are skewing younger and are more digitally engaged. Our refreshed products are also enabling us to reengage with our existing customer base, where we are seeing increased organic spend, all-time high net promoter scores and steady retention.","In our commercial business, we've taken our successful approach to strategic product refreshes and applied it to our business card portfolio in the U.S. and select markets around the world. In addition to the refreshes, we've expanded our commercial card offerings with the introduction of several new products for business customers of all sizes. And to deepen our relationships with our business customers, we continued our focus on growing our non-card product offerings, by expanding our AP automation solutions, as well as offering a variety of lending and flexible payment programs to help our business customers manage cash flow and grow their businesses.","In total, over the past two years, we've refreshed and launched over 50 proprietary products across both our commercial and consumer businesses around the world, resulting in greater customer engagement and strong new card acquisitions which are driving our revenue growth.","Turning to the network business. In 2016, we set an ambitious goal of achieving virtual parity coverage in the United States by the end of 2019. Setting this goal was a recognition of the fundamental importance that our merchant network plays in driving growth across our businesses and to galvanize our organization\u2019s focus on achieving it.","I'm very pleased to report that as of year-end 2019, based on our internal tracking and our understanding of the latest industry data, we have achieved virtual parity coverage with approximately 99% of credit card accepting merchants in the U.S. now able to accept the American Express card.","Of course, we recognize that virtual parity coverage will always be a moving target. The merchant landscape is dynamic with hundreds of thousands of U.S. businesses opening and closing every year. Therefore, we will continue to focus on maintaining virtual parity coverage in the U.S. in 2020 and beyond. We're also making good progress to increase coverage across our international markets, where our card members live, work and travel to the most. And this will continue to be a focus for us.","Going forward, as we continue to grow our network, we\u2019ll work with our merchant partners in the U.S. and around the world to ensure that our card members are warmly welcomed and encourage to spend in a millions of places where their Amex cards are accepted. Finally, I'm also pleased to report that the People's Bank of China officially accepted our network application, an important next step in our plan to build the network business in China.","On a digital front, we've been hard at work, integrating acquisitions we've made over the last few years into our mobile app to provide our card members with premium access and experiences across a wide range of travel, dining and lifestyle services that differentiate us from our competitors. We are also working with our partners and our internal development teams to deliver a wide range of new online and mobile features, capabilities and services to help our customers manage their life and their business, efficiently and securely.","Our goal in these initiatives is to deepen the digital ties we have with our customers, so the American Express becomes an indispensable part of their lives. And we're seeing good results as customer engagement with our digital channels is strong and growing. Today, 81% of our active card members are digitally engaged with us via our app and the website, and we\u2019ve seen a 26% increase year-over-year in the customers who use our mobile app daily.","Those are just some of the highlights of our accomplishments in 2019. As I\u2019ve reported each quarter for the past two years, the progress we've made in each of these areas is driving our performance and shows that our financial model and investment strategy has generated sustainable growth. That's why we\u2019ll continue the strategic approach and why we are confident that we have a long runway for steady growth over the long term.","With that in mind, we expect to deliver revenue growth in 2020 of 8% to 10% on an FX-adjusted basis and earnings of $8.85 to $9.25. Looking ahead, our business is strong and our focus is clear. We have incredibly talented team at all levels and strong relationships with a wide array of outstanding business partners from our co-brand and digital partners to our millions of merchant partners around the globe, all working together to deliver the best products and services for our customers.","I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2020 and beyond, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here today to talk about the fourth quarter and what was a solid year for American Express and to layout our expectations for 2020.","I\u2019ll discuss both our quarterly and full year results this morning, since it is our year-end call, and since looking at our performance on an annual basis is both more in line with how we actually manage the business and also gives us a better sense of the underlying trends.","Turning to our summary financials on slide three. Fourth quarter revenues of $11.4 billion grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis and full-year revenues of $43.6 billion, also grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth as it has been all year continues to be driven by a well-balanced mix of growth in fee, spend and lend revenues and was consistent with the high levels of revenue growth we\u2019ve delivered for over two years. This strong topline performance drove net income of $6.8 billion for the full year and $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter.","In understanding our year-over-year results, we do need to spend a minute on some discrete impacts in our reported results this year and last year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2018 contained $0.58 of positive adjustments for discrete tax items related to the Tax Act of 2017 and certain tax audits. In addition, as you remember, in the first quarter of this year, we had a $0.21 charge from the resolution of certain merchant litigation. If you adjust for these two impacts as we have done on slide three, full-year 2019 adjusted EPS was $8.20, up $0.12 versus the prior year adjusted EPS of $7.33, including the $2.03 of EPS in the fourth quarter, which was up 17% versus the prior year.","Turning now to the details of our performance, I'll start with billed business, which you see several views of on slides four through six. Starting on slide four, total FX-adjusted billed business growth was up 6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We do think it is important to continue to break out the business growth between our proprietary and network businesses due to the differing trends as we continue to see the impact of exiting our network business in Europe and Australia due to regulatory change.","The 13% of our overall billings that comes from our network business, GNS, was down 1% in the fourth quarter and down 2% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis, as a result of the market exit. We do expect to fully lap the billings impact from these exits in the latter part of 2020 and return to positive levels of growth. Our proprietary business, which makes up 87% of total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 7% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis.","Turning to slide five. As we have said throughout 2019, the proprietary billed business growth trends are consistent with the economic environment. Solid growth, but slower than the very robust growth we saw in 2018.","You see this as you turn to slide six to look at the billings by customer type for the fourth quarter. Starting with U.S. consumer, which made up 33% of the Company's billings in the fourth quarter and remains our largest customer segment. Billings were up 7%, in line with the 7% to 8% growth we have seen all year. This growth reflects continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers. These trends also highlight the relative strength of the consumer in the U.S. Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the double digits at 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, despite the mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.","In the fourth quarter, we saw growth moderate in Mexico and the UK sequentially, driven by external factors. The growth in the UK did remain in the mid-teens. And we continue to see strong growth in the mid-teens in our top markets across the European Union, as well as in Japan.","Spending from our U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs, grew a solid 6% in the fourth quarter, in line with the third quarter. We continue to feel good about the steady acquisition results we're seeing in our U.S. SME customers and importantly as we think about 2020. We saw stabilization in this key customer segment in Q4.","International SME remains our highest growing customer type, with 15% FX-adjusted billings growth in the fourth quarter. We feel great about the strong growth we saw throughout 2019 coming off of even higher levels of growth in 2018. Given our focus on this segment and the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products, we continue to believe we have a long runway to sustain strong growth going forward.","And then for the relatively small part of our volumes, 9% this quarter, that come from large and global corporate card billings, we saw a decline of 1% on the fourth quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, similar to what we saw last quarter. As we\u2019ve said for years now, this is not a growth segment for us but is an important part of our merchant value development. Finally, on the far right, global network services was down 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven the market exits that I mentioned earlier. And if you were to adjust for those impacts, the remaining portion of GNS was up 3% on an FX-adjusted basis, in line with Q3.","Overall, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate.","Turning now to loan performance on slide seven. Total loan growth was 8% in the fourth quarter with about 60% of our growth for the year coming from our existing customers. We continue to focus on taking advantage of the unique opportunity we have to deepen our share of our existing customers borrowing. At the same time, as we\u2019ve been saying all year, we have increased our investments in premium products and that shift in portfolio mix coupled with some steady tightening we have done on the risk management side over the past couple of years has led to lower loan growth.","The shift towards more premium products has also led to lower loan balances on promotional offers, which along with continued positive impacts from pricing for risk contributed to the 50 basis-point year-over-year increase in net interest yield in the fourth quarter, if you see on the right-hand side of slide seven. So, the combination of loan growth and yield increases drove the 12% growth in net interest income that we delivered this quarter. Ultimately, we are focused on driving profitable revenue growth as the financial outcome of our lending strategy. And so, we are pleased with the stability in net interest income growth that we saw in 2019.","Turning next to the credit metrics on slide eight, if you were to take an average for the year to smooth out the quarterly volatility, lending write-off rates were up 22 basis points and charge rates were up 14 basis points on average for the full year. This level of modest write-off rate increases in BAU environment is consistent with the expectations we have talked about for several years now. And as you can see on the bottom of the slide, delinquency rates have been relatively stable all year and the GCP loss ratio continued to actually be down year-over-year.","These trends reflect both, the credit implications of our strategy as well as the relatively stable economy and low unemployment rate. We continue to expect modest increases in our loss rates in 2020, consistent with the trends we've now seen for several years. Importantly, we still do not see anything in our portfolios that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment, both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these portfolios performed much better in 2019 than we expected at the beginning of the year.","This brings us to provision expense, which grew 7% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. The business decisions we made to shift more towards premium products along with tightening things a bit on the risk management side, both contributed to the loan growth, credit metrics and provision trends we saw in 2019.","Moving forward, while there may be some variability in the monthly turns, we expect relatively steady loan growth in 2020. And as I mentioned a few moments ago from of credit perspective, we expect the kind of modest increases in loss rates year-over-year that we\u2019ve been seeing to continue. As a result of these dynamics, we do expect higher provision expense growth in 2020 than we saw in 2019.","While we\u2019re on this subject of provision, yes, let me touch on CECL. As you know, the CECL accounting changes went into effect on January 1, 2020 for us as well as the rest of the industry. In our first quarter results, we\u2019ll report the implementation or day-one impact, which we estimate will increase credit reserves by about $1.2 billion. The increase will run net of tax through equity with no impact to earnings. I would remind you that a unique aspect of American Express is our charge card portfolio. So, although our card and other lending reserves will go up by approximately $1.7 billion, we will have an offset from the approximately $0.5 billion decrease in charge reserves, given the short life of those receivables.","Now, as a reminder, this increase will not have a material impact on our capital ratios or our ability to return capital to shareholders, given our 30% plus return on equity in the multi-year phase-in period for regulatory capital purposes.","Then, we get to the ongoing or as some would say, the day-two impact of accounting for CECL in our ongoing provision expense starting in the first quarter of 2020. Under our current outlook, we expect a relatively modest increase to our annual 2020 provision expense from the implementation of CECL. More significantly, I too expect that there will be more quarter-to-quarter volatility under CECL, compared to the previous methodology, though some of this volatility should net out over the course of the year, making our longstanding focus on annual results rather than quarterly results, even more pronounced in 2020.","Now, let's get back to our results and turn to revenues on slide 10. FX-adjusted revenue growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. The focused execution of our strategy has delivered strong top-line revenue growth of 8% or more for the last 10 quarters on an FX-adjusted basis. This consistent revenue performance has occurred in both, the robust economic environment of 2018 and the somewhat slower growth environment of 2019 and continues to be supported by a well-balanced mix of growth in fees, spend and lend revenues, as you see on slide 11.","Net card fees remained the fastest growing revenue lineup, 17% for the full year and accelerating to 20% in the fourth quarter. We are really pleased by the confidence that our customers placed in our value propositions when they choose to pay the subscription-like fees. And we continue to see that the majority of our new card members, around 70%, are choosing our fee-based products as well. Supported by the continued execution of our product refreshment strategy and our focus on premium value proposition, we expect card fee revenues will remain the fastest-growing revenue line in 2020. We are confident in our ability to maintain strong card fee growth, given the breadth of products that are driving this momentum across geographies and customer segments, as well as the high levels of engagement we see with new and existing card members.","These high levels of engagement supported by the progress we've made around coverage, continue to drive steady growth in our largest and most important revenue line, discount revenue, which was up 6% for the full year and in the fourth quarter, broadly in line with billings. And net interest income grew at 12% for the full-year and in the fourth quarter, driven by the growth in loans and net yield that I mentioned a few moments ago.","Looking ahead, I expect net interest income growth to continue to be a bit higher than loan growth, driven by continued benefits from pricing mix as well as the modest tailwind from 2019 rate cuts. Importantly, the portion of our revenue coming from fee and spend revenues remained at 80% for the full year and the fourth quarter, in line with history, and we expect that revenue composition to continue given our differentiated spend and fee-centric model.","Moving on to expenses. On slide 13, overall expenses grew 9% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. There are three important items though impacting the quarter here that more or less offset, but are important to understand. First, there were a few positive income tax and other tax related developments in the quarter that show up in the low effective tax rate, as well as in the operating expense line. We then, as we often do, took the opportunity to reinvest the upside we saw relative to our original plans to do two important things for the long-term health of the business. First, we accelerated the funding of some incremental business growth initiatives, similar to what we did in last year's fourth quarter. And second, we accelerated some of the things we are doing to evolve our organizations for the future and improve operating efficiencies. And as a result, we took a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, which is included in the salary and benefits line in the tables that accompany our earnings release. As I mentioned before, the impact of these three items roughly offset one another. And you see the impacts across OpEx, marketing and business development, and the lower effective tax rates at the bottom of the page. ","Looking at the full year, our OpEx growth of 8% was also impacted by the litigation-related charge we took in the first quarter of 2019 that I mentioned earlier in my remarks. And as I\u2019ve said previously, some of the investments we are making to deliver continued strong revenue growth, growth in sales force, growth in premium servicing and enhancements in digital capabilities caused us in 2019 to see more growth in operating expenses than we have seen in recent years, or importantly than we expect to see going forward.","We have a long track record of generating operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues. Going forward, we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to do so.","Turning now to slide 14 to look at the trend in customer engagement expenses. Overall, customer engagement expenses for the full year grew 10% as a result of our investment strategy. Starting at the bottom, marketing and business development costs were up 10% for the full year, due to our continued focus on funding growth initiatives and in part the incremental impact of the 11-year extension of our longstanding partnership with Delta that we signed earlier this year. Moving on to rewards expense, you can see that it grew 8% and was broadly in line with proprietary billed business growth for the full year. And as we continue to evolve our value propositions and see high engagement with our premium benefits, card member services grew 25% for the full year. While there were some adjustments that caused slower growth in card member services in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category, as it includes the cost of many components of our differentiated value propositions, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based products. Going forward, we continue to expect total customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues as we continue to invest in share, scale and relevance.","Turning to capital on slide 15. We ended the year with a CET1 of 10.7%, near the top of our 10% to 11% target range. During the year, we increased our dividend by 10% and returned $6 billion of capital to our shareholders. This outcome is a testament to the 30%-plus return on equity that our financial model generates, as well as our focus on maintaining capital strength while consistently returning excess capital to our shareholders. As we\u2019ve said, our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the governor of our capital distribution plans, and we do not believe that CECL will have a material impact on those plans.","To sum up, we feel really good about our steady and consistent performance throughout 2019. Looking ahead, we see a long runway to sustain high levels of revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth in today's economic environment. That brings me for our outlook for 2020. And then, we'll open the call for your questions.","Our guidance for 2020 is consistent with our financial growth algorithm. As Steve mentioned at the start of our call, we are introducing our 2020 earnings per share guidance at a range of $8.85 to $9.25. Our guidance does assume an economy that looks somewhat similar to 2019 and reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. Consistent with the performance we've been delivering for over two years, this guidance includes revenue growth of 8% to 10% on an FX-adjusted basis. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect a more modest headwind from FX in our reported growth than we saw in 2019. And as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest to drive those high levels of revenue growth. And so, we expect customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues, again in 2020. And we are committed to generating operating expense leverage by growing our 2020 OpEx at a slower pace than revenues and slower than the pace we saw in 2019.","Looking at the drivers of our financial results, there are a few other key planning assumptions I'd highlight. As I mentioned earlier, we expect provision growth to be higher in 2020 than it was in 2019, including a relatively modest increase from CECL. We do expect CECL to drive more volatility quarter-to-quarter. And so, focusing on the full year results will be even more critical in 2020. In addition, we expect that our effective tax rate will be around 21% next year.","In summary, we remain focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth and in today's environment, double-digit EPS growth. As I look at our performance over the past two years and our expectations for 2020, they clearly demonstrate consistent execution against our strategy, as well as our financial growth algorithm.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rosie.","Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thanks for your cooperation. And with that, operator, we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Don Fandetti","Good to see the solid guide for \u201820. Jeff, I wanted to confirm, does the EPS guidance include the negative impact of CECL?","Jeff Campbell","Yes, absolutely. So, when you think about the range we provided this year, Don, I would say, the normal thing of -- you have to think about a little stronger economy pushes us towards the higher end of the weaker economy which is why a lower end of range is there, and CECL is the other uncertainty. But absolutely, we are contemplating what I call the relatively modest impact of CECL in there. So, you should go with that as full GAAP guidance.","Don Fandetti","And are you -- in your guidance, I mean, I assume we are sort of at the kind of trough of billed business here as you\u2019re lapping some tougher comps. Do you have an acceleration built in? And could you talk about the discount rate, [LDR] [ph] knowing that you are sort of willing to scale that up and down?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think what I would actually point you to is the remarks Steve started with. We had 10 straight quarters now, Don, of revenue growth, which is ultimately what we're focused on, in the 8% to 10% range. And the fourth quarter was another strong quarter of revenue growth. So, actually, when we look at that metric, which ultimately is the end goal of the mixture of everything we're doing with card fees, with pricing, loan growth, the billings, the discount rate, we actually see a lot of stability in the momentum that we\u2019re entering in terms of revenue growth.","Steve Squeri","Yes. I think, the other point is that if you look over these 10 quarters, we've shown that there is an elasticity to our billed business that still continues to drive the high revenue growth. And so, given the high card fees, higher growth in card fees, the consistent performance we\u2019ve had from a net interest income perspective, billings can fluctuate up and down. The other thing I would point out is not all billings are created equally. So, we feel really comfortable with where we wound up and how we ended the year from a billings perspective.","Operator","Next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Yes. Thanks. Steve, I have a question for you just on what inning you guys are in, in this kind of product launch and refresh cycle. And I'm assuming given you've done 50 already, but it's pretty late innings. And the reason I'm asking is, as you pointed out, it's been a big contributor to adding new customers, reengaging with existing ones, and presumably been really helpful in generating that strong revenue growth. And if we are in kind of later innings, what are you looking to as kind of the levers to continue to sustain that revenue growth?","Steve Squeri","Yes. The interesting thing is, I wouldn't equate this to innings. I would equate this to baseball seasons, because the way you got to think about this is that, product refreshes can happen on a three to four-year basis. And so, we got to play a season all over again. And so, if you look at 50 refreshes over the last two years, there are still more to do within the existing portfolio. And by the time you get done, guess what? Some of your products are three and four years old now. So, I wouldn't think about this as a one-time thing. And I think, you have to think about this as continuous refreshment, because look, the reality is our customer base constantly changes. We're looking to appeal to new customers at all aspect. If you look at Platinum before we did the refresh, Platinum was not as attractive to millennials as is today. And if you look at the value and the benefits that we put on it, it\u2019s become a much more attractive product and most of our growth has come from millennial update. Look, we have -- since the refresh, we have 60% more Platinum cards than we did prior to that refresh, and over 50% of the new cards acquired to millennials. So, I wouldn\u2019t think about this as an innings game. I think about this as we constantly play the baseball season. And there is going to be another season and another season and another season. It's just going to be different. It's just going to be different card products. And when you look at our portfolio of card products, it's in hundreds. So, we have a ways to go.","Operator","Next, we go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the network opportunities outside the U.S. I know you mentioned, Steve, that you\u2019ve essentially achieved parity in the U.S. now. And maybe you could give us a sense, because I know that was a three-year outlook that you gave I think last year. And where are we there? And should we expect acceleration? Thanks.","Steve Squeri","Yes. So, look, from an outside the U.S. perspective, obviously we\u2019re nowhere near where we are in the U.S. We identify the strategy that we wanted to increase overall coverage internationally by 20% over a three-year period. We talked about that at investor day. I say without giving specific metrics on this, we\u2019ve made progress. We expect to hit that 20% growth target over that three-year period. It's a very focused strategy and that we\u2019re looking at key cities, we\u2019re looking at the key cities that our card members travel to and that we have large card bases in. And we\u2019re also working with our network partners in markets that we do not have proprietary businesses to continue to grow that. And let's not forget our efforts in China.","We are -- our license has been accepted, we are waiting for the final approval, and hopefully sometime this year, we will launch the network. And that will increase not only coverage in China, but what it will do is it will put more cards on the network as we engage with the Chinese banks to have more Chinese travelers as they go into -- and the reality is, they are going to go into a lot our European and Asian cities, which is going to put more demand and will actually then help drive more coverage.","So, we're still committed to it and we continue to invest in it. And the other point I would make out is the U.S. is not done. From a U.S. perspective, as I said in my remarks, it is a moving feast. And so, what we need to do is to continue to sign those merchants that commence the business. And what we also need to do is to continue our efforts to have warm acceptance. And from a warm acceptance perspective, what we mean is decals on the doors. We put up over 1 million decals this year, just in the United States alone. And it\u2019s an education process as well, it's an education process for the merchants, and it's an education process for our card members that in fact the card is accepted. So, what we\u2019ve laid what we would call technical acceptance, there is some more work to be done from a warm acceptance perspective and our card members realizing that the coverage is there. So, you will see a lot of work in those areas as well.","Operator","Next, we go to Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","Good morning. Thank you, Steve, Jeff and Rosie, I appreciate it. Your competitors have been making some significant acquisitions, Visa acquiring Plaid; MasterCard, several acquisitions;","I mean, PayPal buying Honey. American Express has done some interesting tuck-in acquisitions. But first of all, is there any concern about some of the acquisitions from a competitive perspective, like a Visa-Plaid. And is -- Amex, seems like there are so many opportunities to leverage your brand and your network with all of this innovation in the fintech and software space. Is there areas that you would like to leverage or invest more into, whether it's security or other areas?","Steve Squeri","Look, I mean, we're not getting into obviously specific acquisitions. But, what you've seen our focus over the last sort of 24 months has really been from some of our digital capabilities, whether that be Mezi or Resy or Cake and obviously, LoungeBuddy and we did acompay. And so, what we're trying to do is build out the organic footprint that we have with our existing card members, we're trying to engage with them more digitally.","And look, I think that our competitors, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal -- PayPal is really a partner, more than a competitor. When you look at what they're doing, they're doing things that are smart for them. They're run by really smart people, and they've got their strategies. And their main focus is connectivity and bringing more and more different types of transactions across those rails. And I think that the acquisitions that they've done to build out from a network perspective are smart acquisitions for them.","When we look at what we're trying to do from a card member and merchant perspective, we feel really comfortable what we've done. And I think, just looking at the Plaid acquisition, which I think is a good acquisition by Visa, it allows them to provide connectivity from their bank partners into fintechs. In fact, we use Plaid today. We have an investment in Plaid. And we'll make a little bit on that as well.","And so, that's a more sensible acquisition for them than it would be for us, not only from an economic perspective, but certainly from a strategic perspective, and I think just a customer perspective. So, we look at everything. We have our own target list of things that we want to do and things that quite honestly just don't make sense for us. We're positioned with our model.","Operator","Next, we go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","You guys highlighted the -- being with -- between that 8% and 10% revenue growth kind of for a long string of quarters and pretty much right in the middle of that over the course of 2019. As you look into 2020, you talked a little bit -- maybe a little bit of slowdown on the net interest income. Are there any other things that you'd be looking at to accelerate from where they were here?","Jeff Campbell","Well, Moshe, I guess, I -- we look at the stability we've seen overall in revenue growth, 10 quarters of 8 to 10, and see tremendous momentum to continue to meet that same target in 2020. When you look at acceleration, I would actually point you to card fee growth. So, card fee growth has been our fastest growing revenue line and actually accelerated in Q4. And for all the reasons Steve described, we're pretty bullish in our ability to keep that as our fastest growing revenue line. I\u2019d also point out to everyone that of course, you have a large -- because of the way we do the accounting for this, as you would know most, we have a large portion of next year's card fees just sitting on the balance sheet waiting to be amortized. So, we feel really good about that line. And net interest income, I would point out actually has been very steady sequentially, Moshe. Because while our booked loan growth rate has moderated a little bit, part of that is just us being a little bit tighter about things like promotional offers and that's why your yield is going up and net interest income growth has actually been pretty flat.","So, gosh, we would look at the 2020 revenue guidance and say, it\u2019s a continuation of what we've been putting up for about two-and-half years. And we feel pretty good about the stability we see in the economy, the stability we see in our credit performance and the tremendous strength, frankly, of the U.S. consumer.","Operator","Next, we go to a question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. Sounds like the guidance ranges are more related to execution than anything else. But, last year, Jeff, you guys have talked about a scenario where there was macroeconomic weakening. To the extent that there was any weakness, how should we think about this guidance, especially on the EPS side? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well, look, I think the results we posted, Sanjay, in 2019, demonstrate that we've got a model that produced steady results in the really robust economic environment of 2018 and continued to produce those same results in the more modest growth environment in 2019. So, there is clearly a range of economic outcomes around where we are, where our model is flexible enough or resistant enough to change. I'll go back to the card fee point I just made to Moshe where our card fee growth is actually pretty resilient in different economic environments. So, we feel good about our guidance across any reasonable range of economic outcomes than anyone is forecasting right now. Now, there is a sudden dramatic shift upwards or downwards. That's the kind of thing that it would take to probably cause us to move off that range.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks, guys. Good morning. So, I just wanted to start on the enterprise commercial side. I know it\u2019s still only 9% of billings. But, I think last quarter, we were expecting maybe a little bit of an uptick. We got instead a little bit of a downtick there on a constant currency basis. So, I was just wondering, I know last quarter you had a couple of specific customers that were callouts as driving some of the softness, were those continuing to be headwinds in Q4 and was there more of a malaise in corporate T&E? Do you still think we get back to low-single-digit in our 2020? And then, just on a quick side note, can you size that restructuring charge for us in the quarter? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","So, let me quickly do the facts on the two, and then Steve will probably add a little bit of color. On the large and global, I guess we look at it and we say, sequentially it\u2019s about the same as it was last quarter. Yes, you do have the same two large customers where there is some things unique to those customers going on. But, look, we\u2019ve said for a long time, this isn\u2019t a growth segment for us. This is big companies doing T&E. It's an important part of the franchise. So, we're not frankly particularly overly focused on that rate. We\u2019re focused on other parts of commercial.","On the restructuring charge, the point I would make to everyone is, this just an example of what we've done for many, many years, which is we had some very good developments on the tax side. We use that to accelerate some spending around a range of growth initiatives. We see some of that in the marketing line, some of that in some of the other customer engagement lines. And yes, we did take a restructuring charge; it\u2019s a little bit more than $100 million. Look, we've been growing expenses, we've added over 5,000 colleagues in the last year. We will continue to grow expenses in 2020. Frankly, we're going to continue that to add colleagues. But, we got to make sure we have the right people in the right place, so that we can continue as we have for many, many years to scale our Company as we grow our volumes.","Steve Squeri","And so, as far as restructuring, I think Jeff hit all that. Look, I think with the large and global, it\u2019s -- from a company perspective, not a lot of companies are looking to grow their T&E. So, you don't have sort of the organic growth that you would have. And then, you have a couple of companies that pull back or you have a loss here or there. And you feel that in the numbers. But, it is 9% of the overall billings. But, from a profit perspective, it's a lot less than that. This is an important part of our business from a network perspective, and it allows us to utilize our scale and infrastructure to really support our middle market business and our small business. And so, it plays an important role. And I think where that -- where we are from a perspective of overall billings we're comfortable with. Yes, it\u2019d be great if it would grow. But, if it grows, it's not going to make that much of a difference from a profitability perspective, which gets back to my point about not all billings are created equally. Some billings have a lot more profitability than others.","And so, I think you'll probably see this sort of flatness continue as we move in -- as we move into next year. And it's something that we're doing in our own company as well. I mean, we're not looking to grow our T&A expenses. It's not -- I don't sit around my staff and say, let's see how we can grow more T&A.","I wouldn't mind sitting around with a lot of my customers\u2019 staffs and saying that. But, we don't do that. And so, I think companies are doing that. They are looking at T&E, looking at some more video conferencing and things like that and reducing some of the travel, and you see that in the numbers.","Operator","Next, we go to Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Rick Shane","Look, given the maturity of the business and it's really impressive to see your U.S. consumer business, which is a third of your business growing at the rate that it is. I'm curious to sort of understand what you think is driving that. Is there an increase in discretionary spending among your legacy customers, or when cite particularly the growth of millennials in the portfolio is the ramp in their spending? ","Steve Squeri","Well, Rick, the interesting thing about our business is, it's probably not mature yet. And I think, one of the reasons after the financial crisis, everybody jumped into this business, especially the banks in a big way, is because this is a business that just continues to grow. When you look at the consumer business in the United States, it's sort 8%, 8%, 8%, 8%, and you see that -- you'll see that continuing. And I think when we look at our business and from maturity perspective, look, it's a mix of new customers, it's a mix of -- or what we would call same store sales, if you\u2019re thinking about this from a retail perspective, it's a mix of organic spending as well. But, we're bringing in new customers to the franchise. And our brand is playing a lot more with millennials, which is over half of our customers that we're acquiring at this particular point in time. And the reach that we're getting with some of our co-brand partners is getting us new customers as well.","So, I don't really look at this business as really mature. I look at this business as having a lot -- and I'm not just talking about our business. I'm talking about the card business in general. I think about this as a business that still has a lot of legs and a lot of growth. And you see a lot of the technological changes, whether it's sort of tap and go and making it easy to buy online and so forth. I mean, just with contact list, you're going to see more and more smaller dollar transactions coming on to card products, whether that be vending machines transactions, which is the next thing that's going to happen; you're seeing this with transit; obviously, now in New York City, you can use tap and go through the New York City transit system.","So, we don't really look at this as a mature business at all. And we think there is expansion opportunities for us not only with new customers but also with our existing customers, as we have less than half their share of wallet and we have, as we said for a long time, we only have about 23% of their share of lending. So, we think there's still a lot of upside in this business.","Operator","Next, we'll go to David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Togut","International consumer and international SME continue to be your fastest growth businesses. And particularly, you've called out strength in the UK and the European Continent. Given the regulatory changes with Payment Services Directive 2 in Europe and UK, Visa and MasterCard have both acquired fast ACH trails, both to address PSD2, consumer ACH payments, and also to complement their B2B payment capability. So, my question really is, does fast ACH need to play a role in American Express' future? And if so, where would you have an interest geographically, potentially to acquire fast ACH rails?","Steve Squeri","Yes. So, couple of things. Number one, I think from a consumer perspective, we see this sort of fast payments, we see as really looking to cannibalize some debit, looking to cannibalize some ACH, some check in and things like that. So, from a consumer perspective -- and we have an open banking test right now from a consumer perspective ourselves, where we're offering some of our non-customers the ability to pay out of their bank account. So, that could be an opportunity for us. But, I don't see that really impacting credit and charge growth.","Look, I think, what's interesting for fast payments ACH from a B2B perspective, and I've said this multiple times on calls like this and in meetings, it will play a role in B2B payments and it will play a role in procurement spending as well. The reality is that we believe we can achieve the same things with the network that we have today and the connectivity that we have as we are -- we have the flexibility in pricing. Look, I don't -- I'm not constrained by interchange. I could price from a transaction perspective. And one of the advantages we do have in Europe in particular is we\u2019re a three-party and not a four-party system. And so, the relationships that we have with card members and merchants, which with that direct connectivity, we believe we can accomplish the same things without acquiring either a Vocalink or an Earthport or something like that. But, make no mistake, it will play a role in procurement.","The other thing that I've said on these calls before is from a procurement perspective, fast ACH is really not sort of the be all, end all, given that most of these payments occur in 60 to 90 days. The bigger opportunity is really integrating the payment process within the procurement process and marrying the procure to pay. And so -- and that takes a long, long time. And that's why you do partnerships with people like SAP and people like Ariba to try and integrate the payment in. Companies are much -- look from my perspective, having our own procurement here as well, companies are much more focused on how you merge the two than sort of paying a vendor in 20 minutes. The last thing I want to do is really pay a vendor in 20 minutes. But what I really want to do is integrate the two together. So, I think there's a place for these acquisitions for -- again for reason Visa MasterCard, it goes back I think, a little bit to Plaid acquisition. But, I think we can accomplish the same thing with the capabilities that we have at the current moment.","Operator","Next, we go to James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman","So, Steve, I did -- and follow-up to the previous question and the previous before that. I did want to ask about the large and global corporate again. And I know it's a little like playing twister. But I'm looking at the appendix in terms of the volumes from T&E, and the T&E actually grew 6%. So, that seems pretty good and consistent with the way that it's been. But, I realized not all T&Es lands in large and corporate. I assume some of that's in -- so anyway, any context about how to the T&E could grow but the large and global was down?","Steve Squeri","Yes. Well, T&E -- think about our consumer travel business and think about -- just think about the expansion that we've had in small business international and the expansion that we've had in consumer international. And when you think about small business international, it's not as mature as small businesses in the United States. And so, if you go back in history, what happened from a small business perspective in the United States, that started as a T&E card and now has morphed much more into a B2B card, and so the mix of volume that we have. And the reality is, when you think about sort of the T&E aspects as it relates outside the U.S., small business international that we have, there's a higher percentage of T&E that occurs on that card. So, that's the first thing that small businesses will put on internationally. And then, obviously, our consumer business is growing in leaps and bounds internationally. And again, that has a much more T&E focus than it does retail focus.","Jeff Campbell","The only math point I would add is, in our tables that stat is the U.S. stat but it just goes to the point that the large and global segment is a small part of our total billing. So, the T&E trends get dwarfed in terms of the global company by what consumers and small business are doing.","Operator","Next we go to a question from Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat","Steve, I want to ask kind of a longer term history question about your card fee strategy. Because when you go back a few years, there really wasn't that much growth or low single digit growth in card fees. And I'm wondering if your view is -- what's changed more Amex\u2019s approach or more of the consumer appetite for fee-based cards?","Steve Squeri","No, it's been our approach that has changed, which is why if you go back to the last couple of years, we have started to refresh products. We were not in the business of refreshing products. If you do not refresh the product, it is really hard to increase the fee. Adding value enables you to increase the fee. If you're not adding value, you can't do that. We had a fundamental shift in sort of how we've approached the business over the last few years. You've seen a lot more focus on coverage; you've seen a lot more focus on -- you've seen a lot more focus on a focused international strategy, and you've also seen a major focus on card refreshment. And card refreshment, remember is -- it's not just about fees, it's to get people to spend, which then gets people to revolve that spend. So, it really is more about engagement. And the fees come along as you add value.","Operator","Our final question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Craig Maurer","Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to get a little clarity on your thoughts for billed business growth trends in 2020. With comps getting easier and we're starting to lap some of the issues in corporate and certainly GNS, could we see an inflection point in 2020 where billed business growth starts to reaccelerate? And just a housekeeping item. Are there going to be any unique quarterly trends in marketing spend this year due to the 2020 Olympics? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think the short answer on the second one, Craig, is no. Obviously, the Olympics is an important event from a lot of perspectives, and we have a fabulous franchise in Japan. And it's benefiting from the Prime Minister's incentives that he's providing in the country to encourage more card use, all good stuff for us, but, but not big enough for you to see in our global results.","On the inflection point on billed business, I\u2019d really go back Craig to the theme Steve and I both talked a lot about over the last hour, which is our revenue momentum has been very stable for 10 quarters. And that's because of the breath of sources, it\u2019s because of the way we're focused on being thoughtful about things like card fees, which Steve just touched on, or how we're pricing for risk in our lending portfolio. And so, we feel good about the trends on billed business, but we -- but more importantly, we're focused on the trends and stability on revenue that make us very comfortable with the guidance we've provided for another year of 8% to 10% revenue growth. And it is not counting on a big inflection upwards on billed business. If that happens, great, but that is not a planning assumption, if you will, that underlies the guidance we\u2019ve provided.","Rosie Perez","With that, we'll bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you again for joining the call and for your continued interest in American Express. As usual, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions.

Please go ahead.","Rick Petrino","Thank you. Welcome and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.","The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s 2012 10-K and Q1 2013 10-Q already on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.

He will be leaving Amex after a distinguished 23 year career, including the past six years as CFO, where he has played an important role in building relationships with the investment community.","On behalf of all of my colleagues throughout the finance organization, I want to sincerely thank Dan for his many contributions and to wish him the best of luck on his retirement.","I also want to recognize that Jeff Campbell is joining us on the call today. Jeff joined Amex from McKesson Corporation where he was Executive Vice President and CFO of the largest healthcare services company in the U.S. Jeff will be assuming CFO duties in early August after we file our second quarter financial results and are we are excited to have him as part of American Express.","And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I\u2019ll start on slide two, the second quarter 2013 summary of financial performance slide. Total revenues came in at $8.2 billion. That\u2019s 4% higher than a year ago. On an FX adjusted basis it\u2019s also 4%.","In the first quarter, the growth rates were 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX adjusted basis. I will speak about the impact of cardmember reimbursements on revenue growth a little later.","Net income came in at $1.4 billion, 5% higher; EPS is $1.27, 10% higher as you can see the benefit of our share buyback program. And on the last line you can see that shares outstanding are declining.","Return on average equity was 24% in the second quarter. Without the three adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2012, as this is a 12-month rolling calculation, ROE in the second quarter of 2013 would be 27%.","Moving to slide three, our metric performance; billed business came in at $237 billion. That\u2019s 7% higher or 8% higher on an FX adjusted basis. That compares to the first quarter when we grew at 6% reported and 7% FX adjusted. So this quarter it\u2019s about 100 basis points better growth rate than the first quarter.","Total cards in force are $104 million. That\u2019s a growth of 4%. Proprietary cards grew 2%, which is comparable to what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters.","Average basic cardmember spending is $4,097 in the quarter. That\u2019s up about 4% and reflects the continued strong cardmember engagement that we have seen. Cardmember loans are $63 billion. That\u2019s an increase of 3%, 4% on an FX adjusted basis and reflects continued modest growth in loans.","Moving to slide four, this is billed business growth by segment on an FX adjusted basis. So total billed business, the red line, you can see the growth rate increased from 7% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter. Both ICS, which is International Consumer, the light blue line and GCS, Global Corporate Services, the green line, increased by about 100 basis points.","GNS, the yellow line, increased from 12% in the first quarter growth rate to 17% growth in the second quarter, driven by continued strong growth in Japan and accelerated growth in China and Korea due to new partners and product launches. Markets like China have high growth and are strategically important.","Moving to slide five, so this is billed business growth by region. So the U.S., the dark blue line, growth is 7% consistent with the first quarter. EMEA, the light blue line and LACC, the yellow line, both have increased their growth rate compared to the first quarter. EMEA is growing at 6% and LACC at 10%. JAPA, the green line, increased from 9% growth to 13% growth driven by Japan, China and Korea.","So before I leave this regional section, let me just comment on EC draft proposal that has been in the news today. We put out a press release earlier today based on how the preliminary report has been characterized to us and we made a number of points. First, the publication of the formal proposal by the commission will start a lengthy legislative process and review period. We expect these proposals to prompt extensive debate among many market participants.","The proposals focus primarily on and cap interchange fees charged by four-party payment systems, such as Visa and MasterCard. The discount rate that American Express charges to merchants would not be regulated. Our proprietary consumer and corporate card businesses are not covered by the pricing caps.","Three-party systems, such as American Express, would only be covered when they license other institutions to issue cards, as in our Global Network Services business. GNS represents a relatively small percentage of our European business. The provisions that focus on separating the payment network and processing functions do not appear to impact proprietary networks like ours.","Given the potential impact on consumers and competition within the European payments sector, American Express has been in touch with senior policy makers at the Commission and will continue to represent its positions vigorously throughout the process.","Now, let me be more specific what we mean by GNS represents a relatively small percentage of our European business. EMEA represents about $100 billion of billed business in 2012. GNS billed business in European Union markets are less than 15% of total EMEA billed business.","On page 110 in our Annual Report in footnote number 25, EMEA pre-tax income for 2012 was $505 million. GNS European Union pre-tax income was approximately 12% of EMEA pre-tax income in 2012. So I just wanted to dimensionalize that further for you. There are many aspects to the EC draft proposal. They will play out over time. Some will impact us directly, some will impact us indirectly. We are accustomed to changing business environments and reacting to them in an appropriate manner and we will do the same in this situation.","So let me go to slide six. So this is U.S. Consumer Card loans. So the bar represents U.S. cardmember loans and they totaled $54.6 billion in the second quarter of this year. We have a growth rate of 4% and that\u2019s the same as the past two quarters. As I mentioned before, worldwide loans grew 3% and 4% on an FX adjusted basis. The 4% loan growth is driven by growth in billed business. Loan growth is about half the rate of growth in billings on our lending products.","Net interest yield, which is at the bottom of this chart, is up 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012. It is down sequentially from the first quarter of 2013, which included a reserve reversal for cardmember reimbursements that have been set up in prior periods. As you\u2019ll see in a minute, our credit performance continues to be excellent. But let me comment on interest rates, which have been the focus area in the industry before I move to the next slide.","As disclosed in our 10-K, 100 basis point immediate increase in all interest rates would reduce the Company\u2019s net interest income by approximately $220 million over a one-year period. Historically, an increase in long-term rates generally has a minimal impact on our business. However, movements in short-term rates impact earnings. The impact is primarily driven by the fact that we fund a portion of charge card receivables and transacting loan balances, which should not have interest rate revenue streams with variable rate debt. However, historically in rising interest rate environments has also coincided with strong billings and revenue growth.","So let me move to slide seven, revenue performance. But before I go, do a review of the individual P&L line items, I want to touch on cardmember reimbursements, which is driven by our continuing commitment to proactively review card practices, identify any issue and remediate them quickly. In both the second quarter of 2013 and second quarter of 2012 these efforts resulted in costs that impacted year-over-year variances on some of our P&L lines. The overall cost related to this work was similar in both this quarter and the second quarter of 2012. However, in the current quarter most of the reimbursements were recorded in revenue reducing revenue.","Therefore the revenue growth rate in the second quarter of this year, which was 4% on both our reported and FX adjusted basis, would have been 5% on an FX adjusted basis excluding the impacts of the cardmember reimbursements, same as the first quarter of 2013. A year ago most of the costs were reported in operating expense. The operating expense growth rate in the second quarter of this year is lower due to the reimbursement costs incurred in the prior year. And I\u2019ll provide more detail on adjusted operating expense on slide 13. We\u2019ve also included a reconciliation of the adjustments in Annex 9.","We continue to place a premium on self identifying and resolving any customer related issue and we clearly believe that this is the right thing to do for our customers.","Now let me go through the specific line items on slide 7. Discount revenue increased 6%, reflecting 7% growth in billed business, partially offset by a decrease in discount rate and faster growth in GNS billings than the overall Company billings growth rate. The discount rate is 2.52% in the second quarter of this year, down 2 basis points from the second quarter of 2012 and flat with the first quarter of 2013.","Net card fees increased 5%, as we had higher average fees per card due to fee increases, also due to the increase in the number of proprietary Cards-in-force, and a greater mix of premium products.","Travel commissions and fees decreased 5%, driven by a 1% decrease in worldwide travel sales and lower supplier revenues due to the timing of certain contracts.","Other commissions and fees are up 5% due to slightly higher late fees and foreign currency conversion revenues.","Other revenue is lower by 13%, due to cardmember reimbursements in the second quarter of this year, which I discussed a minute ago, as well as the benefit in second quarter of 2012 related to a revised estimate of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques.","The second quarter of 2013 includes a gain of $36 million related to the sale of ICBC shares. The second quarter of 2012 had a gain of $30 million related to the sale of ICBC shares.","Net interest income increased 7% compared to the second quarter of 2012 reflecting a 3% increase in average cardmember loans. Lower funding costs on the charge card portfolio and an increase in the worldwide net interest yield to 9.1% from 9% a year ago. In the second quarter of 2013, our international consumer segment included the impact of some cardmember reimbursements.","Moving to slide eight, provisions for losses, the Charge Card provision is $38 million or 23% higher than the second quarter of 2012 and this reflects the fact that we have higher receivables up about 6% year-over-year, slightly higher write-offs and a slightly lower reserve release which was $24 million this year compared to $32 million last year.","Cardmember loan provision increased $78 million or 31% reflecting lower reserve releases, this year it was $25 million and last year it was $133 million. So this is the primary driver of the higher provision expense. That was somehow offset by lower write-offs in the second quarter of this year, which were $348 million and that compares to the second quarter of 2012, write-offs of $370 million. So provision is increasing while credit metrics remain stable or improved slightly as we\u2019ll see on the next slide.","So slide nine, our lending credit metrics, on the left side of the chart you can see that we continue to have excellent write-off rates at historically low levels of 2%. On the right side is the 30-day past due, which is also stable or slightly improving and again these are historically low numbers. As I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but to achieve the best economic gains when we invest.","Moving to slide 10, so these are our lending reserve coverage metrics and you can see that reserves as a percentage of loans and principal months coverage are lower in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2012, as our credit metrics continue to either be stable or improving.","Reserves as a percentage of past due are slightly higher than the first quarter as delinquency rate has improved this quarter compared to the first quarter. Our reserves in these metrics are appropriate to the risk in our portfolio.","So I\u2019ll move to slide 11, which is expense performance. So total expenses improved or grew rather 1% year-over-year. Marketing and promotion increased 2% compared to last year and represents 9.5% of revenues, and I'll cover this in more detail on the following slide.","Cardmember rewards reflect higher spending volumes on co-brand and membership reward products. The membership reward ultimate redemption rate is 94% and that's comparable to the ultimate redemption rate that we had in the first quarter. Cardmember services reflect enhanced benefits on our premium card products.","Total operating expense decreased 4% reflecting strong expense control as well as cardmembers reimbursement costs in Q2 2012. And I\u2019ll cover this on another slide as well.","Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2013 was 29.6% reflecting the resolution of certain prior year tax items, while discrete tax items lowered the tax rate in both the second quarter of 2013 and 2012 to be below 30%. Over the past three quarters our tax rate has been 32% or 33% in each of those quarters.","So I\u2019ll move to slide 12, so this is marketing and promotion expense as a percentage of managed revenues. So marketing expense in the second quarter of this year was $786 million compared to $773 million in the second quarter of 2012. As you can see on the right side of the chart, the second quarter was 9.5% of revenues and on track to achieve 9% growth for the year or potentially slightly higher. We continue to invest in our business despite the slow growth economy.","Moving to slide 13, so this is operating expense performance, so total operating expense is 4% lower year-over-year, salaries and benefit is flat year-over-year and this reflects some of the benefits from the restructuring that we announced in January.","Employee count is 1,300 lower than in the second quarter of 2012. Employee count in the first quarter decreased to 1,100 compared to year-end 2012, but picked up slightly by 200 in the second quarter. We estimate employee count at year-end 2013 will be 4% to 6% lower than the year end 2012.","Professional services increased reflecting higher technology development and other net decreased 48% reflecting 89 million more in cardmember reimbursements in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2013. And you can see this on Annex 9. The second quarter of 2012 also included an asset impairment. The second quarter of this year includes the Canadian value added tax benefit that lowered other net expenses.","So, moving to slide 14 \u2013 so, this chart shows the adjusted operating expense growth over the past three years. In 2013 and 2014 our target is to grow operating expense at less than 3% each year. You can see the first quarter grew at 1% and while the second quarter decreased 4% after adjusting for the cardmember reimbursements I just discussed, the second quarter of 2013 would have been a reduction in year-over-year expense of 1%. So we were on track to achieve our target of less than 3% annual growth in operating expense for this year.","Moving to slide 15, so, this is adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenue, and this excludes credit provision. In 2012, we committed to migrate this ratio over time back towards historical levels in two ways; first through revenue growth; and second, controlling operating expense while continue to invest in the business.","In 2012, in those bars the dotted line is excluding the restructuring charge in cardmember reimbursements that we have had in the fourth quarter of 2012.","As you can see on the chart, we are making substantial progress in reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenue. Well both the first quarter and the second quarter of 2013 round to 69%, the second quarter ratio is actually slightly lower than the first quarter, if you carry without one more decimal point.","Slide 16, so these are our capital ratios. In the second quarter of 2013 our Tier 1 common ratio is 12.5%. In the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion of capital, $1.4 billion from net income and $300 million from employee plans. We also distributed $1.7 billion in capital, $1.4 billion through share buybacks and $300 million in dividends. Risk weighted assets increased slightly due to higher receivables.","The Basel III implementation from Basel I would have reduced Tier 1 common by 30 basis points, but I would remind you that we have not yet implemented Basel III advanced approach.","So there has been much conversation about the new supplemental leverage calculation. So the Tier 1 leverage calculation for us as you can see on the chart is 10.5%. If it is the calculation in the second quarter on a leverage supplementary level basis, it would be 8%, well above the required level of 3%. So our Tier 1 common ratio and leverage ratio provides the Company with a strong capital position.","So moving to slide 17, so this is our payout ratio. So our share repurchases are governed by our performance, and our CCAR submission in January 2013. Our plan for 2013 is to repurchase $4 billion. The $1.4 billion in repurchases in the second quarter is consistent with our CCAR submission in January.","Moving to slide 18, so this is our U.S. retail deposit balances. So the U.S. retail deposit activity in the quarter, you can see decreased slightly. Our overall funding strategy is to utilize unsecured, securitizations and deposits. In the second quarter we issued $2 billion of unsecured debt. Therefore we did not need to increase deposits. Therefore we decreased deposits slightly. However, within deposits we continue to grow direct deposits by $1.2 billion to $23.1 billion, while third-party CDs and sweeps decreased slightly.","On the liquidity front, we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities. As of June 30 we had $15.4 billion in excess cash compared to funding maturities of $14.4 billion over the next 12 months thereby meeting our objective.","So with that let me conclude with a few final comments. We continue to feel positive about our performance, especially given the relatively slow growth in the economic environment. In the quarter our spending growth continued to be healthy and was relatively consistent with the past several quarters.","In addition we did see some improvements in our growth rate internationally. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpace the industry. Loan growth and slightly lower funding costs led to a 7% increase in net interest income. At the same time lending loss rates remain near all-time lows.","Revenue growth was 4%. We continue to consistently grow revenues despite the slow growth environment, and in this quarter the negative impact of cardmember reimbursements. In the quarter operating expense decreased by 4% first year reflecting the strong expense control as well as higher cardmember reimbursements cost in the prior year.","We are clearly off to an excellent start with our aim of having operating expense growth at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years. We\u2019re also continuing to invest in the business as marketing and promotion and technology development spending both increased versus prior years. These investments are driving higher average spend and growth in our cardmember base while continuing to build capabilities for the future.","Second quarter EPS were $1.27 represents an all-time high, but this benefit from a lower tax rate than recent quarters. EPS growth rate of 10% outpaced revenue growth reflecting the progress we have made on improving operating leverage and our strong capital position. We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks while maintaining strong capital ratios.","We\u2019ve recognized that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders even in a slow growth environment.","So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff Campbell for a few remarks.","Jeffrey C. Campbell","Well, thank you Dan and good afternoon everyone. I am excited to have joined American Express this week, and I will look forward in the coming months to spending time with many of you on the call, and to continuing the strong legacy of performance that Dan\u2019s leadership has helped to create here at American Express. So with that Rick?","Rick Petrino","Thanks, Jeff. Okay, so we are going to start the Q&A just before we kick it off, I do want to ask everybody as a courtesy to all those who do want to ask a question, that we strongly encourage you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can get as many folks on the call as possible. And with that, let\u2019s open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Craig Maurer \u2013 CLSA Limited","Yeah, good afternoon. Dan, first let me congratulate you on your ride off into the sunset, it\u2019s been a pleasure.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay, thank you.","Craig Maurer \u2013 CLSA Limited","A question regarding the GNS business in Europe and the 12% of the $505 million you discussed, I am not sure, I don\u2019t think any of us know in terms of the breakdown of GNS revenue, is there any component of that that would be susceptible to the cap that they are placing on interchange or is that strictly network and acquiring fees or is there some level of interchange split with the issuer?","And as a follow-up, is there any guidance going forward on cardmember reimbursements that we can think about in terms of suppression of revenue or help on expenses. Thanks.","Daniel T. Henry","So yes the draft is not even out yet, so getting very specific in terms of answering all the elements of your question is really not possible. I think the main point that we wanted to make is that the cap relates to four party systems, and from our understanding does not relate to three party systems, which is our system therefore our proprietary business, the proprietary consumer business, and our corporate card business is not impacted.","However in our GNS business, we think the cap will apply as a result of that we\u2019ll have an impact directly on that business, exactly how it\u2019s going to play out will depend on, exactly what the draft says and the debate that will take place between now and the time that the final rules are issued, which will be several quarters in the future. So it\u2019s hard to be more specific at this point and it is our intent, once we have a chance to read the draft, to touch on this topic at the Financial Community Meeting which will take place on August 8.","In terms of cardmember reimbursements, as we identify items we look for root [causes] [ph], and if there is a need for us to modify our procedures going forward, we\u2019ll do that and if it\u2019s appropriate to have reimbursements for customers we\u2019ll do that as well, as I said in the second quarter of last year and this year the numbers are at a similar level. It has varied from quarter-to-quarter in terms of how much it is. Forecasting what might happen in the future is difficult because certainly anything we know about, we have addressed at this juncture, but certainly in the course of our work of reviewing our policies and our practices, it\u2019s potential we could identify other items, and if they do we will remediate those, and if appropriate have reimbursements, but there is really no way to forecast what that might be.","Operator","Okay. And the next question from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.","Thank you, good evening and congrats Dan. Just two questions; one on Europe, I was just hoping, if you could just talk about, how you would deal with the competitive pressure of lower rates from Visa and MasterCard when domestic interchange rates go down and kind of how you would offset any potential impact to the extent that you have to take your pricing down. And also I just wanted to get a sense of how much of your volume is commercial as well. And then just second that Canadian VAT benefit you mentioned, I just want to know how much that was. Thank you.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. So certainly as I said, there\u2019s going to be a direct impact as it relates to GNS and the business we do with GNS partners. And then there will be an indirect impact, but that\u2019s something again that will be very dependent on what the final rules actually say, and how we need to react in the marketplace. Certainly we have faced these types of challenges in other markets, and I think we have reacted in a way that's been beneficial in terms of our overall business. It\u2019s hard to really specifically say, what's going to happen, because we don\u2019t even know what the draft rules are exactly nor what the final rules will be. A whole lot will take place in the marketplace. This is something that I think will play out honestly not only over a couple of quarters, but likely over a couple of years, but we will be very thoughtful about how we approach that.","In terms of the commercial piece of the European business that\u2019s not disclosure that we\u2019ve historically made at this juncture. I thought the most useful information that was to actually share what percentage the GNS billings were of the total billings in Europe. So hopefully that was helpful.","Canadian benefit, kind of falls in this category of an amount we thought was large enough that we should mention, but not large enough to give the dollar amount, which is kind of in our practice on a fair number of items like this, but to let you know that there is something in there that is affecting the line item and therefore the growth rate.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.","All right, thank you.","Operator","Okay, the next question from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, good evening and Dan, I will also add my congratulations, and it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. I had a follow-up question on the comments that you made. You made it clear that the proprietary business is not covered by the proposed caps. Does that suggest that you will be able to generate premium economics and be able to offer greater rewards, and therefore you have greater value for your customers, and I guess that the logical thought process then, does that put you in a position where you can experience similar results to what you saw in Australia? And I have a follow-up.","Daniel T. Henry","Yeah, so I mean currently we have a premium position, right? And that\u2019s what enables us to provide the value in our products that we provide to our customers. And certainly, initially the gap between what our discount rates are and the cap will probably widen that gap somewhat. But realistically we know we\u2019ll have to react to a second place in the marketplace. I don\u2019t want to analogize this exactly to Australia because every market is different, but what we did in Australia actually demonstrates the fact that we have a flexible business model and are thoughtful in terms of how we do react when the environment changes.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And to address some of the concerns that are out there around regulators focusing on the three-party system, can you just talk \u2013 your comments today were very helpful in the release and what you\u2019ve said so far in the call, but can you just give us, I guess more broadly a perspective on whether you\u2019ve ever heard of any regulator, you have any experience with any regulator anywhere around the world, really talk about bifurcating the negotiated merchant discount rate in your proprietary business with the goal of regulating it.","I think that's kind of where some people were going and it just seems, I remember from past meetings that we've had with your Head of Global Merchant Services, it seems pretty clear that regulators around the world kind of get your models different because your rates are negotiated. I wonder if that's still a fair, a reasonable way of thinking about it, if you can just comment on that. Thank you.","Daniel T. Henry","So I just said we negotiate our rates with the merchants around the world. Certainly in Australia that regulation didn't address our rates specifically. That was a four-party systems and your understanding of this draft as it was characterized us we don't believe addresses three-party system such as ours. So that seems to be the course of action that happens historically and our understanding of the same plays here. What may happen elsewhere, always time will tell, but that has been the focus historically when it's come to a change of regulation.","Operator","Okay. And the next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Brian D. Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","I guess maybe switching gears to capital, as these Basel III rules firm up, two things, one, is there any reason to think the advanced approach would be a meaningful change from the 12.2%, Basel III you kind of implied by the 30 basis point hit; and is there any reason to think the liquidity coverage ratio is a hurdle that would be an issue in terms of the way you manage the excess liquidity?","Daniel T. Henry","So the 30 basis points is when we go from Basel I over to Basel III, kind of skipping the Basel II piece, right. It\u2019s hard for me to say what the impact will be until we actually complete the work on the advanced Basel III methodology. It requires the gathering of an enormous amount of information that we have to process with systems. That work is actually underway currently. We actually have scheduled to enter a parallel run in the beginning of 2014, at that juncture we will have a better sense of what the impact would be on capital ratios. So I don\u2019t have an estimate for you at this juncture.","In terms of liquidity rules, I guess we don\u2019t have final liquidity rules at this point although from what we understand so far, we think we have a strong liquidity position and don\u2019t, at this moment based on our understanding, think that the new ratios that will phase in over time would have a substantial impact on us. So therefore I would say it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have an impact on kind of how we think about liquidity at the moment.","Brian D. Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","One follow-up, I guess on the other expense. All the dimensions you gave are very helpful. But if I just think about it simplistically, I mean, is the $219 million kind of a good run rate for that number or is it better to think about since the Visa and MasterCard benefit rolled off and excluding the quarters where you had the big reimbursements, it\u2019s tended to be more in the kind of $260 million to $270 million range?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, the $219 million, as I said, includes the Canadian item. So I don\u2019t know that I used that number in the first quarter. So in the first quarter of this year we didn\u2019t have any items that we spiked out and it was $246 million.","Brian D. Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay.","Operator","Okay. And next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard B. Shane \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thank you guys for taking my questions. And Dan, I will miss these conversations and wish you all the best.","Daniel T. Henry","Thank you.","Richard B. Shane \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","I\u2019d love to talk a little bit about the nuance of your conversations with the regulators. We\u2019re in a situation now where it appears that the press has seen the documents and what you guys have indicated is you had conversations, it doesn\u2019t sound per se like you\u2019ve actually seen the draft at this point. You guys are very deliberate in your communications, you\u2019re very cautious and you come out with a strong interpretation of how this is going to play out for your guys. I\u2019d love to understand what the dialog was like when it started and make sure that we understand the subtlety of this because it is pretty significant as you can see from how the stock traded around all those today?","Daniel T. Henry","Yeah. Well, I haven\u2019t said that. I mean, we\u2019re not necessarily intimating that the conversations of the people who have characterized this to us are the regulators, right? So it is based on our understanding, previously to this leak of the drafts where we would come out and based on the characterizations of those people who have seen the draft and discussed it with us, our sense is that in fact notably different than what we have been thinking about before.","However we actually see the draft and get a chance to read it and digest it, then we\u2019ll all even be in a better position, but as you indicated there were certainly notable discussion in the press and activity in our stocks, and so we wanted our press release to share our understanding of where we are even though we haven't read the complete document. And so that's the state of play at the moment. After it is issued on the 24th, we will read it and if there is anything \u2013 any refinements we can make, we will do that at the financial committee meeting on August 8.","Richard B. Shane \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, I guess we look forward to reading it at the same time you guys do. Thanks guys.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Next question from the line of Ken Bruce of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you and good evening gentlemen and Dan, wish you good fortune in your retirement. So thank you very much for the help over the years. My question, I\u2019ll stay around Europe for the moment. Looking at the average cardmember spend, that has been decelerating really for the last several quarters and that has always been one of the metrics that you all have really focused on in terms of the health of the business and obviously there has been a change in strategy, at least there has been some additional products that maybe impacting the numbers, but I guess what I\u2019d like to understand is or get some response from you is, how you\u2019re seeing the deceleration in the average cardmember spend growth?","What ultimately will turn that if it\u2019s just purely the weak economy strengthening or if there is something specifically within your strategy set that will drive that or if you expect that to be less going forward just given the nature where you are adding new cards and the like?","Daniel T. Henry","Yes, so I think, historically our growth in billed business has come from both the combination of the growth in Cards-in-force, as well as growth in average spend. The growth in average spend comes from really two things, in recent history, that is just greater engagement on the part of our current customers who are spending at higher levels, but it\u2019s also coming from our premium strategy. So we\u2019re bringing on higher spending customers compared to what we were doing several years ago, and I think that shift to a more premium mix is influencing as well.","However, well first off, the broader economy has an impact here as well and certainly just consumer confidence is the fact in terms of how much people spend. That\u2019s been shifting a little bit recently, certainly things like housing prices firming, stock market doing better are all things that can influence that. But as we have talked about a fair number of times, there is pretty good correlation between billed business for us and GDP and I think the average cardmember spend numbers we see now are being impacted by the fact that GDP is below the average rate that we\u2019ve seen over the last 10 years. And if history is any barometer, and if GDP picks up, you would think, it would have a positive impact on average spend. There is obviously also totally contingent on us having the best value propositions in the marketplace and providing the best service, and that\u2019s what we are focused on.","So it\u2019s hard to spike out exactly how each of those things impact average spend, but certainly the general slow growth in the economy I think is a factor here.","Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you. And just on a clarification or maybe just, if you could provide some senses to what the differences are in the cardmember reimbursements that will either determine whether, it\u2019s a revenue item or an expense, can you give us some examples as to what the cause of that change please?","Daniel T. Henry","So we think it\u2019s, each items to talk one item this quarter, it\u2019s a number of items in each quarter, and each item is unique. So each quarter we evaluate the items that are in front of us and make the judgment based on our view at that quarter of how it should be categorized, so you can have different types of items in different quarters. That\u2019s really the thing that is the primary driver.","Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you and best of luck.","Daniel T. Henry","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. The next question is from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, thanks. Just as a follow-up on Ken\u2019s question related to spend growth, outside the acceleration we saw in GNS from new business wins. Do you think particularly here in the U.S., do you think the current run rates are good proxy for what we should see for spend over the next few quarters? Should we expect it to remain stable or just given the fact that we are seeing improvement from the [welfare] fact whether it\u2019s higher home prices and higher markets, should we start seeing that manifesting into higher spend?","Daniel T. Henry","So as you know me, I don\u2019t want to forecast here, I guess, one of the factors is the grow over later in the year although a lot of steeper thing were earlier in the year. But clearly I think where the economy goes and consumer confidence will also be significant factors about whether it accelerates from here or not.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, and then just a question on expenses, so Europe 69% as a percentage of managed revenues and I know you\u2019ve talked about migrating towards 67% over time, so I guess should we expect to stay at these levels in near-term, and if revenue growth does have to accelerate and we could see a pickup in expenses from here?","Daniel T. Henry","So we say we went migrate back towards historical levels, okay. We are having to have 2007 on there, which is 67%, but we went and migrate back to the historical levels. If we are successful and it\u2019s our plan to be successful of growing operating expense at less than 3%, that\u2019s going to create leverage and should enable us to continue to improve that number over the next 18 months.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats.","Daniel T. Henry","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Dan Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Donald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hi, Dan. Just a conceptual question, I was looking back in your merchant discount rate, it\u2019s down a couple of basis points over the last 2.5 years. And you just had very strong GNS growth, which I would think would naturally bring that down more and so. I guess my question is, do you really have any sort of core change in your merchant discount rate, when should we think about that as more flattish going forward, the mix?","Daniel T. Henry","Okay, so first GNS is not in the discount rate calculations, it\u2019s really a calculation based on our proprietary business, so that\u2019s not in there. So we have said, in the absence of increasing price anywhere because of our strategies drive further into everyday spend categories, in the normal course we\u2019d expect the discount rate to drop by two or three basis points a year. We in fact have not seen that over the last several years as there have been opportunities where we are bringing greater value to merchants and then obviously we\u2019ve been able to increase price in certain situations, so that the drop in discount rate has been probably more in the 1% or 2% level over the past several years.","So if we can drive sufficient volume by moving into new categories and driving volumes up, then I would expect to see some drop in discount rate as we go forward. But that's very much on strategy for what we want to accomplish over the long-term.","Donald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. And then quickly any updates on Bluebird in terms of transaction over fees.","Daniel T. Henry","So I think we're going to do some updates of the data that we shared at the FCM in February, at the August, FCM. So we'll update that information on August 8.","Donald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Hi. Thanks, and let me echo the congratulations. I want to ask about cards in force, Dan. It was one of the faster growing numbers in the past year up 1.2 million. I guess question in two parts. One is, should that continue to be the emphasis going forward in terms of driving billed business? And two, it looked like about 700,000 of that 1.2 million came from GNS. Should we anticipate going forward that GNS will be the driver of cards in force? It sounded like in your introductory comments it suggests that some of the growth may have come from China. Is that a correct interpretation?","Daniel T. Henry","So, cards in force number, which is 4% was 2% on proprietary cards. So that\u2019s pretty consistent. We\u2019ve kind of been at the 2%, 3% growth rate over the last five or six quarters. So the growth rate there is very consistent with the last few quarters. The growth rate in the GNS cards at 7% is somewhat lower than what we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. It had been kind of in the low-single digits, right. So the lower growth rate is driven by fewer GNS cards in out there.","So the growth in our business is going to come, as I said before, from both higher average spend as well as higher number of cards and the fact that cards are growing at 2% and 3% compared to maybe proprietary cards compared to higher levels historically is due to the change in strategy more focused on the premium cards as opposed to just being cards in.","In terms of new cards in China, part of what drove the strong performance in GNS and in JAPA, the answer to that is, yes, right. So both in China and Korea we\u2019ve had some new partners signed and some new product launches in those countries, both by new partners and existing partners. So that is part of what\u2019s driving the GNS and JAPA growth rates that we see.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Hi. And just as a follow-up housekeeping. So Bluebird is not included in that cards in force type of zone, imagine that\u2019s a pretty big number, but\u2026","Daniel T. Henry","It\u2019s not included in cards in force, no.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Okay, okay. And at some point will you start to decompose the cards in force at that level? Thank you.","Daniel T. Henry","So, I mean currently we share information in terms of what the GNS piece is. I think we can do some geographic splits for you.","So, I think that I don\u2019t know that we are going to give more detail on that, it wasn\u2019t in our thinking, but certainly as we move forward we\u2019ll provide information as it relates to new products like Bluebird but we think it\u2019s appropriate.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Dan just help me, if you could provide a little more color on what we can expect on the GNS growth in Asia, you referenced. Is it realistic to think that at least for the next three quarters you\u2019ve got some fairly positive year-over-year comps on that, should we continue to expect to see that kind of robust mid-high teens billed business growth from Asia?","Daniel T. Henry","So, I don\u2019t want to forecast. In China, it is an important market for us and we\u2019re focused on the partners that we have and the [biologics] that will take place. So my sense is that will be a good growth market, but I don\u2019t want to forecast exactly where our GNS growth is going to be over the next couple of quarters. And also potentially it will be impacted by the economy in China. But right now, our growth rates are being driven there by new partner signings and new product launches.","Mark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up, with marketing and promotion expense kind of leveling off on a year-over-year basis, is it reasonable to expect or continue to see kind of the 4% to 5%, cards in force growth that you had over the last year or so?","Daniel T. Henry","Well, we have come up with this 9% number out there. And I don\u2019t want it be a target or a guideline, but I think it\u2019s recognition of the fact that on an annual basis, right we have fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. On an annual basis, we need to increase investments at the rate they were growing the business, if we\u2019re going to continue to have the type of business momentum that we want.","So my view is we are very committed to investing in the growth of business. You have seen us do that historically and we will continue to do that. So our view is we want to make sure that there are sufficient investment dollars to sustain the business momentum as we go forward. Certainly the whole focus on reengineering that we announced in January is designed to grow operating expense at a slower rate, so that it provides additional resources for investment in the growth of the business.","Mark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, best of luck to you Dan.","Daniel T. Henry","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. A quick follow-up on the cards in force, it\u2019s my understanding that you had some minor annual fee increases in some of your proprietary products this year and some \u2013 did you see that in the net cards in force, is there any pricing activity across your portfolio, I guess any (inaudible) but it\u2019s significant, is that a contributing factor and is that something you continue to squeeze higher over the years, given the strength of your products and the consumers attraction and loyalty to your products?","Daniel T. Henry","As we said, there were selected price increases on certain products. We never tried to squeeze out higher fees, we don\u2019t want to increase fees without improving the value proposition for customers, so our practice has been where we increase fees to also avail that increase the value propositions to our customers and we have been very successful at that and when we have had fee increases, we have not seen a notable attrition as a result of that. So it\u2019s all tied into \u2013 we\u2019re delivering value, we\u2019ve increased the value, part of the increase in the fee and probably of course it goes into the bottom line, what portions goes back into increasing the value to the cardmember. That has been our strategy and I think it will be our strategy going forward.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great and then my follow-up question, enterprise growth and your initiatives there, the $3 billion target, I guess and possible with your Bloomberg update for the community meeting in early August, so ultimately feel an update there, I am just curious as to the investments you made over the past several years, serving particular, are we starting to see any meaningful contributions from those new initiatives yet? Any color there would be helpful.","Daniel T. Henry","Yeah, so we set a $3 billion target couple of years ago to exit 2014 at that rate. Simply when we set that target, we didn\u2019t necessarily contemplate the economy being as slow as it has been over that period, that number as we\u2019ve disclosed last year was $1.5 billion. So we have a lot of work to do between now and then, but we continue to think that it\u2019s an appropriate target for us to inform. I don\u2019t anticipate us updating that until we update what I just gave now.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And what about the Serve?","Daniel T. Henry","So, I think one of topics at the meeting will be Dan Schulman and he will talk about what\u2019s taking place both in Serve as well as Bloomberg in particular.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Excellent. Congratulations Dan. Thanks a lot.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay, so we\u2019ll just take one more question.","Operator","Okay and our final question then comes from the line of Brad Ball of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Thanks, and congratulations Dan and good luck in your future endeavors.","Daniel T. Henry","Thank you.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","I wonder if you can give us a sense for the progression of billings over the course of the quarter, month to months, was it stronger late in the quarter and would you give us an update for July to-date?","Daniel T. Henry","So the earnings growth over the month-by-month was relatively consistent. There is no sharp upward trend or downward trend. I would say it\u2019s relatively consistent. And we don\u2019t really plan to give an update about what has taken place in July. When you tend to give even a quarter is a short period of time, you try to do it for a couple of weeks. We\u2019ve found the side note necessarily indicative of what\u2019s going to happen to the quarter. But within the quarter, month-by-month, it was relatively consistent.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And then one follow-up on the EC proposal, you said in your press release earlier today that separating the payment network and processing functions did not appear to impact proprietary networks like AMX\u2019s. Could you explain what you mean by that and what\u2019s the basis for making that statement?","Daniel T. Henry","So I am not going to say, I am an expert here. But I think there is some language in there about what you need to split the merchant core processor and the merchant acquirer I guess in the network. In that case, in our case, we do all those functions, so it doesn\u2019t appear to us that that was the applicable in our situation. But again once you get a chance to read the draft, we can address that more specifically.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","So it would apply to a four party system, but not to the three party system, is that\u2026","Daniel T. Henry","That\u2019s our understanding.","Bradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.","Daniel T. Henry","Okay. Thanks everybody for joining the call and thank you very much for your congratulations. From my perspective it has been a pleasure dealing with each of you as well and we are highly confident that Jeff will do a terrific job as we go forward.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Toby Willard, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Toby Willard","Thanks, Ryan. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures maybe found in the third quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that maybe discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see in this afternoon\u2019s earnings release, our earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which is 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus on our priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and substantially reducing our costs. There is clearly still a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with our performance through the third quarter and our results have come in above the expectations that we shared with you earlier this year.","The favorability was driven by faster than anticipated progress on our expense initiatives and steady credit performance. Also as we have discussed previously, we did take a very balanced approach to our second half assumptions given some of the dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace, including the portfolio sale last quarter in the overall competitive environment. While the environment continues to evolve, we now have greater clarity after seeing the consistent growth in adjusted billings, loans and revenue that we experienced in the third quarter.","Also as expected, Q3 included a higher level of investment spending than the prior year and certain impacts from our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including a modest restructuring charge. And finally, we continued to use our capital strength to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. Separate from our operating results, this quarter also saw the recent Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in our favor in the Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. Though I would point out that the DOJ has the right to further appeal the decision.","The progress we have made this year gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively into Q4 with a number of initiatives that we have been working on for some time. These include a renewed emphasis on our Platinum Card portfolios in the U.S., which provide a combination of service, access and benefits that have been the benchmark of value for more than 30 years. They also include our biggest campaign yet to build on the success of Small Business Saturday and drive additional spending at neighborhood businesses in a way that leverages the ongoing expansion of our merchant network in the U.S. through our OptBlue program. In addition, we are going to continue to build upon the digital marketing capabilities that help to bring on a record number of new card members this year with expanded acquisition campaigns, both in the U.S. and key international markets. Finally, we will be supporting all of these initiatives with an extensive advertising campaign.","With these and other initiatives coming together at the start of the peak shopping season, it will be a very active fourth quarter. In support of this, we are planning a substantial increase in our investment spending to bring together and leverage the combined impact of all these initiatives on our card members and merchants during the remainder of the year and to position us for growth in the years ahead. A highlight that the decision to increase investment levels is consistent with how we have run the company for many years as we seek to leverage earnings capacity to invest for the moderate to long term.","Turning now to the summary of our financial results on Slide 2 the revenues decreased by 5% reflecting the decline in volumes in card member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2. I would note that FX had a relatively small impact on our reported results this quarter, the first such quarter in quite some time. Net income was down 10% versus the prior year due primarily to the lower revenues combined with a higher level of investment spending. These impacts were offset in part by lower rewards and operating expenses.","We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 72 million shares which has driven a 7% reduction in our average share count. This decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove EPS of $1.20 for the quarter, which was just 3% below the prior year. These results include a restructuring charge of $44 million this quarter related to our cost reduction efforts. Since we have provided a 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS, after excluding the $0.04 restructuring charge, was $1.24 in the third quarter and $5.01 on a year-to-date basis. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended September 30 to 26%.","Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of on Slides 3 through 6. Worldwide FX adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter as you can see on Slide 3. As we have done the last two quarters, we have also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rates excluding both Costco cobrand volumes at all merchants and non-cobrand volumes at Costco on Slide 4. By this measure, FX adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was down from 8% last quarter.","We saw a number of positive trends within our underlying billings performance during the third quarter. Within the GCS segment, performance amongst both the U.S. and international middle market and small businesses remains healthy. Our international consumer billings growth rates remained strong, which I will come back to in a minute. In the U.S. consumer segment, while the ultimate outcome will play out over time, you are on track with our expectation to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco cobrand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale, which does provide some lift to our adjusted billings growth rates, but we are starting to lap it this quitter. We are also on track with the overall performance trends we had expected across the evolving and competitive U.S. consumer space, in particular, seeing strong growth across our U.S. Cashback products.","Our adjusted billings performance this quarter also reflected several challenges, which enacted our year-over-year growth rates. The largest driver of the sequential decline in the growth rate versus the second quarter was the end of our network relationship with Fidelity, which moved to a new network this quarter. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from Fidelity was minimal as we were not the card issuer. U.S. billings growth was also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices, which remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter. And finally, consistent with prior quarters, spending by large corporations remains weak with billings declining year-over-year, reflecting the slow growth revenue environment and cost reduction efforts being undertaken by many large companies.","Coming back to the drivers of total international billings performance on Slide 6, the increase in FX adjusted billings growth to 11% during the current quarter was driven by improved performance in JAPA, primarily due to an up-tick in growth rates in China. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks are in on spending within the industry.","Within the EMEA region, our UK business continues to perform very well with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the third quarter. The weakening of the British pound that has occurred since the Brexit vote at the end of June has been a drag on our reported billings and revenues. But from an earnings perspective, as you recall, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the UK serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations.","Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7, our loans on a GAAP basis were down 12% compared to Q3 \u201815, reflecting the sales of the two co-brand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we have excluded the sold co-brand portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX. On this basis, adjusted worldwide loan growth of 12%, which is down from 13% in the second quarter, but continues to outpace the industry. We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high quality prospects. Over the last 2 years, as our co-brand loans have declined, we have successfully shifted our mix towards non-co-brand card members. These card members are more likely to revolve their balances, producing good returns for us, but they do have a slightly higher write-off rate. We do not believe that this mix change is driving any significant change to our overall credit profile and it is producing good returns.","Our net interest yield during the quarter was 9.8%, which was up from recent quarters. Several factors influenced this change. The sold co-brand loan had a slightly lower average yield than the rest of our tenured portfolio. In contrast, the non-co-brand card member launch to which our mix has shifted have a higher yield. In addition, some of the new card members from last year have begun to lap their introductory EPR periods. These positives were then partially offset by a small increase in the percentage of loans in introductory promotional periods due to our strong acquisitions over the past year.","Turning to provision on Slide 8, total provision decreased by 5%, as you can see on the left side of the slide, but this result includes provision in Q3 \u201815 related to the two co-brand portfolios that were sold earlier this year. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased 6% versus the prior year. This 6% however, is a combination of two different trends. Charge card provision declined year-over-year due to improved credit performance as both worldwide write-off and delinquency rates were below prior year with the write-off rate in our U.S. consumer business reaching a new historical low. Consistent with prior quarter performance, adjusted lending provision increased by more than the growth rate loans. As expected, we are beginning to see some seasoning of our newer loan vintages.","Turning to our reported lending credit metrics, I would point out that they are impacted by the Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. As a reminder, these loans primarily relate to canceled accounts. They are having an impact on our reported write-off rates this quarter, but no provision impact as they were already reserved for at a higher level. Excluding these loans, adjusted write-off rates are relatively consistent with last quarter and remain best in class among peer issuers. Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I would emphasize there has been no change in our credit outlook and the credit continues to perform better than our Investor Day expectations. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect the continued growth in adjusted loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will both contribute to an increase in adjusted provisions going forward.","Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 9, reported revenues were down 5% while adjusted revenue growth accelerated modestly from 4% in Q2 to 5% this quarter. This level of growth is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted revenue growth performance and the expectations we shared at our Investor Day in March. As we look at the detailed components of revenue on Slide 10, we see a decline in discount revenue from lower volumes, while on an adjusted basis, discount revenue increased by 5%. This was driven by the 7% increase in adjusted volumes that I already discussed for the quarter, offset partially by a decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed business, which I will come back to in a few minutes. Net card fee growth continues to be strong, up 10% this quarter. We are seeing healthy growth in our domestic Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios as well as in key international markets like Japan and Mexico. Steady growth in card fees is a reminder of the strength of our value propositions and our ability to attract and retain fee paying customers even in the phase of an intense competitive environment.","Moving on, net interest income was down 11% on lower reported loans while up 10% on an adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted loans were up 12% and net interest yield on card member loans increased year-over-year. These impacts were partially offset in net interest income by higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio due to the increase in interest rates versus last year. Last, I would point out that net interest income represents 17% of our total revenues this quarter, somewhat lower than we have seen in recent quarters, given the sales of the co-brand portfolios.","Coming back now to discount rate performance on Slide 11, we saw the reported discount rate increase 1 basis point year-over-year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchants\u2019 negotiations, including those tied to new regulations in Europe and the continued growth of OptBlue. We did see the ratio of discount revenue to billed business moved down by 5 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year decline stems in part from the continued growth from Cashback rewards. The greater sequential change in Q3 versus the reported discount rate is due to our billings mix shifting towards GNS or network business in Q3 as co-brand volumes declined.","Turning now to expense performance on Slide 12, you can see the total expenses were down 3% compared to the prior year. I will speak specifically about marketing shortly, so let me start by focusing on rewards. Reported rewards expense declined 11% versus the prior year, much more than the 3% decline in reported billings I mentioned earlier. We first noted this variance in Q2 as the billings from co-brand products that formerly drove rewards expense come off the network and are partially replaced with new volumes that are more likely to earn Cashback rewards, which are recorded as contra discount revenue. Excluding volumes and rewards in the Costco co-brand in the prior year and including the cost of rewards on Cashback products, the growth in adjusted rewards was relatively in line with the growth in adjusted proprietary billings this quarter. Looking forward, however and consistent with our Investor Day expectations, we would expect this trend to change and for rewards, including Cashback, to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our product value propositions over time beginning in the fourth quarter due to the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products.","Turning then to operating expenses, we continue to feel good about the progress we have made to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. We have made faster progress than we had anticipated on identifying and executing the key initiatives behind this effort. In the third quarter, this translated into operating expenses being down 3% year-over-year despite the $44 million restructuring charge that we took in the quarter.","Moving now to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13, I would remind you that as we entered 2016, we anticipated that our full year marketing spending will be similar to prior year levels of $3.1 billion. On last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we highlighted that we anticipated full year marketing expenses would be at least $200 million higher than 2015 as we take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. Consistent with these comments from last quarter, marketing and promotion was up 10% versus the prior year in Q3. As we have discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of our investment-focused areas and we did acquire 1.7 million new cards across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 2.5 million on a worldwide basis. This performance remains above our historical average level of acquisitions, though as expected, it is below the levels in recent quarters.","Looking ahead to Q4, the financial performance we have had year-to-date gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively with the series of initiatives that we have been working on for some time. In particular, we plan to accelerate and leverage the combined progress we have made in several areas. First, providing increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum card franchise that we have in the U.S., we are excited about the changes announced earlier this month, which will provide expanded travel benefits for our U.S. consumer and small business Platinum products. These new benefits are just one step in a series of further enhancements that we plan to make to the Platinum product over the course of the next year.","Second, leveraging our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday to build upon the success that we have had increasing awareness among small business merchants and card members. Small Business Saturday is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base. We have made significant progress growing our small merchant footprint in the U.S. through OptBlue and believe that a fourth quarter promotional campaign represents an excellent opportunity to make our card members aware of the millions of new locations where American Express is now welcomed.","Third, further building on the success of our U.S. card acquisitions across all of our products, including the distinct opportunities present in the consumer cards segment. Fourth, increasing our acquisition efforts in key international markets to build upon the positive momentum seen in our international business. And last, supporting all of these efforts through an increased brand advertising presence around the globe to drive greater penetration and share of mind with both consumers and merchants.","We believe that the fourth quarter provides an opportunity to bring together and leverage the combined impact from all of these initiatives to best position the company for growth in 2017 and many years beyond. As a result, we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 will be significantly higher sequentially and that for the full year, M&P will be more than 10% above 2015 close.","Moving now to capital, we continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 92% of the capital we have generated to shareholders, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average shares outstanding. While we will, of course, be subject to the annual CCAR process going forward, we remain confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.","So, let me now conclude by going back to the key themes in our results and providing an update on our outlook for the balance of the year. During the third quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remain focused on our cost reduction efforts and continued to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.","To put the third quarter into the context of our full year plan, as a reminder, the beginning of the year, our outlook was for full year 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, excluding restructuring charges and other contingencies. We also pointed out that consistent with our history we expected to use a portion of the portfolio sale gains to fund the increased spending on a range of growth initiatives across the company. We also said that we expected to use the gains to fund spending throughout the year, which would result in some unevenness in our quarterly results. On last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we updated our outlook and said that we expected full year 2016 EPS to be at the high end of the $5.40 to $5.70 range. We also said that the competitive dynamics within the U.S. consumer space created a bit more uncertainty around our second half assumptions.","Today, while competition remains very intense and the environment will continue to evolve, we have greater clarity about the trends we are seeing due to our actual results this quarter. This clarity combined with continued favorable trends in credit and operating expense performance offset partially by the increases in marketing and promotion and rewards that I discussed what would have allowed us to raise our full year 2016 EPS guidance to be between $5.90 and $6. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.","Turning to 2017, our outlook for full year EPS to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged at this time. Given the faster than expected progress on our cost reduction initiatives, we do now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017 will be lower next year than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario. Depending upon our operating performance and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, we believe that the accelerated operating expense savings we are achieving could provide us with the flexibility to have higher levels of marketing and promotion next year than in our Investor Day scenario while still tracking towards our $1 billion cost reduction target as well as our earnings target for 2017 of at least $5.60.","We continue to believe we have the right strategy in place to meet our objectives in 2017 and to build a solid base for driving longer term growth. We are pleased that our results so far this year have provided us with the flexibility to bring together marketing efforts in the fourth quarter around the host of initiatives I outlined earlier, while also raising our outlook for full year earnings. We are clearly operating in a challenging environment, but are intensely focused on executing the plans we have in place.","Toby Willard","Great. Thanks, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Ryan?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Craig Maurer","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Limiting it to one question, if we do see a rise in interest rates, do you expect there to be any change in the competitive environment as it would seem low credit combined \u2013 advantageous credit combined with low rates has allowed what you could call some second rate players to simply throw cash at the problem in the form of Cashback rewards?","Jeff Campbell","Well, Craig, I guess a few comments. We run the company and try to make our decisions based on a very long-term view of how we build long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by creating long-term relationships with our card members and merchants. Frankly, when we do that, we take it through the cycle view of the economics as we make decisions about what we can get good investment returns on and what we can\u2019t. And so that leaves us believing that we should be aggressively investing where we see opportunities regardless of where we may be in the cycle. It is a competitive environment right now. But what I would say is that in response to that competitive environment, we try to stay very focused on our longer term goals and on creating the kinds of products, value propositions and offerings to our card members and merchants that bring to us people interested in the same kind of long-term sustainable value and relationships that we are after. Now, what is the rising interest rate environment as mean for that, well, certainly for us, I think everyone would recall that given the significance of our charge card franchise, for us all else being equal, rising interest rates are \u2013 cost us a little bit of money. 100 basis points all else being equal is a couple hundred of million dollars. On the other hand, rising interest rates, in theory, should be accompanied by reasonably good economic conditions and that generally provide some kind of offset. So we feel very comfortable that we have in place a range of strategies and tactics that will drive and be economically sustainable through whatever economic environment we face with these rising interest rates. What that might mean for the competitive environment, we will have to see, but we try not to make decisions counting on any particular change in the competitive environment.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line now of David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Good afternoon. Just talking about the incremental investment spend, particularly in your Platinum product, was this \u2013 how much of it was reactive versus proactive in response to a new entrant late in October and to what extent will this continue and kind of what\u2019s the pace of investment, we kind of felt a taste of that due to a recent value prop increase, but what else next?","Jeff Campbell","I think it\u2019s a good question, David. What I would say is we are continually working to maintain and keep vibrant what we believe is by far the gold standard in high end cards and that\u2019s the Platinum product, both in the consumer market and the small business market. And you see as part of that us steadily and consistently evolving the product. If you think back over the last few years, every year have seen steady enhancements to the product from the introduction of the Centurion lounges to expansion of various travel oriented credits around TSA PreCheck and Global Entry through status that we are able to offer people through things like our partnership with Hilton HHonors. And so you see a very steady stream of these things. And there is a lot of thought, a lot of planning that goes into them. And what we have announced earlier this month is the latest in that steady stream. And as I said in my prepared remarks, you should expect more, so none of those things happen in response to any particular move by our competitors. They are all very long in the planning, but they all do stem from a general view of how we view the competitive environment evolving in general and how we think we can best evolve the product to take advantage of the broad range of brand and service and global reach that we can bring to our customers that are the kinds of things that we think let us stand out and are very difficult for competitors to match.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. And I guess I don\u2019t want to beat the rewards thing to death, because there are so many other things to focus on. But with the Sapphire card and I would imagine that when you put your planning together, that you were aware that you would expect the Costco, Citi would have very aggressive marketing programs, but are you seeing \u2013 have you seen in effect on the cancellation rate or lost cards from these new competitive products and the rewards that you have put in place and the changes that you put in place, do you think that, that\u2019s good enough to slowdown any competitive loss and then possibly lead to American Express starting to gain market share instead of losing market share?","Jeff Campbell","Well, there is a couple of good questions there Bob and let me start by talking about a couple of different product value propositions. When you look at the Platinum franchise, I would point out to you, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we have seen very nice growth both in numbers of Platinum members in the U.S. as well as the fee income from Platinum members over the course of the past year and that was a contributing factor in our card fees being up 10%. So I would start there and say we feel pretty good about that franchise and its part of why we are continually thinking about how we enhance the proposition in response to the evolving environment. When you look at the Cashback climate, we have been very successful. And again in my prepared remarks, I talked about a particularly good growth we have seen in the U.S. consumer space with our Cashback products. So we feel pretty good about those value propositions. So we will have to \u2013 it\u2019s far too early to see any impact from things that have only been launched in very recent weeks and months. And there is \u2013 I said a few minutes ago, we are in the game for the very long-term to build long-term relationships with our customers. We believe we have product value propositions that are about creating the kind of relationship with our card members that goes on for many, many years. I would point out that when you look at our Platinum franchise, in many ways is built upon a group of people who stay with us for decades, not for short periods of times. So we feel pretty good about all those value propositions. In terms of market share, we have many, many different products across the consumer small business and commercial segments.","When you look at the U.S. market in total across all of those segments to remind everyone we found ourselves gaining quite a bit of share in the couple of years right after the financial crisis and ignoring the portfolio sales for just a second. We have had some modest share declines in the last couple of years. First and foremost, we run the company to create value, financial value for our shareholders. We create product value propositions that we think are attractive to our card members and will create long-term value for our shareholders. Certainly as we make decisions, one factor we consider is what\u2019s happening with overall market share. But I would say our number one goal is how we create long-term sustainable financial value, and market share is just one factor that goes into that. So we are not ever happy or content to see ourselves losing a little bit of market share we have lost in the U.S. over the last couple of years. I would point out that outside the U.S., we have been gaining share in almost every market in which we operate. But I would close by saying our number one objective though is making the right decisions to build sustainable financial value.","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Jeff, I was wondering if you could help us with the run-rate of expenses as we move into 2017. I know 2016 has a lot of numbers, not a lot of stuff in there, but maybe you could just help us with how to think about the beginning point for 2017 off of which you will have those expense saves? And then secondly, just as far as the rewards costs are concerned, can you just help us think about how to think of the impacts to the rewards rate on the expense line and the discount rate as far as the cash rewards are concerned? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well, there is quite a bit there. Sanjay let me take a cut at a few of those. On 2017 expenses broadly, I guess, I maybe break them into three categories: operating expenses and M&P and rewards. So to remind everyone, in March at our Investor Day, we showed one scenario for how you might get to our EPS target for 2017 of earning at least $5.60. In that scenario and we did point out there were other ways to get there as well, but in that scenario, we had operating expense in 2017 of $10.9 billion. And what I am telling you this evening is when we look at the progress we have made in identifying and executing on a range of initiatives, we will do better than that. Just how much better, we will have to see, but we will clearly do better and we feel good about that and we are continuing to work everyday to find more money and get the number as low as we can. The next thing I said in that Investor Day scenario is that versus a 2015 base of M&P of about $3.1 billion, we thought we could trim as much as $200 million to $400 million. We will have to see on that one. I would tell you that certainly to the extent we can do better on OpEx, to the extent we have revenue trends that allow us to achieve our financial bottom line targets, I suspect we will probably not pull down M&P as much as we suggested in that Investor Day scenario both because we may have the financial flexibility enough to do it. And look, I am certainly not going to sit on this call, Sanjay, try to argue with people that the environment doesn\u2019t continue everyday to be a very, very competitive environment. So, our M&P probably comes somewhat off that 2015 level, but perhaps not as much.","Rewards is certainly a moving target, because it\u2019s a function both of the new value propositions we put in the marketplace with Platinum as well as the evolving mix across our Cashback cobrand and proprietary portfolios. So on that one, I will tell you, other than the directional comment that beginning with the fourth quarter, you will see a reversal of the trend we have seen the last few quarters where neutral rewards have been growing a little bit more slowly than billings that will clearly reverse in Q4. It should be clear to you we have been planning that for some time. That\u2019s why going back as far as Investor Day, I said built into the 2017 numbers and the scenarios we showed for what might happen beyond, we had assumed that rewards cost will grow faster than billings. But I think, Sanjay, I am probably going to wait one more quarter until we provide a little bit more insight into 2017 to be much more specific than that and the Q4 results I think will help everyone begin to calibrate as well.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Brendler","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. First question on the UK, you see an acceleration there. I think it\u2019s reflecting the same question I asked last quarter, it was 10% I think last quarter FX adjusted, now it\u2019s 16%, lot of competitors sort of reacting to the interchange reductions there. What\u2019s your strategy there? Are you gaining share because you are sort of holding the line of rewards in the face of the interchange reductions? And is there any color you can provide on your outlook for the UK business given that sort of competitive advantage at this point? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well, I do \u2013 we are pleased by the growth we have seen in the UK, which has been in the double-digits, above 10% for quite some time now. And then I would also point out, as I said earlier, that, that is typical of the majority of countries outside the U.S. where we, in most countries, not all, but in most do find ourselves are gaining share albeit starting from much smaller basis in share than what we have in the U.S. We have a very flexible business model. You hear us talk a lot about the many different advantages of having a closed loop model gives us and we talked a lot about the value that we get from that fact everyday we have to go out and negotiate with merchants to demonstrate our value. And everyday, we have got to demonstrate our value to card members. That is giving us some flexibility in the UK and across Europe to try to craft propositions for both the merchants and card members that people find very attractive as that environment evolves. So, we are pleased with the growth in the UK. I would say that growth has been strong for some time, but it does seem to have picked up even a little bit more steam as you look at this year. So, we are pleased with that and we are working hard all across the EU to further build on that momentum. I would remind everyone however that in the nearer term an offset, which we talk about when we talk about the discount rate is that we are in a multiyear process probably of slowly renegotiating many of our merchant agreements in Europe. And as we renegotiate them because of the caps on interchange, there is more pressure on us in many ways to keep the differential similar, but bring the absolute breakdown and that\u2019s part of what we have been talking about for some time now. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s putting some unusual downward pressure on our discount rate. So, that is an offset that we should remember to some of the nice volume performance we are seeing in Europe.","Chris Brendler","Thanks so much, Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the success you have talked about in digital marketing with the 1.7 million accounts you added in the U.S. this quarter and 5.9 million year-to-date. Are you seeing improvements in your cost of acquisition relative to what you have seen in the past and is that a function of being digital or you are just getting better at acquiring customers than maybe were a couple of years ago?","Jeff Campbell","Yes. There is probably a couple of different phenomenon, Chris, worth commenting on. So yes, every quarter, we get better, more sophisticated more thoughtful about how we leverage our closed loop data in terms of making our digital marketing more effective. And that\u2019s why across the globe in our consumer businesses, the majority of our new card member acquisitions for sometime now have come through digital channels. So, one of the reasons why we believe we can moderate marketing and promotional spend over time without losing traction on accelerating revenue growth is every quarter, we get a little better in digital marketing. It is far more economically efficient than some of the other direct mail or depending on what country you are in and the world we used direct sales channels sometimes in a few countries. The one thing I would acknowledge that goes the other way a little bit is certainly our relationship with Costco provided a really good source of acquiring new customers and that was a very low cost acquisition channel and they were good customers attracted to two good brands. So, we have lost that. One of the things internally that we do look at that and are pleased by is as we have lost that channel, we have effectively had to completely replace that acquisition effort with efforts in other channels. Digital has played a big part of that and we feel we have crossed the threshold, if you will, where our acquisitions now even though we have lost that one big former channel, we are above what they were in the prior year and we feel good about that mix. I would say though that certainly not all of our card member acquisitions are digital yet, and one of the positives to me about that is it means I see many years still ahead of us of getting better every year and that\u2019s going to give us a little bit better economics every year. So thanks for the question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. Jeff, most of my questions were actually asked, but I was just hoping you could kind of discuss the performance of the global merchant services, the growth rate in revenue, you talked about \u2013 you mentioned Fidelity in your comments, but talk a little bit about the revenue growth and margin trends there, if you could?","Jeff Campbell","Yes. I would remind Moshe, you and for everyone, as we re-segmented the company after \u201810, reorganized the company late last year, we created the four new segments. In the new segments, what we call GMS, which is led by Anr\u00e9 Williams represents our merchant and loyalty businesses. That business does not have in it the \u2013 what we call the GMS or network business, which is the business that goes out and negotiates with third-party issues such as the third-party issuer of the Fidelity co-brands. That business is reported in our international consumer segment for the most card part because most of those are relationships are outside the U.S. Fidelity was one of the small number that were in the U.S. So with that as background, when you look at the GMS segment, quite frankly, it\u2019s really going to track the overall company because what you are really seeing in that segment are the acquirer and network economics that go with the issuing done by the consumer in commercial segments. What you see when you look at what we are calling ICNS or the International Consumer and Network Services segment, is the combination of our proprietary issuing businesses outside the U.S. along with the network business. And we do provide in the tables some information about the growth in the network side of the business, which continues as it has for many years now to be of the highest growth in terms of billing segment of the company. So with all that as background, what I would say is the GMS segment really just reflects the overall company economics. And I am not sure I would add a lot there. When you look at the performance of the GMS or network business, we continued to be very pleased by growth in that business outside the U.S. I would say the business in the U.S. is not a growth business. It was down this quarter driven by Fidelity and that would be one thing that I would say is not a particular growth opportunity for the company at least in the near-term. But outside the U.S., we see very nice growth in Europe, Asia as well as Latin America. So thank you for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Bruce","Thank you. Good evening and a surprising quarter in a very good way, so congratulations. My question relates to credit, you talked about competition being intense and most of that\u2019s around rewards. One of the other areas that we have noticed is there has been a lot more focus on growing loans across the board and we are seeing some expansion of the credit box, all things being equal, you guys have been growing fast yourself and you talk about higher loss rates, I guess I would like you to try to dimensionalize kind of where you are expanding the credit box versus what you think is just seasoning within the portfolio without really changing the composition, the overall composition of that loan book. If you could help us with that, that would be great. Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","It\u2019s a good question. Okay. I guess I would say a couple of things. As I said in my prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our co-brand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio of sales, we have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly coming from those co-brand card members with non-co-brand card members. And as a general statement, we find that the non-co-brand card members are more likely to revolve on their balances. They do have higher write-off rates, so the average credit quality is marginally below where it was for the co-brand card members. We price for that. That\u2019s part of why as I went to the net interest yield, our net interest yield sequentially has gone up a little bit because you are losing the lower yielding co-brand card members and you are gaining more non-co-brand card members where the yield tends to be a little bit better. So that\u2019s the one area where I would say there is some evolution in the nature of the card members. You add to that seasoning because you go through a process over the first year or 2 years that you require a revolving card member where they evolve through the credit process. And those are the two things going on that have led us for some time now to say we feel good about our loan growth. We think we can grow loans at the kind of rates we have been growing them for a very long time and we think we can do without materially changing the overall credit profile of the company. Because I would also just remind you the other reason that we have been able to do that for some years now, because remember it\u2019s not \u2013 we didn\u2019t just accelerate our loan growth, it\u2019s been well above the industry for several years now. And you haven\u2019t seen a change in the relative credit profiles. We are able to grow loans probably because we are just focused on it now and we are creating the products that are attractive to consumers in that area. We are creating marketing that actually drives people to the product and could we just have more focus on it here as a management team. And as you heard us say over and over again over the last year, we really were leaving a target rich opportunity for ourselves with our very low penetration into our own card members borrowing behaviors. And so that\u2019s a key difference I think Ken, between us and where others maybe because as we thought a few years ago to begin to accelerate our growth in loans, we really didn\u2019t have to figure out we are already capturing our share of our own card members behaviors. How are you going to attract new card members, we had a very different proposition ahead of us. We could just say well, what do we do to start tuning our marketing and products so that we capture more of our appropriate share of wallet that we already captured on spend. So I think that gives us a very different opportunity set than others may have. And I think it\u2019s an important component of why we had several years of growth above the industry while maintaining our relative credit positioning. So hope that helped.","Ken Bruce","Thank you. Yes, it does. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Don Fandetti","Jeff, I was wondering if we can talk a little bit about where your thinking is on the international strategy, it sounds like it\u2019s going to be one of the areas of investment that you highlighted, it\u2019s been a pretty strong area where some of the U.S. consumer businesses are feeling intense competition, can you talk a bit about what you are thinking, are you getting more aggressive there, or is this just sort of continuing the pace?","Jeff Campbell","No, I \u2013 it\u2019s a good question Don. And I do think we are trying to drive even more growth out of our international businesses. I will point out for some time now with the one challenge we had and Canada aside, we have seen really nice growth across our international consumer businesses. Our international small business segment, which is reported in GCS is \u2013 has consistently for some time now been our highest growth segment in the company. So we feel really good about the growth we have been getting and we will be doing a number of things to try to accelerate it further. When you say though talk about your international strategy, that\u2019s always a challenging question, because we don\u2019t have an international strategy. We have a strategy in the UK. We have different strategy in Germany where we are greatly able to leverage the tremendous strength of our business, which has really nice synergies. The card business, we have a totally different opportunity in Mexico where we have one of the largest market shares we have outside of the U.S. and a tremendous market position that\u2019s growing rapidly. We have a very different strategy in Japan where due to a relationship we struck with JCB many, many years ago, it is one of the few international markets where we have tremendous coverage. And that has been fueling growth rates in the double-digits for a number of years right now. Sorry, I could go on, but I guess my point is we feel good about the trends that we have seen for a couple of years now. We are trying to provide even more resource and focus to invest in the markets where frankly we see the greatest traction and I just named a couple of them. It might be go on, but I won\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t want to take too much of everyone\u2019s time. And it\u2019s really more about just putting more time, effort, resource and focus behind the things we are already doing.","Don Fandetti","And just as to quickly clarify I know it\u2019s not material, but the China activity pick up, is that outbound coming out of China, is that sort of just organic growth or are there new signings of deals?","Jeff Campbell","No, it\u2019s really organic growth. And so you do see the growth across all types, including outbound, but the biggest chunk is still intra China, where like all networks our share, we are allotted under the Chinese government\u2019s rules is quite modest, to put it mildly. So we like to thank we have continued to you very successfully build the brand and build presence of China. We have been able to do that without putting any capital into China. And as the Chinese government inevitably moves towards a more open and competitive market, we hope that that brand presence that we have been able to create is an asset that we will be able to leverage more over time in the future.","Don Fandetti","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with American Express [ph]. Please go ahead.","James Friedman","Hi. I want to ask Jeff, if you had any observations or comments about your incubation strategy, I remember a couple of years ago you sold your Concur out of your portfolio, I think you probably disclosed Foursquare and [indiscernible] in China, I was wondering are there any assets that you are particularly excited about, I think that you might monetize over time? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","That\u2019s a good question, James. Certainly, we were pleased in the last couple of years, I would say, you saw two in particular really significant investments that turned out quite well for us, the ICBC investment as well as the Concur investment. We do run, as you would find it, many if not most companies of our size and scale, a venture capital group. And we do have very modest investments in a range of companies across the payments and technology spectrum. I would say our goal there is really about making sure we stay very close to where innovation is happening across all of the spaces that are interesting to us. Our goal is to invest with companies where we can also create working relationships and operating relationships where we can help them succeed and we can also stay with the pulse. And our goal is not to necessarily as the first priority find ourselves making lots of money by buying and selling these stakes. That\u2019s not really the goal. And our goal is not to lose money. So from time to time, we have one of those companies that has some \u2013 take some kind of exit and there are modest gains that I don\u2019t usually even bother to talk about are modest losses. For now that\u2019s too quite a nice modest positive. But as I said, that\u2019s not the goal. There is nothing else in the portfolio that I would say is material at this point that an investor should be aware of. There are always investments are quite small.","James Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash","Hi, good evening guys. I will try to make this one quick. Jeff, you gave us a lot of detail in terms of the puts and takes on the expense base, whether it\u2019s the below 10.9 and\/or the marketing and promotion dollars, can you just \u2013 given all the customer acquisition that you have done this year, can you just help us understand the outlook for revenues, clearly you talked about a lot of different areas, small business, calling back market share, increase lending what you have talked about on this call, but can you give us a sense of how you are progressing relative to expectations on revenues and given this increased marketing spend that you are doing, could \u2013 is there a potential we could see higher than expected revenue growth?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I think Ryan, as you would probably expect me to say, we will have to see. We are pleased that when you look at Q3, you saw a little bit of sequential acceleration from the 4% you saw in Q2. We are pleased that year-to-date 35% [ph], I would remind everyone that our scenario that we showed back in March at Investor Day through 2017 had a 5% revenue CAGR, so we are already there. We as a management team, we are laser focused on thinking through the best strategies for accelerating revenue growth further into the kind of higher range scenario that we talked about beyond 2017 at Investor Day. But we will have to see. There is \u2013 we feel very comfortable and confident in the choices we have made, but there is a lot of factors, whether it\u2019s the economy or interest rates that someone brought up earlier or the evolving competitive environment. What I would say is we feel good about the earnings guidance we have given people for 2016 and 2017. We feel good about the revenue trends we have seen year-to-date. We feel good about the decisions we have made and we will see how that all plays out in 2017.","Ryan Nash","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Jeff, I was hoping that you might just clarify how we should think about net income for next year? I mean, obviously, you have given the guidance on the EPS and we know that there is going to be significant share repurchases and you have talked to a number of the expense line items. But how do we think about the net income and core profitability relative to, let\u2019s say, an annualized run-rate for the quarter that you just produced?","Jeff Campbell","Well, I would make a few comments. I think you should presume that we will execute upon the CCAR approvals that we have from a share repurchase perspective. And so that math will get you to some continued significant uplift in EPS versus net income. When you think about the quarter we were just in, I would say a couple of things. You would expect to see based on all the comments we have made a little growth in rewards costs relative to the quarter we just saw. On the other hand, we have a lot of operating expense that we are now confident we will get out as we get into 2017. We also believe we can moderate the marketing and promotional line somewhat. I talked a little bit earlier about the tubing and throwing that we will debate internally over the next couple of months about just how much. And then clearly, we are very focused on continuing to get good revenue growth and our goal is to accelerate it. So, you can sort of back into what that will mean depending on what you want to believe about where we end up on an EPS perspective. In some ways, I suppose the probably least variable of all the \u2013 variables I just talked you through would be share repurchase, because you can publicly see what we are going to do. Thanks to the CCAR process. So, that\u2019s probably the way I would think about it, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Toby Willard","Hey, Ryan, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. That comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rick Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I will try to be quick here. Jeff, you had talked a little bit about the distortion that\u2019s occurring is as you increase the mix towards Cashback between member rewards and the impact on net discount revenue. I am curious as we think about the fourth quarter and your emphasis on marketing \u2013 or excuse me, on growing the Platinum book, how we should think about that relationship, because I am assuming that\u2019s not a Cashback offer?","Jeff Campbell","Correct. Yes, so it\u2019s a good question, Rick. So to remind everyone, what I have been trying to do the last few quarters just due to the way the accounting rules work, we put our Cashback rewards up as a contra revenue and our membership rewards and cobrand rewards generally go down is what you see in the rewards line. So, we try to add all those up as they have been growing so much similarly in recent quarters. Rewards have actually been growing a little bit slower than billings. That will clearly change next quarter because of the Platinum changes. There were also in last year\u2019s fourth quarter a couple of true-ups that kind of one-time things you have from time-to-time that helped lower last year\u2019s Q4 rewards line. So the year-over-year change will look a little bit more exaggerated in this Q4 than in others. In some ways, it might be better to look at the sequential run-rates of rewards, Rick, to try to figure out what happens to the rewards line. But that Cashback counter rewards sequentially aren\u2019t going to do anything unusual other than just grow as the products grow. And the two things that will change on the rewards line are the implementation of these Platinum changes, which will clearly drive significant cost. How much? We will have to see what the take up is, etcetera, along with this accounting item that I talked about from last year. So hopefully, that\u2019s a little helpful in how you think about it.","Rick Shane","And the good news is that the clock is now ticking on anniversarying all of these adjustments. So 12 months from now, we won\u2019t be thinking about this quite as much.","Jeff Campbell","I think everyone will enjoy the October 2017 earnings call, Rick, when I don\u2019t have to do adjust at anything. Thank you very much for that reminder.","Rick Shane","You could be happiest guy out there.","Toby Willard","Alright. Thanks, everybody for joining tonight\u2019s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express. Ryan, I think we are all set.","Operator","Okay. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

","Today's discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remark, we'll move to a Q&A session on the financial results with both Steve and Jeff. ","With that, let me turn it over to Steve.","Stephen Squeri","Thanks, Edmund. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As our first quarter results showed, we had a solid start to the year. FX-adjusted revenues grew 9%, which marked the seventh consecutive quarter with FX-adjusted revenues up by at least 8%. Once again, this growth was broad-based and well balanced across spend, lend and fee revenues, reflecting the benefits of our integrated business model. Our adjusted EPS of $2.01 reflected good progress against our strategic imperatives as well as our focus on consistently investing in share, scale and relevance to drive growth. ","We added 3.1 million new proprietary cards in Q1, driven primarily by our digital acquisition efforts. We continue to expand our merchant network in the U.S. and internationally and billings growth remained solid across customer segments and geographies. Loan growth continued to be strong and credit quality remained at industry-leading levels. ","As you'll recall, we started the year with mixed signals in the economic environment. Since then, we've seen the economy grow at a steady pace, although not quite as strong as the robust levels we saw in 2018. Consistent with what we said at our Investor Day last month, we are not seeing any broad signals in our business of a significant economic downturn. ","Looking ahead, we continue to see a number of attractive growth opportunities across our businesses. And as you've heard me say on many occasions, we're continuing to invest to take advantage of those opportunities in order to drive revenue growth over the moderate to longer term. ","At our Investor Day, I also discussed 3 company-wide initiatives we're focusing on to help accelerate progress on our strategic imperatives. All 3 will build on and strengthen aspects of our business model that differentiate us from our competitors. As a reminder, these initiatives are as follows: We're focusing on our customer base as a platform for growth; we're adopting a more focused international strategy which is guiding how we manage our business outside the U.S.; and we're expanding our network of strategic partners to bring additional value propositions to our customers. ","There's good progress to report on each of these priorities. We're seeing steady increases in customer engagement and acquisitions from our Member Get Member referral program as well as through our innovative lending offerings such as Pay It Plan It for consumers and working capital loans for our SME customers. We're generating strong billings across international especially in our consumer and SME segments, and we are driving increased merchant coverage. And we made a number of announcements regarding strategic partnerships since the beginning of the year. ","I want to spend a few minutes on that last item. During the quarter, we renewed our relationship with Air Canada and revamped our consumer and commercial cards with Marriott's Bonvoy travel program. We acquired 2 digital platforms that we've been partnering with: Pocket Concierge, which provides restaurant reservations in Japan; and LoungeBuddy, which enables travelers to discover, book and access airport lounges worldwide. We announced the new AP Automation solution for SMEs with our partner, Bill.com. And we also announced the strategic partnership with SAP Ariba. And in China, we're continuing to make progress in developing our network offerings with our partner, Lianlian. ","The biggest news of course was Delta. As you know, we announced an extension of our partnership with Delta Airlines that will take us to 2030. This is a terrific step forward for both Delta and for us. Delta is our largest program partnership and it's one of the most valuable portfolios in the industry. Our 11-year extension is groundbreaking and perhaps unprecedented in terms of its length and breadth. And I wanted to give you a sense of how excited we are about the value-creation opportunity it represents for both our customers and our shareholders. ","First as a reminder, I talked at Investor Day about how the Delta partnership broadly fits with the 4 strategic imperatives that we're focused on. Delta shares our strong focus on a premium consumer customer base. Delta has a large base of business customers which provides many attractive opportunities to build on our strong position in commercial payments. Delta's global reach and scale help strengthen our merchant network in the U.S. and in many countries around the world. And last, Delta shares our focus on using technology capabilities to deliver digital experiences that help us become an essential part of our customers' digital lives. These common values are what has driven Delta to drive 8% of our billings and 20% of our lending today. ","So with that as background, Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian and I started meeting on a regular basis shortly after I became CEO. It became clear very quickly that we both appreciated the importance of this partnership to our respective companies. It was also clear that we had a shared interest in working more closely together to build something even bigger and better for both companies. ","Our existing agreement had 4 more years to run, but toward the end of last year, we started talking about the benefits of an early renewal. Given the potential we both saw, we wanted to think and act for the long term and avoid the short-term distractions or disruptions that could come if there was any uncertainty about the next stage of our partnership. We went to work on a renewal agreement so that we could focus our respective teams on growing the portfolio with innovative products and services for our customers. I feel great about where we came out and where we're going. ","The Delta relationship is now positioned to remain a key element in our strategy of growing our share, scale and relevance, producing great returns for our shareholders. Delta will continue to be one of the fastest-growing parts of our business as it has been for years. I would remind you that spending on our Delta co-brand products has grown by double digits annually for many years. And together, we've acquired more than 1 million new accounts in each of the past 2 years. ","With the certainty of our relationship now locked in until 2030, we can work together even more closely to sustain this momentum, growing the value every year for our mutual customers and for both partners. This means becoming even more integrated in our customer value propositions, digital efforts and how we run our businesses. As Ed Bastian said during Delta's earnings call last week, Delta will be investing alongside us to grow the portfolio and strengthen the ways we work together. Given this kind of commitment by both partners for the next 11 years and all the opportunities we see, I believe the Delta relationship will remain a key cornerstone of our growth across every dimension, including billings, lending, revenue, scale and profitability. So all in all, this is a great partnership for the customers and shareholders of both companies. ","In summary, I feel good about the progress we are making as a business, about our results this quarter and about our prospects as we look at the rest of 2019. As we stated at Investor Day and most recently when we announced the Delta renewal, we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year of delivering revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and adjusted earnings per share between $7.85 and $8.35. I remain excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders. ","Let me now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here today to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect a solid start to 2019. Let's get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. First quarter revenues of $10.4 billion grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, with this growth again driven by a well-balanced mix of growth across discount revenue, fee revenue and net interest income. As Steve mentioned, but it bears repeating, this is now the seventh consecutive quarter with FX-adjusted revenue growth of 8% or better. ","I would point out that as we continue to see a stronger U.S. dollar relative to last year against most major currencies in which we operate, our reported revenue growth is around 200 basis points below our FX-adjusted revenue growth. Now as you know, FX rates tend to move over time, and so we focus on FX-adjusted revenue growth trends. In fact, you might remember that just a year ago on this call, I was talking about 200 basis points of FX going in the other direction with our reported revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018 up 12% versus our FX-adjusted revenue growth of 10%. ","Moving down to net income. Our reported net income of $1.6 billion includes an increase to our legal reserves related to certain merchant litigation that was scheduled for trial in June and has now been resolved. Our reported EPS of $1.80 includes a $0.21 impact related to this matter. Given the discrete nature of this $0.21 charge, we are going to focus today on our adjusted Q1 EPS of $2.01, up 8% from the prior year, as we think it is a better reflection of our operating performance. ","Looking now at the details of that performance. I'll start with billed business, which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 6. Starting on Slide 4, we have broken out our billings growth between AXP proprietary and Global Network Services, our network business. As we continue to exit the network business in Europe and Australia due to certain regulatory changes, we think it's important to show these 2 trends separately. Our proprietary business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 9% in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. The remaining 14% of our overall billings which come from our network business, GNS, was down 4% in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, consistent with the prior few quarters. ","Turning to Slide 5, you will recall that during our earnings call in January and again at our Investor Day in March, I noted the growth in spending from our existing customers showed a step-up beginning late in Q4 of 2017 that became even more evident in Q1 of 2018. We attributed this acceleration, which occurred across geographies and the customer segments, to an increase in confidence in our customer base. As we got to the end of 2018, we began to lap that step-up. And in the first quarter, we see the full impact of that lapping dynamic resulting in a sequential deceleration in growth. ","Now to keep this in perspective, Steve noted in his opening remarks that we've been seeing the economy grow at a solid, steady pace this year. And though I don't want to get into the habit on commenting on intra-quarter trends, I think it is important to note that we did see relatively stable growth throughout the first quarter. ","If you then turn to Slide 6 to look at the billings by customer type for the first quarter, I would start by reminding you that our Global Commercial and Global Consumer segments are roughly the same size, representing 42% and 44% of Q1 billings, respectively, while Global Network Services makes up the remaining 14% of billings. ","Starting on the left with a large and global customer segment, we saw a 5% growth on an FX-adjusted basis in the first quarter. I've mentioned before that growth in this segment can vary a bit quarter-to-quarter due to the large volumes a few customers can drive and due to the fact that this segment remained heavily T&E-oriented. More broadly on T&E, you can see in our earnings tables that we had solid growth in U.S. T&E spend of 5% in the quarter. ","Moving on to our small and mid-sized enterprise Card Members, or SMEs, U.S. SME grew 8% in the first quarter. We feel good about our continued leadership position in the U.S. SME space and the continued strong acquisition performance we are seeing in the segment. ","International SME remains our highest-growth customer segment with 19% FX-adjusted growth in the first quarter. During Investor Day, we highlighted the long-term growth opportunity in this segment given the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products. And we continue to feel good about our long runway for growth in this segment. ","Moving to U.S. consumer, which made up 32% of the company's billings in the first quarter, billings were up 7%, reflecting continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers despite the lapping impact that we've repeatedly discussed now as well as the Hilton portfolio acquisition in the first quarter of last year. ","Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the high teens as it was for all of 2018 at 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. We continue to have widespread growth across countries, with double-digit growth in Mexico and Australia and growth of 20% and 18% for the U.K. and Japan, respectively. ","Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 4% on an FX-adjusted basis driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia, where we are in the process of exiting our network business. Although network billings are down in these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia, the remaining portion of GNS was up 6% on an FX-adjusted basis. ","Overall then, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate. ","Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7. Total loan growth was 12% in the first quarter with nearly 60% of that growth, again, coming from our existing customers. We have now lapped the impact of the Hilton portfolio acquisition that took place in the first quarter of last year and contributed 120 basis points to growth in the fourth quarter. ","On the right-hand side of Slide 7, you see that net interest yield was 10.9%, up 10 basis points relative to the prior year. We've been saying for quite some time now that these increases were going to moderate, and so we are pleased that our yield is still increasing year-over-year. ","Turning next to the credit metrics on Slide 8. On the left, you can see that in the first quarter, the lending write-off rate was 2.3%, up 30 basis points to the prior year; and on the right, you can see that the charge write-off rate, excluding GCP, was 1.8%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. You also see on the page the delinquency and GCP net loss ratio trends. All of these portfolios are performing in line with our expectations, subject to typical seasonal trends and the fact that there is typically a bit more quarterly volatility in the charge rates. More broadly, as we said last quarter, we still do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment. ","With these metric trends, you can then see on Slide 9 that provision expense was $809 million in the first quarter, up just 4%. Now as you know, the accounting for provision is complex, and as an aside, is about to become much more complex under CECL. And I've often said that even today's complexity can drive some significant quarterly volatility at times. That quarterly volatility is certainly evident in the provision growth trend for the first quarter. ","The low growth in the quarter is primarily due to the lower level of reserve builds this year versus last year. As you will remember, we saw higher reserve builds in the first quarter of last year driven by acceleration in loan growth and the seasoning of our lending book. In addition, we are lapping the impact of a modest increase in lending reserves in the first quarter of 2018 from the Hilton portfolio acquisition. ","In contrast, given the relative stability we see in our lending portfolio today, we are not building reserves at the same level this quarter relative to a year ago. More broadly though, stepping back, as you think about the full year during our fourth quarter earnings call, we said we expected provision growth of less than 30% in 2019. Given the positive underlying trends we saw in the first quarter, we now expect to do somewhat better than this with provision growth in the mid-20% range for the full year. ","Turning now to revenues on Slide 10. FX-adjusted revenue growth was 9% in the first quarter driven by broad-based growth across spend, lend and fee revenues. As I mentioned earlier, the FX impact to our growth rates in the first quarter was significant due to the year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the major currencies in which we operate beginning in the third quarter of last year. Assuming the dollar stays roughly where it is today, that effect should lessen as we go through 2019. For those of you interested, I would remind you that we share our exposure to top currencies in the appendix of the earnings slides that you see on our website today. ","Moving to Slide 11, you see the components of our total revenue. The portion of our revenue coming from discount revenue and fees remained at 80% in the first quarter, in line with 2018. Discount revenue was up 5% on a reported basis and was up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis, which I'll come back to on the next slide. Net card fees grew 14% in the first quarter which is in line with the momentum we saw exiting 2018. ","We feel very good about our ability to maintain strong growth in net card fees given the breadth of products that drive this momentum and the high engagement that we see with new and existing customers. As just one example, this quarter, we saw 67% of our consumer new account acquisitions come on fee-based products. ","Net interest income grew at 12% in the first quarter, more in line with loan growth as our yield growth moderates. I would remind you that rising rates do represent a modest headwind for us given the size and scale of our charge business, and we have higher funding cost this year due to the rise in interest rates relative to last year. This impact of rising rates on our funding cost is being partially mitigated though by the great growth we are seeing in our online personal savings deposit program which has increased by 25% over the past year. As we have said, we continue to expect this to be the fastest-growing part of our funding stack. Stepping back, I would point out that unlike many other financial institutions, the latest interest rate outlook for the rest of the year represents a modest upside for us relative to what we saw as we put together our original outlook for 2019. ","Turning now to Slide 12 to cover the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue. As Steve and I continue to say going forward, our focus will continue to be on driving discount revenue growth, not the average discount rate. And on the right, you see that discount revenue grew 7% in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, roughly following our billing strength, making this the sixth consecutive quarter with discount revenue growth above 6%. ","Turning now to our expenses on Slide 13. Let me first point you to operating expenses, which were up 10% in the quarter. There are a few discrete items impacting the growth rate, including the increase to legal reserves in the quarter this year and a charge related to the sale of our prepaid operations in the first quarter of last year. Excluding these items, we continue to have well-controlled operating expenses. Our ability to generate steady OpEx leverage continues to be a key part of our financial model and one that we have confidence in sustaining over the long term. ","We continue to invest in our customer engagement cost which you can see on Slide 14 in which we're up 12% in the first quarter. Starting at the bottom with marketing and business development, I'll remind you that this line has 2 components: Our traditional marketing and promotion expenses; as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners. Marketing and business development costs were up 17% in Q1. Last year, you saw a little bit of back-end loading in the spending we did around customer engagement, specifically in the marketing and business development line. ","As I mentioned during our Investor Day in March, we expect in 2019 that our marketing spending will be more even across the 4 quarters. As a result, you see a little higher year-over-year growth rate in these costs in Q1. Just for clarity, I would also point out that when we announced the partnership extension with Delta, we said there was no impact to our Q1 results from the new agreement, and we'll come back to Delta at the end of my remarks. ","Moving on to rewards expense. You can see that it was up 4% relative to the prior year. We would typically expect to see rewards expense grow roughly in line with proprietary billing. However, there were a few discrete impacts this quarter that drove somewhat lower growth. ","Continuing on to Card Member services. We're up 34% in the first quarter. As we've said for some time, we expect this line to be our fastest-growing expense category as it includes many components of our differentiated value propositions which we believe are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the level of customer engagement we see with our premium benefits and services. ","Turning to capital on Slide 15. Our CET1 ratio in the first quarter was 10.8%, near the top end of our 10% to 11% target range, and we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders. Over the course of the last 5 quarters, we have built our CET1 ratio back to the high end of our 10% to 11% target range after absorbing the impact of the Tax Act. This is a real testament to our high-ROE financial model. Going forward, I'd remind you that next quarter will be the last quarter of our 2018 CCAR share repurchase authorization of $3.4 billion. After that, we will continue to focus on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10% to 11% target range. ","In terms of capital usage going forward, you should expect us to continue our past philosophy. This means that you can expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings as it has historically. We will use a modest portion of our capital to continue to support our organic growth and for the occasional acquisition. And we'll return the remainder of our capital to our shareholders while remaining within the 10% to 11% CET1 target range. Since we are focused on staying in our 10% to 11% CET1 target range, you will see some quarterly variability in the amount of our share repurchases due to seasonality. But our longer-term commitment remains unchanged. ","Now let's talk about things moving forward and then we'll open the call for your questions. As Steve mentioned, the 11-year extension of our strategic partnership with Delta marks another key milestone in our highly successful long-standing relationship. Today, it's one of the fastest-growing parts of our business with many years of growth above the company average. We look forward to many more years of this strong growth which generates attractive economics for both companies. ","Although there was no impact to our Q1 '19 results from the contract renewal, we do expect an increase in the marketing and business development line of approximately $200 million over the balance of the year relative to our original outlook under the previous contract terms. As you would expect in today's competitive co-brand environment, there is some margin compression when these partnerships are renewed. However, this agreement will continue to generate attractive economics for us each and every year of its term. We are excited about the opportunity to continue to grow the partnership and drive ongoing benefits for our customers, our partner and our shareholder. ","So that brings us to our outlook. We are affirming again our guidance for the year of having revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and having our adjusted earnings per share be between $7.85 and $8.35. During our earnings call in January and at Investor Day in March, we said that the lower end of the EPS range is there if there is some more significant economic slowdown relative to 2018. As we sit here in April, we see a stable, growing economy, albeit not quite at the levels of growth we saw in 2018. As a result, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on our outlook for 2019. ","One final point which relates to our Investor Relations team here at American Express. Steve and I have decided to move Edmund Reese to a critical new role within the company as the CFO of our largest and most critical segment, our Global Consumer business, working closely with Doug Buckminster, who you all know. I'd like to thank Edmund for leading the IR function during a period of strong performance for the company. On a personal note, I will miss the passion and relentless drive for creating value for our shareholders that Edmund has brought to the IR role. I'll look forward to seeing the great things he will no doubt accomplish with Doug in our Global Consumer business. ","I'd also then like to welcome Rosie Perez, our new Head of Investor Relations effective immediately. Rosie was most recently the CFO of the Global Consumer Products and U.S. marketing business and has had a number of key finance positions over her 11 years with the company. I'm sure you will all benefit from Rosie's keen insights about our business as you get to know her. ","With that, let me turn it back to Edmund one last time.","Edmund Reese","Thank you, Jeff. [Operator Instructions]. We will be ending the call a few minutes before 9:30 am prior to the market opening. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will open the line for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research.","Craig Maurer","First, congrats, Edmund, and congrats, Rosie. My question is about Delta. I was hoping you could sort of couch the comments that were made both by Delta and you guys today to help us understand how much of this new agreement relies on enhanced economics for Delta versus just what would be standard kind of improvements in the contract for Delta as the portfolio grew.","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, let me start, Craig, by making a few financial comments then I'll let Steve comment a little more broadly. So we have had tremendous growth over the years with Delta. And in fact, if you were to look at the things we said at the time of the last renewal in 2014, you would see tremendous growth between the numbers that both we and Delta talked about in 2014 and today. And in fact, if you look at some of the numbers that Delta has publicly talked about over the last few weeks, and you run that forward, you basically see about the same growth rates. ","So this has been a tremendous part of our business model for many years, faster growing than the company average. And what this agreement does is lock in both of our commitments to keeping this as one of the fastest-growing parts of our company for many years. And that's the key source of economics for both of these things. Now sure, when you renew these agreements, as we talked about in 2008 and 2014 and today, as we talked about with Hilton and Marriott last year, there is always some update to market terms. But we have a long track record of growing right through those modest updates to market terms and this is really about the partnership growing and driving value for both of us.","Stephen Squeri","Right. So let me just make a couple other comments. When you -- when Ed and I sort of met for the first time and started talking about our partnership, we realized just how critical this was to both companies. And when we got to November, what we both had said was let's put this sort of off the table for not only the foreseeable future but potentially forever, and that's why we decided to do this 11-year deal. And when you think about sort of that comment that I just made about forever, our intent is to invest side-by-side, our intent is to integrate from a technological perspective, to continue to integrate and leverage the huge amount of assets that we both have from a travel perspective, both business and personal travel, lounges, technological app integration, so forth and so on. And my view is, and I think Ed would say the same thing, we're going to grow this thing so big and we'll be in each other's DNA so much that come renewal time in January 1st of 2030, it will probably be much more of a formality to renew this versus any protracted negotiation. In 2030 I'm sure that there will be some economics that we'll talk about. Maybe it won't be Ed and I talking about them, but somebody will be talking about them. And we're really excited about it. ","The other thing I'll point out, and Jeff mentioned this, we're going to have a $200 million headwind this year. And that happens when you do this. But I think what's really important here is that will be the last time you hear us talk about this. We'll have this $200 million headwind this year and we're going to just continue to grow. And I'll refer to my remarks where I said this is about billings growth, it's about lending growth, it's about revenue growth and it's about profitability growth. And so I think this is a great deal for us, I think it's a great deal for Delta, but probably most importantly, it's a great deal for our existing customers, both of them, as they're going to get a better product and we're going to avoid that sort of dance that you tend to do two years before the deal is up and we're going to invest right through this. And so avoiding that, I think, is probably the biggest win for both companies and for our customers.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And congratulations to Edmund. Can you hear me?","Edmund Reese","Thank you, Sanjay.","Stephen Squeri","Yes, Absolutely.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Sorry about that. Yes. Congratulations to Edmund and Rosie and congratulations on renewing Delta and thank you for not having us talk about it for the next 3 years. I guess I wanted to drill down on the spending volume stats that Jeff mentioned and sort of the fact that they were even through the quarter. Jeff, could you just talk about how we expect that to continue as we move through the year? Because there were certain onetime items in the quarter related to holidays and such and gas prices. I mean, does that rebound as we move forward? And then as we think about the FX optics, too, I think those subside as well, right?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, so let me work backwards. On FX, of course, we don't try to predict FX rates. My comments earlier were just pointing out that if you take today's rates and you assume that they were to stay for the rest of the year, then you would see naturally just given what happened last year, the FX impact moderate as you go through the year. ","Look, we absolutely did see stable growth throughout the course of the first quarter, so we feel good that we are at a steady-state level consistent with the growth we see in the economy. In terms of -- when we net out all the various kinds of onetime items you talk about, I don't think there is anything that particularly drove the first quarter differently than what I'd expect to see in the rest of the year. So we feel good about the trends. ","I think perhaps more importantly, Sanjay, on the revenue growth side, which is ultimately what this is all about, we were right in the middle of our guidance of 8% to 10% for the year and we feel great about that start and we are very confident in our ability to sustain the kind of strong revenue growth that you've heard us talk about as our key first goal in terms of driving sustainable share, scale and relevance. So we feel good about the trends.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","I actually wanted to follow up on Craig's question. I want to commend you on renewing Delta. I think most people will recognize it's a valuable partnership for both you and for them. And clearly, they were pretty happy with the outcome. They had mentioned a contribution from Amex by 2023 of $7 billion, up from $3.4 billion this year. And that implies, if you just kind of straight-line that over the period, about $5 billion in 2021 versus their prior disclosure of $4 billion. So I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is how much of that is them and you feeling like the new partnership is going to help you expand the pie? And how -- or how much of that is them just getting a larger share of that pie?","Jeffrey Campbell","So let me start, Mark, but just maybe level-setting everyone with some numbers. And while I don't always like to quote numbers from other people, if you go back to when we last renewed with Delta, they do talk about what they call the overall remuneration, which I would remind people are payments we make to Delta for lots of things that we then use in our value propositions, as we buy miles from them, as we pay for lounge access, as we pay for things like free baggage, et cetera. So in 2014, they talked about a $2 billion number. If you run that forward to the numbers they've been talking about for this year, you're at a compound annual growth rate in the mid-teens. And if you look at the numbers they talked about for the future, you're pretty much at about the same growth rate. ","So this -- what we keep coming back to is this has been a great partnership where we have had very high rates of growth for some number of years. And with the 11-year deal now locked in so we're both comfortable continuing to invest, we're both very confident we can continue to grow at these kind of great rates. And that's the source of the economics. It's not particularly an inflection point from the path we have been on. You can also triangulate, if you like, on this by just looking at the numbers we provided at our Investor Days the last 2 years talking about the size of Delta relative to our overall billings and volumes. And again, if you just triangulate on those numbers, you're going to see growth rates all in the same kind of range.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I just wanted to talk a little bit about the loan growth. I know we've already talked about spend and how that trajected throughout the quarter. I wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the demand from your customers. And do you expect that there's an incremental upside to the loan growth as we go through the next couple of quarters here as the economy the markets obviously have done better? Or do you feel that at pace with recent trend is more likely? And then if you could speak a little bit about the international component versus the U.S. component as well. Like to understand if there's any incentives going on in the international side for spurring a little bit more loan growth.","Jeffrey Campbell","Maybe I'll start, Betsy, and Steve can add some business color. Look, we feel great about the now 5 years of growth that we've had a little bit above the industry. And as, Betsy, you've heard me say many times, we see that as color -- or driven by the unique opportunity that we have to correct our historical under-penetration of our own customers' borrowing behaviors. And we feel pretty great about 5 years of growing a little faster than the industry while growing our net interest yield and while maintaining best-in-class credit metrics. ","All that said, I don't particularly see an inflection point in the environment. I think the rates that we're at, and I'd remind you, most of our lending is still driven by U.S. consumer, we feel good about those rates. I don't know that we're particularly looking to accelerate. And in fact, if you look at some of the things I said at Investor Day, I talked a little bit about some of the risk actions we've taken over the past year. We are seeing really good growth outside the U.S. as we have only more recently begun to focus a little bit on capturing a greater share of our customers' card borrowing behaviors outside the U.S., that's still a pretty modest portion of the total. So while the growth rates are good, it's still not a particularly large driver of the overall growth in the portfolio.","Stephen Squeri","Yes. I would just go back to what I said in my remarks and what I said at Investor Day. I think this sort of the loan growth and offering more loans to our customers really focuses on the whole concept the customer is a platform for growth. And so if you even look at sort of how we're treading, we're even trending now even up even more with loans to our existing customers. So we're up almost 60%. So if you look at the 12% loan growth that we had in our consumer business, 60% of that growth has come from existing customers. And we're going to continue that. I mean, we're going to continue to focus on the product and services that our customers need. There's no reason to cede that to the competition. And we're looking at obviously working capital. And we continue to grow loans internationally for our consumer business as well, but it's a very, very small part of our overall loan book. So not much change going forward. It's steady as she goes, staying on course, and obviously looking at all the guide rails as we go along and managing the credit quality as it comes in. And you even saw at Investor Day how our overall FICO score has gone up to 740, which we talked about. So we feel good about where we are.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman","So as we start getting closer to the end of 2019, can you provide any updates on where you are relative to your U.S. coverage parity goal? And on that same topic, are there an incremental -- is there any incremental spending you think you'll have to make to drive yourselves over the finish line there?","Stephen Squeri","So boy, you're coming up on the end of 2019. But my grandfather used to say that July 4th, that the summer's over. But I guess for you, the whole year's over in April, huh? But anyway, look, we're still right on track. Virtual parity coverage by the end of 2019 in the U.S. We don't anticipate spending any more money than we already have in our plan or that we've -- or have been articulating. And so we feel really good about where that is. Now having said that, let me just explain what virtual parity coverage is. It doesn't mean that we might not find the restaurant here or the small retail shop there, but we're looking at sort of maybe triple 9s, five 9s, 99.99%, coverage here. And we feel really good about it. And when we find those places that just opened and may not accept the card, we'll jump right on it with our partners, which is -- the reason we feel so good about what we can do in international now, as I talked about at Investor Day, because of what we've done in the United States. And why we're taking a country focus and a city focus in international, is to really drive that coverage up using a lot of the same tools that we've used here in the U.S. to drive coverage. So bottom line, we feel good about it and we feel we're right on track.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Jeff, your comments about spending during Q1, some economists have talked a little bit about the fact that people who are kind of higher income but not wealthy might see unexpected kind of tax payments in April. Have you seen in the first couple of weeks any impact from that? Is that something we should be thinking about in Q2?","Jeffrey Campbell","That is a -- Moshe, I will say, common question we get. And as we look every year at spending patterns, it's really hard to see them impacted all by the timing around tax payments. And while I don't want to get too much into intra-quarter trends, it is April 18 and I certainly see no evidence of any kind of impact from people suddenly looking at what their ultimate tax due was and being surprised. So I think we feel good about the trends we saw in the first quarter. As I said earlier in response to Sanjay, we feel good about the sustainability of those trends. And in the grand scheme of things, I don't think that tax payments have much of an impact.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","I wanted to follow up on your comments about the benefit you're generating from lower-cost funding sources with a broad branding strategy question. So we've seen some of your issuing bank partners start offering enhanced credit card rewards to customers who also maintain balances with them. Is there a possibility that we could see Amex do something similar with enhanced Membership Rewards for customers who exceed certain deposit thresholds? ","And then separately but still on the topic of funding strategies, Amex in the past has concluded that debit products, that the offering didn't really make sense for you. But do you think there -- with the digitization that's taking place in the industry, could there -- could the debit offering perhaps become a bit more viable today than you thought in the past, particularly when you factor in the Durbin exemption that I believe you would qualify for?","Stephen Squeri","So let me take this. When -- as we think about sort of debit and we think about enhanced Membership Rewards, we constantly look at sort of the marketplace and the product offerings that we have to determine whether they're the right offerings or not. So you never say never as it relates to debit. I think the point that you bring up as it relates to debit is that with digitization, and I think there's no greater example of what you can do from a digital perspective than what we've done with personal savings and just the 25% growth that we've seen. So could you see a world or a day when you attach a debit to one of those products or attached debit to the Amex product? Possibly. But we're constantly looking. At it at this particular point in time, we don't really have any plans to do anything. We think the products and services that we have right now work just great. ","As far as sort of linking products together from a rewards perspective, let me take it up one level. And we look at the totality of the value proposition. And the totality of the value proposition encompasses not only the Membership Rewards, but investments that you might make in lounge, in co-funding benefits with partners. And you can go through across our product line and see just the various components, whether it's restaurant credits or airline credits or Uber credits and so forth and so on. And so as we look at it, we try and see what our customers really truly value. And if there comes a point in time where it makes sense to take more rewards and give rewards to personal savings, we'll certainly look at that as we look at things all the time. ","But right now, we like the value propositions that we have, and we continue to invest in those value propositions. And I'd just point out 2 of the acquisitions that we just made with LoungeBuddy here and with Pocket Concierge in Japan, which provides -- is going to provide more restaurant access. It's going to build upon the Cake acquisition and the Mezi acquisition that we did. And LoungeBuddy builds upon our entire lounge strategy. And we've just decided to make more investments in those areas at this point in time. But we certainly don't have our eyes closed. We really like to sort of manage this business with an external perspective. And if we find that, that becomes either an Achilles' heel or an opportunity, we'll take a look at it.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert Napoli","Jeff, I know you wanted some comments on CECL, but I don't want to use up my question on CECL. If you want -- because that's going to be some complications. But I did notice that you guys, on the B2B side, adding Ariba, SAP Ariba, and you have Bill.com. And I was just wondering some updated thoughts on the growth of B2B payments. And I guess you're using SAP Ariba for enterprise and Bill.com for SMB would be my thought.","Stephen Squeri","Yes. As far as -- like I say, I don't know if it was the fourth quarter you asked the question or the third quarter, I talked about how we sort of think about this market in sort of 3s from a B2B perspective. You think about sort of the real small businesses, and that's exactly where Bill.com is focused as we look to integrate working capital and we look to integrate Card. Then you look at some of the AP Automation players, and we think about that in sort of the midsized companies and less-sophisticated maybe larger companies. And then you look at SAP Ariba and you look at sort of the integration there for large and global companies. ","And what I would say about this sort of the SAP Ariba integration, the interesting part here for us is that what happens is the payment is completely integrated within the existing flow. But what's different is instead of just assigning a virtual account number, what we do is we assign the existing CPC card or the existing Corporate Card will spin off a virtual account number. So bottom line is the existing cardholders don't need to get new virtual card -- virtual account numbers, and that virtual payment sort of token that goes through will be tied back to their existing account. So there's no reissuance of cards and things like that. It's a seamless integration. And so if you have SAP Ariba, you have a Corporate Card, you're authorized to use it. You can put that in and it turns into a virtual payment. And it also provides some more control on the back-end because the supplier will not be able to continue to hit that card, it really becomes a onetime use for that transaction. ","So we feel really good about that. We feel that like there's good reconciliation capabilities. We feel that what we've done with sort of tying our corporate and CPC products to the virtual account technology works out really well. And that, we feel, is really a value of having, again, the integrated business model that we have. So we're excited about it and it gives us an opportunity to go after that segment. And just to point out, obviously, we're in really good shape from an SME perspective. But 50% of our corporate -- large and global Corporate Card clients use SAP Ariba.","Jeffrey Campbell","And Bob, I will admit we were surprised at Investor Day as well that nobody asked about it. I'll very quickly say this. Obviously, it's super complex as I said earlier. It's a little baffling to us that it doesn't fit very well with credit card and yet seems like credit card may be most impacted by CECL, which I'm not sure is the original goal of the regulators. ","Look, we have two things to think about. On the credit card side, our results aren't going be that dissimilar to others, although I don't see us at the high end maybe of what some others have said. What's unique for us just because of our charge card franchise, nobody else has that, and there actually reserves will go down. Now because our charge receivables are smaller than our lend receivables, on balance, I'd expect it to be a modest increase in reserves. For us, particularly from a capital perspective, I think this is manageable. But biggest challenge, I think, is going to be the volatility and complexity this is going to drive going forward as well as the pro-cyclicality. So there we go. CECL in 60 seconds. Next question.","Operator","That will go to the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","I'd appreciate your updated thoughts on the average discount rate for this year. The discount rate was actually flat year-over-year in the first quarter for the first time in a while, and I'm curious what your thoughts are on discount rate, especially as we approach the rollout of PSD2 in Europe where consumer ACH payments might be widely used for e-commerce transactions. In that environment, does that change your value proposition, especially in Europe?","Stephen Squeri","So let me -- I was going to kick this to Jeff, but let me address the back part of this. I think actually, that's probably an opportunity for us. I don't think it's really going to change our discount rate. I think what it does is gives us an opportunity, like many other financial opportunities, to jump in to some of the debit potentially, some of the ACH transactions and some of the cash transactions which we don't really have access to today. ","So if you had that under a discount rate model, yes, it would impact the discount rate. But this is why what I've been saying since day 1 is you have to look at the industry, you have to look at the country, you have to look at the economics of the overall transaction. And we have $1.2 trillion, $1.3 trillion of billings. If I put another $1.3 trillion on and it was at 50 basis points of what you would call \"discount rate\" and that was 50 basis points of profit and the discount rate was cut in half, who cares? ","So reality is it's all about margin and it's all about making money, but the reality is when you get back to sort of PSD2, and I see it much more opportunity for us to grab more revenue and to grab more margin as we move forward. And I really don't look at that as impacting the discount rate. I certainly don't see it impacting the discount rate that we have on our traditional products with those existing merchants and that might be a new fee structure that we look at. ","So -- and that's the reason why we haven't really been focused on the discount rate, right? Because as I've said before, this is what everybody has used as a proxy for the margin of the company and that's not really the way to look at it. And so we feel good about discount revenue growth and we're really going to continue to focus on discount revenue growth as we move forward.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Donald Fandetti","If you look at U.S. small business, the spend volumes have continued to be pretty steady and good. As you think about Amazon and you dig further in terms the penetration opportunity, do you think that billed business growth rates could potentially improve? And then secondarily, as we think about U.S. consumer cards, the view seems to be that competition has stabilized. In small business in the U.S., are you seeing players get more active or more aggressive? Can you comment on that?","Stephen Squeri","Yes, look, I think in small business in the U.S., people have been very competitive for a long time. I just don't think it's been something that everybody has focused on. In a lot of banks, small business is buried within the consumer business. In fact, for us small business was buried within the consumer business until 2 to 3 years ago. So I see that as a very competitive space. Not -- maybe not as crazily competitive as U.S. consumer has been. So -- but look, I mean, has competition reached a plateau? We haven't seen the same step-ups, would say, that we've seen in the past. But look, even with Citi and some of the other banks, what they've done now, and Bank of America as well, is when you -- and Bill Carcache brought this up before, as you then tie sort of your deposits to your credit cards and put rewards on that, that's another form of competition. But we believe our value propositions play well. ","So I think that when you think about the competition from a small business perspective, it's there. We feel that we have the assets of compete and have been competing very effectively and Amazon saw that same thing. The last point I'll make from a small business growth perspective, we have a very large base from a small business perspective, and small businesses go in and out. And so what you're seeing in that growth rate is not only all the new signings that we get, which is a pretty good number, but also businesses that close and so forth. So we'll continue to push with products and services and hopefully to continue the growth rate that we've seen over the last 3, 4, 5 years in the U.S.","Edmund Reese","With that, we'll bring the call to an end.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead, sir.","Rick Petrino","Thank you and welcome. We appreciate everybody joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s other reports already on file with the SEC.","The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.","With that, let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the Company consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as well as several discrete impacts including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and various changes to our cobrand relationships.","As you recall, we discussed at Investor Day our expectations for the first quarter and in fact EPS growth of 11% did come in better than our full-year outlook and even a little better than we thought a few weeks ago, in part due to the timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives which will ramp up over the course of the year along with some other timing benefits that we don\u2019t expect to repeat as we go through the year. I\u2019ll discuss these items in more detail later in my remarks.","Importantly for these reasons, our full-year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect EPS growth to be flat to modestly down. Looking back to the financial outlook framework from Investor Day, our core underlying performance remains consistent and continued to be driven by solid revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year, disciplined cost controls and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.","Our results also reflect some of the discrete impacts that we discussed a few weeks ago. In the cobrand space, we are seeing the impact from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada as well as the reset impact from the early renewals we have done with several other cobrand partners including Delta, Starwood and Cathay Pacific. In addition, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter and represented a significant headwind to our quarterly earnings performance. Importantly, during the quarter we also continued to have strong momentum on key initiatives, highlights included the expansion of our small merchant coverage through OptBlue, the announcement of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S., the signing of the new Charles Schwab cobrand along with the renewal of our cobrand relationship with British Airways in Iberia as well as the announcement just today of our new wearable payments partnership with Jawbone.","We were also very pleased by our strong 2015 CCAR performance which will provide us with the flexibility to increase our dividend and share repurchases going forward. As we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that these developments are indicative of the many attractive opportunities for growth as we have over the longer-term.","So that is the quarter and a simple summary. So we get into the detail, I will warn you that lasting the impact the 2014\u2019s Global Business Travel and Concur transactions along with the 2015 discrete impact of FX and our cobrand changes all combined to make understanding our results this year a bit more complex than usual.","To begin now with our financial results for Q1, as you can see on slide two, reported billings growth was 3%. Like many other global companies, the strength of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on our growth rates this quarter. As the dollar continued to strengthen, the magnitude of the FX impact increased and for the first quarter depressed our growth by nearly four percentage points. As a result, FX adjusted billings growth was 7%, significantly higher than our reported rate.","I\u2019ll provide more details on our billings performance shortly, but lower gas prices in the U.S. and the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada clearly had an impact on our results. Reported revenue growth of negative 3% was of course also impacted by FX as well as the inclusion of business travel revenues in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, consistent with both the prior quarter and recent trends.","Net income grew by 6% helped by disciplined expense control and lower provision costs, both of which also reflected some timing benefits in the quarter which helped to offset the discrete impacts of FX and the changes in our cobrand relationships.","Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 48 million shares which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This declined in shares outstanding along with the modestly lower tax rate drove the 11% diluted EPS growth that we generated during the first quarter. This performance also resulted in an ROE of 29% for the period ending March 31, well above or on average and over time target of 25% and demonstrates the continued strength of our business model.","Let\u2019s now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the first quarter, starting with billed business on slide three. On an FX adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 8% in Q4 to 7% during the quarter. Looking at the results by segment, in our U.S. consumer and small segment growth also decelerated slightly to 7% in Q1. This performance was impacted by the more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year as well as slower retail sales growth, consistent with industry wide trends in the U.S.","I would note that in the U.S. we did not see any material impact on our billings growth from the announced termination next year of our relationship with Costco. As you would have expected however, we have started to see some slowing of new Costco cobrand card acquisitions which along with any future customer behavior changes that we may experience will likely begin to impact our performance somewhat later this year.","It\u2019s also worth noting on billings that the deceleration in Q1 was more pronounced in our GCS segment or billings were up 4% on an FX adjusted basis as we seem to see a slowdown in spending across a number of corporate customers, primarily in the U.S. GNS continues to be our strongest billings growth segment with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the quarter. This continued strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the much higher than company average returns on equity we achieved in the GNS business.","Finally, ICS FX adjusted growth was 2% during Q1, but as we began to see last quarter, we saw very different trends by region, as you can see on slide four. The slowdown in international regions came primarily from LACC where volumes were down 4% versus the prior year, driven by a drop-off in Canadian billings.","As you recall, we began to see volume slow in Canada during Q4 when card acceptance at Costco in Canada was expanded to include other networks. Beginning January 1st, American Express products were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada and we are now seeing that full impact from the termination of this relationship on billed business.","In contrast to LACC, we saw improved growth in the JAPA region which was again the fastest growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan. In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates.","To provide you with some additional perspective here, on slide five, we have again included a comparison of our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last eight quarters. As you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on this slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with the recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the first quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our results than in prior periods, driving adjusted revenue growth down by nearly four percentage points. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the second quarter. As you can see in the second row, the bottom of the chart, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S.","Now of course this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom-line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically.","Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. As we discussed at Investor Day however, if the current rates hold, FX will continue to have a significant discrete impact for the balance of the year.","Turning now to loans, you see on slide six that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year. Consistent with historical seasonal trends, we did see a drop-off in loan balances versus year-end and a small sequential increase in net interest yield during the first quarter. In the U.S. which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth was relatively consistent to the prior quarter at 7%. On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and the decline in loans related to the Costco Canada cobrand portfolio.","Stepping back, our loan growth has consistently been above the industry over the past two years. And we talked at Investor Day about the opportunity to continue the strength by growing share with existing card members as well as attracting new customers to our franchise.","Having said this however, I\u2019d also remind you that net interest income this quarter still made up only 18% of our total revenues. And given the expected run-off in loans associated with the Costco U.S. cobrand portfolio next year, even if we continue to grow our core loan portfolio with the higher rates we have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend focused.","So now putting together, our billings and loan performance, you see on slide seven that revenues declined 3% on reported basis but increased by 5% after adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year. I\u2019ll note that revenue growth during the current quarter does reflect a portion of the negative impact from our cobrand partnership early renewals as well as a larger impact versus Q4 from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada. Even with these discrete impacts however, adjusted revenue growth of 5% is consistent with recent trend, illustrating the ongoing strength of our underlying core business.","The two largest components of revenue are of course discount revenue and net interest income. To start with the former, during the first quarter, discount revenue grew by 1%, which was approximately 200 basis points below the reported growth in billed business of 3%. The first driver of this difference was a decline in our reported discount rate, which was down 2 basis points versus the prior year. This year-over-year decline is slightly smaller than in recent quarters, in part because the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume where we earned a much slower discount rate, actually raises the company average discount rate. The discount rate also reflects continued growth in our OptBlue program, as merchant acquirers actively sign up new merchants onto the American Express network.","As Ed discussed at Investor Day, 14 of the top 15 merchant acquirers in the U.S. are now part of OptBlue. Last year when Anre Williams introduced this new program to you at the February financial community meeting, he said that we expect to increase our small merchant acquisition by 50% and more for the next several years, starting in 2015. And while this is obviously a multiyear effort, we in fact signed more than 400,000 new small merchants last year in 2014. So, we are clearly off to a good start. We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world.","Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was faster growth in both GNS volumes and the Concur revenue items, including cash incentives and certain payments related to our renewed cobrand relationships.","Turning to the other key component of revenue, net interest income, we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio, as well as lower funding cost. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income and on other revenue lines.","Moving now to credit performance on slide eight. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels and that our write-off and delinquency rates both remained relatively consistent with recent trends.","As you can see on slide nine, despite this steady lending credit performance, provision expense dropped 13% versus the prior year. Typically we experienced the reserve release during Q1 due to the seasonal decline in loans and receivable balances versus year end. The increase in the reserve release versus the prior year is largely to due to charge cards with the prior year period included a modest reserve build.","Moving to our lending reserve coverage levels on slide 10, coverage remained relatively consistent, after considering the impact of the seasonal decline in loans and receivables I just mentioned. We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.","Thinking about the balance of the year, it is important to note that we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and to represent a headwind to growth for the remainder of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multiyear financial outlook and assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.","Moving below revenue now to expenses on slide 11. On a reported basis, expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year. Excluding business travel expenses incurred in 2014, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% and also of course benefitted somewhat from the strength of the U.S. dollar. I\u2019ll come back to operating expenses in marketing and promotion at a knock. First however, I\u2019ll touch on a few other items on this slide.","Rewards expense grew by 4%, which was relatively consistent with our reported billed business growth. And rewards expense in the current quarter does include a portion of the discreet impact from our renewed cobrand relationships. The resultant increase in our rewards costs however was partially offset by some timing benefits this quarter related to our membership rewards program.","Next, while it\u2019s a relatively small percentage of total expenses, cost of card member services increased significantly year-over-year by 18%. As background, a portion of the expenses in this line are related to the payments we may provide partners for services such as baggage fees, companion tickets and airport lounge access, which have increased as a result of our renewed cobrand relationships. For the remainder of 2015, given the Q1 of last year also included elevated costs in cost of card member services, we would expect to see an even higher level of growth for this line item.","Lastly on slide 11, the tax rate during the first quarter was 34%, which was relatively consistent with recent quarters, but slightly below the prior year. As we mentioned at Investor Day, our assumption is that the tax rate will remain roughly in line with recent performance during 2015.","Let\u2019s turn now to marketing and promotion expenses which accounts for the majority of our spending on growth initiatives.","Slide 12 shows the trend of these costs. And you see that while this quarter\u2019s marketing and promotion expenses were 4% higher than the prior year, you\u2019ll also notice that these costs have historically been much slower during each year\u2019s first quarter. More broadly, as we think about 2015, we continue to evolve our plans around the timing and level of incremental spending on growth initiatives.","As we have said, the majority but not all of this spending will occur in marketing and promotion. Considering this, we would expect marketing and promotion expenses to be relatively similar with the elevated levels of 2014, which you can see on the slide included higher levels of expenses in Q2 when we have the business travel joint venture transaction gain and in Q4 when we had the Concur gain.","While we could have made the decision to reduce investments from their elevated 2014 levels, as we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that the right decision for shareholders to best position the Company for the medium to long-term is to keep investments at an elevated level this year in anticipation of the termination of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. during early 2016. As Ken, Ed and Steve discussed in detail a few weeks ago, the incremental spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we see across all segments in our Company including our efforts to capture a meaningful portion of the spend and lend of our Costco card members in the U.S.","Turning now to operating expense performance on slide 13, our reported results continue to reflect the impact of business travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line by line comparisons. That said, excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 2% in the quarter. I\u2019ll also note that during the quarter, we benefited from some specific items in the other net line which we do not expect to repeat going forward. As you think about the balance of the year, I\u2019d also point out that operating expenses have historically been lower during Q1.","Moving to slide 14, adjusted operating expense growth of course remained well below our stated 3% growth target. As we discussed at Investor Day, maintaining disciplined control of our expense, particularly operating expenses remains a key driver of our earnings performance. As Steve noted that day however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense controls or a cutback in investment levels but rather to ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization, we continue to make substantial investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives.","Now shifting to our capital performance on slide 15. During the current quarter, we returned 65% of the capital we generated to shareholders while strengthening our already strong capital ratios. As I mentioned at Investor Day, share repurchases of approximately $750 million for the first quarter were below the amount included in our 2014 CCAR submission due to some nuances in 2014 CCAR rules associated with the capital generated by employee plan. These rules have evolved for future CCAR periods but did cause our Q1 payout ratio to be somewhat lower than in recent quarters. I also point out that the 2015 CCAR process gives all participants more flexibility on the timing of share repurchases across the five-quarter CCAR approval period. Accordingly, the exact timing and size of our repurchases in 2015 will be driven by many factors including but not limited to the levels of our earnings and the demand for other capital uses.","Looking at our capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, you see a more significant increase year-over-year in our Tier 1 capital ratio. This was driven by the $1.6 billion in preferred issuances we executed during the last two quarters. As a reminder, we will see the EPS impact from the dividend payments associated with these issuances beginning in Q2. These payments will reduce our net income available to common shareholders by approximately $20 million each quarter.","Stepping back from these quarterly results, our strong relative performance in the 2015 CCAR process and the Fed\u2019s non-objection to our capital plan clearly illustrates the strength of our capital position and business model. This reinforces our confidence in the Company\u2019s ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength. And we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.","Before moving on to your questions, let me make just a few final comments. Stepping away from the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results, we believe that our core underlying performance this quarter was solid and reflected the continued strength of our business model and the trends we discussed last month at Investor Day.","Earnings per share growth of 11% was better than our full year 2015 outlook in part due to some specific benefits in Q1, most notably in provision and operating expenses and also because we have not yet seen a ramp up in incremental spending on growth initiatives. Clearly, given our 11% EPS growth in Q1, simple math would indicate that EPS growth would have to be negative for the balance of year to meet our continued outlook for full-year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.","Looking at the second quarter in particular, I would remind you that you will begin to see the impact from our recent preferred share issuances and that the prior year EPS of the $1.43 included in that benefit from the business travel joint venture transaction, considering this while it is obliviously very early in the quarter, we would expect earnings per share in Q2 to be more significantly down from last year. All this is consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance would be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full year earnings outlook rather than our performance in any individual quarter.","When we consider our Q1 performance and our Q2 comments in the context of the multiyear financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we believe we are on track and are continuing to do the right things to position the Company for the long-term.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session.","Rick Petrino","Thanks Jeff. As a reminder, in order to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the call, I will ask that those in the queue please limit yourself to just one question. Thanks for your cooperation in this process. And with that operator, let\u2019s open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. I guess my question will be on Costco Canada. I know you guys have addressed it throughout the last couple of times you\u2019ve spoken. But now that you have a full quarter\u2019s worth of experience at Costco Canada, could you maybe just talk about you know your ability to retain spending on those customers\u2019 cards and how you think it reflects, relative to your strategy in the U.S.? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Thanks Sanjay for the question. Maybe let me start by providing just a little bit of context for Canada because we\u2019ve given a fairly unusual amount of color around the U.S. where we pointed out that that relationship consists of about 70% of the cobrand spend being out of store, also talked about the cobrand in the U.S, accounting for about 8%of global billings. To draw a contrast to Canada, in Canada, the Costco cobrand and Costco as a merchant represented a more significant portion of our country total billings in Canada. The other probably two very important differences to point out to you are that the portion of spend on the Costco Canada cobrand that was in store was much higher, it was about 60% in store and of course in Canada there was no sale of the portfolio.","So with all that as context, you are correct that this is the first full quarter since the termination of acceptance of Amex products in Canada on January 1st. As you would expect that means all of the in store spend goes away. But we, while it\u2019s still early, I would say continue to be pleased as you now heard us say in a couple forums, by our efforts to capture the spend and lend of the Canadian Costco card members. And of course in Canada, we did issue a new cash back card. As you would expect we are very focused on those customers who clearly have an affinity with the American Express brand. And I\u2019d say there have been significant learnings and we are encouraged by them and we are being very thoughtful about how we will apply them in the U.S. As you would expect Sanjay, I probably don\u2019t want to provide a lot of color and detail beyond that general statement, but we are encouraged on quarter end.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The next question will come from Don Vendetti with Citigroup.","Don Vendetti","Yes Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about a potential gain from the Costco sale. I mean sometimes these portfolios can trade for 15% plus premiums. And can you talk about some of the offsets and how that may also impact your capital return, given that you\u2019re able to return more than 100% in the CCAR?","Jeff Campbell","Couple of comments, I really, in terms of the progress potential outcome, Don, on any portfolio sale, I can\u2019t really comment beyond what we\u2019ve already said, which is we\u2019ll just have to see -- there\u2019s a process and we\u2019ll see how it plays out. In terms of the financial outlook, we have provided, I would remind everyone that we did not include any assumption about a gain on the sale of the portfolio. So any gain would be incremental to the outlook we laid out.","When you think about capital implications, obviously if there is a portfolio sale, there\u2019s a significant reduction in risk weighted assets, that\u2019s the Costco U.S. loan portfolio as we previously talked about constituted about 20% of our global loan portfolio. That in and of itself depending upon how quickly we ramp our efforts elsewhere to replace that spend, that of course frees up some capital. And to the extent there is a sale and there is a gain, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019d have to look at the timing and amount of any gain and think about what portion of it we might want to use to make sure we\u2019re fully funding our efforts to capture the future spend and lend from our relationships with the Costco card members and what portion should drop to the bottom line.","Clearly, we have a very strong balance sheet already. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a very strong and steady commitment to using that balance sheet to return capital to shareholders. It\u2019s also fair to say though that the nature and timing of the CCAR process means there is often a lag between big developments that impact capital and our ability to run them through the CCAR process. So, we\u2019ll kind have to see how this plays out. But hopefully that gives you a sense Don of how we\u2019re thinking about the various components.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Ho","Good afternoon. Can we talk about the expense ramp in specifically what areas you\u2019re investing, particularly as we saw in the second quarter and maybe this quarter as well? And how are they different than some of the areas that you have invested in previous years and in particular coalition partners and do you expect the Costco USA build to accelerate towards the end of the year versus the middle part of the year.","Jeff Campbell","Good question, David. Let me make a few comments. One of the reasons why we have continued to talk a little bit about an expectation that you will see more quarterly unevenness in our earnings is we think the prudent thing here is to be a little flexible around the timing at amounts that we choose to spend around one of the things that we will be ramping our growth spending initiative, our growth initiative spending on and that\u2019s focusing on the capturing a future spend and lend from our relationship with Costco card members. It\u2019s very complex process between now and 2016 that will play out in that relationship. And we need a little bit of flexibility that will determine when we choose to ramp up some of our marketing efforts and when we do.","Certainly that is one of the elements though when you think about what is different this year, potentially next year about the range of things that we do growth spending on. We have a very rich pool of very dedicated American Express card members and we will do our best to capture their future spend and lend.","The second thing I might point out for 2015 is we are very excited about the launch of Plenti, since you brought coalition. As you would imagine or as you recall, we have a pretty well drawn track with the loyalty coalition business as we\u2019ve launched that in other countries for understanding the flows from the first year of launch which is more of an investment year and has as the program that matures in the coming years. So, it\u2019s fair to say that we want to make sure this is a really strong launch and we\u2019re putting a lot of resource towards that in 2015. And that\u2019s probably a little different in terms of the profile that you would have seen last year and a little different than what you will see next year as the progress moves beyond the launch phase.","Beyond those two things, I would say, really that we will be investing in the range of growth opportunities we have across the Company; we tried to do a pretty thorough overview of those at Investor Day and really expand the Company. So, you\u2019ll see us continue to invest in some of the international markets where we\u2019ve seen particularly high rates of growth. Basically you\u2019ll see us continue to invest around our small business and middle market efforts. You will see us continue to invest in some of the areas where we believe expanding the breadth of the demographic that our brand reaches out to is producing new opportunities and you will see us continue to do some things that we think will drive the steady growth in lending that you\u2019re seeing above industry averages.","So that\u2019s probably how we think about the spending overall.","Operator","And our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good evening, Jeff. Could you clarify for us what cost of equity or hurdle rate you use when evaluating new investment opportunities? And can you also discuss how your hurdle rates might differ across your different businesses including for example cobrand, particularly since it seems like your GNS and charge card businesses generate structurally higher returns and are big driver of that 25% plus return target that you have? I don\u2019t think you guys have discussed that in the past but I do think it could be helpful to the extent you can give some kind of indication would be helpful for investors to assess the risk that people have been worried about that you could lose, continue to lose future partnerships to competitors who are willing to accept lower returns?","Jeff Campbell","Bill, that\u2019s a good and actually very important question. So, we have a range of businesses across American Express and of course we have a fairly unique business model in our core business. That range of businesses and that business model produce a tremendous return on equity relative to most of our peers in financial services. And so, we are thrilled that we have an ROE which this quarter was 29% and we have really strong track record in meeting our more than 25% target. And I think it\u2019s a real commentary on the strength of more business model.","But we shouldn\u2019t confuse that with hurdle rates for incremental investments or for how we think about bidding for business. Because of course if we really look at our cost of capital, you will of course get to numbers far, far below 25%. And I can spend the rest of the call getting philosophical, but exactly how you might calculate our cost of capital when we look at it, as you would expect in many ways, but suffices to say it is much below 25% and it is somewhere around the 10% range depending on which measure you want to look at.","And when we are thinking about incremental opportunities in a bidding situation, I don\u2019t really believe that we would take a different economic choice based strictly on a hurdle rate. Now, we do make choices based on the next part of your question though which is we do have a range of opportunities in our business. And we generate a range of returns on equity and a range of returns on an incremental dollar of expense spending as well.","And so, when we think about opportunities, we\u2019re always making sure that anything we do is going to generate incremental value for our shareholders and be above our returns on capital, but we also have to think about the range of opportunities in the financial and managerial resources that we have to allocate across those opportunities. And one of the things you heard us talk a fair amount about going all the way back to the February 2012 investor call that Ken and I had on Costco is as we thought about where we were with Costco, one of the things we really thought about was the range of other opportunities we have; some of the non-financial constraints that a future contract might have entailed. And when we baked all of those things together, we came to the conclusion that in a long run, we would be better off pursuing another path. But I think it would be a real misnomer for anyone to conclude from that that oh! American Express is never going to pursue a transaction or piece of business that has a return on equity below 25%, so they are not competitive.","Our job is to create value for our shareholders. And of course I\u2019d like to create it at the highest possible ROE and I\u2019d like to create it in the highest possible parts of our business. But if I can create a new chunk of business at something that is closer to our hurdle rate, we will absolutely of course pursue that business if it\u2019s the best alternative in the long run for the company.","Operator","And the next question will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery.","Sameer Gokhale","Hi, thank you. My question was about your loss provisions and the reserve release. Jeff, you provided a bit of an explanation. I think you talked about the provisioning, the reserve release being more related to charge cards, I think this quarter, if I heard you correctly. But it just seems like between last quarter and this quarter there seem to be a lot more volatility than we\u2019ve seen I think at least in recent quarters; recent years between Q4 and Q1. So, were there any changes made to any underlying assumptions that would drive this kind of volatility? So, if you could just parse that out a little bit that would be helpful.","Jeff Campbell","It\u2019s a very accurate description, Sameer I think of where we are in the last couple of quarters. I would have to call this quarter\u2019s provision one that is certainly off the normal trend. I talked in my remarks about the fact that of course, you have a normal Q4 to Q1 decline in your loan and receivable balances and that does generally drive a seasonal therefore decline in your reserves and that happened this year, as it did last year. However, you have a combination of the fact that last year\u2019s first quarter had a few various more specific items that happen to drive that number up; a little bit this quarter, we had some of the kind of specific adjustments for items that you have every quarter in the provision that happen to drive it down a little bit. You put those two together and you suddenly get a really big year-over-year difference.","I think the more which is why I also in my remarks tried to point people to I think the more important thing to think about here is, as we look at the rest of 2015, in the current economic environment, we expect layoff trends to stay pretty strong. However, we\u2019ve been steadily growing our loan balances and you would expect reserves to build along with those loan balances. And some of these specific items that drove the Q1 results, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to repeat. So you put all that together and I would expect to see provision going up year-over-year in 2015. And I would also just remind you that in terms of what assumptions, we made in the financial outlook we\u2019ve given for 2016 and 2017, we did assume in 2016 and 2017 that you do see some modest uptick in write-off rates and hence provision and reserves.","Operator","The next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Jeff, can you just clarify in terms of the \u201816 broad guidance that you gave back in February and related at the recent Investor Day, does it contemplate the foregone net interest income from a sale of Costco portfolio, that\u2019s really I suppose?","Jeff Campbell","That\u2019s a good question, Eric. And what I would say is that because we can\u2019t be completely sure of the timing and outcome of any potential portfolio sale, we built an outlook for 2016 which we think we can achieve under a range of potential outcomes for the portfolio. And we\u2019ve built an outlook that to be exclusive does not include any potential gain on a sale. So, we think as a matter what assumption you might want to make about the resolution around the portfolio, we think we have enough levers in our business to hit the outlook we\u2019ve given for 2016. Now certainly there are some things that could drive you above that. If there is a gain on a sale for example that is clearly not in our outlook and would be incremental, but we just don\u2019t know enough about the final outcome and the timing of the final outcome to be specific beyond the comments I just made.","Operator","And the next question will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley.","Cheryl Pate","Just wanted to touch on billed business a little bit and if we can split it up into international and U.S. On the international side, I was just wondering if you could maybe spend a minute on how you think about potential hedging strategies to help offset some of the headwinds. And then on the U.S. side, if you could provide a bit of color for how you\u2019re thinking about trends as we look at the rest of 2015 and on top of that potential to maybe take some share with OptBlue similarly tracking a bit ahead of expectations? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Let me take those one at a time, Cheryl. On hedging, so we do some foreign exchange hedging but it\u2019s really about frankly helping us have a clear view from a planning perspective within a quarter. It helps us know what the FX impact is going to be. In essence at the beginning of a quarter we do a bunch of hedging that unwind as you get to the end of the quarter. So, you\u2019re not further impacted by anything that happens in the quarter. That obviously has zero impact on our longer trend or on the year-over-year declines. And as we think about doing any other kind of strategy longer term to hedge, our conclusion at the end of the day is that, we think there is value in the diverse set of global businesses we have we think in the long run; the currencies go up and down and tend to equilibrate over time and that the frictional costs and frankly the volatility that the accounting drives for any longer term hedging strategy has caused us to shy away from it. So that\u2019s how we think about hedging.","On the U.S., obviously we\u2019ll have to see where the economy goes as we get into the rest of the year. I think it\u2019s fair to say from our experience in the first quarter, we haven\u2019t started to see estimates of GDP growth in the U.S. or elsewhere, but I think when we look at our own experience and some of the external data around retail sales and we look at what\u2019s happening to gas prices, when we look at some of the immediately somewhat anecdotal stories we hear in our corporate card business, it suggests to us that it was certainly not the most robust of quarters for economic growth. So really in that environment for us to want to adjust for FX in last year\u2019s business travel, get to 5% revenue growth, we actually feel pretty good about.","When you think about the rest of the year, you\u2019re correct. I mean we\u2019re up about OptBlue; it is a multiyear effort. I want to be clear that when Anre Williams on our team first talked about it at the February financial community meeting last year, we talked about it in the context of sort of 2015 to 2017. In that vein, we are encouraged that we actually signed up 400,000 merchants in 2014 and that was sort of before we told you, we start to ramp the program much. So we do think as we get into the latter part of 2015 that we should begin to see a meaningful benefit from OptBlue and we remain very encouraged by it.","We obviously remain very encouraged by lots of other things in the market. Our steady growth in the U.S. of growing our lend portfolio, we expect to be able to continue and we think we\u2019re doing that without materially changing the risk profile of Company by really focusing on capturing a fairer share of our card member spend. We\u2019re excited about our continued efforts around broadening the reach of the brand with things like the everyday card and we\u2019re excited about things like Plenti. And if you haven\u2019t focused on it, I\u2019ll point out to you, we are going to launch a Plenti cobrand which we think will be a very interesting play as just one more step on our pathway of broadening the demographic reach of the brand and the franchise. So, we\u2019ll have to see where the economy goes and what the environment does but those are probably some of the things we\u2019re thinking about as we look at the rest of the year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. ","Craig Maurer","Good evening. Just a fast question, the sharp decline, or not the sharp decline but slowing in commercial card spend; if you could first tell us where or in what parts of the economy you\u2019re seeing that weakness most clearly? And secondly, historically in talking to Amex, we\u2019ve discussed corporate spend trends, leading consumer spend trends by about six months. Do you still think of that as a good relationship that the slowdown in commercial could be forecasting a slowdown in consumer toward the back half of the year? Thanks.","Jeff Campbell","Well, it\u2019s a good question Craig. Let me just remind everyone of the facts. So, what it does to us as well, strike us is that in the corporate card segment you saw a sequential slowing from 8% in Q4 to 4% in Q1 and that\u2019s clearly a much sharper sequential slowing that you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. As we have dug into that a little bit, it is primarily driven by the U.S. and seems to be a little bit more striking in our larger accounts in the U.S. In terms of what this means for the broader economy six months from now, I guess I\u2019d be cautious. One, if you look at corporate spending, it tends to be a little more volatile than some of our other segments because companies who\u2019ve gotten pretty good over the years are turning on and off their travel spends and other T&E spend in response to their own business challenges in all sense of the economic environment. I think in any part of our business we are always cautious about saying just one quarter makes a trend. So, we\u2019ll have to see. I guess I\u2019d say it\u2019s a note of caution for us but I wouldn\u2019t want to read too much into it at this point in time.","Operator","And our next question will come from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Rick Shane","Craig, actually just asked my question but I\u2019d love to get a little bit more of a specific answer. You defined where the slowdown was in terms of size of the customer but I think what I\u2019m interested in and I suspect Craig was as well, is there any industry that we can specifically look to; I think everybody\u2019s sort of wondering about oil and gas and also any category of spend where you saw it particularly?","Jeff Campbell","Those are good questions, Rick and ones believe me we\u2019ve been asking ourselves. So, maybe I\u2019ll even take this opportunity to step back a little bit. Certainly, we are watching very closely across our global portfolio for any impact to both billings and credit arising from the rather dramatic drop in oil prices. And what I would tell you for now is certainly we see the billings impact to the drop in oil prices; remember it\u2019s 2% to 3% of our billings, so 30% drop costs about 1 point of billings growth.","We do see some drop in spend from some of the oil services companies in the grand scheme of our overall billings. However that did not total up to anything that is significant for us. We have not seen any significant deterioration in credit yet either by industry or parts of the U.S. or parts of the globe that are particularly driven by an oil economy but believe me we\u2019re watching all of that like a hawk.","It\u2019s also difficult for us to say whether people taking their monies, their savings from slightly lower oil prices and using it to spur more spending elsewhere, that\u2019s tough for us to see. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not happening but not sure we can really see any of it. So to come all the way back to the origin of your question which is what\u2019s driving the sharper sequential decline in corporate card, I think we\u2019ve done enough work to say it doesn\u2019t appear to be isolated to oil service, doesn\u2019t appear to be isolated to any particular industry or geography with any fire point than it is primarily U.S. not in other parts of the world.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Good afternoon, Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Hi Ryan.","Ryan Nash","So, I just wanted to ask you one quick question regarding loan growth. You made the comment that you could have some slower growth related to Costco; your growth has been running into the 4%-5% range. Just want to get a sense given the efforts that you\u2019re putting into this from a growth perspective, we\u2019ve seen some across the industry have accelerating growth rates. And I was just wondering, given the focus here, should we expect that we could actually start to see growth rates across the lending area accelerating or do you think the offsets from run-off in Costco are going to overtake the incremental growth that you\u2019re seeing in the rest of portfolio?","Jeff Campbell","Well I think, I might break the answer, Ryan, into three components, so we think about this. Talk a little bit about U.S.; talk a little bit about international; and then separately talk about Costco. Because in the U.S. in fact our loan growth is close to 7% and has been running up at the 6% to 7% rate for the last couple of quarters. And I would say that if you look at the kinds of things that Ed in particular talked about at Investor Day, this is an area where we think we could run that number also little higher than that in the current industry environment without any material change in our risk profile by continuing to build from a marketing perspective, new customers as well as within existing customers, both bringing or borrowing focus customers as well capture more of our preferred share of the borrowing behavior of our existing customers. We are pretty upbeat about that and think it\u2019s a real opportunity for the Company.","Internationally, we have a much, much smaller loan portfolio. We do think we can achieve steady growth that\u2019s masked right now by the very significant foreign exchange impacts you see and the fact that and this comes in our third point, there was a loan portfolio associated with Costco Canada. While we didn\u2019t sell the portfolio as you would expect because as I said earlier in response to question because 60% of the spend on it Canadian Costco cobrand using store as that spend run away January 1, you see a more rapid decline in some of the loan balances as well and so that will drag on the international piece a little bit.","The third component to think about is Costco in the U.S. So, we can\u2019t be sure of the outcome of any potential sale of the portfolio but that portfolio, if were to be sold, represents 20% of our loan. So, you could accelerate your growth excluding that by significant amount from 7%; it\u2019s still going to take you a long time frankly to get back to even where we are today in terms of the overall loan portfolio and what that means for the spend centricity if you will of our overall income statement.","So, long winded answer to your question, but I think you do have to think about loan growth in the context of those three categories. So, I think we have time for one last question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. And that will come from line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. I just want to focus little more on small business and maybe how the lending growth in small business and OptBlue, how that\u2019s tying together. I mean every merchant acquirer talks positively but OptBlue and one of them talk about moving it into Canada. You said Jeff earlier that you\u2019re moving in something similar in related markets. The investor meeting you had you showed the merchant loan portfolio growing from almost nothing to 500 million over the last couple of years. So, how was that tying together? Do you expect to grow the loan portfolio along with OptBlue; is that part of the strategy? And will that be not only in the U.S. but in another markets? And is there any way to quantify in some way the incremental effect that you think that will have on spend growth or loan growth?","Jeff Campbell","Bob, that\u2019s a good question, that\u2019s a series of questions, Bob. And in some way that is the way I would tie together my answer, is to say remember, one of the aspects of our unique close look model is we work extremely hard every day, not just to generate value for our card memories but we work extremely hard every day to see how we generate more value for our merchants.","We are very excited about the OptBlue program and we think it is making it easier for smaller merchants to work with us. We think it\u2019s going to expand their business opportunities. And we\u2019re very excited about what it will do for merchant coverage over the next few years. We do lots of things to try to help small businesses operate better.","When you look at our open business which on the issuing side, target small businesses, it\u2019s really all about helping drive the success of those businesses and giving them access to spend capacity that our business model and our charge card model really is able to fairly uniquely provide them. And we really try to use that and have used it over the years to drive to a very significant position with small businesses. And we do like small business pattern, another example of what we do to help try value and support for our merchants. Merchant financing in that context is just another extension of the same driver. We have to constantly work at how do we find new ways to add value to merchants, very excited about merchant financing and we think, it is not only a good opportunity for us to in a very thoughtful, measured risk profile centered way grow our financing portfolio , we think it\u2019s a real value add for our partners, particularly some of our smaller business partners. So, hopefully that strategy all fits together; it\u2019s really part of what we have to do every day.","So with that I would like to thank you all for joining tonight\u2019s call and participating in the Q&A session. I would summarize by coming back to the fact that we think our results in the first quarter reflect solid core underlying performance. When you think about our Q1 performance and what I said today about Q2 and when you think about it in the context of the multiyear financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we think we\u2019re on track and we\u2019re continuing to do the right things to position the Company for the long term.","So, with that I wish all of you a good evening. And I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Rick, who is going to provide a brief overview of the investor conferences we plan to participate in during the second quarter. Rick?","Rick Petrino","Thanks Jeff. So, yes, before we close, I just want to mention that we are speaking at a number of conferences this quarter. First, our CEO, Ken Chenault will be participating in the Bernstein Strategic Decision\u2019s Conference in New York on May 28; then the President of our Global Network and International Card Services Business, Doug Buckminster will be at the William Blair Growth Conference in Chicago on June 9th; and then on June 10th, American Express President, Ed Gilligan will be at the Morgan Stanley Financial Conference here in New York.

Please go ahead.","Rosie Perez","Thank you, Alan. Good morning. Appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties.

We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company\u2019s progress and results, and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remark, we\u2019ll move to a Q&A session on the financial results, with both Steve and Jeff.","With that, let me turn it over to Steve.","Stephen Squeri","Thanks, Rosie. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. As our second quarter results showed, we continue to build on the broad based momentum we entered the year with.","FX adjusted revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 10% and earnings per share of $2.07 was 13% higher than last year. I feel good about these results, as well as the breadth and consistency of our performance. This is the eighth straight quarter we posted FX adjusted revenue growth of 8% [ph] or better. And our growth continues to be driven by a well balanced mix of spending, fees and loans spread across geographies and customer segments.","We continue to see solid trends in Card Member spending led by consumers. This spending is occurring as the backdrop of an economy that is growing at a steady, with more modest pace relative to 2018.","FX adjusted proprietary billings grew 8% on a consolidated basis and loan growth remained strong with over 60% of that growth coming from existing customers. Credit continued to perform at industry leading levels, driven by the premium nature of our customer base, our strong risk management capabilities and the opportunity we have to increase our share of our customers lending wallets.","The consistent growth we're seeing speaks to the strength of our differentiated business model and the success of our focus on our four strategic imperatives. It\u2019s been a busy first half of the year and I thought it would be good to take a step back and reflect on some of the progress we\u2019re making in each of our priority areas.","In the Consumer space, we\u2019re continuing our disciplined approach globally to upgrade our premium card products, enhancing our unique value propositions and pricing for the additional value that we\u2019re delivering to our card members.","In the second quarter, we launched new and refreshed Platinum Cards in the UK, Italy, Finland, Norway and Sweden. And in early July, we launched an enhanced Platinum Card in Germany.","We also made several additional enhancements to the Gold Card in the US and earlier in the year, we launched the new suite of co-branded Marriott Bonvoy cards. In each case, we\u2019re leveraging our differentiated business model to offer unique benefits, services and experiences to our card members in categories of travel, dining, and access to popular events and experiences.","These are some of the aspects of our products that are more difficult for others to replicate, and they are the ones that our card members most value and are willing to pay for.","In fact, nearly 70% of the new consumer cards we acquired this quarter carry an annual fee, and card fee revenue grew 17% year-over-year and accelerated sequentially quarter-over-quarter.","In addition, we\u2019re seeing strong results in attracting next-generation consumers to the franchise, with our most recent US consumer product refreshes more than 50% of our new card members are millennials or Gen Zers. I believe we have a long runway to continue this growth.","Turning to Commercial Payments, scaling our B2B payment offerings is one of our key growth strategies. Expanding our network of strategic partnerships is a key enabler here and we\u2019re making great progress.","Our commercial customers increasingly want payments integrated into their Procure to Pay infrastructure, and we\u2019re developing a range of solutions, which do that for businesses of all sizes and complexities.","For example, we\u2019re partnering with providers like Amazon Business, Tradeshift, and most recently SAP Ariba to help large and global companies track and reconcile payments within their ERP systems.","For our larger SME customers who are looking for ways to increase efficiency and cash flow. We're working with companies like Wax and MineralTree on payment solutions by integrating their accounting and procurement systems. And for our small business customers, who are offering an AP Automation solution with Bill.com that makes it easier for them to pay their suppliers using our cards.","Our objective is to provide payment capabilities and financing solutions that help our customers manage and grow their business. We want them to view American Express as an essential partner, whether they\u2019re single proprietorship or a Fortune 500 company.","We're still in a relatively early stage of this journey, but we\u2019re making good progress in building out our B2B offerings, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in this area going forward.","Moving on to our third imperative of strengthening our global integrated network. We\u2019re on track to achieve our goal of virtual parity coverage in the US by year end. We\u2019re also making good progress on expanding merchant coverage internationally and building our network in China.","In the second quarter, we announced that card members can now tap and pay with their contactless-enabled American Express Cards or digital wallets for subway and bus rides in New York City, as part of the MTA's new pilot program.","This is just another example of the vast array of opportunities in the payment space, as contactless will convert more cash transactions to mobile and plastic. Once consumers have experienced the speed, convenience and security of contactless payments in public transit, they are more likely to tap and pay at other establishments, such as quick service restaurants, retailers and more.","We\u2019ll continue to expand our contactless capabilities in the US and internationally both through third party mobile providers and through the issuance of contactless enabled cards. We're also working with merchants to expand contactless acceptance in order to give our card members more options for easy and efficient ways to pay.","Our fourth imperative, making American Express an essential part of our customers digital lives, cuts across all of our lines of business. We know that our card members spend much of their time online, particularly on their mobile devices. We want to help them manage more aspects of their lives by integrating more content, capabilities, experiences and benefits into all of the ways we interact digitally with them.","We\u2019re making good progress on this front, and to accelerate our efforts we\u2019ve acquired a number of digital companies over the past 18 months including Mezi, LoungeBuddy, Cake Technologies, Pocket Concierge and our newest acquisition Resy, the US restaurant booking and management platform, which we announced in May.","These acquisitions along with new digital features and contents we\u2019re continually building in-house, will enable our card members to do more with their American Express membership directly from their mobile device, whether it\u2019s getting a recommendation for a new restaurant, finding tickets to popular events, reserving a spot at the nearest airport lounge, redeeming rewards points for a wide variety of merchandise and experiences, saving money at some of their favorite merchants or booking travel.","Today our card members are engaging with our app more frequently and on a wider range of activities in addition to performing traditional transactions by checking their spending and paying their bills. We expect this to increase as we work to integrate more new capabilities and benefits.","In summary, I feel good about the quarter and I like where we stand at the halfway point of the year. Our strategy of investing in share, scale and relevance and leveraging the power of our differentiated business model is paying off across the enterprise. This strategy is driving growth in spending, lending, customer acquisitions and engagement across businesses and geographies.","Our results give us confidence that we\u2019re on the right track to delivering on our goal of consistent revenue and earnings growth. As we look ahead, we\u2019re reaffirming our guidance for the full year of delivering revenue in the 8% to 10% range and adjusted earnings per share of between $7.85 and $8.35.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jeff with detailed discussion about our second quarter results and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, thanks Steve. And good morning, everyone. And yes we are having our call in the morning instead of our historical evening timeslot after trying it in the morning last quarter due to the holiday calendar, we felt the timing worked a bit better for us from a process standpoint, and from feedback from many of you, it sounds like many of you prefer a morning call as well.","With that, it\u2019s good to be here today. Let\u2019s talk about another solid quarter in 2019 and about another quarterly example of the consistent performance we have been delivering for some time now.","Let\u2019s get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. Second quarter revenues of $10.8 billion grew 10% on an FX adjusted basis. As Steve mentioned, I think it bears repeating this is the eighth straight quarter of having FX adjusted revenue growth of 8% or better. And importantly for the future, this growth continues to be driven by a well balanced mix of growth and spend lend and fee revenues, across geographies and across customer segments.","I would point out that we continue to see a stronger US dollar relative to last year against most of the major currencies in which we operate. So you again see a spread between our reported revenue growth of 8% and our FX adjusted revenue growth of 10%.","As you recall, the year-over-year strengthening of the US dollar against the major currencies in which we operate began in the third quarter of last year. So assuming the dollar stays roughly where it is today, you should see reported and FX adjusted revenue growth levels more similar to each other in the second half of 2019.","Our strong topline performance drove net income of $1.8 million, up 9% from a year ago and then aided by our assumption of a more typical level of share repurchases over the last four quarters, our EPS was $2.07, representing double-digit EPS growth of 13% in the second quarter.","Looking now at the details of our performance, I\u2019ll start with billed business, which you\u2019ve seen several views of on Slides 4 through 6.","Starting on Slide 4, our FX adjusted total billings growth for the second quarter was 7% in line with Q1. As we continue to exit the network business in Europe and Australia due to certain regulatory changes, we think it's important to continue to break out our billings growth trends between our proprietary and network businesses.","Our proprietary business which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results was up 8% in the second quarter on an FX adjusted basis. The remaining 14% of our overall billings which come from our network business, GNS, was down 2% in the quarter and an FX adjusted basis. This is less of a decline than prior quarters as we are getting closer to lapping the impact of exiting our network partnerships in the European Union and Australia.","Turning to Slide 5, you will recall that during our last earnings call in April, we saw the full impact of lapping a step up in the growth in spending from our existing customers that began in the late Q4 of 2017 and became even more evident in Q1 of 2018. We attributed that acceleration which occurred across geographies and customer segments to an increase in confidence in our customer base.","To bring this comment up to date, our Q2 2019 results show a continuation of the Q1 2019 trends, solid and steady growth though at a more modest pace relative to 2018.","If you then turn to Slide 6 to look at the billings by customer-type for the second quarter, starting on the left with a large and global commercial customers, we saw a 5% growth on an FX adjusted basis for the second quarter, in line with Q1 and our small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs in the US grew 7% in the second quarter.","We feel good about our continued leadership position with both of these customer types. I would suggest that the growth levels here are reflective of the economic tones Steve discussed, stable and growing, though at more modest levels than the very robust growth we saw in 2018.","But also note that we will continue to watch these two commercial customer types closely to determine whether we are seeing perhaps a bit of caution in our commercial spending trends which we are not seeing in the consumer segment at this time.","International SME, however, remains our highest growth customer type with 17% FX adjusted growth in the second quarter. During Investor Day, we highlighted the long-term growth opportunity in this segment, given the low penetration we have in the top countries where we operate international small business products and we continue to believe we have a long runway for higher levels of growth in this segment.","Moving to US consumer which made up of 32% of the company\u2019s billings in the second quarter, billings were up 8%, reflecting continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers, and in general, solid growth on the part of consumers.","Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the teens at 15% on an FX adjusted basis. We continue to have widespread growth in our proprietary business across key countries with double-digit growth in Mexico and Australia and growth of 20% and 18% for the UK and Japan, respectively.","Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 2% on an FX adjusted basis, driven by the impact of regulation in the European Union and Australia where we are in the process of exiting our network business. Although network billings are down in these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia, the remaining portion of GNS was up 6% on an FX adjusted basis.","Overall, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate.","Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7. We continued, as we have for years now, to grow a little faster than the industry by taking advantage of the unique opportunity that our historical under penetration of our own customer\u2019s card-based borrowing behaviors creates.","Total loan growth was 11% in the second quarter, with over 60% of that growth coming from our existing customers. And on the right hand side of Slide 7, you see that net interest yield was 10.8%, up 20 basis points relative to the prior year.","While we\u2019ve been saying for some time that these yield increases were going to moderate, we are pleased that our yield is still increasing year-over-year from continued impacts from mix and pricing for risk.","Slide 8 then shows you the credit implications of our strategy. On the left you can see that the lending write-off rate was 2.3% in the second quarter, up 20 basis points from the prior year and in line with the first quarter.","On the right, you can see that the charged write-off rate, excluding GCP was 1.7%, down 10 basis points for the prior year, as well as the prior quarter. You\u2019ll also see the delinquency and GCP net loss ratio trends. All of these lead to the same conclusion we have reached in recent quarters.","We still do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment, both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these portfolios are performing better than we expected so far this year.","So given these credit metric and loan volume trends, you can see on Slide 9 the provision expense was $861 million in the second quarter, up just 7%, while loans, as I said earlier, were up 11%.","As you think about this relationship, I would remind you that we have talked in a few forums [ph] about how we have been evolving over the past year a number of the things we\u2019re doing on the risk management side, to create a greater margin of safety and position us well for any potential future downturn. These changes, coupled with the stable economic environment and the fact that we are acquiring a higher percentage of new accounts on premium fee-based products, are driving our provision cost to be below our original expectations.","As you think about the full year, during our first quarter earnings call we said we expected provision growth in the mid-20% range in 2019. Given the positive underlying trends we have seen in the first half of the year, I would now expect to do better than this, with provision growth below 20% for the full year.","While we\u2019re on the subject of provision, let me take a few minutes to step away from our results and talk about CECL. We've made good progress on our implementation efforts, though there is a lot of work left before implementation on January 1 of next year.","Based on our work so far, we estimate that if we implemented CECL this quarter, our current total reserves of $2.9 billion would increase by roughly 25% to 40%. This estimate includes a roughly 55% to 70% increase in lending card reserves, somewhat offset by a significantly lower charge card reserve, due to the extremely short life of charge receivable.","To be clear, the ultimate impact will depend on the loan and receivable portfolio compositions, macroeconomic conditions and forecast of the adoption date, as well as other factors including the remaining management judgments as we finish off our modeling.","I would leave you on CECL though with three important takeaways. First, remember that CECL represents an accounting driven acceleration of estimated losses. There is no change to the underlying economics, our view of the risk portfolio or the ultimate expected losses in our portfolios.","Second for us given our strong balance sheet, 30% plus return on equity and spend-centric model, the capital impact of the one-time implementation increase in reserves will likely very be manageable.","Third, while the impact of implementation is getting the majority of the attention to date, it is important to keep in mind that CECL will have an impact on our provision expense going forward. The ultimate impact will of course be heavily [Technical Difficulty]","However, the growth in our lending portfolio, which has been higher than the industry, coupled with the increased reserve requirement for loans, will very likely result in incremental provision expense under CECL relative to the current accounting methodology.","So now let\u2019s get back to our results. In terms of the strong revenue growth of 10% on an FX adjusted basis that you see on Slide 10, we see our eighth straight quarters of FX adjusted revenue growth being at least 8%, as evidence that our focus on investing in share scale and relevance is working.","And this growth is driven by broad-based growth across spend lend and fee revenues as you can see on Slide 11. Importantly, the portion of our revenue coming from discount revenue and fees remained at roughly 80% in the second quarter, in line with the recent history. Discount revenue was up 6% on a reported basis and was up 7% on an FX adjusted basis, which I\u2019ll come back to on the next slide.","Net card fees growth accelerated to 17% in the second quarter. This is the financial outcome of the disciplined approach to product refreshment, our unique value propositions, and our focus on fee-based products that Steve talked about in his opening remarks. And we feel good about our ability to maintain this strong growth in net card fees given the breadth of products that are driving our momentum. Net interest income grew at 13% in the second quarter driven by growth in loans and net yield.","Now I know that many of you are focused on the outlook for interest rates, and what that means for various financial companies, given that the latest rate projections are a bit lower than they were at the beginning of the year.","I would remind you that for us, the impact of modest changes in rates is fairly muted. Our sizable charge portfolio does mean that our balance sheet is a bit liability sensitive, but we manage our funding stack to keep that sensitivity in a range.","If you look at our latest 10-Q - excuse me, 10-K disclosures, it implies that a 25 basis point increase in rates would cost us about $0.01 of EPS a quarter on a run rate basis over the ensuing year. All else equal, including a beta on our deposit account in line with recent history, the impact of a 25 basis point decrease would be similar in size.","Keep in mind as well of course, that today\u2019s modestly lower rate outlook is caused by a view that the economy is a bit weaker, which would tend to move our overall results in the opposite direction of the rate impact itself. Putting this all together, I don\u2019t expect current changes in interest rate expectations to have a material impact on our 2019 results.","Turning now to Slide 12 to cover the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue. On the right you see that discount revenue grew in line with billings in the second quarter at 7% on an FX adjusted basis, making this the seventh consecutive quarter with discount revenue growth above 6%. We see this as continued strong evidence that our strategy of focusing on driving discount revenue not the average discount rate is working.","Moving on now to the things we are doing to drive our strong revenue growth, let\u2019s start with our customer engagement cost, which you can see on Slide 13 were $5 billion in the second quarter, up 11% versus last year, a bit more than revenue.","Turning at the bottom with marketing and business development, I\u2019d remind you that this line has two components, our traditional marketing and promotional expenses, as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners. Marketing and business development costs were up 7% in Q2.","There are two offsetting impacts to mention on this slide. First, our marketing spending will be more evenly distributed across the four quarters in 2019, driving lower growth in marketing and business development in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, as we grow over the launch of our global brand campaign in the second quarter of last year.","Offsetting this impact this quarter is the expected $200 million increase in 29 [ph] marketing and business development, driven by the extension we signed in Q1 of our enterprise-wide Delta partnership. This impact will be spread across three quarters beginning with our second quarter results.","Moving onto rewards expense, you can see that it was up 9% relative to the prior year broadly in line with proprietary billed business growth. Continuing on to Card Member services, as you have seen for sometime and as we continue to expect Card Member services costs were our fastest growing expense line up 35% in the second quarter, as this line includes many components of our differentiated value propositions, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based product. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the level of customer engagement we see with our premium benefits and services.","That then brings us to the operating expense line on Slide 14, which was up 7% in the quarter. While there is always some variability in OpEx quarter-to-quarter, I would say that some of the drivers of our strong revenue performance, growth in sales force, premium servicing and digital capabilities will cause us for this year to see more growth in this line than we have seen in recent years.","That said, we have a long track record of getting operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues, and we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to do so.","Turning to capital. On Slide 15 our CET1 ratio in the second quarter was 11% at the top end of our 10% to 11% of target range and we returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders.","As you know in previous years, we\u2019ve issued a press release at the end of the CCAR process announcing our capital plan. Since we were not subject to the CCAR process this year we chose not to issue a press release in June.","As we\u2019ve said, the reality is going forward our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 capital ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the governor of our capital distribution plans.","Now we\u2019ve historically been very focused on maintaining capital strength, while aggressively returning excess capital to our shareholders, and you should expect us to continue that philosophy. In terms of what this means going forward, I\u2019d reiterate the same philosophy we have talked about all this year.","First, remember that our industry leading ROE, which was 32% this quarter, means we generate a tremendous amount of capital each year. In deploying this capital our philosophy is straightforward. You can expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings as it has historically.","Consistent with this, you may have noticed in our press release today that we intend to increase our dividend from $0.39 to $0.43 subject to board approval, beginning with the declaration in Q3, \u201819 and payable in Q4, \u201819.","We\u2019ll then use a modest portion of our capital generated to continue to support our organic growth and if you look at the last 18 months, the occasional small acquisition. And we will return the remainder of our capital to our shareholders, while managing within the 10% to 11% CET1 target range.","To sum up before we open the call for your questions, our solid performance in the first half of the year reflects our investment strategy focused on share scale and relevance, delivering high levels of revenue growth and steady and consistent EPS growth.","For the full year 2019, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and having our adjusted earnings per share to be between $7.85 and $8.35.","During our earnings call in January and Investor Day in March, we said that the lower end of the EPS range is there, if there is some more significant economic slowdown relative to 2018.","Halfway through 2019 we continue to see a stable and growing economy, though not quite at the robust levels of growth we saw in 2018 as we put our 2019 plan together. In addition we've had a few changes relative to our regional outlook for the year. Most significantly, we have a $200 million increase to marketing and business development from the Delta renewal, which you saw beginning in our results for the second quarter and going in the other direction, we have more favorable credit performance relative to our initial expectation. Given where we are today, I would expect our full year EPS results to be more in line with the middle part of our original guidance range.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rosie.","Rosie Perez","Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I\u2019ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I\u2019ll start off with where you ended Jeff on the guidance. You mentioned the middle part of the range and thinking through the $200 million and the favorable provision, it would seem to me like the provision given the credit trajectory has been trending better roughly in the $200 million. Perhaps you can just reconcile that for me?","And then as far as the CECL numbers you gave in terms of the quantification, I was just doing the back of the envelope on the percentage you mentioned. And if we were to assume a sort of similar environment to this year, it would seem like the provision might go up low single digits percentage wise. I know there is a lot of assumptions. Can you just help us think through that? Thanks.","Jeffrey Campbell","So two good questions Sanjay. Thank you for them. First, on the guidance. I\u2019d really say there is three things going on all of which I talked about in my remarks. You\u2019re correct, U.K. added $200 million of costs this year due to the tremendous new long-term agreement we have with Delta. It\u2019s a great thing for shareholders long-term. Offsetting that provision is clearly much better than we had expected. And I\u2019d say you're right that benefit is probably a little bit bigger than the $200 million.","But I think the third thing to recall is if you go back Sanjay to the January call when we first talked about guidance, I said at the time that in the world where 2019 turns out to look kind of like 2018 in terms of the economy, you should expect us to be in the middle or upper part of the range.","You know, in fact, while the economy is stable, it is clearly growing at a more modest level than it was in 2019 - 2018 when we put our plan together based on the more robust growth you saw in 2018.","So, it's a little bit of softness in volume relative to our expectation. And so that\u2019s really the missing third piece. All that said, eight straight quarters of revenue growth above 8%, 10% revenue growth this quarter we feel tremendous about the momentum.","On the CECL side, boy, predicting the ongoing P&L impact of CECL Sanjay has so many moving parts right now, I am reluctant to give you a number. All I was trying to do on the call at this point is begin to focus people a little bit on the fact that for us the one time increase in reserves given the strength of our balance sheet and ROE, it doesn\u2019t have any material impact I think in our capital returns.","But the ongoing provision costs depending on the environment is something that you will probably hear us continue to talk about and I think your back of the envelope is as good as any. I just cautioned that there could be lots of different factors that affect it going forward. So thanks for the question Sanjay.","Operator","And for our next question we\u2019ll go to the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.","Don Fandetti","Hi, good morning. Jeff I think most financial institutions have put out a buyback discussion. I know you provided some general background. Is there any reason why you're not talking specifically about that?","And then secondarily, what is your general thought on operating leverage or lack thereof? Obviously, your OpEx expense is growing at a more rapid pace. But if you sort of layer in engagement cost, are your expenses going to grow faster than your revenues?","Jeffrey Campbell","Yes. So, two things. First, on capital, Don, we said for a while now that the governor of how we manage our share repurchase is that we intend to keep that CET1 ratio in the 10% to 11% range and that is actually more important than where we are with the Fed.","And so depending on our earnings, depending on our levels of organic growth, that\u2019s how you should expect us to move the share repurchase up and down. Now, all that said, that means share repurchase have leveled very similar to what you\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve rebuilt the balance sheet post the Tax Act charge.","But that\u2019s really the way I encourage everyone to think about our capital return not \u2013 that we are no longer in this world where the CCAR outcomes are governing what we\u2019re doing on capital and so we\u2019re going to return exactly that amount of capital.","On leverage, boy, I think we\u2019re just executing Don on the financial and business model that we\u2019ve been talking about ever since Steve became CEO last February, which is, we\u2019re generating industry\u2019s leading levels of revenue growth. We think that\u2019s the best way to create value for our shareholders long term.","Customer engagement cost has been and, I expect, will continue to grow a little faster than our revenues and so that creates a little bit of margin compression. That\u2019s mitigated by the fact that we expect operating expenses to grow less than revenue, they have for a decade, we\u2019re highly confident that they will continue to. And then you add a little bit of share repurchase to all that and you get a double-digit EPS growth.","Now, that does mean that PTI, in any given period may grow a little faster or a little slower than revenue. But we think this is the right strategy, focused on share, scale and relevance for creating the most value for our shareholders in the long term.","Operator","For our next question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Yeah. Thank you. It seemed like the US consumer might have been the biggest source of strength in the quarter. I think you guys \u2013 you had proprietary billables and it's actually declined modestly Q-over-Q, but your discount revenue growth accelerated. Was that due to the acceleration in the US consumer where presumably you have higher discount rate revenue?","And then also, just higher level, what are you seeing from the US consumer? Are they being more resilient for some of the uncertainties we\u2019re seeing around things like the China trade issues that they may be having maybe a bigger impact on the corporate side?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, maybe I\u2019ll start Mark on the math and, Steve, you might add a little bit of color. Look, I think, when you look sequentially, sure as you\u2019ve heard from many people, the consumer is strong and you did see in the US Consumer business a little bit of a modest uptick in billings sequentially.","You know, all that said, I think, we see overall stability, but at more modest levels than last year. Commercial spending is still at a good level, but I exercise - I noted a little bit of caution. We just have our eye on that a little bit more than the consumer. So I don\u2019t know, Steve, maybe you want to add a little bit of color.","Stephen Squeri","Yeah. I mean, look, I think that international is still strong as well. I mean, you had 17% international SME growth, you have 15% international consumer growth. But just a comment in US SME. I think when we dig into the numbers in US SME, what I always look at is, how are we bringing on new booked business. So that\u2019s from new signings and that\u2019s been stable for a long time. How are we looking at the attrition and that\u2019s also been very stable.","What you see and I think this is to Jeff's point, what you see is maybe a little less confidence that the consumer from an SME perspective where there is been organic decline from what we would say, pretty much all time highs from what we\u2019re growing over, but it\u2019s still positive. So that's US SME.","And I think large corporate, you know, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with large corporate, especially when we had such a breakout year, I think, last year from large and global corporate accounts.","So I think the commercial side of the business is being slightly more cautious than the consumer side. And I think you\u2019ve heard that as you listen to other earnings calls this week as well. So - but still strong, I mean, still strong growth. ","Operator","And our next question will be from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Go ahead please.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe just to pick up on those comments with international SME. I know it\u2019s been on a little bit of a decelerating trend here 17% is still a very strong number, but it was - I believe 25% is recently the year ago. So you\u2019ve got some tough comps you\u2019re working through.","I guess as those - trying to get easier for the next few quarters is it essentially and obviously you see some reacceleration in international SME? And then if you can just separately make a quick comment on the sustainability of the card fee growth which continues to be very impressive that would be great? Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell","Yeah. So I think I got the question with a little bit of the background noise. But look, I mean, if you look at what was going on for international SME for pretty much like six quarters prior to this, you had sort of the long run of 20% growth, but often relatively smaller base.","I am pretty happy where we are with 17% international SME growth. We continue to invest not only in the value propositions, but in the sales organizations, and our absolute numbers are actually getting bigger and bigger. So I am not really worried at all about 17% international SME growth. Our performance there has been, I think really outstanding.","So we\u2019re going to - and we're going to continue to invest. I mean, that\u2019s one of the reasons why you saw a little bit of an uptick sort of an operating expenses is we\u2019re investing in sales organizations not only international SME, but we\u2019re investing in some sales resources as well as it relates to - international coverage. So you have some extra OpEx as it relates to that.","As far as card \u2013 as far as card fees go, you know, card fees is all about adding value to the products and we will continue on our quest to continue to add differentiated value on an ongoing basis to all of our products around the globe. We have taken a very deliberate step to make sure that we are constantly looking at and refreshing these products on a very proactive basis.","And by doing that, that enables us to continue to add tremendous pace that we\u2019ve been on in terms of card fee acceleration. I mean, you saw 17% card fee growth year-over-year, and you even saw a sequential uptick, and 70% of the cards that we acquired, our fee-based cards and people are paying for those cards because they are getting value out of those cards.","And so it is how our model has been for decades, and we will continue to invest in those value propositions so that we can continue to generate card fees.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Go ahead.","James Friedman","Hi. Thank you. It's Jamie. Steve, I wanted to ask you about the M&A strategy. You had some activity year-to-date. How would you describe the themes in M&A, because some of it seems consumer oriented, but some of it seems merchant oriented like your last couple \u2013 if you could provide some instruction about how you\u2019re thinking about M&A would be helpful?","Stephen Squeri","Yeah. So, look for every business, we have an opportunity to grow sort of three different ways, right? You grow from organic growth, you grow through partnerships, and you grow through acquisitions.","I think, if you look at the last sort of five acquisitions or so, and I think you picked up on a really important point with Resy but I'll get to that in a minute. But if you really look at the last five acquisitions, while you can say they are consumer rated, consumer driven what they really are is all about embedding ourselves more in our customers digital lives. And those customers are not only consumers, but they are small business, and they're corporate card customers.","So maybe for a business process perspective, we\u2019re not - we haven't done any M&A in that area. But when you think about what we've done, it first started out, and we started with some building blocks. We started out with Mezi which is digital based AI assist and now we\u2019ve roll that out in the UK and we\u2019re testing that in the US with some of our platinum cardholders.","And then we went with Cake, which is really sort of middleware to help us sort of manage our restaurant reservation. We went with Pocket Concierge, which Japan is a really important market for us and that gave us access to some of the best restaurants in Japan.","And then we went with LoungeBuddy because our focus has been on providing a great experience end-to-end for the travelers. And while I'm not going to be able to build hundreds of lounges, we\u2019ve got 12 right now and will continue to add them selectively as we go along. LoungeBuddy from a mobile perspective will show our customers exactly where other lounges are and we get access to lots of the lounges.","And then the last one Resy, which is really sort of two-pronged and I think we probably not done a good enough job talking about the merchant side of this. But it will give us access to some of the what we believe is some of the finest restaurants and actually one of the more requested restaurants from our card members and be able to not only provide special Card Member offers, but to also be able to acquire new card members when they actually use the Resy app and seeing what our existing card members were getting.","And for restaurants, the thing that we love Resy is they look at the fact that they have two customers. They have the card, they have the diner as a customer, and they have the restaurant and the customers, and restaurants are really important partners for us.","And so what you\u2019re seeing is a concept - a continue to build out whether it be organically partnership or via acquisition. And remember we had a partnership with LoungeBuddy before this to constantly and consistently move more upstream or in-stream into our customers digital lives.","So we\u2019ll be opportunistic. We\u2019ll continue to look for those companies either from a partnership perspective or an acquisition perspective that will continue to build-out our digital capabilities.","And we\u2019ll continue to look on the commercial side, but I don't want you to think its all consumer, because small businesses can use this and our corporate card customers can use this as well.","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to the line up David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.","David Togut","Thank you. And good morning. You\u2019ve been repositioning American Express in Europe over the last year principally winding down GNS. With the next wave of payment regulation coming PSD2 on September 14th along with strong customer authentication requirements, is there more to do, you signaled on the last call you might introduce a debit card for example. I'd be curious for your updated thoughts?","Stephen Squeri","No. I don't know that we - yeah, well actually yes. Not necessarily a debit card, but access for sort of more real-time payments, but - with PSIP. But I think that we\u2019ll wind down Europe by the end of this year, and so you won't have that grow over.","Our value propositions are very strong in Europe. We still - the reason we - just to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, the reason we wound this done is, we wanted to stay as a three party scheme versus a four party scheme, which aspects of our business in Europe were four-party, which enables us to have a better, not only better value proposition, but in fact a higher discount rate as it relates to our transactions there.","But I don\u2019t see us introducing a debit card per se, and I think we\u2019ll just continue on our path of increasing our value to our customers both from small business perspective and from a consumer perspective.","Jeffrey Campbell","And the only thing I\u2019d add, David on your specific question around September 14th deadline on merchants having better than authentication capabilities, we\u2019re working with our merchants. It\u2019s not a big cost for us. It\u2019s really a merchant question. We don\u2019t expect it to cause any significant inflection point. There is some talk about banks deferring a little bit because not all merchants were ready to launch. But I don\u2019t see it as a big issue.","Stephen Squeri","No actually and we\u2019ll leverage our safety technology to do that. But in fact it's really more about conversations and visits with merchants more than just technology and we\u2019ve been really ahead of the curve on that in educating merchants on how to interact. So not a cost issue for us at all.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. You started to kind of discuss some of the aspects of this. But could you talk a little bit about the - how would you expect the SME business to perform both in terms of kind of growth rate and in terms of credit as the economy looks to be a little more variable? Is it more or less kind of volatile than the consumer side?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, we feel really good about the breadth of our small business franchise. As you know Moshe we talk a lot about the fact that we are in the US larger than our next five competitors combined outside the US where we have some of the highest growth rates in the company. Our shares tend to be small and we think we have a very long run way to continue to grow.","We are broadly speaking and I am actually going to take your question beyond just small business, one of the things you've heard me talk about in my prepared remarks is we actually have been making some changes in all of our risk management practices steadily across the last year. That\u2019s both a consumer and a small business issue because they are both so important to us.","And in fact those changes are part along with a stable economic environment of what\u2019s driving stronger than expected credit performance for us provision actually being up less than loan.","So all of those things we think help prepare us to continue to perform strongly in all economic environments. We always spend a lot of time thinking about how we manage the company through all aspects of an economic cycle. We make every economic decision around customers assuming through the cycle view of the economics. So we feel good about where we are in our preparation.","Stephen Squeri","Yeah. The other point that I would make is when you look at international SME, it\u2019s predominantly if not 100% a charged business for us, and which has a lot less - obviously, a lot less volatility. And our small business portfolio is more heavily charge based than our - in fact our consumer portfolio as well.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Go ahead please.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Carcache","Thanks. Jeff, I wanted to follow up on some of your comments regarding the rate environment. I understand your point that there is a natural buffer in your business model based on the interplay between a stronger or weaker economy and higher or lower rates.","But to the extent that the Fed is turning more accommodative in an effort to extend the cycle and not because economic conditions are deteriorating then wouldn\u2019t that be a scenario where lower rates would benefit you?","And Steve if I may, I just wanted to ask a question on the digital investments that you guys are making, specifically on cloud you\u2019ve guys have talked about pursuing a hybrid cloud strategy versus a public cloud strategy that some of your competitors are pursuing. Is there any concern that you may be falling behind your competitors relative to the investments that they are making? Thanks.","Stephen Squeri","So, let me - I'll answer the second one. No, I think look having been CIO of this company and spent 10 years running technology, I am really comfortable with where we are. From an economic perspective, the reason we have a hybrid strategy is we believe that on an ongoing basis, we have better economics by running our own private clouds. Now that may not be the case with everybody else. But when you go to one of the cloud providers, you have a situation where there is obviously just profit built in.","So as we focused on our infrastructure and if you look at our technology cost over a long period of time, our run the - our run the company cost are best in class and they have been decreasing over time. So I am really comfortable with where we are from a hybrid strategy perspective.","And what you do is you look to put workloads out there that are variable in nature. And so I think having a hybrid strategy really works well for us because it enables us not to have some of the fixed cost investment that you would just need to have on a variable basis.","So, I don\u2019t see we\u2019re falling behind at all, and I think we might have been a little bit ahead with the hybrid strategy that we have deployed.","Jeffrey Campbell","And Bill on rates. Look I\u2019d just started by reminding everyone that 80% of our revenues come from spend and fee revenues. So just the math starts with the fact that relative to any other financial institution, we\u2019re just far less sensitive in terms of our overall economics to where our rates are going.","Second, we do manage our funding stack in terms of our fixed floating mix to keep our exposure to changes in rates pretty modest and that\u2019s why in my prepared remarks I pointed out that when you think about a 25 basis point change, it\u2019s $0.01 a quarter.","And then assuming quarters third, there is this economic offset, right? I think in response to Sanjay\u2019s first question, I did point out that the economy is growing slowly than it was last year as the rate environment or the rate outlook has come down a little bit, that\u2019s because people are worried about the economy. That provides a little bit of a natural offset to even a modest impact that rates do.","So, look, we pay attention to rates. I am just making a general point that when you net it all out for us, I don\u2019t see modest changes in the rate environment up and down as something that\u2019s going to move the needle in our overall earnings. I think operator let\u2019s keep going and probably squeeze in one or two more here.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Hecht","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Your discount rate has been very stable year-over-year and I know you\u2019ve taken specific guidance regarding the discount rate off the table.","But I am wondering if you can tell us is there any trends whether you\u2019re looking by channel, by region, by product or mix shift? Is there any trends underlying that we should think about for the next couple of quarters?","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, I just remind you, yes, you are correct, we\u2019re focused on driving discount revenue which we feel great about not average discount rate. All of that said, we\u2019re also getting further from some of the things we\u2019ve talked about for a few years, the impact of regulation in Australia and the European Union. The impact about Blue, some big strategic deals we cut. And so those are having an impact on the average discount rate.","But the thing that I just want to emphasize is, we feel good about the discount revenue trajectory. That's what we\u2019re focused on driving and the rate will average - discount rate will kind of go where it will. Operator?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Go ahead please.","Craig Maurer","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the Blue Business Cash Card that you put a release out on yesterday. You talked about the invoicing product and that you were launching effectively what seems like a working capital program that will be paid over ACH. Curious is that a new offering? How are you marketing it, how big is it today if it's not a new offering? Thanks.","Stephen Squeri","So actually the working capital product's been out there for a couple of years now, which - maybe you got sort of mixed up in this - in the Blue Cash announcement. But the working capital product has been out there for quite a long time, a couple of years. It is relatively small and it does ride over ACH rails.","And what we want do is remember, what we wanted to do with small businesses is to help run their businesses and part - the role that the card plays is part of their overall working capital solution. And so there are suppliers and there are merchants that do not accept credit card payments of any type, not just American Express with Visa and MasterCard.","And so to be able to provide, along with providing the card product, to be able to provide a working capital product as well to these customers, helps them manage their business and helps them manage their cash flow. And the reality is these are loans that are anywhere from 30 to 90 days.","Craig Maurer","How big is it?","Stephen Squeri","It's very tiny.","Rosie Perez","Okay. With that, we\u2019ll bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you again for joining today\u2019s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.

Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials from prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Today's discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then, Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of Q3 financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session on the quarter's results, with both Steve and Jeff.","With that, let me turn it over to Steve.","Steve Squeri","Thanks, Edmund and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with some of the key highlights from the third quarter results we released earlier this afternoon. From there, I'll give an overview of the year-to-date results. And before turning it over to Jeff for a more detailed discussion of our financial performance, I\u2019ll provide a quick progress report on the four strategic imperatives that we focused the organization on at the beginning of the year.","In the third quarter, we saw a continued momentum in our business that was in line with the strong growth of the first half. Adjusted revenues grew 10% and we delivered EPS of $1.88. I feel really good about the company's performance. We\u2019ve had several quarters of high revenue growth and in fact this marks the sixth consecutive quarter with adjusted revenue growth of at least 8%. Our growth has been broad based, driven by a well balanced mix of card member spending, fees and loans and spread across geographies, businesses and customer segments.","We have continued to control our operating expenses and that provides the flexibility to make investments in our brand, customer benefits and digital capabilities. As I reflect on the first nine months of the year, I see very consistent and positive trends. We generated a healthy level of top line revenue growth and delivered strong bottom line results each quarter. Year-to-date, our revenue growth is 10% and our earnings per share growth is slightly higher than that, after adjusting for the tax act of 2017.","We're gaining spending and lending share in almost all the countries in which we operate. At the same time, our customer engagement expenses, which are composed of rewards, card member services and marketing are growing a little faster than revenue. We are seeing very good payback from the targeted enhancements we've made to our customer value propositions. But that does translate into some margin pressure.","The remainder of our cost on operating expenses. For us, these are primarily scalable infrastructure costs and they are growing at a much slower rate than revenues. So in effect, the margin compression created by higher customer engagement expenses is being partially offset by OpEx leverage. And as many of you know, we have a proven track record of disciplined control on operating expenses, while growing the rest of the business. ","We're delivering strong results in a highly competitive and regulated environment where there are higher costs associated with driving growth. And going forward, we are focused on sustaining the high levels of revenue growth that have been delivering steady and consistent double digit EPS growth. We believe that the best way to do that is to invest in share, scale and relevance for the long term.","Turning back to our year-to-date performance, we feel good about the advantages that come from our integrated business model and the progress we're making on our four strategic imperatives, which I'll take you through now. We continue to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space. We introduced the new Gold Card in the US with an enhanced value proposition and an innovative set of rewards. We continued to refresh our international product line with enhancements to our Platinum Card in Australia, Singapore in Japan. ","The US Platinum Card continued its strong performance. New consumer accounts are up more than 50% and about half of those are for millennials. Building on our strong position in commercial payments, small and medium sized businesses continue to be our fastest growing customer segment worldwide, with particular strength in our international regions. Continuing to strengthen our global integrated network, we continue to add more places worldwide, where American Express cards are accepted.","While I could expand much more in our progress in these first three areas, today, I want to focus more on our fourth priority, making American Express a more essential part of our customers\u2019 digital lives. Given the announcement we made earlier today about an expanded relationship with PayPal, I wanted to put the many things we are doing here in context. Over the past year, we've steadily gained traction on this critical imperative that cuts across every part of our integrated business model.","Our progress on our digital efforts takes many forms. Acquiring companies with great technology and AI capabilities like Mezi and Cake and working to integrate those capabilities into our app, creating partnerships with a range of innovative startups to stay on the leading edge of exploring new capabilities for our customers, steadily expanding our internal capabilities through new and innovative products, such as Early Pay and Amex Gold for our commercial products, continuing to drive working efficiencies by having more of our marketing and new card member acquisitions come through our digital channels and building upon our longstanding relationship with a digital leader like Amazon and our strength in small business to come together and launch later this quarter what we believe will grow to be one of our leading small business co-brands in the US.","And so like we are excited to expand our longstanding relationship with a digital leader like Amazon, I am also excited about expanding our longstanding relationship with another digital leader, PayPal. PayPal and long been one of our largest merchants and most important partners, helping to expand the reach of our digital payments in the American Express network and I'm really excited about what we're doing together.","As part of our expanded relationship, card members will be able to use membership rewards points for purchases at millions of PayPal merchants online and send money via Venmo or PayPal to friends and family directly from the Amex mobile app easily at American Express card to the Pay Pal wallet directly from the mobile app or website from Amex\u2019s mobile app or website and pay their American Express bill with their PayPal or Venmo balance via the PayPal instant transfer features.","We\u2019ll have a more prominent place on the platform and we\u2019ll continue to jointly explore additional innovative digital products and experiences. I believe this is going to be a winning partnership for our customers, for our merchants, for us and for PayPal. It's truly a win-win. And as I see it, it is just the latest step in our journey to play a more essential role in the digital lives of our customers.","As I said at the start, I feel very good about our performance. The investments we've made in new benefits, services, digital capabilities and the global marketing campaign that supports them are generating very good momentum. Given that momentum, we now expect full year 2018 revenue growth to be between 9% and 10% and we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 to $7.40, up from $6.90 to $7.30 range we set at the start of the year. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders.","Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Campbell","Well, thanks, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s good to be here today to talk about another quarter of steady and consistent revenue and earnings growth. But to get right into our summary financials on slide 3. Third quarter revenues of $10.1 billion grew 10% on an FX adjusted basis, with this growth again driven by a well balanced mix of growth across discount revenue, fee revenue and net interest income. I would point out that the FX adjusted growth rate now exceeds our reported growth of 9%, given the strengthening of the US dollar against the major currencies in which we operate.","This 10% revenue growth then drove net income of $1.7 billion, up 22% from a year ago and earnings per share was $1.88 for the quarter, up 25% from the prior year. Our shares outstanding were down 2% from the prior year, a little less than recent quarters due to the suspension of our share repurchases in the first half of the year, which resulted from the one-time impact of the tax act last December. We are now back within our targeted capital level range and as a result, resumed share buybacks this quarter.","All in, these are results we feel really good about. Looking at the details of our performance, I\u2019ll start with billed business, which you see several reviews of on slides 4 through 6. Starting on slide 4, our FX adjusted total billings growth accelerated sequentially to 10% in Q3. More significantly, as you can see on the top right, our proprietary business, which makes up 80% or the majority of our total billings, was up 12%, maintaining very strong growth levels. The remaining 15% of our overall billings, which come from our network business, GNS, continues to see the expected impact of regulation in the European Union and Australia and as a result, GNS billings were down 1% on an FX adjusted basis.","The steady and strong growth across all of our proprietary segments is shown clearly as you turn to slide 5, which gives you a segment oriented view of our billings. ","Turning to slide 6, we have a more detailed view of billings by customer segment. And also a reminder, the global commercial and global consumer are roughly the same size, representing 41% and 44% of Q3 billings respectively, while global network services makes up the remaining 15% billings.","Starting on the left, with our small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs, US SME was up 10%. As the leader in the US SME space, we feel good about the consistently strong billings growth that we have shown for many years in this customer segment. International SME remains our highest growth customer segment with 23% FX adjusted growth in the third quarter. Our growth in this segment has accelerated significantly in the last year and we continue to believe that we have a long runway for growth, given the low penetration we see in the top countries where we offer international small business products.","In the large and global customer segment, we saw a 10% growth on an FX adjusted basis. As you know, this is an important segment for us as it helps strengthen our network by driving acceptance and coverage. Now, on any given quarter, our growth rate in this segment can vary a bit, given the large volumes that a few customers can drive. This segment is heavily T&E oriented and you can see in the earnings table that the company's overall US T&E and global airline billings also accelerated sequentially to 9% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter.","Moving to US consumer, which made up 32% of the company's billings in the third quarter, we are pleased to report our third consecutive quarter with double digit growth. Our double digit billings growth in US consumer reflects our strong acquisition efforts through digital channels as well as the general strength we're seeing in consumer spending and confidence within our premium US consumer base.","Moving to the right, international consumer growth remains high at 18% on an FX adjusted basis, consistent with Q2. We have widespread growth in key markets with FX adjusted growth of 13% in Japan, 14% in Mexico and over 20% in both Australia and the UK. Last, on the right, as I mentioned earlier, global network services was down 1% on an FX adjusted basis, driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia. ","Although the network billings are down in these regions, we are seeing strong growth on the proprietary side as I just mentioned. Additionally, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia markets, the remaining portion of GNS was up 8%. Overall, our growth has been diverse and this is the first quarter in some time in which we have had double digit billings growth across all of our proprietary groups. US and international SME and consumer as well as large and global corporate.","Turning next to loan performance on slide 7. Total loan growth was 16% in the third quarter and in line with the prior few quarters. We continue to be focused on driving growth with our existing customers and about 60% of our growth in lending came from existing customers once again this quarter. I would remind you that we completed the Hilton portfolio acquisition earlier this year, which contributed around 120 basis points to growth this quarter, roughly in line with the contribution to growth in the first half of the year.","On the right hand side of slide 7, you see that net interest yield was 10.8%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year. As we have been saying for some time, we have expected net interest yield to stabilize, which would cause year-over-year growth to moderate. You are clearly seeing that playing out over the last few quarters. While net yield is still growing over the prior year, the increase continues to moderate, as we lap some of our pricing initiatives.","To spend a minute on funding, I\u2019d remind you that over half of our funding comes from deposits and over half of our deposits are in our online personal savings program. We resumed actively growing our online personal savings program this year and in a rising rate environment, it is generally our least expensive source of funding. Our beta on this program has been around 0.7 of late, consistent with the assumption we use for internal planning.","Stepping back, while we view a rising rate environment as a modest headwind to us, it is usually mitigated by a stronger economic environment, which is certainly what we are seeing now. ","Turning next to the credit metrics, on slide nine, on the left side, you can see that the lending write-off rate was 2.1%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and stable on a sequential basis. As a reminder, we have been saying for some time now that we expect these rates to gradually increase, as they have and in fact the rates continue to be slightly better than we expected for this year.","On the bottom left, we have added delinquency rates, which you can see have been relatively stable now for several quarters. On the right side, you can see similar metrics on our charge portfolio. The charge write-off rate, excluding GCP, was 1.7% in the third quarter, up 20 basis points from a year ago, but down on a sequential basis. Here, I'd remind you that there can be some quarterly volatility in these charge rates due to seasonality and looking forward, we do not see anything in the performance of our tenured customers to suggest any change in the broader environment.","Turning next to provision on slide 8, provision was $817 million. I would point out that our reserve build was $92 million this quarter versus $229 million in the third quarter of 2017. And I also remind you that the third quarter of 2017 reserve build took into account a number of factors at the time, including recent hurricanes, accelerating loan growth and seasoning in the portfolio. For this year, as you just saw on the prior slide, the delinquency rates have remained relatively stable for several quarters, so that is what you see reflected in our reserve build this quarter.","Based on our year to date performance, we are now lowering our full year provision growth expectation from the mid-30% range to less than 30%. We feel good about our ability to continue growing our lending a bit faster than the industry, by focusing on our existing customers, while retaining best-in-class credit metrics.","Turning now to revenues on slide 10, FX adjusted revenue growth was 10% in the third quarter. As Steve mentioned, this represents the sixth straight quarter of having adjusted revenue growth of at least 8%, driven by steady growth from a well balanced mix of spending fees and lending.","On slide 11, you see the components of our total revenue. Discount revenue, which makes up 61% of our revenue was up 8% on a reported basis, which I'll come back to on the next slide. Net card fees growth was 11%, driven by growth in Platinum and Delta in the US as well as growth in key international markets like Japan and Australia. We continue to demonstrate the ability to generate card fee revenues by offering differentiated value propositions, even in the face of the steady competitive challenges that others present. Lastly, net interest income was up 17%, driven primarily by the growth in loans that I mentioned a few moments ago. ","Turning now to slide 12 to cover the largest and most important component of our revenue, discount revenue. Starting on the left, our average discount rate in Q3 was 2.38%. This is down just 2 basis points from a year ago, a much smaller decline than we have been seeing in recent quarters. For some time now, we have been talking about how there were several factors driving a larger decline in the average discount rate that we did expect to fade over time. ","These factors included the impact of regulatory changes in Europe and Australia, the continued rollout of our [indiscernible] program to drive toward superiority merchant coverage in the US and some impacts from decisions we made to deepen the broad relationships we have with certain strategic partners. You see this quarter that these impacts are indeed beginning to moderate. In addition, mix also plays an important role in our average discount rate and the higher growth in travel and entertainment spending this quarter that I discussed earlier also helped the average discount rate.","As a result, we now expect the average discount rate for the full year to be down less than the 5 to 6 basis point expectation that we originally shared at our March Investor Day. Moving beyond the discount rate and really more importantly, for many quarters, you\u2019ve heard us say that our main focus is on driving discount revenue growth, not managing to an average discount rate. And what you see on the right hand side of page 12 is that discount revenue growth was up 9% on an FX adjusted basis. This represents the highest FX adjusted growth rate on discount revenue that we have shown since 2012. And we feel really good about the momentum in our largest, and most critical revenue line.","Turning now to expenses on slide 13, let me start with operating expenses, which were down 1% this quarter, while there were a number of discrete items that impacted the growth rate in both the current and prior year. If you were to adjust for all the various discrete charges, we would have seen a modest increase in operating expenses from the prior year, consistent with our long standing trend of getting operating expense leverage relative to our revenue growth. We continue, as Steve said, to have great confidence in our ability to deliver steady operating expense leverage.","So that brings me next to customer engagement costs on slide 14. In total, customer engagement expenses were 4.5 billion in the third quarter, up 13% from the prior year. Starting at the bottom, we have the marketing and business development line, which has two components. Our traditional marketing and promotion expenses as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co brand partners. This line in total is up 14% versus the prior year, driven by two factors.","First, as we've said for the last few quarters, we have some increases in partner payments due to co-brand agreements that we signed in the last year and growth in our corporate business. Second, as you may recall, we launched a new global brand campaign earlier this year and as you would expect, we increased our spending in marketing to support our brand refresh. I would add that we feel good about our continued ability to drive marketing efficiencies in our card member acquisition efforts.","As we have grown our acquisitions to 3 million new proprietary cards globally this quarter, without a corresponding increase in our levels of direct spending. This marks our highest quarter of acquisition in many years, when you set aside the Hilton portfolio acquisition earlier this year. ","Moving up to rewards expense, you can see that it was up 11% from the prior year, roughly in line with proprietary billings growth. Moving then to the top of the slide, card member services cost was up 30% in the third quarter. We continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category, as it includes the cost of many components of the differentiated value propositions, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits.","Turning last to capital on slide 15, you can see that we ended Q3 with a CET1 ratio of 10.8%. Our high ROE business model has allowed us to quickly rebuild our capital levels to our target range of having a 10% to 11% CET1 ratio after last December's Tax Act charge briefly dropped us below our target range. This has allowed us to resume share repurchases in Q3 and to raise our dividend, consistent with the CCAR approvals we received from [indiscernible] in June.","So that brings us to our outlook and then we'll open the call for questions. First, we now expect full year revenue growth to be 9% to 10%. As both Steve and I have pointed out, our revenue growth has been at least 8% on an adjusted basis for six consecutive quarters and that strong growth has been driven across a diverse mix of both geographies as well as business and customer segments. We can directly link our decisions and investments to the strong revenue growth that we have seen year-to-date and we will continue to make investments that we believe will drive share, scale and relevance and will sustain our strong level of revenue growth. ","Our confidence in this revenue growth leads us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 to $7.40, excluding any potential discrete tax benefits and other contingencies. This is up from our original guidance range of $6.90 to $7.30. Taking a step back, our performance year to date and full year guidance reinforce several points that Steve let off with.","First, over the last several quarters, we have had strong revenue growth and tax adjusted earnings per share growth, slightly above that, as we offset some of the increased customer engagement costs with operating expense leverage. Second, while our business model has the flexibility to throttle back spending on value propositions and card member engagement in ways that contribute to EPS in the short term, we believe that our decisions today are driving share, scale and relevance, which support the business over the long term. Finally, we are focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth, which we believe is the best way to generate steady and consistent double digit EPS growth.","With that, let me turn it back over to Edmund to begin the Q&A session.","Edmund Reese","Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation and with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","[Technical Difficulty] And it seems like the growth is diverse and accelerated \u2013 ","Steve Squeri","Hey, Sanjay. You cut out for a minute, so would you mind starting again?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Absolutely. Okay. Good. So the revenues have been consistently surpassing your expectations this year and it seems like the growth is diverse and accelerating. Could you guys talk about where specifically the outperformance is coming from, is it macro, is it investments, is it a favorable competitive environment and what gives you the confidence that it's going to persist?","And then just on a related note, on the discount rate, Jeff, you mentioned that you expected to not be down as much as you guys envisioned. So what would be the trajectory going forward, given there's not as many of these partnership discounts or anything else sort of affecting that number?","Steve Squeri","So, Sanjay, let me sort of start out and maybe get the first part of the question. Look, what we have really focused on, and not just this year, but over the last couple of years, is we've really focused in on investing. We've invested in value for our card members. We've really invested in value propositions and we've certainly invested in coverage. And Jeff will talk about sort of discount rate, but you've seen discount revenue. But when you look at the -- you look at our growth, it's across the board. ","You've got double digit growth in every billing segment that we report with the exception of GNS, which has the issues as we wind down Australia, wind down Europe, but whether it's small and middle market in the US, even large and global accounts, certainly, international, both consumer and small business was really high double digit and double digit growth rates and with SME up in the 20% and US consumer as well and, look, we continue to grow our lending book judiciously, not only in the US, but in international. ","So, I think, we\u2019ve spoken in times that, maybe from an organic perspective, there is a little bit of the economy, but certainly, we believe that the investments that we're making are really driving this sustainable, what we believe, is sustainable growth. And we believe our value propositions are resonating with what would be our traditional customers and what I think a lot of people are surprised at as millennials. And so it really is across the board growth.","Jeff Campbell","The only thing I'd add on that, Sanjay and then I\u2019ll talk about discount rate is, we did talk going actually all the way back to the January call, about the fact that late in last year's fourth quarter, we did see a noticeable uptick in what we would call organic growth and we really can't particularly attribute that last little uptick to anything other than the economy and it\u2019s sustained itself this year, though not further accelerated. So, there's a modest boost from economic growth, but I think all of the factors Steve talked about are the much larger drivers for us.","On discount rate, Sanjay, you have enough history to know that for many years, we used to talk about a 2 to 3 basis point a year decline and this average, discount rate due to mix, people hitting volume triggers, et cetera. In fact, if you look at history, it was used in more 1 to 2. And then for a couple of years now, we've said because of [indiscernible], because of regulation in Europe and Australia, because of a few strategic agreements we've done, that has driven it down an unusual amount, but all those you see this quarter are beginning to fade.","Now, I'm not going to give you guidance for the future beyond that, because I think Steve and I have been very clear this year that our focus is on driving discount revenue growth and so we're going to make decisions sometimes that leverage our integrated business model, if we think they're going to drive discount revenue growth and we're not going to worry about the average discount rate. What I would say is, we feel good within any given category of merchants about the stability of the rates and about where we are.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","If I look at sort of forecasted revenue estimates, they\u2019re probably around a seven handle, yet you guys are doing a 9, 10. And so I guess the question is, on sustainability. So you talked a little bit about billed business, but you're facing tougher comps on proprietary, yet easier on GNS. I guess, my question is, can your billed business growth accelerate or is it more likely that we've peaked out here.","Jeff Campbell","Well, I\u2019ll make a few comments and then Steve you can add. Look, I think, Steve and I couldn\u2019t have been clear about the focus we have on sustaining the kind of revenue growth that you have now seen for six consecutive quarters. And of course, that revenue growth is coming from a mixture of great billings growth, steady loan growth, steady growth in all the fees that we generate and the key to sustaining the overall revenue growth we have is we see a long runway to sustain growth in all three areas. So I would say, we're not particularly trying to drive or forecast or suggest acceleration from where we are. We feel really good about the share and scale gains that we're getting with our performance right now and that's what we\u2019re focused on sustaining.","Steve Squeri","Yeah. Look, I think what we have said is, we have lots of great investment opportunities and we're going to take advantage of those investment opportunities and those opportunities are not only within our commercial business and consumer business, but they\u2019re broad based. And so what you will continue to see us do is investing in card acquisition and you will continue to see a focus on investing and coverage. And we believe that, as we have invested in coverage here in the United States, it has made a huge difference and you\u2019re seeing that play out in discount, you've seen that play out in billed business growth and you\u2019ve seen that played out in discount revenue growth and we're not at where we want to be, even in the United States at this particular point in time, as we've said, we want to get to virtual parity coverage by the end of 2019. ","And so, you will continue to see us focus there and you continue to see us focus internationally on coverage, which there is a relationship between improved coverage and driving billed business and the more billed business if you think about our spend centric model, then you actually can drive -- continue to drive the revenue growth that we're also getting from lending. So bottom line is, we're going to be investing for share and for scale, as we continue moving forward.","Operator","And our next question is from Jill Shea with Citi.","Jill Shea","Related to billed business from large and corporate customers, you saw some accelerating trends there. Can you just speak to the strength and how should we think about growth going forward and then perhaps also touch on airline in US T&E and the strength that you saw this quarter and how we should think about the outlook going forward there?","Steve Squeri","Yeah. I think for large and global, it was a particularly good quarter. I think, there are some -- we will have some grow over issues as we move forward. But what you're seeing is a little bit more diversification in terms of we're getting some more B2B within that space. But we also continue to see our large corporates and our global accounts continue to spend in the T&E space. So we're really happy with the sort of the double digit growth. It's not something that we've experienced in quite a while. In fact, if you go back a few quarters, you saw this sort of at a 2% level, at a negative level and we've had that uptick, partially due our focus on B2B, but also due to increased T&E spending with our large and corporate accounts.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I just wanted to change conversation a little bit and talk about the very fast loan growth that you\u2019ve been generating with strong credit quality. A little bit of an uptick in net charge-offs, but not that much. And related to how you're thinking about reserving as we go into the CECL world, really the question has to do with the fact that you've got obviously a lot of transactors, does that mean that you could potentially pull back on some of the reserving that you're doing and drive that into even faster loan growth or potentially buybacks or is that not part of the equation and if you could speak a little bit to how you're thinking about the new accounting world and when we'd be getting some information with regard to how that's going to impact you would be helpful?","Steve Squeri","So let me first just remind you, we're now four years into growing a little faster than the industry, because of our unique focus on capturing a bigger share of our own customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors, which frankly we've historically under penetrated and that's why we have sixty percent of our loan growth coming from our existing customer base. I point out if take that growth out, you'd be growing at about at the industry. It's why four years into this exercise, we still buy quite a stretch the best in class credit metrics and credit has consistently performed. As we have told people, it would, so we feel really good about the growth and we actually think we have a very, very long runway to continue to grow a little faster than the industry.","On CECL, Betsy, I'm afraid, I'm not going to give you a lot of insights that are much different from what others have said. If you look at our card lending look, I would suggest that you are liable to see larger reserves that are somewhere in the range of what you've heard others talk about somewhere in the 10%, 20%, maybe a little higher percent range. What is unique about us, as you point out, is we are the only financial institution in the world that has a really large charge card franchise that obviously has some different dynamics in the CECL world. Frankly, we're still working through that partly because of our uniqueness. There's a lot to work through with regulators and auditors and accounting authorities. ","The net of all that, we\u2019ll have to see. I guess I will go on record as saying we're one of the great majority of financial institutions who think that there is incredible complexity to this accounting standard. There's probably also some pro-cyclicality which may be the opposite of what the regulators set out to accomplish when they went down this path. And, we'll have to see what that means overall. ","We\u2019d also hope, but boy, it's way too early to say that this is a pure accounting change, which you would think shouldn't effect ratings, shouldn't affect capital requirements, although there are certainly no commitments out there right now from the Fed or the rating agencies to in fact take that approach. So, I think there's still a lot of discussion to have on this, Betsy. And I actually see that discussion growing a little bit in the industry as well as in DC. I will say like most other institutions, in 2019, we'll be running parallel and that's really when we'll be able to give people more specific insights.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Anthony Cyganovich","Hi, good evening. This is Anthony Cyganovich on behalf of David Togut. Do you expect to reduce merchant discount rates further in Europe as PST 2 [ph] goes into effect in Continental Europe next year which may promote more ACH based payment?","Steve Squeri","So, look, as we look at Europe, as you know we're outside of the regulation but our competitors aren't and so we still have a premium. Our business in Europe is very different. It is a corporate card SME, really high end consumer business which merchants value and when you look at that business, that's a business that's grown in the high high-double digits at this particular point for us all across the board, international and in Europe. So I don't see that happening and I don't see us having actually the exact same coverage needs that we do in the United States, but what we will do is we will use discount rate as a tool to provide coverage where we need coverage whether that be B2B, where there is a different value equation.","And remember again here is where the integrated model helps us out because we have both sides of that equation and especially in Europe because we're not able to use sort of the same models we have in the United States and as we need small merchants, we may run our own what I\u2019d call our own theoretical ARPU program here from a pricing perspective, but other than that I don't see us -- I see us maintaining that premium. And again I wouldn't look at that as it relates and we don't share this obviously but I wouldn\u2019t look at that as it relates to the discount rate in Europe. I would look at us using that discount rate as a tool to get coverage when and where we need it.","Operator","We have a question from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. And nice job on the quarter. The international semi and consumer businesses continued to grow at a very high rate. What is specifically driving that? I think it's still relatively small relative to the opportunity. Are we early days and what is driving that and if I could, the Amazon program, how are you going to manage that with all the other SMB programs, small business programs you have in the US? How does that fit in and compete with your other programs.","Steve Squeri","Let me go with the second one first here. I think we'll be launching the Amazon product soon. And we have a range of \u2013 look, we have a range of small business products. We have a Delta co-brand, a Hilton co-brand, a Marriott co-brand, a Lowe's co-brand and now we have an Amazon c-brand and in addition to proprietary products and the proprietary products whether those be cash back with charge products or what have you and a lot of our customers actually use multiple products. You will see small businesses that use a corporate card product, you will see small businesses that use a Marriott product and use an Amex simply cash product. And I think the beauty of the Amazon and Delta, Marriott and so forth and so on is that we provide small businesses the opportunity to use the variety of products that meet their needs and meets their rewards needs and spending needs and so forth.","And so our view is I'd rather have that sort of arsenal of products all under the American Express umbrella than certainly have to compete there. And it'll be -- you may see customers that have our small business product today, also get the Amazon product just like they also got to Marriott product. And so I just think it's one of the ways that we will continue to drive our billings and drive our position in commercial payments in the US. As far as your first question, when you look at the SME segment internationally and then I'll get into consumer, when you look at the SME segment internationally which is a relatively newer segment that is being penetrated here is the vantages of global scale.","What we're able to do is leverage our global infrastructure, leverage our global footprint, leverage everything that we have in our commercial business in the United States and our global business outside the United States and we've been driving that business and the way we drive that business is we drive it in multiple ways. We drive that from a telesales perspective and in-person sales perspective and a digital perspective. And the reality is, we see that as a large growth opportunity and when you look at that business for us, right now we are growing that primarily on from a billings perspective but over time there will be a working capital component we believe to that base that we have.","From a consumer perspective, American Express has been a premium product brand outside the United States for many years and, look, we are continuing to inject value and what\u2019s really interesting about our business outside the United States is that in a lot of places or in a lot of cases our fees that we charge to our consumers are actually higher than they are in the United States and the services that we provide are on par even or even better. So we see that opportunity still as a growth opportunity for us and as we continue to increase the coverage we believe spending will increase as well.","Operator","Our next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman","Hi. Let me echo the congratulations. It\u2019s James at Susquehanna. Since you called it out Steve, I just wanted to probe about the trend in the leverage and the margin trajectory especially with regard to card member services. Just kind of philosophically I realize you conclude that it's a good area of investment but I'm just getting questions from investors at what point will it likely stabilize because 30% is a pretty big ticket? Thank you.","Jeff Campbell","Let me make a financial comment, Steve and then you can cover on the strategy. One caution James and one for you and really for everyone is we pull different levers at different times in different geographies and different parts of our business. And one of the reasons why we flipped a while back to talking broadly about card member engagement costs which includes rewards, which includes business development, payments to partners, traditional marketing and it includes cost of card member services, although I would point out that's by far the smallest component is because at different times the growth rates are going to vary across those three depending on what we think is going to produce best return.","So I encourage you to look in many ways across all three of those categories, but we've been pretty clear today that, look, those have been growing a little faster than revenue. But we actually feel great about the revenue growth that that's generating. We feel great about the platform that provides a pretty steady double digit EPS growth and we think it is allowing us to build scale and relevance in a way that quite frankly we haven\u2019t in a number of years.","Steve Squeri","I think it really gets down to how we inject value and I think Jeff is right. I mean, we look at multiple levers to do that and I think as we continue to get more customers, as we continue to get more of their billings, it provides that platform to do more things with them as we continue to develop more and more products and services. So again our strategy here is really about more share, really about more relevance and really about more scale and we believe that's the right lever for us to pull at this particular point in time.","Operator","And we go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. Wanted to talk about the reserving, because obviously very strong results both in -- somewhat in Q2, but even more so in Q3 and you did lower your expectations for the full year. How do we think about it going into \u201919 just because the portfolio is obviously growing at a fairly high rate and while credit ratios are good, the dollar amounts of both delinquencies and loss are growing? And I guess how do we think about that into \u201919?","Jeff Campbell","Well, you know, we will have to give you a, of course, much more thorough answer in 90 days when we are on the January call and will provide a lot of commentary on 2019. But, look, I\u2019d make a few comments. As you very well understand, provision is affected by a lot of things including sequential rates of growth in your loan. So in a world though where, let's say, our loan growth in 2019 roughly looks like where it is today. I think what you're seeing in our trends of late is we're getting past some of the more dramatic seasoning that we had to get go through and we're starting to get to the point where your provision growth will begin to asymptote down, all else being equal, towards your loan growth rate.","Now we are growing loans in the mid-teens, so that tells you that you should expect the provision to at least grow at that level even as we maintain the kind of credit performance that we've had. But we feel really good about the economics we've been getting from four years of growing lender a little faster than the industry but I think we can do this in the current kind of economic climate for many years to come.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rick Shane","Guys, thanks for taking my question. You guys have articulated and really executed on a wallet share driven loan growth strategy. I am curious if there are any differences in how season customers build balances and if there is any more sort of concentration in terms of transaction, higher utilization initially or how we think about season in future growth given that this portfolio could be constructed a little bit differently.","Jeff Campbell","I think, Rick, the thing that I always keep trying to bring people back to is, historically our customers don't think of American Express as a place to do their borrowing on a card and that's why Doug Buckminster, Steve, myself, we talk a lot about the statistic in the US consumer segment which is where most of our lending is, that we capture roughly 50% of our customers spending behaviors and only 25% of their borrowing behavior. So what we have consistently worked at now for the last few years is trying to do lots of different things in marketing and product and pricing, in incentives to try to change that mindset and that's why 60% of our loan growth is coming from our existing customers, it's why we're able to keep credit metrics at the levels that I was just talking about in response to Moshe's question and it's why we think we can keep at this for a long time.","Steve Squeri","The only thing I would say is that and I've said this before in meetings and at our analysts calls and so forth it is important for us to have a broader relationship with our customers and if they're going to go and borrow money someplace else, that also provides the possibility of them spending someplace else as well.","So it really is important, which is why it is important for us from a small business perspective to continue to talk about and expand what we're doing with small businesses whether that\u2019d be cross border payments, whether that be merchant financing, 90 day working capital loans and things like that because they do have other options and it really is important especially in a world where things are still accessible from a digital perspective that they don't look at us as a one trick pony and that they're looking at us as a source of their -- and look, this applies from a small business perspective and a consumer perspective as a source of their working capital needs and that's what we're really trying to do and so that's why the sort of messaging. And you see this a little bit with some of our advertising. When you look at it and you see somebody applying for a loan, a small loan online as they're watching TV, so you're going to continue to see us expand what we're doing with our customers.","Rick Shane","Got it. And again I'm just sort of curious, presumably a seasoned American Express customer has a different balance build behavior than a millennial and that totally makes sense. I'm trying to understand what the implications are in terms of future growth if we should think about how those loans season and then no judgments one way or the other, better, worse, fast or slower but how we think about the difference in terms of how that initial entry behavior translates into long term performance.","Steve Squeri","I guess, Rick, I am going to come back to, remember the diversity of our product portfolio US, international, consumer, small business, lots of different cards, people borrow on the platinum card, they borrow on every day cards, those kinds of generalizations. I am just not sure we -- frankly we don't look at the world that way because of the diversity of our base. I'm just going to come back to, we see a long runway to continue what we're doing here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Thanks. Coming back to the topic of the relationship between your revenue growth, engagement expenses and the EPS, I think you indicated given the faster engagement expense, you were saying EPS growth adjusted for the tax benefits, it's slightly ahead of the revenue growth and I think you know the Amex of all, kind of reliably expect that a mid to high single digit revenue growth to translate into kind of a mid-teens EPS growth. Would you expect to widen back out to that kind of relationship over time or do you see that kind of margin pressure persisting?","Jeff Campbell","Well, Mark, it\u2019s a very good question and let me just maybe be clear with everyone. So Steve and I were very clear on the call that we are focused on sustaining the kind of high levels of revenue growth we have. We think we have a good runway to do that and we think it's a great basis to produce double digit EPS growth. If you look at Q2 and Q3, though, just to look at some actual results and there's a little complexity to the taking out the impact of the Tax Act. But if you do take the impact of the Tax Act out, you see 9% to 10% EPS growth in those two quarters and you see 10% to 12% EPS growth excluding the impact of the tax.","In history, to your point, 2012 to 2014 we were getting very little revenue growth, 4%, frankly losing share, losing some scale. But we\u2019ve squeezed 11% EPS growth out of that. Pre-crisis, you saw some numbers like that. We don't think that's the right way to run the company in the current competitive and regulatory environment. We don't think that produces the kind of sustainable foundation. It\u2019s going to build scale and relevance and share that will allow us to really sustain double digital EPS growth.","Steve Squeri","The Amex of old, the Amex of today, from a numbers perspective, we're in a very different environment as Jeff just said. We're in a different environment competitively, we're in a different environment from a regulatory perspective. We're in different mindset too though and I think that mindset that we have is it is really important that we continue to grow our share and we continue to grow our relevance and scale. And you don't need any more proof of that than what we've been doing from a coverage perspective and just how important it is. And what we've been doing from a value injection perspective with our card members and so we're going to continue to do that as well as continue to build capabilities so that we can expand our relationships with them. So we believe the right way to win is to really focus in as we both said, on higher revenue growth with a narrowing of that revenue and that EPS number, but just to point out, it is with a lot higher revenue growth.","Operator","And we go to Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good evening. Hi, Steve and Jeff. I had a follow up on Moshe's question earlier. Credit has held up much better than many expected with Amex never really facing the severe normalization headwinds that some of your lend centric competitors did. Can you help us understand the role that your closed loop things like machine learning and other technologies have played in driving your strong credit performance and maybe speak to the extent to which you think those assets provide you guys with an edge over your competitor swap rate in an open loop environment?","Jeff Campbell","Other than if you look at sort of blip during the credit crisis, the financial crisis, the closed loops is a secret sauce. It is the secret sauce from a fraud perspective, it is a secret sauce from an underwriting perspective, it's a secret sauce from a targeting perspective upfront and who you acquire. And reality is that good credit starts right at the beginning of the funnel in terms of who you're targeting, who you're letting in, how much money you're lending and all of that is all about sort of how we continue to invest in our machine learning capabilities and our data capabilities and all that's really powered by the closed loop and all the data that we have.","So it has been a tremendous advantage for us from day one. The other thing I will add on this is that the other thing that's really important within the closed loop which absolutely has nothing to do with the closed loop is preset spending limit. And so when we look at our machine learning capability, it also helps to drive just how we set that no preset spending limit. And one of the huge advantages that we have is in small business space because in the small business space, small businesses use credit card products as a form of working capital whether it\u2019s charge or whether it's lending and to be able to set a no preset spending limit where we are dynamically determining what the level of spend is based upon data from millions of small businesses and historical data and so forth is a huge advantage to us as well.","So, look, there's many models that are out there in this business. There is a PayPal model, Visa, MasterCard model, there is JPMorgan Chase model. Our model is unique and the uniqueness is, it\u2019s integrated. That integration gives you the closed loop, the closed loop gives you data, it gives you relationships on either side and it gives you the ability to have the -- to play with the economics which becomes even more important down the road from a B2B perspective. So closed loop is key for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeff Cantwell","Can you talk a little more about today's announcement with PayPal? I guess what I'm curious about is how much opportunity is there for Amex card holders who might be interested in using Amex rewards points for purchases at the PayPal merchants online. Maybe tell us why this is something where you think you'll see a lot of demand from your card holders. Just a related question. How eager are Amex card holders to add their Amex cards to the PayPal wallet through the mobile app or the website and then start to spend via the wallet? I'm really just trying to get a framework for how incremental this might be for you.","Steve Squeri","So, look, I think what you saw today really is a multifaceted expansion of our relationship with PayPal our relationship with PayPal goes way back. They are a huge partner of ours from a acquiring merchant perspective, they're a leader in the digital space. I think that's very, very clear. My perspective is it always made sense for us to sort of expand our relationship with them and, look, Dan and the team are really great to work with. I have a long term relationship with Dan. We worked really well together here. And the teams as we went through this what we tried to think about is ways we could add incremental value to American Express, ways we could add incremental value to our merchants, ways we could add incremental value to PayPal and ways we could add incremental value to our card members.","And so when you think about sort of this integration within the app or within the wallet, the one thing that you realize is, the more seamless you can make things, the easier it is for your card members, your customers to transact. I mean when you think about merchants, for example, one of the things that they look for is to make sure that they don't use shopping carts and that they make sure it is easy as possible online and not shopping carts in the supermarket but online and what we wanted to make sure is that we can make it as seamless as possible for our card members to be loaded in their card into PayPal because PayPal offers us a tremendous expansion of our network today. And so, to be able to make those millions of merchants of available to our court members in a more seamless way is a win-win for everybody. It's a win-win for merchants, it's a win-win for us, it's a win-win for PayPal, it\u2019s a win-win for card members.","As far as you know the American Express pay with points and how many card members will use those points at PayPal merchants, this is the most valuable bank of points anywhere in the world bar none. It\u2019 a behemoth and the reality is that we are looking for more ubiquity. Our card members use points for a variety of things at a variety of places and this just expands that ubiquity. And it is going to be good for merchants, it's going to be good for our card members. Can I put a number around it? I can't put a number around it, but the reality is I think this will be an uptick in points burn. I think this will be an uptick in card member satisfaction. I think it's going to be an uptick in merchant satisfaction as well so we're really pleased with this and obviously there will be more announcements as we move along from a timing perspective and what have you. But we're really excited about this expansion of strategic partnership.","Operator","Thank you. And now the last question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat","Good afternoon. Thanks for tucking me in. Wanted to ask one strategic question on a piece of the revenue that you haven't touched upon much today is the annual fees because with the platinum and gold cards you\u2019ve seen some increases and Jeff mentioned some increase or some growth in Japan and Australia on the fees. Just wondering if you're strategically thinking about fee increases being more likely in the future. It seemed like that was something -- there was some hesitancy around in past years, but it seems like there's more appetite among consumers for higher fees. And I'm also wondering if there's also more trade off on some of your member services with that too.","Steve Squeri","So if you look at it right, our card members are looking for value and our experiences is that card members will pay for value and so what you\u2019ve seen is, lots of value injection and that value injection takes many forms. I mean, when we look at card member engagement cost, you look at some fixed cost which could be your allowances and things like that which get consumed as people go through, but they don't get charged on the variable basis. You look at rewards cost and you look at deals we may do with some of our merchant partners where both of us can bring value to that equation as well. And so our belief is, if you are bringing value, you should charge for that value and there's no better proof in the pudding than when in a very, very difficult competitive environment with the launch Chase Sapphire, we put in a $100 increase in our in our platinum card and so attrition goes down and so our acquisition go up and so more acquisition go up from a millennial perspective as well and reality is, that\u2019s all due to value.","People will pay for value and American Express is known as a brand that does provide value and so where we have opportunities to raise our fees, we will raise our fees and we did that just with the gold card, we've done that in various international markets, but we\u2019ve injected value and when you inject value, the other benefit of injecting value is people who use the card more. When they use the card more, they spend more. When they spend more, you give them an opportunity to revolve more. So it's a virtuous cycle as far as we're concerned and we're going to continue to pursue that strategy as well.","Edmund Reese","Thank you, Chris, for that call. With that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve, thank you, Jeff, thank you to those of you on the phone. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.
