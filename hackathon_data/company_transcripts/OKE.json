Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Good day. And welcome to the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead.","T.D. Eureste","Thank you. And welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934.","Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thank you, T.D. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Rob Martinovich, our Executive Vice President, Commercial; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; and Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer. Also with us and available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids; and Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing.","On this morning\u2019s call, Derek will start with a review of our financial results. Rob will review our operating results, including sequential quarter variances, give a brief NGL market update and touch on the drilling economics in the basins we operate. Wes will give an update on our capital growth projects. And finally, I will elaborate on last week\u2019s announced acquisition of the West Texas LPG and Mesquite NGL Pipelines from Chevron and I\u2019ll have a few closing remarks.","During our previous conference calls, we have shared our plans and progress for growing ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. While execution of these plans has not been without challenges, we have and will continue to execute on our key growth strategies and create value for our shareholders, unitholders and stakeholders.","So, in the midst of weaker commodity prices and other market uncertainties, it is important to provide some perspective on how we will approach the future by acknowledging our actions and successes of the past.","As we begin our call this morning, I\u2019d like to touch on some of our accomplishments. ONEOK Partners\u2019 2014 adjusted EBITDA exceeded $1.14 billion in only nine months, which is the quickest the partnership has exceeded a $1 billion in its history and we are on track to grow our distributable cash flow in 2014 by over 20% since 2013.","At ONEOK, we are clearly benefiting from this growth. We completed approximately $4.7 billion in capital investments since 2010 and expect to exceed $5 billion with the completion of the MB-3 Fractionator by the end of the year.","Including these capital investments we will have invested nearly $7 billion when combined with our $2 billion capital growth program we completed between 2006 and 2009, and we have entered into yet another incredible capital growth phase at the partnership with a backlog of unannounced projects of between $4 billion and $5 billion.","These completed projects are providing predominantly fee-based earnings and have contributed to record volume growth in the gathering and processing segment. The Natural Gas Liquids segment is seeing strong sequential volume growth, despite increased ethane rejection.","And the recent announcement of the West Texas LPG pipeline and the Mesquite NGL pipeline, which will establish the partnership as a significant fully integrated natural gas liquids service provider in the Permian Basin, generating additional fee-based earnings and increasing the segments gathered NGL volumes nearly 40%.","While NGL location price differentials remain narrow in this lower commodity price environment, let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that the assets we have built and are building, and acquired, increased our ability to add volumes to our systems, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and collect a fee to gather, process, fractionate, store and transport these commodities for producers, processors and customers.","These services provide us, and our customers and investors with sustainable long-term value regardless of location price differentials and commodity prices. Our integrated and extensive network of midstream assets in key basins combined with our strong liquidity at ONEOK Partners leaves us well-positioned for the future.","As we outlined in the earnings release last night, we revised our 2014 guidance at ONEOK Partners, due mainly to the non-cash impairment charge in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segments, and continued narrow Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane differentials. We also narrowed ONEOK\u2019s financial guidance ranges. We\u2019ll provide more color later in the call. Please reference the releases for the updated ranges and midpoints.","To conclude my opening remarks, we remain confident in the partnerships estimated annual distribution increase of 6% to 8% between 2013 and 2016, and we continue to expect EBITDA to increase by an average of 15% to 20% annually between 2015 and 2016.","The distribution growth driven by the ongoing capital program at ONEOK Partners will continue to benefit ONEOK. While our current ONEOK dividend growth rate guidance remains at 10% in 2015 and 2016, we continue to look for opportunities to support a higher dividend growth rate.","At our upcoming Investor Conference on December 3rd, as is our normal practice, we will provide updated financial guidance that will include 2016 and 2017, as well as 2015 at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.","Derek now will review ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 financial highlights. Derek?","Derek Reiners","Thanks, Terry, and good morning. Third quarter 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $65 million or $0.31 per diluted share, which includes a non-cash impairment charge of $76.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share attributable to ONEOK in the gathering and processing segment of ONEOK Partners. I will discuss the impairment charge at the partnership in a few moments.","ONEOK is benefiting from its pure-play general partnership strategy receiving $443 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners in the nine months of 2014, a 12% increase from the same period last year.","Cash flow available for dividends for the first nine months was $478 million providing 1.33 times coverage of the ONEOK dividend. ONEOK increased its quarterly 2014 dividend for the third quarter 2014 by $1.05 per share to $0.59 per share, 55% higher than a year ago.","Now moving on to ONEOK Partners, ONEOK Partners\u2019 third quarter net income was approximately $167 million or -- $0.32 per unit, which includes a non-cash impairment charge of $76 million or $0.31 per unit in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment.","In the third quarter 2013, net income attributable to ONEOK Partners was $216 million, or $0.64 per unit in the second quarter 2013. The non-cash impairment charge, which is included in equity earnings from investments, resulted from the partnerships 49% equity investment in Bighorn Gas Gathering, a natural gas gathering system located in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, where dry natural gas volumes continued to decline.","Distributable cash flow was $293 million for the third quarter, providing coverage of 1.05 times. For the first nine months of 2014, distributable cash flow was $863 million, providing 1.11 times coverage, compared with $704 million for the same period last year, providing coverage of 1.04 times.","Our long-term annual coverage ratio target remains at 1.05 to 1.15 times. The partnerships third quarter 2014 distribution increased to 0.77, an increase of approximately 7% from our third quarter 2013 distribution of $72.5 per unit.","During the quarter we issued 1.4 million common units through our at-the-market equity program for a total of 4.4 million common units in the first nine months of 2014, compared with 681,000 common units issued all of last year through the program.","We have ample liquidity to support the partnerships ongoing capital growth program and the recently announced acquisition, including access to nearly $1.7 billion in our commercial paper program or under our credit facility as of September 30th.","At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $54 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility, a long-term debt to capitalization ratio of 51% and a debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 3.4 times. Our current capital structure metrics are in line with our long-term targets of 50-50 capitalization and debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than four times.","As we have done previously, we expect to utilize our commercial paper program and cash on hand to initially finance our capital investments and we\u2019ll be disciplined and balanced in our approach to obtaining permanent financing as opportunities arise in the debt or equity markets.","Rob, that concludes my remarks.","Rob Martinovich","Thank you, Derek. Starting at ONEOK Partners, the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segments third quarter 2014 operating income was up 42%, compared with the third quarter 2013, due primarily to higher natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and Cana-Woodford Shale, as a result of recently completed capital growth projects.","From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income for the third quarter 2014 compared with the second quarter 2014 was up 25%, due to a $21 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and Cana-Woodford Shale, and a $4 million increase due to changes in contract mix, offset partially by a $3 million decrease in lower net realized prices and a $5 million increase in operating costs, primarily due to timing of materials and supplies.","Volumes increased sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Natural gas gathered increased 12% and natural gas process increased 15%. We have continued to see a significant ramp-up in natural gas volumes across our system and we expect to see this strong growth continue the remainder of the year and into 2015.","Especially in the Williston Basin as improved producer drilling and recovery techniques have resulted in increased natural gas volumes from new wells, with Garden Creek II operating at full capacity and Garden Creek III volumes ramping up.","We have updated our hedging tables in the release. We expect to execute on more natural gas and natural gas liquids hedges for 2015 during the winter heating season. As always, we will continue to monitor the market and execute hedges when opportunities are presented.","The Natural Gas Liquids segments third quarter 2014 operating income was up 19%, compared with the third quarter of 2013, due to higher margin volumes delivered to the Bakken NGL pipeline and from new plants connected in the Mid-Continent region.","From the sequential quarter comparison, operating income was up 9%, due to a $25 million increase in fee-based exchange service margins, which resulted primarily from higher margin volumes delivered to the Bakken NGL pipeline, a $13 million increase in optimization and marketing margins, which resulted from a more than $6 million increase from marketing, truck and rail activities, and $6 million from wider NGL product price differentials, partially offset by a $13 million decrease from narrower normal butane to iso-butane product price differentials, a $5 million decrease from lower NGL volumes as a result of increased ethane rejection and a $4 million decrease from lower operational measurement gains.","Our Bakken NGL pipeline is now gathering nearly 60,000 barrels per day, an almost 50% increase from the previous update in the second quarter. We expect to see higher margin fee-based volume continue to increase with our Garden Creek III plant coming on line three months early for the remainder of the year and through 2015. The recently completed Bakken NGL pipeline expansion gives us additional capacity to transport up to 135,000 barrels per day.","The Natural Gas Pipeline segments third quarter 2014 operating income was up 3% compared with the third quarter 2013, due to higher natural gas transportation revenues related to increased rates on intrastate pipelines, higher contracted capacity and higher natural gas volumes transported. From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income and equity earnings was relatively flat.","Now a brief outlook on the NGL markets. The ethane rejection by natural gas processing plants connected to our NGL system is approximately 150,000 barrels per day. We expect ethane rejection will continue at least through 2016 after which new ethylene production capacity is forecasted to begin coming online. Ethane exports will also have an impact on ethane rejection levels.","Current ethane demand is approximately 1.1 million barrels per day and is expected to increase to approximately 1.2 million barrels per day during the first quarter of 2015 due to decreased ethylene facility downtime. In recent weeks, we have seen Conway-to-Mont Belvieu location price differentials for ethane under $0.03 per gallon in favor of Mont Belvieu. And we expect these narrow differentials to continue for the rest of this year and during 2015.","Propane exports are steady and we are seeing more propane buying in Conway for crop drying and winter demand. As a result, we expect propane location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu to be in the minus $0.03 per gallon to plus $0.02 per gallon range for the remainder of 2014. While we recognize the continued near-term challenges regarding excess ethane supply, the partnership remains well positioned through its integrated network of assets in the NGL-rich basins to provide essential services to its customers for the long term.","We expect the lower commodity price environment to continue through 2015, which will impact our net realized prices for natural gas, NGLs and condensate. However, we do not anticipate that the lower commodity prices will result in reduced drilling activity in the basins in which we operate.","In our view, drilling continues to be economical in the basins where we operate at West Texas intermediate crude oil prices of approximately $45 to $60 a barrel in the Bakken, $50 to $65 a barrel in the Powder River, and $60 to $70 a barrel in the SCOOP. In addition, the key non-commodity price variables that impact drilling economics including well productivity and well cost should also be factored into the breakeven analysis.","That concludes my comments. Wes?","Wes Christensen","Thank you, Rob. A quick update on our announced capital growth program. We have revised our capital growth for 2014 to $1.7 billion from $2.1 billion. This change is a result of the timing of expenditures and has no impact on the projected capital growth, project costs or scheduled completion dates.","As mentioned in last week\u2019s announcement, the Garden Creek III natural gas processing plant was completed in October, three months ahead of schedule and on budget. We were able to utilize construction synergies with Garden Creek II to complete the facility ahead of schedule.","The expansion of the Bakken NGL pipeline was completed in September and increased the pipeline\u2019s capacity to 135,000 barrels per day from 60,000 barrels per day and the Niobrara NGL lateral connecting ONEOK Partners\u2019 Sage Creek natural gas processing facility to the Bakken NGL pipeline was also completed in September. The MB-3 fractionator is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2014.","I would like to point out we increased capital expenditures on Sterling III pipeline and the reconfiguration of Sterling I and Sterling II pipelines to approximately $800 million from $767 million due to higher inspection costs during winter construction and post-commissioning activities.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Wes. Let\u2019s discuss the strategic acquisition we announced last week, which substantially increased our operating presence in the Permian, as we already have a significant position with our natural gas pipeline segment\u2019s ownership of the West Texas transmission intrastate natural gas pipeline system.","With the acquisition of the West Texas LPG pipeline and the Mesquite NGL pipeline, the partnership\u2019s presence in the Permian basin will be significantly stronger. And this acquisition will establish a new region for natural gas liquids growth.","These assets will give us access to a major new NGL supply basin and increases our gathered NGL volumes by nearly 40%, pushing our total system-wide NGL gathered volumes to approximately 800,000 barrels per day. Our expectation is to significantly grow these assets and enhance their service capability and flexibility. Our current plans call for investing approximately $500 million between 2015 and 2019 with even more potential projects to come.","ONEOK Partners expects to generate an adjusted EBITDA multiple of six to eight times between 2017 and 2020 through enhanced customer services and volume increases from pipeline capacity expansions. I should further emphasize that potential margins realized downstream from fee-based fractionation and storage services at our Mont Belvieu facilities could further enhance these multiples.","Our extensive NGL operating experience and the valuable knowledge of the approximately 75 soon-to-be new employees joining us from Chevron will enable us to realize and maximize the true potential of these assets. We\u2019d like to welcome these employees to the ONEOK team.","From a commercial standpoint, we have positive long-term relationships with the customers served by these assets. Many are our current customers in other basins where we operate.","Our existing NGL asset position in Mont Belvieu provides us the ability to offer these customers enhanced services including fractionation and storage, an opportunity that wasn\u2019t available to them under the previous ownership. Although we intend to provide more detail on the call regarding our NGL growth plans in the Permian, we will be limited in certain of our discussions due to the existence of a confidentiality agreement and for the competitive nature of information relating to rate structures and strategies.","Our current and future growth at the partnership has never looked stronger. We have completed approximately $2 billion in capital growth projects this year and expect to add $550 million to the completed list with the completion of the MB-3 Fractionator later in the fourth quarter. So that the partnership will have the full benefit of these completed projects in 2015.","The partnership\u2019s growth is not slowing. $2.5 billion in capital investments have been announced in 2014, including our recent acquisition. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we increased our unannounced backlog range to $4 billion to $5 billion from the previous range of $3 billion to $4 billion in yesterday\u2019s earnings release. Earlier this year, our unannounced backlog was $2 billion to $3 billion.","Our internal capital growth program continues to provide solid visibility into future earnings growth with assets that are well positioned in multiple producing formation, high-growth liquids rich areas such as the Williston Basin, Powder River Basin, Cana-Woodford, Stack and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma and the Permian basin. We continue to remain focused on our strategy to meet our customer\u2019s infrastructure needs quickly and cost effectively.","To put this year in perspective, our 2014 versus 2013 year-over-year distributable cash flow growth rate is over 20%, even with ethane rejection and narrow location price differentials. Despite the ethane-related headwinds, we\u2019ve been facing this year, this has been a strong year at the partnership and we are excited for the future. We expect to continue to deliver solid returns to our unit holders and shareholders through volume growth and predominantly fee-based earnings.","ONEOK as a pure play general partner continues to provide the management and resources to ONEOK Partners to execute on its growth strategies so that the partnership can increase its distributions to unit holders including ONEOK, enabling ONEOK to maximize its dividend payout to shareholders.","In closing, I\u2019d like to again thank our employees, whose dedication and commitment allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly everyday and create exceptional value for our investors and customers. Our entire management team appreciates their efforts to make our company successful.","Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the color.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Christine.","Rob Martinovich","Good morning.","Christine Cho - Barclays","Just some clarification on the acquisition. In yesterday\u2019s release, you say you expect the asset to eventually generate six to eight times which you reiterated on this call. If I take the $800 million purchase price and the $500 million of subsequent CapEx to get to the $1.3 billion and tack on a seven times multiple, I get $185 million of EBITDA, which my common sense tells me I am interpreting this incorrectly.","So if I were to take into consideration your acquisition press release where you say you expect to double the current EBITDA of -- I am estimating $32 million that\u2019s net to you guys. Is that what the $500 million of CapEx will get you to? And you\u2019re expecting to spend probably a considerable amount in fractionation processing distribution, all things related downstream to get you to that all-in six to eight times number by 2017 to 2020. Is that -- am I thinking about that correctly?","Terry Spencer","Well, you are partially.","Christine Cho - Barclays","Okay.","Terry Spencer","Okay. So let me try this and here is the piece that you are missing. When we look at the growth opportunities associated with this business or with this pipeline asset, it\u2019s going to come from primarily three things. We\u2019ve got an existing base business that\u2019s going to have some inherent growth that is volumes behind existing plants and new plants are going to increase as drilling continues in the Permian. A considerable portion of that volume growth does not have much capital associated with it, okay.","You\u2019ve got another bucket of enhanced services. And I can go into some detail about that. Basically providing more flexibility, more delivery capability and in particular across regions providing some packaging opportunities across regions for these customers. We expect to generate enhanced revenues from that. There\u2019s not a whole lot of capital that goes with that bucket, okay.","So then that leaves you with the system expansions where we are planning to build and construct pipeline facilities to handle new volumes, incremental volumes, for shippers that need the increased capacity. That will come at a very low multiple, okay.","So when you add all of these up and you look at the final result, you come to a total six to eight multiple on the roughly $1.3 billion capital, that\u2019s going to be spent, okay. That means -- so your multiple on that -- on the total incremental revenue that\u2019s being generated here looks very, very low and it is very low. Because you have a lot of revenue coming that\u2019s not going to require capital investment.","Christine Cho - Barclays","Okay.","Terry Spencer","I hope that helps?","Christine Cho - Barclays","Yes, that was very helpful. Can you give us a \u2026","Terry Spencer","The last point I\u2019m going to make is that in these numbers there is no downstream revenue coming from fractionation and storage services, okay. Let us make that clear.","Christine Cho - Barclays","Okay.","Terry Spencer","","That will be additive and can help that six to eight multiple go even lower.","Christine Cho - Barclays","I see. Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Can you give us a ballpark estimate, maybe a percentage of the barrels that\u2019s already going to your downstream assets tied to the volumes from the acquisition. And how much is potentially \u201cup for grabs\u201d at some point as legacy contracts roll off? Also if you could provide average length in terms of contract, that would be helpful too.","Wes Christensen","So I will handle this at a high level and what I can tell you is there is basically no volume from this system that\u2019s coming to our fractionators, actually zero, okay.","Christine Cho - Barclays","Okay.","Wes Christensen","So it\u2019s all up there for grabs. We don\u2019t know though what the contractual terms are from a fractionation standpoint. Certainly by owning this pipeline asset, we are now in a position to compete for that business. And certainly I think it would be impractical to think we could get all of it. I\u2019m going to say we have a good chance to get in our fracs. Okay.","Christine Cho - Barclays","Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I think in the past there has been talks about potentially converting the West Texas pipe to crude service. Was this on the table for you guys at all or do the customer contracts on the pipe prohibit you from abandoning NGL takeaway service or do you see the value in keeping NGL service due to all of the other opportunities that it brings to the table for you guys? Is it more valuable in keeping an NGL service versus if you were to convert it and just collect the toll on crude service?","Terry Spencer","Well, Christine, today, it certainly has more value as an NGL pipeline. However, in this day and time you better be thinking about repurposing. Okay. So it should always be in the back of your mind is there a better application for these pipeline assets considering how valuable they are these days in the mainstream space.","So while I couldn\u2019t rule out crude for a portion of the pipeline system, it is certainly something we have to be thinking about and we do think about. But right now, we intend to operate this pipeline system as an NGL facility primarily because of those integration and downstream opportunities. That help you?","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Moving on, we\u2019ll hear from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Terry, appreciate all the color on the Permian, maybe just keying off Christine\u2019s question though. Just trying to get a better sense, I guess perhaps as you look at the three different buckets, perhaps a bit of the ramp profile of how ultimately the 40 becomes 80 becomes 175-plus?","And I ask that in the sense that if the $500 million is primarily system expansions and there is ability to increase revenue and EBITDA without the expansion of capital. Is that something that could potentially come in the earlier years, or is it basically a leverage effect on the extra volume from the system expansions?","Terry Spencer","Well, Carl, what I will tell you is yes. We do see a potential by the time we get to 2017 and course to have a substantial increase in EBITDA along the lines of what we initially indicated. But particularly as we make these capital investments, which begin in the 2017 timeframe and move through the 2019 timeframe, we are going to see significant ramp up in EBITDA during that period.","So basically how this will look is without including any downstream frac or storage synergies, your multiple is going to look about like this. In that 2017 timeframe, you will get to that eight multiple range. And then as you move through that 2019 timeframe, you will drop to that seven-range and then move into about 2020 into that six range.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe just sort of last question off that. Of the $500 million, is that coming from pumping expansion, or I guess I\u2019m trying to get a better sense of? Is this something where you guys are looking at the drilling and ultimately the volume needs and so you go ahead and in effect you pre-build in order to handle that capacity? Or is the $500 million something that will be associated for instance with new incremental contracts as a gating factor, if you will?","Terry Spencer","Well, I think the last part of your question, the answer to that\u2019s yes. But I\u2019m going to let Sheridan Swords take that question.","Sheridan Swords","I think on your first part of the question, yeah, we see the expansion of the pipeline will be predominately looping of sections of the pipeline to increase its capacity, which will also, will have to increase our pumping capacity as well. But as Terry said, we anticipate through our integrated services that we will be contracting under long-term contracts with customers for our expanding capacity through the fracs.","Terry Spencer","That helped you, Carl?","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","And then maybe one last question if I can for Rob, just because you were talking about view of the NGL markets and ethane rejection at least through 2016. And perhaps my nuance on the question is an understanding that you all will give perhaps roll your guidance through to 2017 in December. I didn\u2019t know if the ethane rejection affect will come through 2016 was just a -- we weren\u2019t ready to look out beyond 2016, or if that was actually sort of a call where you expect perhaps a positive ethane frac spread in 2017?","Rob Martinovich","Carl, I guess from our standpoint what we\u2019re tying to add onto is obviously the beginning of those crackers coming on line in that 2017 timeframe. And I think as we have said before, it\u2019s going to be lumpy as those come on and as the ethane supply and demand start to balance out along with the ethane exports. So, really our view hasn\u2019t changed per se from that and so that is really where we are kind of focused on.","Operator","I\u2019m sorry. Moving on, next, we\u2019ll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Morning guys.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Craig.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","I\u2019ve got to tell you, the additional color on that Permian acquisition now sounds extremely attractive.","Terry Spencer","Yeah, we think so. We are glad we got it.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","A couple ones here. Rob, can you discuss the contract changes that increased the G&P contributions sequentially? And also it looks like 2015 NGL hedges didn\u2019t change from 2Q guidance, but the percent hedged fell. Is that a reflection of moderating ethane rejection expectation into next year, or increased propane plus volumes versus prior assumptions?","Rob Martinovich","Yeah, increased propane plus volumes for your second question. With regards to the first question, could you repeat that real quick? Your first part was?","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Changes in G&P contracts.","Rob Martinovich","Yeah. That was in the Williston Basin, Craig, where we had some more fee-based business come on line between the second and third quarter. That was predominately the full amount.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Okay. And so that being fee-based and you think that\u2019s more sustainable and growing?","Rob Martinovich","We do. It is. That particular volume is coming from our Divide County system and so as those volumes continue to ramp up and then sustain, we will be able to maintain that benefit.","Operator","And moving on, we\u2019ll go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies","Hey, guys. This is Corey filling in for Chris.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Corey.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies","Just a quick question on the gathering and processing revised volume guidance. It looks as though you are expecting a pretty flat run rate sequentially, but a pretty good step-up in terms of op income. Just wondering if you can kind of reconcile that for us and how we should think about that going forward?","Terry Spencer","Sure. And certainly you can get in there and look at the -- do your own calculations, kind of for a fourth quarter average and come up. And you will see that volumes are up a tick overall in the fourth quarter over third quarter. But it depends on where those volumes are coming from. So we\u2019re seeing a little bit more of an increase in the Williston Basin volumes and as a result, higher margin per unit there is leading to that increase in income.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then one really quick one if I can follow-up. That asset sale you are expecting to book a $16 million gain on in the pipelines, can you talk about how big that total sales size is and what type of assets you are selling there?","Terry Spencer","What we are doing, it\u2019s really a two-part. We\u2019ve got some non-strategic pad gas that we are selling, so a pretty low basis there. And then we\u2019ve also got a small non-strategic piece of pipe that again is from a sales to value is not much more than what we\u2019re showing there. So in total, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve got a five times sales value going on to get that gain.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Moving on, we will go to John Edwards with Credit Suisse.","John Edwards - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Good morning, everybody and congrats on a nice quarter. I am just curious if you could just talk a little bit about in terms of the inventory of project backlog, it has obviously risen quite a bit this year. I mean, in light of the sort of volatile commodity price environment, do you think it would be even higher, or maybe you could talk a little bit about that? And then my other question is just, what was the impact on the narrowing price differential Conway-Belvieu on the quarter and perhaps on the guidance if you could talk about those things? Thanks.","Terry Spencer","Well, John, so as we look at the backlog. Okay. And I think we have provided some of this color before. We look at the breakdown of that $4 billion to $5 billion backlog. Roughly two-thirds of it actually is going to be coming from the NGL segment, the rest of it comes from gathering and processing in the natural gas pipes. And of course, much of that -- most of that NGL business is all fee-based. Okay.","So as I think from a broad perspective of the inflow of projects into that $4.5 billion backlog, and as we think about the $4.5 billion backlog itself, right now we\u2019re seeing no indications and no impact on this lower commodity price environment on those plants. Okay. We are seeing none. Okay. So that is all still intact and still looks really good. Your second question is on the op -- did that help you?","John Edwards - Credit Suisse","Yeah, it does. That\u2019s really helpful.","Terry Spencer","Okay. So your second question on the optimization margins, when you look at the impact relative to what we guided to for the NGL segment, you have to note that ethane spreads have gone from about $0.07 a gallon in our guidance. We actually experienced ethane spreads at $0.025 to $0.03 for the quarter. So the impacts of the quarter relative to the quarter we guided for the NGL segment, so that delta was a negative $14 million or $15 million, roughly. Okay. So it was a pretty significant impact, or a pretty significant hole we had to come out of in order to have a pretty good quarter. And that\u2019s an indication of the strength of the volume growth that we are seeing in not just the NGL business but the gathering and processing business as well.","Operator","And moving on, we will go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Good morning, guys.","Terry Spencer","Hi, Becca.","Derek Reiners","Hi, Becca.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","First question is on the volumes on West Texas LPG. If, hypothetically, you were able to get a significant amount of those volumes to your own fracs, would you need to construct another frac?","Terry Spencer","We would be able to handle some of that volume in capacity from this new fracs that have been built and that are in the process of being built. For a period of time, there would be a substantial portion of that we could handle. But then as those volumes in those fracs continue to ramp up, we would likely have to build more frac capacity. In theory, let\u2019s say we contracted all of it, certainly we would have to build more frac capacity. And some of that, incidentally, is in our backlog of future growth -- unannounced backlog of future growth.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Okay. Thank you. That answers it. Thank you. And then on the Mesquite system that comes with that, it looks like that really doesn\u2019t generate much EBITDA right now. Can you talk about what you see in that asset, what potentially it could do for your?","Terry Spencer","Well, I mean, the first thing I would tell you that it is integral to the operations of that business. But I\u2019m going to let Sheridan provide you a little more color on your question.","Sheridan Swords","Becca, basically the Mesquite pipeline\u2019s capacity is leased to the partnership to West Texas pipeline\u2019s capacity. So it collects a small lease fee from the partnership but it is integral to the whole operation of that. If you take Mesquite away, you would drop your throughput by quite a bit. Does that answer your question?","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Yes. Thank you, guys.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Becca.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum - Wells Fargo","Hey, guys.","Terry Spencer","Hi, Michael.","Michael Blum - Wells Fargo","Just two more questions on the acquisition. One, just to clarify. So currently or I guess post the closing of the deal, would you guys be a shipper on the line, or is it all third-party shippers on that line? And then when you think about expanding the capacity, would you contemplate for example your marketing business taking some of that capacity?","Terry Spencer","Great question, Michael. And because it\u2019s such a great question, I\u2019m going to get you a great answer from Sheridan Swords.","Sheridan Swords","Michael, currently we do ship on this pipeline. It\u2019s not currently tied into our frac, but it is tied into Mont Belvieu fracs, but we ship a small amount, less than 10,000 barrels a day on that pipeline into our fracs.","As we go forward and we look into the moving more volume on that, we do anticipate that our marketing affiliate will move barrels on that, especially as we offer the bundled service, integration services of both transportation and fractionation and storage. That will be done through the marketing piece.","Michael Blum - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then the second question is, to get to that 6 to 8 multiple, is it strictly -- are we strictly talking about expansions and increased volumes, or you also assuming an increase in the tariff?","Terry Spencer","We do anticipate it will be increased volumes on that piece. As we start talking about tariffs and rates, due to some existing confidentiality agreements and just think of the competitive nature of that question, we really can\u2019t dive into the rate structures at this time.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Jeremy.","Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan","Thanks for taking my question. Terry, want to go back to some of the comments you had at the beginning of the call. And I think you\u2019re talking about opportunities that could increase the 10% growth rate at OKE. And I was wondering if you might be willing to share some more color on the topic in general and if that might involve lower than expected taxes going, now that the spin-off of OGS has been completed sometime, I don\u2019t know if you have better color into what that could look like?","Terry Spencer","Well certainly, Jeremy, I can make a couple comments and Derek can follow up. But yes, we do see potentially an opportunity to increase the dividend growth rate at OKE. You have got to understand we are spending a lot of capital at OKS and certainly that it could equate to more IDR opportunity for OKE.","So certainly we will look at that. This pure play structure that we have in place really sets the tone and does put us in a position to maximize the cash flow to the shareholder. So certainly as we go forward, we are going to look at that. And Derek, you got anything to add?","Derek Reiners","Well, I think that\u2019s exactly right. It will be driven primarily from OKS as OKS grows, and that will also grow distributions, particularly the IDRs at OKE. It will also provide additional depreciation deductions at OKE. So those two things in concert could provide some upside opportunity there.","Terry Spencer","And Jeremy, from a tax perspective, certainly if we get some good news on bonus depreciation for example, that could help us further increase the dividend. Now you know how the process works. Our Board of Directors determines our dividend policy and we sit down and we look at all these factors and make that determination.","And our expectations by the time we get to the December 3 Investor Day, if we have anything new to share with you at that point, which I suspect we will about our business in total, we will share our dividend outlook, particularly the dividend growth outlook for OKE with you.","Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan","That all makes sense. And thank you again for the details on the acquisition. That was all very helpful. Just one last one for me, I was wondering as far as the M&A market is concerned, are you guys still active and looking at other incremental bolt-ons as well that potentially could expand the platform or kind of full with this [Technical Difficulty]?","Terry Spencer","Yeah. We are looking at both, Jeremy. We are looking at asset bolt-ons, projects across the midstream space. Certainly as we said before, not all of them make any sense at all and some of them are so small in scale, they won\u2019t move the needle. But we are looking at those. And on the M&A front, it is -- there\u2019s a lot of chatter out in the marketplace right now.","A lot of people are thinking about consolidation and a lot of people looking at their structure. However, as we kind of sit today, the weakening in the equities markets I\u2019m sure has got some folks, who are considering M&A opportunities kind of perhaps pausing a bit and thinking hard about their strategies.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Moving on, we will go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Ted.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Maybe can you just talk a bit more about, is there a broader strategy in the Permian here after the acquisition? Is this a precursor to investments in gathering processing, or even some storage? Just talk about a broader Permian strategy if there is one?","Terry Spencer","Sure. Ted, there definitely is. I mean, we -- certainly with that NGL position, it could create great synergies with upstream gathering and processing assets. So yes, to the extent that there are gathering and processing opportunities and in particular those that fit well with these assets, we\u2019re going to be very interested.","However, here is the however part, the valuations that we are seeing for certain of these gathering and processing assets in the Permian are astronomical. And so that gives us pause and we\u2019re not going to acquire gathering and processing assets at the expense of economic discipline, okay. We\u2019re just not going to do that.","I think another opportunity for us is crude. We have not only the 2,600 miles of the NGL pipelines we just acquired, but we\u2019ve got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles of natural gas pipelines too that potentially could have some other purposes in particular for crude. So that strategy is as a result of these assets and a result of us having now a kind of a wider footprint in the Permian is really going to have us looking hard at crude opportunities.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Maybe we could just come to the Bakken here. I feel like we haven\u2019t talked about that much on this call. But as you are seeing the regulators turning the screws on the producers up there to hit flaring targets, can you just give us a sense of what the outlook is for the number of new processing plants we are going to need as you look at your supply curves going out for the next few years?","Terry Spencer","Well Ted, the short answer is we\u2019re going to need a lot more, a lot more than we have today. We have in the works enough plans to get us up to 1.2 Bcf a day and the analysts are indicating gas production could be easily 2 Bcf a day or more. What that tells me we need more processing plants. We\u2019ve got about a 50%, as we sit today about a 50% market share up there.","So I would expect a lot of those plants to come right underneath and right well within our footprint. And we have some of that in of course our unannounced backlog and some in our unannounced, unannounced backlog. So yeah, we see a lot of runway there and visibility into a lot more growth.","Operator","Next we will go to Eric Genco with Citi.","Eric Genco - Citi","Hi. I just had a quick question, maybe a clarification. I think you said earlier on the Permian acquisition that you are looking at sort of returns in the 2017 timeframe of eight times, 2019 seven times. And I think you said that the bulk of the $500 million of incremental capital will be spent 2017 to 2020, but I just wanted to make sure I understood that. Is basically, associated with those numbers are you saying that what sort of the gross cash invested at those times?","Terry Spencer","You\u2019ll see the 500 million, you will see $200 or $300 million spent in that \u201817 to \u201819 timeframe and the balance of it spent earlier, prior to 2017. So that\u2019s kind of how the shape of the CapEx spend will look.","Eric Genco - Citi","Okay. Thank you. And then I guess just trying to understand and maybe this is a point of clarification. You mentioned, you talked about the impact of ethane rejection in the quarter and then you mentioned sort of demand likely going up next quarter as certain plants maybe come back online. How do you really -- I mean from a GPM perspective, how do you think about things kind of over the next year and evolving?","We are still in ethane rejection but should we think about this as being maybe one of the worst quarters for ethane rejection, should it get a little better gradually? And how do you think about that as you figure the Williston Basin is a greater share of the volumes in this richer gas, so I\u2019m just trying to think about those dynamics? Thank you.","Terry Spencer","That\u2019s kind of a mouthful in terms of question, but what I will tell you is, is that I\u2019ll try to give you the condensed answer. And that is throughout 2015, we expect prices to stay relatively low. You will see ethane prices at Belvieu probably in that low $0.20 a gallon range. So fundamentally, we\u2019re still going to be oversupplied.","We are still going to reject ethane at pretty high levels. So we\u2019re going to continue to see this in the 2015 timeframe and we will see it continue into 2016. So we will see this narrow spread environment. We are not going to be making a whole lot of money in terms of ethane optimization for the next 18 to 24 months, and certainly we don\u2019t have that -- we are not counting on it in our forward view.","So ethane fundamentals, while we are seeing peak demand or strong demand at 1.2 -- 1.1 million to 1.2 million barrels per day, we\u2019re balancing the market with about 350,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection as an industry. So it\u2019s all well and good and you hear all these good things about the petchems, but quite frankly we are awash in ethane and having to reject it to balance it up. I see that those fundamentals continuing throughout 2015.","Operator","And gentlemen, it appears there are no further questions. I would like to turn it back to you for any additional or closing comments.","T.D. Eureste","Thanks for joining us.

Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Ziola","Thank you, Todd and good morning and welcome to ONEOK's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions.","A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934.

Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK.","Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. I'll make a few brief comments and then turn the call over to Walt to discuss our first quarter financial highlights.","To start, we've continued to see an improving industry backdrop since January. Crude prices have strengthened, producers remain active across our operations and our capital growth program remains on track and on budget.","Project construction is progressing very well with our ability to predict expected completion dates improving every week. As it looks today, we now expect the southern section of the Elk Creek pipeline to be complete early in the third quarter of this year and the entire pipeline complete during the fourth quarter.","The Arbuckle II pipeline and MB-4 fractionator are expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. Keep in mind, the earlier these projects are completed and are placed into service, the earlier ONEOK begins to recognize earnings on them.","Based on producer activity and the progress on our projects and assuming no dramatic market change, ending the year at the low end of our capital guidance range is less likely than it was in February. To the extent that we may be above the guidance midpoint of $3.1 billion, we would be spending construction dollars in 2019 that were previously planned for 2020 and accelerating the in-service dates for some projects.","Last week, we announced an extension of our Bakken NGL pipeline in North Dakota to connect with a third party natural gas processing plant. We're not only connecting an additional plant, we're reaching into a new area of the Bakken and providing NGL takeaway in Williams County, which historically has had limited transportation options. And by doing so, we are enhancing our ability to provide potential NGL transportation services to more customers.","Additionally, our commercial team continues to evaluate a potential NGL export facility on the Gulf Coast. As this opportunity continues to evolve and develop, we will provide further details as appropriate.","After more than a year of taking about our capital growth projects, we are nearing completion on several of them. Over the coming months, these projects will add critical NGL takeaway, fractionation and natural gas processing capacity for our customers where they need it the most, providing ONEOK with substantial long-term fee-based earnings and cash flow growth.","With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for comments on our first quarter results.","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry.","ONEOK's first quarter 2019 net income totaled $337 million or $0.81 per share, a 27% increase year-over-year and first quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $638 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. All three business segments recorded double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth compared with the first quarter 2018.","Distributable cash flow in the first quarter 2019 was more than $500 million, but more than 17% from the first quarter 2018 with a healthy dividend coverage of 1.43 times. We continued to reinvest in the business, generating more than $150 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in the first quarter 2019.","During the first quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.86 per share and in April, we announced an increase to $0.865 per share or $3.46 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record on April 29.","Our March 31, debt to EBITDA, on an annualized run rate basis, was 4.0 times and 4.1 times on a trailing 12 month basis. We ended the first quarter with total available liquidity of $3.25 billion, including borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion available on our credit facility and $750 million available on our three-year unsecured term loan agreement.","As Terry mentioned, the industry environment has strengthened since the fourth quarter and construction on some of our largest projects could be completed early in the quarter as we've specified. We have clear line of sight to the ramp and timing of expected cash flows on these projects, which combined with our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, continues to underscore our expectation for no equity financing needs in 2019 or 2020.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operating performance.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt.","I'll walk through each of our operating areas and touch on a few more highlights related to operations in our projects. Starting with the Rockies region, raw feed NGL throughput volume on the Bakken NGL pipeline averaged 167,000 barrels per day in the first quarter with most of this growth attributable to increasing volumes being railed from the basin.","Natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region increased to more than 1 billion cubic feet per day during the first quarter, as we continued to see strong producer activity and record North Dakota natural gas production in January. We estimate more than 250 million cubic feet per day of natural gas is currently being flared on ONEOK's acreage, providing a clear backlog of volume to fill Demicks Lake I, when it begins service in the fourth quarter of this year.","We expect additional flared natural gas and continued strong production to provide for a quick volume ramp of Demicks Lake II, which is expected to come online in the first quarter of 2020. Each of these plants, when full, are expected to provide approximately 25,000 barrels per day of NGLs to our Elk Creek Pipeline, not including ethane recovery. We continue to expect Elk Creek to reach approximately 100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020 with volumes increasing throughout 2020 and beyond.","At volumes of 100,000 barrels per day, Elk Creek will be generating its targeted adjusted EBITDA multiple of four to six times within its first few months of operation. In addition, we now have secured contracts with natural gas processing plants in the Rocky Mountain region that can produce up to 200,000 barrels per day of NGLs, up from 170,000 barrels per day previously reported.","The Williston Basin continues to average more than 60 rigs operating with approximately 25 rigs on our dedicated acreage. If crude prices sustain around $60 to $65 per barrel, we could see additional rigs move into the basin once NGL takeaway capacity and natural gas processing capacity are completed this year. Feedback from producers in the Powder River Basin also remains positive, where we continue to have more than 20 rigs on our dedicated NGL acreage.","Moving onto the Mid-Continent, NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased approximately 4% in the first quarter 2019 compared with the same period last year. Volumes decreased in the first quarter of 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to the impact of winter weather in the first quarter and some short-term volume we only gathered in second half of 2018.","Construction on Arbuckle II pipeline is on track for completion in the first quarter of 2020 and our total contracted capacity on Arbuckle II is now 350,000 barrels per day compared with 320,000 barrels per day previously.","In our gathering and processing segment, winter weather impacts and the delayed timing of several well completions contributed to the decline in natural gas volumes processed in the Mid-Continent in the first quarter 2019 compared with the fourth quarter 2018. Producer activity on our acreage in the STACK and SCOOP areas remains in line with our expectations and we're on track to be within our volume guidance range.","In our natural gas pipelines segment, contracted pipeline capacity increased 10% compared with the first quarter 2018. This increase was driven by recent pipeline project completions in both the Mid-Continent region and the Permian Basin. These strategic expansions have helped alleviate natural gas pipeline constraints in these areas, as we've been able to provide much needed takeaway for our customers.","Now, taking a closer look at our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast operations, NGL raw feed throughput volumes in this region increased 7% compared with the fourth quarter 2018, primarily driven by increased volume on our West Texas LPG pipeline system, including a ramp in volumes from our completed extension into the Delaware Basin.","Additionally, the average NGL fee rate associated with our Gulf Coast Permian volumes increased to an average of $0.05 per gallon in the first quarter 2019. The higher rate is primarily being driven by increased bundled service volumes or transportation and fractionation volumes on West Texas LPG.","Volume on this pipeline has historically been lower margin, transport only barrels, but as legacy volumes roll off, we are replacing them with higher margin transportation and fractionation volume, which we expect will cause this average rate to continue trending upward. ONEOK's system-wide NGL fractionation capacity is approximately 810,000 barrels per day, given our current product composition and this capacity remains approximately 90% utilized.","We continue to look at several debottlenecking projects that could add 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity in 2019 and early 2020 and be efficiently completed at costs substantially lower than new construction. These de-bottlenecking projects are expected to provide capacity to help bridge us to the early first quarter 2020 completion of our 125,000 barrel per day MB-4 fractionator, which we expect will exit 2020 at full capacity.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Kevin.","We've had a great start to 2019 and are looking forward to getting a number of these projects to the finish line in the coming months. The credit goes to our employees who remain extremely focused on operating our existing assets and building new ones safely and responsibly. We'll be putting hundreds of miles of pipeline and several facilities into service later this year and into next, which will dramatically increase the scale of our operations and provide much needed infrastructure and services for our customers.","Our employees work every day to provide solutions for these customers, to enhance our business and to make ONEOK even more sustainable for the long term, all while focusing on safety and reliability, limiting our impact on the environment and providing value to our investors. Again, I want to express my thanks to all of our employees.","With that, operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Christine Cho of Barclays.","Christine Cho","I wanted to start off with the lateral to the Bakken NGL line. I think the processor that you're connecting to their other processing plants have been connected to different NGL takeaway solutions. Can you provide us some color on what's going on with those other options and why they finally came to you? Also my guess is the capacity of the pipeline even though you guys haven't disclosed it, it's much more than the contract is. Can you give us an idea of what other opportunities you have along the line?","Sheridan Swords","Christine, this is Sheridan. I think once we get Elk Creek in line that the customers up there are seeing that our alternative for NGL takeaway nets them a greater net back than going the existing route, and as they continue to expand up in that area that their existing outlets are limited and they need that extra capacity.","And you are correct, we are putting in a line that could move probably over 200,000 barrels a day, the lateral going over there. We see today other processing plants in the area that this pipeline goes by are producing approximately 10,000 barrels a day. But as we talk to people in the area that 10,000 barrels a day could grow to as much as 40,000 barrels per day in the near future.","Christine Cho","And then moving over to just sort of the ethane with also Permian ethane that's coming out, and I think pressuring ethane prices in the event Conway ethane frac spread remains negative. Should we think that third-party processing plants are rejecting the ethane. So there's less supply of ethane showing up at Conway for you to optimize. Just some color and how we should think about that?","Sheridan Swords","I think you're right. As long as you keep Conway ethane in rejection which is sitting there today, you will have about the same amount of ethane, you have today. It may grow a little bit as we bring on couple new plants in the second quarter. But remember, not every plants can't reject \u2013 not every plant can reject all the ethane. There some ethane that has to come out naturally anyway on our system. So I think what we're seeing today is what we think we'll see going forward if we stay in a time when Conway going to stand in ethane rejection.","Kevin Burdick","And Christine it's Kevin. I mean you've also got the significant amount of demand for more ethane coming on in the back half of 2019 as well. So that's going to be, that's going to pull more ethane out also.","Christine Cho","And can you give us an idea of, like the utilization on Sterling I and II for the quarter?","Terry Spencer","We just finished the expansion of Sterling III and we really operate those pipelines altogether they move around and we're a little bit under 90% for the total system.","Christine Cho","And then last question for me, I just wanted to make sure, can you remind us on the LPG export project any partner that you guys bring on would be someone who would take the volumes, yes or might think about it?","Kevin Burdick","Yes Christine this is Kevin. Well, I think it could we're exploring a lot of alternatives but yeah, especially as you think about ethane that would be a scenario that could play out LPGs might have a different approach, but we're working with the markets, on both sides. And we're working with others as well and still working through the details of what that, what that might look like.","Christine Cho","When you say both sides do you mean ethane and LPG I'm sorry ethane?","Kevin Burdick","Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Two questions from me one, some of the recent data coming out of the government and Bakken production shows a decline in the last couple of months. So I wondering if you just comment in terms of any trends you're seeing in terms of overall production trends in the Bakken?","Kevin Burdick","Well Michael, this is Kevin. I mean from a gas perspective we set a record in January. So that's always a good sign February, you had quite a bit of weather, not necessarily abnormal, but that pulled production back a little bit which is, standard kind of operating procedure this time of year. There is the feedback we're getting from not only our G&P customers, but then there\u2019s already been a couple calls from some of the other processors up there, the results have been incredibly strong. So we don't see any pullback of volumes of rigs and the results seem to keep getting stronger.","Michael Blum","The second question I had was on this potential LPG export project. I was wondering if you just talk to some of the competitive dynamics and return expectations you would have. I'm sure you're well aware that one of the big players in that market is out very publicly talking about basically keeping their rates down to keep competition out of the markets. So I was wondering if you could just kind of talk about the competitive dynamics and what returns would look like for a project like this. Thanks.","Sheridan Swords","Michael, we are seeing it's a very competitive market out there on the LPG side and if we would get into the LPG and ethane. It would be a very strategic move that we see that we need to be able to clear our product and be able to incite more ethane to come out. So it's a bigger look and just straight economics. No doubt the economics would be more compressed than we've seen on some of the recent projects, but we think it's a long-term play if we would go that route that we would do.","Kevin Burdick","So I think, Michael, this is Kevin. I think we've said and we continue to maintain that the project will - the project will stand on its own merits. So as we look at that obviously, the economics will be key but Sheridan is right it's a very competitive landscape out there for the project.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Just wanted just wanted to touch on Elk Creek and how that was going with the contracting side, if anything was added since the last quarter and kind of what enabled you to pull forward the timeframe here. It seems like pipeline project seem to be pulling backwards as opposed to be pulling forward so I\u2019m wondering what we were able to accomplish?","Terry Spencer","We'll start with the contracting. As I said in my remarks that we were now 200,000 barrels a day contracted out of the Rockies region that will ultimately we believe hit Elk Creek. As for the construction and our teams just jumped, they've done a great job executing as we've gone through the first stages of the project as we move forward. We've been very open about starting with the southern section and the team has made great project even through some tough weather and some very wet weather in the winter and early spring.","But still on track and got comfortable that we now think it's going to be that southern section, can be complete early in the third quarter. So just a great job of executing so far by our project team as it relates to write away acquisition and getting the pipe in the ground.","Jeremy Tonet","And looking at the Mid-Con looks things have step down a little bit 1Q versus 4Q for some of the volumes you had. Just wondering how you see that kind of trending over the balance of the year. Has there been any change as far as producer communications for their activity levels are things kind of within the band of what you expect?","Chuck Kelley","Jeremy, this is Chuck. I'd say Mid-Con we got a good start to the year with our 32 well connects and the number of rigs operating. On our acreage are consistent with our plan and with guidance volumes were within the band of guidance. So we feel good about our numbers balance of the year in Mid-Con and in talking with some of the producers we actually see some of the rigs movement moving to our acreage on the SCOOP later in the year end of Q2 end of Q3. So overall, I just think we're one on pace with our guidance for the year.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies.","Chris Sighinolfi","Thanks for your time today. Terry I am not sure this for you or if this Walt, but just wanted to follow up on the discussion we had on the last quarter call about the pace of your dividend growth. Was just, I've noticed in subsequent presentations following that discussion that the 9% to 11% rate that you previously discussed and featured. You no longer peers obviously, the pace of growth has decelerated over the last two quarters below that range unless there is a subsequent step up later in the year. So I'm just I'm not advocating for a particular range or saying that there's something optimal I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to interpret what we've seen and what you guys are thinking at this point?","Walt Hulse","Well, as far as the omission I wouldn't read anything into that. We've been clear on that guidance and it hadn't changed. We established that guidance shortly after the consolidation transaction. So it's in place. So I wouldn't read anything into that. I think as the Board thinks about as we go into the balance of the year and it thinks about our dividend policy going forward, obviously we got the guidance there.","But I think the most important fact they will take into consideration is just a tremendous cash flow growth that we see for the company. Business is performing extremely well and particularly with these projects coming online earlier and the growth opportunities we continue to develop, the free cash flow generation really its continuing to exceed our expectations as we look out, so that will be the key thing that they take into consideration as I think about the dividend policy going forward.","Chris Sighinolfi","The baseline view is still a view around the 9% to 11% that you're talking about?","Walt Hulse","Absolutely that guidance is still there, so.","Chris Sighinolfi","And then I guess maybe for Kevin or for Sheridan. We had previously chatted about heat content in the Bakken as it pertains to Northern Border and the fact that, ethane rejection might not just be a economic decision, but maybe an operational one. I'm just wondering where we shake out on that a lot of processing set to come up later this year and into next year, but curious how the dynamics look today?","Kevin Burdick","Yes, this is Kevin and yes, that's still something we watch very closely and stay in touch with - as you push with the basin being in ethane rejection right now you're pushing more and more high BTU content gas into Northern Border, that trend will continue and you're right, if you think about them Demicks 1 and Demicks 2 and the target has plant and Crestwood's expansion and you think about those that all the capacity there and all that residue making its way to Northern Border, clearly we're watching the BTU content at the bottom of border very closely.","As we've said, we have the ability, as does the rest of the processors up there to recover ethane. Now, we need to get out Creek and service first before we would have the capacity to do that. But once we have Elk Creek in service, then we've got that's a nice option, we have as an industry, to be able to lower the BTU content on border if we start seeing downstream market impacts.","Chris Sighinolfi","And kind of why have you. Just a follow-up on Michael's earlier question about the export dock. I think you said that the project would have to stand on its own. So in terms of returns you guys have talked for a while about getting into that market. Michael referenced that you are talking about aggressively pricing their capacity, we shouldn't think about there being maybe a sub-optimal return on getting access to that space made up or through later expansions or anything like that.","Walt Hulse","Yes, I mean I wouldn't think about it that way that you're going to see periods of time where competition for spot space or it to the extent that there is excess capacity on these docs, you're going to see some dock on dock competition that will pressure margins.","But as we think about this project, we\u2019re thinking about it long-term contracting solid returns even relative to our other investments that we have obviously, the project itself, it would be a strategic move for us, making sure that we have the ability to clear barrels.","We could have the ability to clear barrels even without of dock, longer term, but it's better if we have dock. So, but as Kevin indicated, we're looking at all our options and again it's a project that we are investing a lot of time in and certainly it's a capability that would add value to our existing suite of capabilities.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Actually I have a couple of them. First of all, your thought for a while about the expansion capability at either Elk Creek and Arbuckle II just with pumps. How are you thinking about the timeline for when you would potentially implement that and would you do it kind of staggered or you think the market warrants like bigger leaps?","Sheridan Swords","This is Sheridan, obviously is we're starting to get contract up to 200,000 barrels a day. That is really on our mind when we put it in. We have the ability to stagger it, you don't have to go all the way on Elk Creek to the $400,000, there's intermediate steps you can just put a couple of pumps in here in a couple of pumps and there and get incremental capacity, so we can do that in stages we go on but definitely as we reach this 200,000 barrel a day mark.","We are definitely looking at when we want to expand that pipeline because we want to make sure that we have the capacity to meet the customers' needs up there and don't get into an issue where the pumps are delayed by anyway by any means.","Kevin Burdick","And the only thing I would add on to that. This is Kevin, the contracted volumes that we talk about and we report really C3 plus volumes and they don't assume any ethane being extracted, so as we also think about our capacity on Elk Creek, we want to make sure we've got the ability and have some capacity available that if we back to Chris' question that if we do need to pull some ethane out because of downstream spec issues or the issues on board in the BTU content that we have the capacity to be able to do that. So we factor that into our thoughts on capacity expansions as well.","Michael Lapides","And then on with debottlenecking projects for the fracs. Can you talk a little bit about how much incremental capacity you think you're adding to that and when you think you get that completed?","Sheridan Swords","That's what we said, we were at 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of additional, we think we can get. You will see some of that maybe 10 to 20-ish and that we expect will get probably in 2019 with the balance in early 2020.","Michael Lapides","And then last thing, the rates of the margin, on West Texas, meaning the Permian in the Gulf Coast, you've talked about going from $0.04 to $0.05, and more importantly you made the comment about it kind of continuing to creep higher. How should we think about that? How do you want investors to think about how much higher that could creep? Are you talking about just kind of slow and gradual are you talking about moving closer to the rates you're getting in the Mid-Con. I just want to kind of frame that a little bit?","Sheridan Swords","It\u2019s Sheridan again. What I would say is that it's, I wouldn't say it's going to be slow and gradual, obviously we have the next expansion coming on West Texas pipeline that is contracted and when those volumes come up. They will almost be contracted at a rate twice as our average when that volume comes on. And then obviously we know that we will be losing some legacy volume as other pipelines come on and we have contracted that space as well.","So I think there's two big leaps we will see in that rate going up. One is, when we complete the second expansion of the West Texas and the other one will be when their pipelines are completed out of there and volume comes off and we were able to replace it without volumes that we've contracted at the market rate and not at below-market rate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dennis Coleman of Bank of America.","Dennis Coleman","I guess, if I wonder if I might ask a little bit more strategic question. You talk about the export docks and how you enter that market. M&A has been the topic that's come up quite a bit in recent weeks with some of the M&A and on the producer side and just some producer activity. How do you think about the M&A market, particularly with your currency being attractive as it is for that?","Terry Spencer","Yes, well, as far as the M&A market goes, we think about it quite a bit. The effect of the meant is the challenge there course is transact ability, when you think about the opportunity set that this company has heavy organic tremendous returns, low-risk projects relative to say much more strategic or exotic M&A.","So we remain focused on this organic growth opportunity set that we have. So it's difficult for us to rationalize the risk associated with some of these transactions that we think that we think about, we'll look, we'll look we have investment bankers coming to us with their own ideas and what makes sense, but you know whenever seems to have a deal ready to do, so we stay focused on what we do and that\u2019s build in this infrastructure in these basins where we have these great, positions.","I mean, candidly, when you look at it just purely on an accretion basis, just look at on DCF per unit accretion, these organic projects blow away any M&A transaction. So that's why we stay focused and you continue to execute heavily on the organic side. Does it help you?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sunil Sibal of Seaport Capital.","Sunil Sibal","Couple of questions from me, starting out on the Permian side of things, seems like, how should we think about 150,000 to 200,000 kind of barrels per day of NGL volumes on that pipeline contracted \u2013 rolling over the next 1 to 2, 3 years?","Terry Spencer","I think you will be over 200,000, yeah I think you'd be close to 300,000 barrels a day over the next couple of years on that pipeline moving. You already today approaching, 250,000 barrels, that's moving on the pipeline. So I think, we will be over 300,000 next couple of years, easily.","Sunil Sibal","Actually I was kind of trying to get some color on the legacy contracts that you have on that pipeline, how should those contracts been rolling over in the next one, two, three years?","Kevin Burdick","I think most of them will come off that we see coming off will come off in 2019.","Sunil Sibal","And then on the CapEx side of things. Seems like on the growth CapEx side you spent close to it $850 million this quarter, how should we think about cadence of that over the remainder of the year?","Terry Spencer","Yes we, I mean think about our projects, especially the big four we are in the heavy construction as we went through the first quarter. We\u2019ll continue heavy construction as we go through the second and third quarter. Every project kind of has a natural flow as far as when the capital spent and as you get towards the end it tapers off a little bit so as you see that, but what could change that is again.","We're doing everything we can to accelerate these projects that purely from a timing perspective, you might see some dollars. If we're above the guidance we would be, it would just be a shift from $20 into 2019 or vice versa. It's just literally the timing of how that would play out at the end of the year.","Sunil Sibal","And then just a clarification on the dividend growth policy, I think previously the policy has been 9% to 11% annual rate. Is there any thought on kind of thinking about that rate on an average basis over the next three years or so, just to kind of manage your CapEx spend, or should we just think about 9% to 11% every year through 2021?","Terry Spencer","So the Board is going to continue to take it up on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But what I would tell you is that the fundamental of our business continues to strengthen, given us plenty of earnings to support our dividend growth. And we have not adjusted our dividend growth guidance and we'll let the Board look at it, but we have strong earnings to support our guidance.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jean Salisbury of Bernstein.","Jean Salisbury","What a Basin turnaround from the Bakken, if it is pursued the overall good or bad for what else I can kind of see both sides that would be interested in your view of the impact?","Kevin Burdick","Well, I think, this is Kevin. I think clearly anytime there's addition. We don't want to be takeaway constrained right. And so we're always looking for ways to ensure that we have the takeaway for our customers up there. And so that will involve you look at residue in a couple of different ways. And so, I think it would come down to what type of rate, what type of term, and what type of volume commitments that would be required to make a project like that work versus alternatives, that the basin might have of other ways to handle the residue, which would also include handling some of the residue by recovering ethane.","So I think that's still under. As we look through it and we\u2019ll be thinking through that, but clearly having. We don't want the Basin to be takeaway constrained from the producer standpoint, we want them to be able to continue to drill.","Jean Salisbury","And then there's some concern by investors of a fractionation overbuild over the next couple of years, how much of your Mont Belvieu fractionation is take or pay or perhaps otherwise protected?","Terry Spencer","Most of our new stuff coming on has very limited take or pay and that the market in these last couple rounds as built as not supported take or pay economics. But what I would say is that Mont Belvieu fractionation position and we anticipated the four and five being full, but under the scenario that they wouldn't we're not full we always have the option to take barrels that were fracking in the Mid-Continent moving down to the Gulf Coast and collect the additional Conway to Belvieu spread on that piece, but I don't think.","What I'm seeing today with what's coming on. Now, there may be a little bit of short-term overcapacity in the fractionation market. But I think long term beaten up pretty quickly. And also remember that a lot of the players that are building these fracs today are storing raw feed and they will have to frac that off once they come on. So it's not just new production its production that's coming on. Now that we do not have enough frac capacity to today.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Three quick questions around Elk Creek, the growth that we're seeing out of the Bakken or out of the Rockies is being railed and the rail volumes have, if I understand that de minimis margins currently. So when the southern leg of Elk Creek opens up and we have more capacity upstream the Bakken NGL line, those volumes kind of immediately get what$0.20plus bump in margin?","Terry Spencer","Yes, you\u2019re pretty close.","Craig Shere","And on the 200,000 a day ultimate capacity that's been contracted in the Rockies, two questions on that. One, how long do you think that that could take to reach full capacity on those contracts. And two, can you break it down between Bakken and DJ?","Terry Spencer","I think we will ramp up to that 200,000 fairly quickly. I would say probably as we get into 2021, we will see that volume be at that rate up to 200,000 barrels. And once again, as Kevin said, that is assuming no ethane, if anything comes on your reset a lot quicker, so I think it take a little bit of time. I think the last piece will come in the delay on the last piece would be. We got to get the lateral over which will be completed the end of 2020.And then it would you repeat your last part of the question?","Craig Shere","I wanted to get a sense where it's all sourcing from in terms of proportion from the Bakken or DJ?","Terry Spencer","I would say about 70% to 80% coming out of the Bakken.","Craig Shere","Right. And one last versus\u2026","Chuck Kelley","Craig, just before you, before you move on, really a lot of those volumes are coming out of the powder not as DJ.","Terry Spencer","Yes, 80% of the Bakken and almost the almost the rest of it's all out of the Powder River.","Craig Shere","And the last question I noticed DCF coverage in the quarter was aided by lower sequential maintenance like CapEx and higher sequential other income, can you touch on the repeatability of that?","Terry Spencer","I think it's maintenance is just normal timing that comes and goes quarter-to-quarter and when the project gets done or not. The other was a small and non-strategic assets that we sold for a very small amount of money. So that was just a kind of ordinary course cleaning up some assets.","Operator","Thank you, this concludes our questions for today. I'll turn it back to Andrew Ziola for closing remarks.","Andrew Ziola","Thank you, Todd. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in early July and extends until we release earnings in later July. We will provide details for the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us, and the IR team will be available throughout the day.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew J. Ziola","Thank you.

A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","Our first speaker is John Gibson, Chairman and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. John?","John W. Gibson","Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and many thanks to all of you for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and in ONEOK Partners. Joining me today are Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; and Terry Spencer, our President. Also on the call and available to answer your questions are Pierce Norton, Executive Vice President of Commercial; and Rob Martinovich, Executive Vice President of Operations.","Today we will review the first quarter 2013 financial results; review our progress on our growth projects, including projects completed and about to complete; and finish with some comments about our backlog and future growth projects.","So let me start with our first quarter performance. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' first quarter results were lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The partnership's earnings were lower primarily because of reduced NGL optimization margins, lower NGL volumes due to ethane rejection and lower realized commodity prices. And I'll provide a bit more color on that in a moment.","On a positive note, the partnership continues to see the volume growth we expected in both the natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing businesses as a result of our completed capital projects. And that volume growth will continue as volumes from the new Stateline II natural gas processing plant and, of course, the Bakken NGL pipeline ramp-up.","ONEOK's natural gas distribution segment turned in slightly higher results for the first quarter, reflecting higher rates, offset partially by higher share-based expenses. And our energy services segment reported a loss, although lower than the first quarter last year. This segment continues to face headwinds due to both low natural gas prices and volatility.","As Terry will explain to you in more detail in his remarks, the partnership's NGL segment had a $90 million reduction in NGL optimization margins compared with the first quarter last year. Specifically in the first quarter of this year, the NGL price differential between Conway and Mont Belvieu was $0.01 per gallon for ethane while a year ago it was $0.24 per gallon. The other contributing factor to the reduction is that our NGL optimization volumes were lower than the a year-ago levels.","And as you may recall, these lower NGL optimization volumes are intentional on our part as a result of our long-term strategy to convert more of the NGL transportation capacity previously used for optimization activities to fee-based revenues. The intent of this strategy is to reduce the earnings volatility attributable to price spreads. These 2 factors, the tighter NGL price differentials between Conway and Belvieu and less NGL optimization capacity, are the primary reasons of the quarter-over-quarter earnings decrease at the partnership.","We also affirmed our 2013 earnings guidance ranges for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners based on the expectation that recently completed and soon-to-be completed projects will contribute earnings throughout the rest of the year. And Terry will provide you with more information on these projects in his remarks.","Derek will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, followed by Terry, who will review ONEOK's operating performance. Derek?","Derek S. Reiners","Thanks, John, and good morning. ONEOK's first quarter net income was $113 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared with $123 million or $0.58 per diluted share for the same period last year. As a reminder, first quarter 2012 net income included $14 million or $0.07 per share from ONEOK's retail marketing business that was sold in February 2012.","ONEOK Partners' results were lower in the first quarter compared with the same period last year due primarily to narrower NGL location differentials and lower realized NGL prices, offset somewhat by higher volumes mainly in the Williston Basin. The natural gas distribution segment posted higher results due to increased rates, offset partially by higher operating expenses. The energy services segment continues to face a challenging market. However, its results improved compared with last year's first quarter.","ONEOK reaffirmed 2013 guidance with net income expected to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million and we have not made any adjustments to our 3-year guidance provided in February. In April, we declared a dividend of $0.36 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. Subject to Board approval we expect to increase the dividend $0.02 per share in July and, as mentioned in our year-end conference call, we will reevaluate our dividend if market conditions improve.","In the first quarter, ONEOK received $131 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, a 43% increase from the same period last year. ONEOK's first quarter 2013 standalone cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $125 million. We currently are and have been benefiting from bonus depreciation that was extended in January but we do not expect this benefit to continue after 2013. The resulting effect is that our cash payments for taxes are expected to rise in future years, thus reducing our free cash flow.","Our slightly lower 3-year dividend growth rate announced in February reflects both the revised cash distributions anticipated from ONEOK Partners and our expectations about higher future cash taxes. We still expect to generate significant free cash flows in the future, which will be available to consider increasing the dividend, acquiring additional units of ONEOK Partners and\/or repurchasing ONEOK shares. As we have said many times, we will consider each of these alternatives at the time but they are not mutually exclusive.","ONEOK's liquidity position remains strong. At the end of the first quarter on a standalone basis, we had $551 million of commercial paper outstanding, $75 million of cash and cash equivalents, $647 million available under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility, which we amended in March, extending the maturity to 2018. Our standalone debt to capitalization ratio was 45%.","Now Terry will update you on ONEOK's operating performance.","Terry K. Spencer","Thank you, Derek, and good morning. Let's start with our natural gas distribution segment. As you saw in the news release, first quarter 2013 earnings were higher compared with the same period last year, reflecting higher rates in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Operating costs were higher compared with the first quarter 2012 primarily because of share-based compensation expenses due to the appreciation of ONEOK's share price along with increasing pension expenses and property taxes.","While energy services' earnings are up compared with the same period last year, it continues to experience challenging market conditions. In the first quarter, this segment realized an operating loss of $4.4 million compared with a loss of $30.7 million first quarter of 2012. We did see a reduction in storage and transportation costs of $7 million due to the reduction in our leased storage capacity. We have 53 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity under lease at the end of this quarter compared with nearly 76 Bcf at March 31, 2012.","John, that concludes my remarks about ONEOK.","John W. Gibson","Okay. Thank you, Terry. Now Derek will review with you the ONEOK Partners' financial performance and then we'll go back to Terry. He'll take a look at the partnership's operating performance, the growth projects and then give you a brief update on our view of the current and longer-term NGL market.","Derek S. Reiners","Thanks, John. In the first quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income was $157 million or $0.42 per unit compared with $239 million or $0.91 per unit in the first quarter of 2012. Distributable cash flow was $193 million in the quarter compared with $279 million in the first quarter of 2012, resulting in a coverage ratio of 0.81x for the first quarter, 2013.","By comparison, our coverage ratio is 1.74x in the first quarter of 2012, when we realized higher NGL optimization margins benefiting from a $0.24 per gallon Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane differential, compared with a $0.01 per gallon differential in the first quarter of 2013. As we said then, we did not believe the wide NGL location price differential was sustainable and, as a result, did not raise our distribution to unitholders, which is why the coverage ratio was so high. Our long-term annual coverage ratio target remains at 1.05 to 1.15x. However, as we discussed in our year-end earnings conference call, we expect our full year 2013 coverage ratio to be less than our target but still greater than 1x.","We reaffirmed 2013 net income guidance range of $790 million to $870 million and distributable cash flow range of $910 million to $1.0 billion and we did not make any changes to our 3-year growth forecast that we provided on February. We increased the distribution declared by $0.005 per unit for the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 13% from the first quarter of 2012. Subject to Board approval, we expect to increase our distributions by $0.005 per quarter for the remainder of 2013.","In the earnings release, you will note some updates in our hedging information. NGL hedges increased to 64% of our expected equity volumes for 2013. Condensate hedges remained at 83%. And 78% of our natural gas is now hedged for 2013, thus reducing a significant amount of the commodity risk in the natural gas gathering and processing segment for the remainder of 2013. We also added new natural gas hedges for 2014 and 2015, which is also included in the earnings release.","We also revised our tables on commodity sales volumes in our gathering and processing segment by combining our percentage of proceeds and keep-whole quantities and deducting fuel, which has become a more significant component as compression is added to accommodate our volume growth. We manage our equity, natural gas and NGL positions in total as opposed to the form of contract by which we receive those volumes. So this presentation is consistent with how we manage our risk. Furthermore, keep-whole contracts now represent less than 2% of our volumes. And we expect this percentage to continue to decrease as our new natural gas processing plants are completed. In addition most of our keep-whole contracts have conditioning language that prevent them from generating a negative margin.","During the first quarter, the partnership sold $16 million in common units through our at-the-market equity program. At the end of the first quarter, the partnership had $69 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial paper or borrowings on our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility outstanding, our long-term debt to capitalization ratio was 52% and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.3x.","And finally, from a financing perspective, we continue to have multiple sources of liquidity available to us and we remain confident in our ability to raise the necessary capital to fund the growth at ONEOK Partners, which include cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, access to our $1.2 billion credit facility with the option to request an increase to $1.7 billion and access to our $300 million at-the-market program that allows the partnership to offer common units for sale in the market. These items enable us to be opportunistic from a timing perspective as we look to access public equity and debt markets.","Now Terry will update you on the partnership's operating performance.","Terry K. Spencer","Thank you, Derek. As John noted, the biggest contributor to ONEOK Partners' quarter-over-quarter earnings decline was significantly narrower NGL location price differentials between the Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, market hubs, driven largely by our industry's current high ethane inventory position. I'll provide more color on these market dynamics in just a few minutes during my review of segment performance.","The natural gas gathering and processing segment's first quarter financial results were lower due primarily to lower realized NGL prices and higher compression and operating costs due to the projects we placed in service over the last year, partially offset by higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed. Natural gas volumes gathered and processed continue to grow, driven by increased well connections in the Williston Basin and Western Oklahoma.","For the first quarter, natural gas volumes gathered increased 16% and natural gas volumes processed increased almost 30%, driven by the new Garden Creek and Stateline I natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure projects completed in 2012. Both the Garden Creek and Stateline I natural gas processing plants are operating near their 100 million cubic feet per day capacity. Stateline II, which was recently completed, is expected to reach capacity later this year. We expect to connect more than 1,000 wells to our gathering systems in 2013 in both the Williston Basin and the Mid-Continent. That will enable us to achieve our volume expectations this year.","The first quarter was a bit challenging on the well connection front due to inclement winter weather conditions. Despite those challenges, we still connected 270 wells in the quarter compared with 200 wells in the first quarter last year. The flaring of natural gas in the Williston Basin continues but, in the areas we operate, flaring is decreasing, so our new infrastructure is making a positive impact.","Our realized composite NGL price was $0.85 per gallon for the first quarter of 2013 compared with $1.09 in the first quarter 2012 and $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2012. NGL prices in the first quarter were 22% lower, a $13 million impact in the segment compared with the first quarter last year and 19% lower than in the fourth quarter 2012.","The natural gas pipeline segment's first quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher rates on Guardian Pipeline, increased capacity contracted on our interstate pipelines and higher natural gas storage margins. Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were lower in the first quarter of 2013 due to reduced transportation rates on Northern Border Pipeline due to a rate settlement with its shippers that took effect in January.","Our natural gas liquids segment's first quarter results were lower due primarily to significantly narrower Conway-to-Mont Belvieu NGL price differentials, which negatively impacted our optimization activities by $90 million compared with the first quarter of last year. This decrease was offset partially by higher NGL volumes gathered in the Williston Basin, increased fee-based NGL exchange services activities and higher revenues from customers with minimum volume obligations.","To put this narrow NGL location price differential impact in perspective, the first quarter 2013 Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differential was $0.01 per gallon compared with $0.24 per gallon in the first quarter 2012. While the NGL segment's optimization activities were impacted significantly by these lower differentials, as we've said many times before, we continue to execute on our strategy to recontract our optimization capacity under long-term, fee-based contracts that will substantially reduce our exposure to NGL location price differentials.","In our 2013 financial guidance, we have assumed the ethane differential between Conway and Mont Belvieu will average $0.05 per gallon during the year. In April, the ethane differential reached $0.09, up considerably from the $0.01 per gallon we averaged in the first quarter. Accordingly, we expect substantial improvement in our optimization margins in the coming months.","Given the excess ethane inventories on the Gulf Coast, we expect our throughput in the natural gas liquids business to continue to be affected by ethane rejection throughout much of this year with a return to a normal days of ethane supply inventory level later in 2013 and consistent ethane recovery in 2014 and 2015 with only intermittent periods of ethane rejection. Our NGL team remains focused on making sure that our unique and well-positioned NGL network continues to provide value to our customers and shareholders regardless of market conditions.","Now an update on our projects. The Stateline II natural gas processing plant and the Bakken NGL pipeline are in service with increasing volumes. Congratulations to all of the ONEOK employees, contractors, landowners, federal, state and local officials, who worked with us to bring these projects online safely on time and on budget. We continue to develop our backlog of unannounced growth projects that is between $2 billion and $3 billion and includes natural gas, NGL and crude oil-related infrastructure.","These potential growth projects are within our current footprint and include natural gas processing plants and pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities and some crude oil-related projects. Potential crude oil-related projects include rail loading facilities, storage and pipelines. As is our practice, we will announce these projects when we have secured sufficient commitments from customers.","Now a brief update on the NGL markets. First, inventories and ethane rejection. Ethane and propane inventories are decreasing, primarily as a result of ethane rejection and the startup of a new propane export facility on the Gulf Coast. With continued high petchem utilization rates expected throughout 2013, we expect inventories to continue their decline. We believe the industry's current ethane rejection level exceeds 200,000 barrels per day based on what we've seen from Mid-Continent and Rockies plants connected to our NGL systems. We currently are experiencing more than 90,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection across our NGL systems and expect it to remain at those levels for much of this year.","Now to prices. You'll recall that, in February, we updated our 2013 equity NGL composite price assumption for the natural gas gathering and processing segment to $0.66 per gallon. Our 2013 equity NGL composite price is weighted more to Conway due to contractual commitments. To be clear, this price is at-the-market hubs before transportation and fractionation fee deduction. The $0.66 per gallon is calculated on a full ethane recovery basis. By comparison, with reduced ethane recovery in 2013, our realized NGL composite prices are expected to be closer to $0.85 per gallon.","Our 2014 and 2015 NGL price assumptions have not changed since our last conference call and are available online in our most recent investor presentation. Our composite NGL price assumptions for 2014 and 2015 will be primarily on a Mont Belvieu basis. The change to Mont Belvieu pricing in 2014 and 2015 reflects the expected completion of our Sterling III Pipeline in late 2013, providing our customers with more access to the Mont Belvieu market.","And finally, as NGL supply growth continues at a rapid pace, we expect the ethane markets to be [indiscernible] through much of '13 [indiscernible] ethane rejection. We expect natural gas market will [indiscernible] in 2014 and 2015 with impairment periods of ethane rejection. We anticipate an undersupplied position as we move through 2016 into 2017, when we expect ethane demand to increase when petchem expansions and new, world-class facilities are completed. While growing NGL production has outpaced end-use demand in the near term, we believe demand will grow over the longer term, putting us in a position to serve that growth because of our well-positioned and integrated midstream assets.","John, that concludes my remarks.","John W. Gibson","Thank you, Terry. Before we take your questions, I'd like to just spend a few moments to provide you with some additional comments on our future growth projects.","For the last year or so, we've communicated a $2 billion plus backlog of unannounced projects and, during that same timeframe, we've announced $1.5 billion of new projects but the backlog remained unchanged. As Terry discussed early, the partnership's current project backlog is now $2 billion to $3 billion and I'm confident that, over time, we will add to that backlog just as we have in the past.","We have always chosen to not discuss publicly the specifics of the projects in our backlog, primarily for competitive reasons. Even though we won't provide insight into the type of projects we're working on and their specifics, I can tell you that we are not interested in acquiring assets or developing projects that involve exploration and production, refineries, petchem or petrochemical crackers, electric power generation, retail marketing of CNG or heavy truck transportation. Every one of our projects starts by understanding the supply and demand of hydrocarbons and where we have a sustainable competitive advantage to provide the assets or services necessary to connect supply with demand. As Terry mentioned, we will continue to grow in our current businesses and our projects are always focused on applying our core capabilities to create value for our customers and our company.","In closing, I'd like to again, thank you -- thank our more than 4,800 employees, whose dedication and commitment allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly everyday and create exceptional value for our investors and our customers. Our entire management team appreciates their efforts to make our company as successful as it is today.","Operator, we're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Edwards of Credit Suisse.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up with a question kind of on the NGL market outlook. I guess I'm trying to figure out -- I mean, we kind of share your view, I guess, if you look at the petchem market being relatively robust in the 2016-and-beyond timeframe but we figure the market probably to be more balanced. I think you said you thought it would be ethane undersupplied at that time but we figure the steam crackers wouldn't get built if it were undersupplied. So I'm just wondering -- I'm just trying to figure out how to reconcile the comment, where you were thinking it would be undersupplied in the future as opposed to, say, more balanced?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, that's a great question, John. I think that when you look at this over the long term and when we sit down and talk to these petrochemical companies, they recognize as you look at what's being developed today and you look at the potential demand for another 700,000 barrels a day for ethane as you reach this 2017 timeframe, they recognize that there's a potential for an undersupplied situation. However, they recognize, too, that there's a lot of potential in these shale plays and that there is a lot of capacity being developed upstream and that the midstream companies are going to do what they need to do to make that supply materialize. So the projects, at least as they're indicating to us, are going to happen and the fact that we're painting this picture of an ethane undersupply doesn't seem to affect them one bit in terms of their psychology.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So the belief -- I guess, to clarify, the thought process is that the -- with the demand being significant that really, as prices improve, the supplies -- it may not be on an announced project base at this time but it's likely to come? I mean, it seems to us every time there's any kind of price recovery, more ethane comes to market, which is why it looks to us we're in a sort of prolonged oversupply situation until these petchem projects come online. Is that kind of the thought process?","Terry K. Spencer","I mean, certainly in the near term, we feel that way. In this 2014 to 2015 timeframe, there's going to be continued demand creep and we've seen it as recently as this first quarter. We've seen 50,000 barrels a day of incremental ethane demand come from some expansions that have started up. So the experts continue to see this happen. The other thing that's going to happen, particularly with propane prices running up with the export demand, you're going to see this switchover from propane to ethane occur. And that happened significantly in the first quarter. So as you move into this 2014 timeframe, we think the markets are going to be more balance. And it's not really going to be until you get into that 2016 and 2017 timeframe, where we're going to be kind of behind the 8 ball. The thing you've got to remember, too, with these petrochemical companies is the demand pull they're seeing on their side for ethylene in the world market is huge. The spreads that they're realizing are off the charts. And so it is going to take something extremely major to get them to change their minds in terms of building and continuing to build out these world-class crackers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions for me. One, it seemed like your operating expenses just kind of across-the-board, particularly the NGL and G&P segments, was up quite a bit. Was there anything just kind of unusual going on there? Or should I be viewing that as kind of new normalized levels, given the amount of investment you've made?","Terry K. Spencer","Michael, at a high level, I mean, certainly we're bringing on these new processing plants and so we're going to incur increased operating expenses. So our per unit operating expenses are going to be higher. But until we get the volumes behind these plants -- I mean, when you operate a processing plant, it costs you about the same amount of money to operate a processing plant that's at 25% load as it does to operate one that's at 100% load. So you're going to -- as you ramp up, you're going to go through this period of higher per unit operating cost on the front end because you're bearing the full load. Then on top of that, you're bearing depreciation and then interest expenses and the whole nine yards, okay? So until we get these plants full, which we expect to do later on this year, you're going to see these higher per unit costs. And as we fill that volume up, the per unit operating cost will go down.","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Did you see any weather disruptions in the first quarter that had a material impact on results?","Terry K. Spencer","Michael, we always see winter in the Bakken. So we had some pretty significant inclement weather that affected us really more from a well connect standpoint. Not much of an impact, though, from an expected revenue standpoint. We had severe weather, I think, the quarter a year ago. So I mean, it's to be expected. So I'm not going to bellyache about 24 inches of snowfall.","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And my last question on energy services. Given the increase in natural gas prices and we've seen, at least in some areas, a widening of basis differentials, is it fair to conclude that, that'll result in some uplift in that business? I mean, are you able to capture some of that change in the market?","Pierce H. Norton","Michael, this is Pierce. Actually, the biggest impact that we're going to see in energy services is due to expiring contracts on the transport and storage side. We're going to be reducing about $29 million year-over-year. That's going to have a bigger impact. We're still seeing pressure on the winter-summer spreads, as well as the location spreads.","Operator","Your next question comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","On the NGL segment, can you talk a little bit about where you see volumes going across the year relative to ethane rejection? I think you said you were seeing roughly 90,000 barrels a day of ethane rejection yet the NGLs distributed fell by about 140,000 barrels a day. Can you kind of reconcile that difference there and then where you see volumes ramping up across the year, if any? And also on the fractionation side, talk a little bit about the reduction relative to the fourth quarter and how you see that ramping up across the year.","Terry K. Spencer","Well, I'll take the first part of your question, Becca. The 90,000 barrels a day is what we're expecting for pretty much most of this year. We don't really see that changing. We've seen ethane prices and natural gas prices move around a lot in this first quarter. But the volume of rejection has really stayed fairly steady. So we really don't expect a change. From a residue standpoint at these processing plants, the pipelines seemed to be just fine taking the natural gas, so there's not any significant quality issues that we've seen. So we expect that level to stay around the 90,000 barrels per day. And then to your other question, Pierce, do you want to grab...","Pierce H. Norton","I mean, the only thing that I would add to that, Becca, is that we will see significant volume growth in the Williston Basin. We're averaging about 261,000 a day currently and we have capacity up there to process 400,000 a day. So as Terry indicated, we expect to get those plants filled up more towards the end of the year, so you're going to see significant growth in the Williston. We also will see growth from third-party plants that affect our NGL business down in the Mid-Continent as they come on. Fractionation right now is running slightly higher than what it averaged in the first quarter, so we expect that to be there. And then like Terry said, we do expect the ethane rejection to continue through the end of the year.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","But can you reconcile the 90,000 barrels a day of ethane rejection versus the roughly 140,000 barrel a day reduction in NGLs distributed from the fourth quarter to the first quarter?","Terry K. Spencer","Becca, I think that maybe this might help. One of the other things that we expect to happen is, in the third quarter of 2013, we're going to be starting up that MB-2 fractionator. So we'll see a significant ramp-up in NGL volume when we start that facility up. So that might get you part of the way there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A couple of quick questions. I know you don't historically talk about the size of the Conway-to-Belvieu optimization capacity you have open. But as you work to bring this down, focusing more on fee-based earnings, can you quantify the ramp-down over time maybe in percentage ranges?","Unknown Executive","Craig, we really haven't given any kind of forward looks on what that ramp-down is. But I mean, you can look at our margins and see that there was a significant change in the exchange in storage and transportation quarter-over-quarter. So we still continue to think that's going to happen. One of the big movers is going to be when Sterling III comes online because we do not have that risk there that, that is contracted by volumes. So when that comes on, that can make a significant difference in the shift over the optimization volumes currently seen.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And have you altered your long-term view of what is the sustainable Conway-to-Belvieu spreads?","Terry K. Spencer","No, we haven't. We still -- as we've indicated for this year, $0.05 a gallon for ethane and looking in the $0.10 a gallon range as we move out to 2014 and 2015. We still feel strongly, as we've said many, many times before, we expect these spreads to narrow and they have narrowed. And they're going to move back into that cost-of-build range. And so certainly, our view over this next 2 to 3 years has remained at that level.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And last question. We're kind of getting into an unusual situation here with gas up another $0.09 today, where ethane rejection, which in recent periods had been driven more by low NGL prices, could be driven a little more in future periods by high gas prices. So can you speak to the relative impact of that? Since your low [indiscernible] on gas, it's obviously not quite the same impact as just having low ethane prices.","Terry K. Spencer","Right. I mean, when we look at natural gas as far as it affects our business, our gathering and processing business, we're well hedged at pretty attractive prices. When you look at our customers on the NGL front, certainly those spreads, the ethane spread in particular that you're referring to, affects their throughput. Certainly, if natural gas prices go higher, it could affect their economics. But we saw very low prices in the first quarter for ethane and our view is that if those prices -- as weak as those spreads were, that 90,000 barrels a day seemed to act like a floor.","John W. Gibson","The other thing to consider is most of those customers, NGL customers, have also hedged much like we have. So their economic decisions, for most case, have been made. I don't think we expect to see significant difference in the amount of ethane rejected due to the rising natural gas price for that reason.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","But there's certainly the possibility of a prolonging of the trend. Isn't that correct?","Terry K. Spencer","Certainly, that's a possibility. I think that one of the things, too, that you have to keep in mind, too, is last year when you're talking specifically about natural gas, we saw significant coal displacement in the power generation sector. Just based upon what the experts are saying this year, probably not going to see that.","John W. Gibson","So to think about this, 2 different fronts. One is gathering and processing, rising gas prices help us. So we're good with that. The second thing is, theoretically, you're correct. Rising gas prices relative to NGL prices puts more pressure on the ethane rejection volumes. But as we look at the NGL customers that are on our system, most of them are fairly effectively hedged as it relates to 2013 and, really, into 2014. So we don't anticipate to the NGL segment a significant increase in the amount of ethane rejected than from our current levels.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And last take on this. Is a lot of the 2013 impact simply because of the Conway pricing and really not as much an issue when you start thinking about relative pricing on a Mont Belvieu basis between ethane and gas?","John W. Gibson","I believe that to be true. The first point is the one that we're trying to get across in our comments. And if you look back a year ago, our comments were along the line with this high coverage ratio and high ethane spread between Belvieu and Conway that we didn't think they were sustainable, so we didn't increase our distribution. We foretold that industry infrastructure would have the impact of narrowing that spread over time. And that has come to fruition. And during that time period and even before, I think you'll note that we've been looking to reduce the amount of volume we have that we utilize for optimization and that's the reason why. So I think on both points I'd agree with you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital.","Elvira Scotto - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Thanks for all the information, your thoughts on ethane markets near-term and longer-term. Can you maybe touch on your view as NGL production increases? How you see the heavier end of the barrel, supply-demand dynamics shaping up there?","Terry K. Spencer","Sure, Elvira. We do see supply growing on the heavier end of the barrel. In particular, you've heard a lot of discussion about normal butane being an issue. But one of the things that has been emerging, much like for propane, the export markets have been increasing, not just for propane but for LPGs as a whole. So the heavier end of the barrel, in particular normal butanes, are finding its way into the export pool as well. So as those volumes continue to grow, they will continue to drive attractive price levels in the international markets and find their way into the export pool. At least that's what experts are telling us.","Elvira Scotto - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then in terms of kind of expanding into crude oil, would you consider doing an acquisition to actually gain a foothold in that market?","John W. Gibson","Yes, we would.","Operator","And our next question comes from Helen Ryoo with Barclays.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question on your fractionation volume, I guess. It came down quite a bit versus Q4. I'm just wondering, is that mostly Mid-Continent fractionators that took the hit there?","Terry K. Spencer","Helen, it's a combination of Mid-Continent and Rockies. And it's mostly ethane rejection.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So your Mont Belvieu fractionators really did not suffer volume decline?","Terry K. Spencer","We had some impact at Mont Belvieu, as well. Across our fractionators, we had impact.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But vast majority, you would say, is in Mid-Continent and Rockies?","Terry K. Spencer","Mid-Continent and Rockies. That's correct.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I know a lot of your new projects come with 100% volume commitment and your new projects are mostly in the Mont Belvieu area. So as you think about having these new MB-2, MB-3 coming, should those fractionators be subject to volume risk? Or are they pretty much well protected because of the contracts?","Terry K. Spencer","Helen, they're pretty much protected from a volume standpoint because the vast majority of these contracts are, as you say, they're firm-based, frac-or-pay or ship-or-pay type contracts. So they're going to be pretty well insulated from volume risks. However, they won't start up chock-a-block full when we begin. But the revenue streams will be there.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So there's going to be some ramp-up period. But once you fill it up -- once you've reached a certain level, you should not worry about volume fluctuating?","Terry K. Spencer","That's correct. I think one other comment that I'll make as it relates to these firm contracts, and I've made this comment before, is not every one of these contracts is 100% firm. So when we negotiate these contract rates, there will be a very high percentage, 90% or so -- and I'm not going to give you details for competitive reasons. But there will be some high percentage of that contract that will be structured firm.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then just another quick clarification. Did you say that because -- are you changing your NGL price assumption for the year? I know it started at $0.66. But what was your comment that now -- that you've realized $0.85 that, that's sort of the level that you're looking at for the remainder of the year?","Terry K. Spencer","Helen, the reason it came up to $0.85 is because the $0.66 was based on a full ethane recovery, and so when you -- in actuality, we're not at full ethane recovery because we're not recovering ethane in the Rockies or the Bakken. So when you calculate the weighted average composite price, assuming no ethane recovery in the Bakken, you'd come up with this $0.85.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ketul Sakhpara with TPH Asset Management.","Ketul Sakhpara - TPH Asset Management, LLC","A couple of quick questions. The new fracs that are coming up in Mont Belvieu, does this level of ethane rejection change the ramp-up schedule or the ramp-up schedule still remains relatively the same?","Terry K. Spencer","I didn't understand -- could you repeat that question? I didn't hear it all.","Ketul Sakhpara - TPH Asset Management, LLC","Okay. So does the ramp-up schedule get affected because of the ethane rejection, the ramp-up schedule for your new Mont Belvieu fractionators that are coming up online?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, it will affect it. It will be affected by ethane rejection to the extent it extends -- ethane rejection extends into that -- during that period. But remember, as I've mentioned just on the previous question, much of that capacity is subscribed under firm, frac-or-pay contracts.","Ketul Sakhpara - TPH Asset Management, LLC","Okay. Do you think that ramp-up schedule is 12 to 18 months, above 18 months to get to 60%, 70% of the capacity? Have you given any color on that?","Terry K. Spencer","I think our expectation is to be full during the 2014 timeframe.","Ketul Sakhpara - TPH Asset Management, LLC","Okay. The shift from -- now moving to your optimization volumes. The shift from optimization volumes to fee-based volumes, should we see that in the NGL transported distribution lines volumes? Or where should we see those volumes show up?","Terry K. Spencer","Where you'll see it actually, and you've seen it actually in the financials that we produced for this quarter. Where you'll see it is in exchange services, okay? So like if you look at the quarter, we said $40 million improvement in exchange services quarter-over-quarter. Most of that is this recontracting that we're talking about. That's where you'll see it. But it'll be -- from a physical volume standpoint, you'll see it in your gathered volume and you will see it in some of your transportation volume, as well.","Ketul Sakhpara - TPH Asset Management, LLC","Okay. All right. And as more and more ethane is being rejected, the Btu content of gas keeps going up. Have you seen any issues with that content affecting the pipeline gas that is being shipped in terms of are they exceeding the maximum Btu content allowed on natural gas transportation pipelines on any of your systems anywhere or that's not an issue so far?","Terry K. Spencer","It's really not been an issue so far. I've not heard anything really significant in the way of downstream end users having to adjust their -- significantly adjust their operations to accommodate the ethane left in the gas train.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You talk about growing all of these businesses at OKS and just mentioned that you would consider acquiring crude assets to enter that market. It would seem to me that growing the utility business is very low on this list, given the growth for everything else is just better. How important is it to keep these assets maybe with respect to investment-grade rating? It seems like you would be able to pay the dividend no problem without these assets. So just kind of trying to get your thoughts on possibly divesting these assets, whether through sale or tax-free spin, to become a more pure-play EGP [ph]?","John W. Gibson","Well, as I've indicated before, that we at the Board level continue to discuss our structure and try to determine that ultimate and\/or most efficient structure. Clearly, as you point out, most of our growth has occurred inside the partnership. We've not been successful in paying the values requested in the marketplace for distribution assets. We have said that we believe that the distribution assets at the OKE level do have a positive impact on our credit rating. So the answer to your question is we continue to look at that, from a Board's perspective, at what is the right structure. And we continue to come back to where we are today. But we can't emphasize enough how much we spend time looking at that and talking about it.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I guess, would you be able to keep your investment-grade rating without those assets? I mean, how hard would that be?","John W. Gibson","Well, first of all, we don't make that decision. I don't mean to be sharp about that. But that isn't our call. So what we think -- well, we can just speculate but I don't want to speculate on this call.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President Natural Gas.","On today's call, we will discuss ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year financial and operational performance, our 2019 financial guidance and 2020 outlook and provide an update on our more than $6 billion capital growth program. 2018 was an impressive year for ONEOK both operationally and financially as volumes across our assets and our earnings posted significant increases. In our first full year of operation following the acquisition of ONEOK Partners, we announced more than $5.5 billion of new capital growth projects, experienced NGL and natural gas volume growth across our operations and strengthened our already solid investment grade balance sheet.","Our long track record of earnings growth continues. ONEOK's operating income has increased nearly $1 billion over the last five years, while adjusted EBITDA has also doubled over that five-year period and has increased 50% since 2015. 2018 was a year of growth and new project announcements and 2019 will be a year where we rely on our ability to execute and position our business for continued earnings growth into 2020 and I'm confident that we will.","Over the next 12 to 24 months, our focus will be set on completing our projects on time and on budget, on protecting the safety of the hundreds of employees and contractors we have working on these assets and on the safe and reliable operation of our existing assets. We continued to evaluate additional opportunistic projects that address customer needs and the increasing demand for NGLs and natural gas in the U.S. and abroad. One of these projects, which has received a lot of attention, is a potential NGL export facility. What I can say is that we're closer to a deal now than we've ever been, but there are a number of details that still need to be worked out before we announce anything further.","We're optimistic about where we are in the process and believe this facility would be a great fee-driven addition to our already predominantly fee-based business model. Along with announcing 2019 guidance yesterday, we also provided an outlook for 2020 to help bridge the gap between what will be a heavy-billed year in 2019 and a large step up in volumes and earnings expectations in 2010.","We expect a greater than 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2020 compared with 2019 expectations. More than $4.4 billion of capital growth projects expected to be completed in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020, will provide a foundation for significant earnings growth in 2020 and beyond. We acknowledge that we have disclosed a fairly wide range for 2019 capital expenditures with our guidance based upon a $3.1 billion midpoint.","Given the volatility in commodity prices we experienced around year-end, our CapEx range demonstrates that we have the flexibility to make adjustments based on increases or decreases in producer activity. As the year progresses, we will likely tighten the range as appropriate. Walt will provide more detail in a moment.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Walt.","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's 2018 operating income totaled $1.8 billion, a 32% increase year-over-year. In 2018, adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.45 billion, a 23% increase year-over-year. Strong natural gas and natural gas liquids volume performance helped us achieve 2018 net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow guidance, which were all increased twice during 2018 because of better-than-expected operating results.","The Natural Gas Liquids segment's 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 25% compared with 2017. The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Pipelines segments also saw impressive earnings increases of 22% and 8% respectively.","The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Pipelines segments both exceeded 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance, driven primarily by increased producer activity on our dedicated acreage and higher contracted transportation volumes on our natural gas pipelines.","The Natural Gas Liquids segment ended 2018 nearly 6% above our original guidance expectations. The segment's fourth quarter 2018 earnings were impacted by lower optimization and marketing earnings as the average Conway to Mont Belvieu price differential decreased approximately $0.12 as compared with $0.24 in the third quarter. Additionally, due to maintenance at our Medford Oklahoma fractionator the segment had higher NGL inventories than expected at year-end 2018, which impacted fourth quarter earnings by approximately $20 million. We expect to recognize a $20 million earnings benefit from the sale of this inventory in the first quarter of 2019.","Strong business segment performance in 2018 set a solid foundation for 2019. We announced 2019 guidance expectations with yesterday's earnings release, including our expectation for net income, adjusted EBITDA to increase approximately 10% and 6% respectively in 2019. We expect year-over-year earnings growth in all three of our business segments with Natural Gas Liquids segment expected to be the largest contributor to that growth.","We expect key drivers for 2019 to include our recently completed Sterling III and West Texas LPG pipeline expansion projects. We expected completion of the southern portion of Elk Creek pipeline in the third quarter, additional third-party plant connections in our Natural Gas Liquids segment and increased volumes and a higher-average fee rate in our Gathering and Processes segment. Kevin will provide more detail on our volume and operational outlook.","Total distributable cash flow in 2018 was more than $1.8 billion, up more than 30% from 2017 with a healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4 times. We generated nearly $0.5 billion of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in 2018, a more than 70% increase compared with 2017. This is cash we reinvested in the business to fund our capital growth program.","During 2018, our total debt increased only approximately $200 million, while we spent just over $2 billion on capital expenditures. At December 31, our debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.75 times and 3.83 times on a trailing 12-month basis. We saw a significant decrease in leverage from 2017 to 2018 and ended last year with an even stronger balance sheet than we had anticipated. We entered 2019 with total liquidity of $3.5 billion, including borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion available on our credit facility and $950 million available on our three-year unsecured term loan agreement. This liquidity, plus strong anticipated distributable cash flows and excessive dividends, positions us well for completing the capital growth projects still ahead of us.","Our capital spending is heavily weighted towards 2019, as the bulk of our largest projects are being placed in service this year and early in 2020. In 2019, we expect approximately $3.1 billion in growth capital expenditures, of which more than two-thirds is related to Elk Creek, Arbuckle II, MB-4 and Demicks Lake I.","Another 10% is related to routine growth capital expenditures, which includes well connections and plant connections and the remainder is related to spending on growth projects being put in service in 2020 and 2021, such as MB-5, the West Texas LPG expansion and Demicks Lake II. With these announced projects, 2020 CapEx is expected to be significantly less than 2019.","As it relates to the range we provided, the low-end reflects a sustained reduction in commodity prices that would drive significant slowing of producer activity, which we have not seen and do not expect to see, based on our customer activity and announcements so far in 2019. The high-end of the range reflects a significant increase in producer activity and related capital to address that growth.","To reiterate, at current market conditions we feel comfortable with the mid-point of our capital guidance range. Having said all that, with our strong balance sheet, expected continued earnings growth and financial flexibility, we expect no equity financing needs in 2019 nor in 2020 based on our expected slate of growth projects and our rapid deleveraging as these projects come online.","During the fourth quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.855 per share and in February, we paid a dividend of $0.86 per share or $3.44 per share on an annualized basis. As it relates to our expectations for dividend growth -- for the dividend growth rate going forward, I'll make a few comments.","To start, I want to point out that many positive things have happened to our earnings prospects since we initially guided to a 9% to 11% annual dividend growth rate when we announced the acquisition of ONEOK Partners.","We're pleased to have the financial flexibility to return capital to shareholders at an attractive rate, fund our growth projects and maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet. We acknowledge that many investors and some research analysts have expressed the view that prudent capital allocation in the midstream space is more value.","Accordingly, many investors do not require as higher dividend growth rate as they did in the past and that alternative approaches to returning capital maybe appropriate at some point in the future. We've received quite a bit of feedback on both sides of this issue.","Going forward on a quarterly basis, our Board will continue their practice to evaluate dividend growth and alternative ways to return capital to shareholders based on the strength of our business, the commodity price environment of our producer customers, the funding needs of our growth projects, investor sentiment and our strategy to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet.","We believe that investors continue to value our ability to return capital to shareholders, while also funding our growth projects without expecting to issue equity to complete our announced capital projects.","Before handing the call over to Kevin, I'll provide an update on the West Texas LPG rate case that was being reviewed by the Railroad Commission of Texas. In January, the case was settled with higher rates prospectively across the pipeline system. These rates are assumed within our guidance ranges. As we said previously, the majority of new volume commitments on the system are being contracted at market based negotiated rates, but we're pleased to have this matter resolved.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our business segment performance.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt. As both Terry and Walt said, in 2019, we continue to execute on our low multiple organic growth program that is providing needed infrastructure for our customers across our operating areas. As these projects are completed in the second half of 2019 and early in 2020, we expect to see volumes and EBITDA ramp quickly.","I'll walk through each of our operating areas and highlight our expected growth drivers in 2019 and into next year. Starting with the Rockies region. We continued to see strong producer activity and efficiency improvements across the Williston Basin and Powder River Basin, which is driving associated natural gas and NGL growth.","NGL volume gathered on the Bakken Pipeline in 2018 increased 4% compared with 2017. Fourth quarter NGL volumes gathered averaged 148,000 barrels per day, a 7% increase compared with the third quarter of 2018.","Growth has continued early in 2019 as we've gathered more than 165,000 barrels per day out of the Williston and Powder River basins on numerous days, which includes rail volume.","In the Gathering and Processing segment, Rocky Mountain region natural gas volumes processed increased more than 14% in 2018 compared with 2017. Fourth quarter processed volume decreased slightly compared with the third quarter 2018 due to typical winter weather and maintenance which were already factored in to our expectations.","So far in 2019, our Williston Basin processing plants are operating close to full capacity and averaged more than 1 billion cubic feet per day during January. With more than 250 million cubic feet per day of natural gas currently being flared on our dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin, we expect our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant to open full in the fourth quarter of 2019 and provide approximately 25,000 barrels per day of NGLs to the Elk Creek pipeline.","Demicks Lake II also a 200 million cubic feet per day plant is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2020 and will provide additional capacity for natural gas and NGL volumes to ramp through 2020.","There continues to be more than 60 rigs operating in the Williston Basin with approximately 25 rigs on our dedicated acreage. These rig counts have remained relatively consistent as crude prices have fluctuated in recent months.","We connected 610 wells in the Rocky Mountain region in 2018, exceeding our guidance of 550 wells and expect to connect approximately 620 wells in 2019. We also continued to see solid rig activity in the Powder River Basin where we have approximately 1 million acres dedicated to our Natural Gas Liquids segment and a 130,000 acres dedicated to our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. There are more than 20 rigs on our dedicated NGL acreage in the Powder River Basin currently and we continue to hear positive feedback from producers in the area.","The southern portion of the Elk Creek pipeline from the Powder River Basin to the Mid-Continent remains on track to be complete as early as the third quarter 2019, with the entire Elk Creek pipeline expected to be fully in service in the fourth quarter of 2019.","We have clear line of sight to Elk Creek reaching its initial contracted capacity of approximately 100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020, generating its targeted adjusted EBITDA multiple of four to six times within the first few months of operation. ","We included a new slide in our earnings presentation yesterday that shows the various contributors to the expected volume ramp, which includes approximately 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of rail volume, approximately 25,000 barrels from Demicks Lake I, 10,000 to 15,000 barrels of Powder River volume and approximately 25,000 to 30,000 barrels from third-party plants that are currently under construction or being expanded.","The Powder River volume will be moved to the southern portion of Elk Creek once complete in the third quarter to make additional room for Williston Basin volume on the Bakken NGL pipeline. Elk Creek volumes are expected to continue to increase throughout 2020.","Moving on to the Mid-Continent. 2018 NGL volumes gathered in the Mid-Continent increased 17% compared with 2017. NGL volumes gathered from the region decreased in the fourth quarter 2018 compared with the third quarter 2018 due to increased ethane rejection and approximately 20,000 barrels per day of NGLs from a third-party plant which moved to a third party NGL pipeline, as expected and as we had previously disclosed.","We completed the 60,000-barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III NGL pipeline in the fourth quarter and expect raw feed volumes to ramp up over the next 12 months. Our NGL pipeline capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu is approximately 90% utilized.","Arbuckle II is under construction and on schedule for an expected completion in the first quarter of 2020. Initial capacity on Arbuckle II is 400,000 barrels per day. That will be expanded to 500,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2021.","We continue to expect that transportation capacity from Conway to Mont Belvieu will remain highly utilized due to growing NGL volumes, which we expect will keep spreads wider than normal until Arbuckle II is placed in service.","In our Gathering and Processing segment, 2018 Mid-Continent natural gas volumes processed increased more than 18% compared with 2017 and increased 8% in the fourth quarter 2018 compared with the third quarter 2018, benefiting from the completion of several large well pads that we previously mentioned had been delayed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We connected 138 wells in the Mid-Continent in 2018.","During the fourth quarter, we completed the expansion of our Canadian Valley natural gas processing plant in the STACK, which brings our total Oklahoma processing capacity to approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day.","In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we recently completed expansions on our ONEOK gas transportation pipeline system, which support growth in the STACK and SCOOP. The expansions included 100 million cubic feet per day of westbound capacity and a 100 million cubicle feet per day of eastbound capacity, which are fully subscribed under firm transportation agreements. An additional 50 million cubic feet per day expansion of the eastbound capacity is expected to be complete this quarter.","Now a quick update on our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast operations. NGL volumes gathered on our West Texas LPG system averaged 200,000 barrels per day in 2018, a 5% increase compared with 2017. Since the first expansion of this system was fully placed in service in the fourth quarter, we have seen volumes ramp reaching more than 250,000 barrels per day on several days in 2019.","Our Mont Belvieu fractionators continue to operate highly utilized and we remain on schedule to complete our 125,000 barrel per day MB-4 fractionator in the first quarter of 2020. We expect MB-4 to exit 2020 full and for MB-5, which is also 125,000 barrels per day, to ramp up quickly once it's completed in the first quarter of 2021.","ONEOK's total system-wide NGL fractionation capacity remains around 800,000 barrels per day, given our current product composition and we're utilizing approximately 90% of our fractionation capacity.","We're currently undergoing debottlenecking projects that could add an additional 15,000 to 30,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity in 2019. These projects are in addition to the 20,000 barrel per day expansion of our Bushton, Kansas fractionator that we discussed on our third quarter call.","We continue to expect that these debottlenecking projects, our current available capacity, our storage assets and a small amount of already contracted third-party offloads will provide sufficient capacity until MB-4 is complete.","In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we have completed capital growth projects in the Permian Basin that include a 300 million cubic feet per day expansion of our WesTex Transmission pipeline system and a project to make our Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline bidirectional.","Before I turn the call back to Terry, let's discuss our 2019 volume guidance, which incorporates recently announced customer activity levels. We expect our NGL throughput volume to be approximately 11% greater than 2018, driven by growth in all three of our operating regions.","In our gathering and processing segment, we expect natural gas volumes processed to increase approximately 5% compared with 2018, primarily from growth in the Williston Basin. Additionally, with our Demicks Lake I plant coming online in the fourth quarter, we expect our 2019 exit rate for volumes processed in the Williston Basin to be approximately 20% higher than our current processed volume level.","Our 2019 NGL volume guidance was provided yesterday using a new volume disclosure. The new metric is NGL raw feed throughput volume and it represents all physical raw feed volume on which ONEOK charges a fee for transportation, fractionation or a bundled fee for both services.","This is the volume metric that we use internally and we believe better represents the key drivers to our earnings. We have provided historical comparisons of the new metric and plan to provide actual gathered and fractionated volumes for a period of time for comparison purposes. Please reach out to our Investor Relations team if you have questions regarding the change.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Kevin. Good color on 2018 operations and drivers in 2019. As we sit today, ONEOK is in a great position with an extensive and integrated system of assets in some of the country's most productive basin.","I truly believe that one of the reasons we've been successful over the years is, because of our focus, meaning our focus on doing what we do well and doing what is best for our customers, investors and for ONEOK in the long term.","We have a large growth program in progress right now, but we're not growing just to grow. Getting bigger isn't the point. We're focused on our customers and we're growing to meet their needs. We're focused on our investors and investing in attractive return projects.","We're focused on our balance sheet and growing our strong asset positions and we remain focused on growing the right way, by being mindful of the environment and the safety of our employees, contractors and local communities.","The hard work of our 2,700 employees and the support of our investors have enabled us to continue to grow our operations in a way that meets the needs of our customers, stakeholders and investors. A big thank you to all of you for a successful 2018.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Hi. Good morning everybody.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Blum","Just a few quick questions. One, your comments on the dividend. So I, obviously, understand you're not providing a new dividend growth rate, but should we take this to mean that you're definitely signaling that you'll be lowering the growth rate going forward?","Terry Spencer","No, you should not. What we've done is we've just reminded you of the process that we've always used for making a determination on what we pay each quarter in terms of the dividend. The dividend growth guidance is still out there.","We haven't changed it, but we're just reminding you that given all the discussions that are out there in the marketplace today about this topic, we continue to employ the same process that we used each and every quarter.","And our board, if they decide to make a change, given all the facts and circumstances that we face today, then we'll let you know. Right now, yeah, we think that the process that we use is still intact and still in place and that guidance is still out there.","Michael Blum","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. On -- just wanted to ask you a question on leverage. Should we just think -- given that you're not going to issue equity, should we expect that leverage will kind of flex higher into 2019 and then come back down in 2020 as more of the projects come into service and EBITDA ramps up? Is that the right way to think about it?","Walter Hulse","Yes, that's right Michael. But I think what I'd point out is that we're obviously entering the year at a very attractive spot to 3.75 times on a run rate basis. So, as we move through the year and CapEx as we get to the back-end of the year in the fourth quarter, leverage will peak up a little bit just as we're bringing those assets online and starting the cash flow in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2020.","Michael Blum","Okay great. And then I don't think -- I just want to confirm that the 2019 CapEx range is there any capital in that number for the potential LPG export dock?","Walter Hulse","No, there is not.","Michael Blum","Great. That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks and good morning. My first question is for Kevin. I noticed that you didn't outline any frac volume guidance for the quarter you're going forward. Do you see any visibility for an incremental frac going forward here just given how significant in flesh your NGL volumes are within your system?","Kevin Burdick","Well, Danilo I think I'd go back to -- we feel confident I mean with the volume ramp we see as we look at our volumes going through 2019. When we look at the capacity we've got today we look at the storage we've got. We look at the expansions or the debottlenecking projects underway, we have a good outlook and having enough capacity that will bridge us till MB-4 comes online in the first quarter of 2020. Does that answer your question?","Danilo Juvane","No, it does. Thank you for that. And as you kind of think about your CapEx specifically the high-end of that range obviously you've said no equity for the planned year but if you do hit that high-end of the range still no plans for equity?","Walter Hulse","No. If we hit the high-end of the range we'll have seen a significant increase in producer activity and be bringing on these assets with very significant cash flow when they come online. So, we're still -- we're focused on the midpoint of our range, but we want to demonstrate that we have the flexibility to flex that depending on producer activity.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks. Those were my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Chris Sighinolfi","Terry I just want to circle back very quickly on Michael's question just around -- I think commentary. I mean you guys had one of the more sort of heads-up negotiation process with ONEOK Partners when you guys were doing the merger. I know that at that time the 9% to 11% growth rates through 2021 was sort of important consideration for them.","Clearly 2021 is also a year where everything we know that you're building will be online and it sounds like from Kevin running pretty well where leverage will come down. So, I guess are you talking -- or were Walt's comments about the shareholder feedback and dividend versus other forms of shareholder return is that to be interpreted as something that's actively discussed in the near term or more around periods around just 2021 negotiation with ONEOK Partners campus community?","Terry Spencer","I'll let Walt answer that question about his comments.","Walter Hulse","Yes what I would tell you is that our board's practice has been to evaluate all of those options on a quarterly basis as we move forward here. And we just wanted to acknowledge to the marketplace that we are hearing feedback from folks and that is being translated into the discussions with the board.","And just be another factor that they factor in but they have always considered whether alternatives to dividend growth or other ways to give back capital to the shareholders and I'll continue to look at those opportunities going forward. And at some point in the future they may make some sense.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. If I could two questions on CapEx or I guess cash flow. The 2018 growth CapEx was just a bit light of what the midpoint of your 2018 guidance. Assuming that's timing but just wanted to check on that?","And then related you did have a working capital benefit last year that was not immaterial I'm just wondering if we should assume anything for the line items like that in 2019?","Walter Hulse","Yes the CapEx is entirely timing. I mean nothing has changed whatsoever in our view of the scope of these projects. So, we have -- we're on budget and on time so as Kevin mentioned. So, it's just a function of timing and timing is through kind of how we factor through 2019 and 2020 as well.","From the working capital standpoint, you've got significantly lower commodity prices at year end 2018 about 25% lower than they were in 2017 which is it gets reflected in both your accounts receivable and your account payable. And we had about $50 million less in inventory at the end of the year. So, nothing other than that that's really significant.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay great. One final question if I could for Kevin I think. Just on the NGL market dynamics particularly in the Mid-Continent that obviously you guys enjoyed a very strong spread environment in 2018 forecast a nice scenario in 2019 although not as frothy.","I'm just wondering how -- I guess two questions related to that. How Shin Oak coming up and any available capacity that emerges on the MAPL system focuses in on what you're thinking in this guidance?","And then second to that the Williams-Targa announcement on Bluestem and their comments about being able to move volumes off the third-party system. I don't know whose third-party system that is? It could be yours. Just wondering how that factors on your market view?","Terry Spencer","Okay. Chris, I'm going to let Sheridan take that one.","Sheridan Swords","Chris this is Sheridan. I'll first talk about the spreads between Conway and Belvieu. Yes, we're protecting a more narrow spread in 2019 than we saw in 2018. And some of the factors of what you said was Shin Oak coming on could have some downward or squeezing pressure between Conway and Belvieu. It just depends on how much purity products they can move out of the Conway market into Belvieu.","In terms of -- as we go forward past 2019, as we said, Arbuckle II, when it comes online it will open up a lot of purity capacity on our system on the Sterling system that presently is being used for raw feed which we think will bring the spreads back into more of a historical or normal level a very narrow differential between the two markets.","So, any additional capacity that's put in service between Conway and Belvieu past Arbuckle II, we really won't think we'll have a very limited impact on the spreads from where they are at that time.","I'd also say on this you're talking about a third-party pipeline what I would say is we do not anticipate a material change in third-party volume that we currently fractionate and exchange in Mid-Continent that comes off of OPPL for many years in the future. So, with that -- but I also say that we do anticipate volume growth from Williams acquisition of Discovery created a need for additional capacity on OPPL.","In this regard, we were able to reach an agreement with Williams to accommodate this potential growth in terms that are favorable to us. Also remember that we received an immediate EBITDA uplift from both shipping our barrels on our own 100% owned pipeline and from the additional third-party volume shipped on OPPL. We are pleased that OPPL continues to show both growth out of the D-J provide ONEOK with incremental benefits.","Chris Sighinolfi","Yes, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Good morning. Just want to come back to the guidance here. In the range that you provided for EBITDA for 2019, if you could build a bit more on what'll be some of the drivers for the low-end versus the high-end there? And when we look at the 2020 guide kind of the 20% plus, is there like a certain commodity price environment that's kind of baked in there? Or any of the color that you could provide on that?","Terry Spencer","No. Jeremy I think the key there is as with any year, a lot of will come down to just the actual volumes that are flowing and that'll be predicated based on producer activity. This year is kind of interesting and that especially in the Bakken you look at from a gathering and processing perspective with the flared gas backlog that provides us support if you will for that volume outlook in the Williston Basin.","But at the same time we're bumping up against some capacity in both the G&P segment and the NGL segment. So clearly spreads could have an impact as we move through the year that could move you up or down a little bit. But by and large we feel good about the midpoint of that guidance range, given the volumes that we have flowing today, the line of sight we've got to growth coming out of the Permian on our West Texas expansion growth coming out of the Mid-Continent on the Sterling III expansion and then just a higher month-to-month volumes coming out of the Bakken.","Jeremy Tonet","That's helpful. Thanks. And going back to the CapEx range real quick here. I just wanted to confirm you guys hadn't seen any kind of cost overruns here? And as far as the range you're talking about, it's simply just a matter of timing between whether projects spending falls into 2019 or 2020 depending on the commodity price environment and how quickly producers want this infrastructure?","Terry Spencer","That's correct. All of our projects that we've announced are on schedule and on budget right now. So it's purely a timing -- the timing that we're talking about.","Jeremy Tonet","That's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Two questions. One can you just talk about some of the commentary or feedback you've gotten from your producer or shipper customers from the Mid-Con? I\u2019m just kind of generically what are they saying about the environment today? How they're thinking about the next 12 months to 24 months production and volume-wise and kind of how that flows through to you guys?","Terry Spencer","We're going to let Chuck Kelley take that question.","Chuck Kelley","Thank you, Michael. Good question. What we're seeing in the Mid-Continent and STACK and SCOOP primarily for this year and maybe into the early part of next year, a lot of these producers that we deal with as you know have alternatives in other basins. They completely believe in the STACK and SCOOP. The inventory is there, the rock is good.","We're all firm believers in that. We're still seeing good activity year-over-year. We had a great 2018 over 2017. So as we rode into 2019, we came in with a record volume of platform for us. We still see 2% growth year-over-year. So -- and what we're seeing primarily in the STACK and SCOOP, we're seeing more activity in the SCOOP than the STACK. So what you'll see from us this year we've seen some rig movements between us and other processors on dedicated acreage we'll still average in that eight rig to 10 rig count for the year.","So we feel very good about our position in the STACK from a -- and SCOOP from a G&P standpoint. We have as you know a little better than 300,000 acres. But more importantly our NGL position and Sheridan can speak to that as to how many processing plants, he's connected to and the growth that he is still seeing in the Mid-Con. Sheridan?","Sheridan Swords","Yes. We're connected to over 90% of the plants in the Mid-Continent and they all the new plants we've contracted on a long-term basis 10 years to 15 years old almost all the new plants that have come up in the last couple of years. And as Chuck said, we continue to talk to those customers and see the producers behind them. A lot of them are very excited about the growth prospects they see, even though, we've seen some producers back off a little bit. And in our volume guidance that we provided for 2019, we've already incorporated all these conversations and everything we've had with our producers on the NGL side as well as with the G&P side.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then one follow-up on CapEx. Just trying to think about it like you've got so many large projects underway, whether it's the fracs, whether it's Arbuckle, Demicks Lake, how should we think about not just even 2020, but even kind of beyond that 2021 CapEx? Should we kind of think that growth CapEx slows materially, which means maybe there's less growth in EBITDA from new projects coming online, but there's also a sizable pickup in free cash? Or is there another wave of kind of major sizable projects like in Arbuckle or others and they simply haven't been announced yet?","Terry Spencer","So let me take the first part of that question and then Kevin can follow-up. So if you just think back historically, we've had a number of these large organic growth programs over the past several years, and it seems like every time we talk about this very question, we answer this very question the same way, and we're going to probably answer at the same way. Again -- but we'll see this growth. And then what will happen is based upon the visibility that we perhaps don't have looking into -- looking two or three years down the road, we'll have the growth capital taper off okay?","And so Kevin will tell that yes, as we go into 2020 and 2021, we -- our own internal forecast are indicating less capital to be spent. However, each and every time we have continued to -- as that visibility gets closer to us, we've been able to develop more projects and continue to keep the organic growth train going if you will. And so that's -- I mean, that's just historically that's how it has happened, and I think it's very possible that there's opportunity out there we don't know about yet that will come. So, Kevin anything to add there?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. That's spot on. I think one of the ways to think about it is with these two -- primarily the two big pipes Arbuckle II and Elk Creek, we've more than doubled the back bundle if you will of our NGL system from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast. And so as we move forward with the operating leverage we have on those pipes to continue to expand it through low-cost pump stations that provides us the opportunity.","So really future capital needs are things like maybe another processing plant in the Bakken and another fractionator in the Gulf Coast, which are in much smaller chunks than the large multi-billion-dollar projects that we've got underway right now. So I do think you're going to see that range down over time, but as Terry suggested, we'll continue to look for opportunities to generate nice returns on other projects as well.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jean Ann with Sanford Bernstein.","Jean Ann","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on [Technical Difficulty]","Terry Spencer","Jean Ann, I couldn't understand a word you said. It's -- but we've got a technical difficulty on your transmission for some reason. Did any of you pick up?","Jean Ann","Is it any better?","Terry Spencer","That's much better.","Jean Ann","All right. Great. So I just wanted to follow-up Chris's question on Bluestem. Outside of the third-party, the Bluestem Grand [Technical Difficulty] ","Kevin Burdick","I think your question Jean Ann was do those plants have the option to switch? And what I would tell you is, as I said in my statement is that, all the plants we've contracted here lately are in 10 years to 15 years. So our contract that the dedication those plants have to the ONEOK System or for many years to come. So those plants are already dedicated to us and will not come on.","Terry Spencer ","So they don't have the ability to switch.","Kevin Burdick","Yes. So they don't have the ability to switch.","Jean Ann","Okay. Thanks. And can you give a sense as to what [Technical Difficulty] ","Kevin Burdick","We have not hedged any of the $0.10 around the Conway to Belvieu spread. It's very -- it's difficult to get forward numbers on Conway and a lot those products. At times we will forward sell a little bit where we store one month's product and ship it in the following month a little bit of it, but it is very difficult to hedge the north-south on a long-term basis. So you just don't have the liquidity.","Jean Ann","Okay. Sorry, about the echo. Great. It makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Dennis Coleman","Hi. Good morning. My question I guess maybe to follow-up a little bit on your discussion from the question with Michael. Should we think about sort of the next wave of projects as being tied to some of the discussion about crude oil pipeline takeaway out of the Bakken? And as we see announcements there potentially we could see you start to talk about your growth projects beyond 2020?","Terry Spencer ","Well, you get a long-term and maybe it would be. But if you look over the next two years or three years, we feel comfortable and as we talk to our customers that both crude and residue takeaway, there will be enough there to provide pretty significant growth over the next few years. And so I don't know that I would tie our next plant or additional capacity, we may need in the Bakken over the next two years or three years to a crude oil solution. I mean, you've got a couple open seasons out there that are being looked at. You've got some other expansion opportunities that I know people are floating around. So again right now our producers feel pretty good about their crude takeaway, and then you've always got crude by rail that can get you to the coast as they bridge, if you will to get to a pipe if they need it.","Dennis Coleman","Okay. Thanks for that. I guess, then my follow-up. Can you just give a little bit of color about the debottlenecking projects that you talked about the 15,000, I guess the 15,000 to 30,000 a day of frac capacity and what's the nature of those projects are?","Terry Spencer","That's just a -- there's several items in those numbers that will span just from very low-cost expansions and some different equipment that we could put in some different controls, we could put in that could squeak out at three or four different facilities an extra 5,000 or 6,000 barrels a day.","Dennis Coleman","And is that something -- are these something that can happen in a month or two or second half of the year?","Terry Spencer","They'll range. Some of them may happen very quickly others may take a few months if we've got to order some vessels or equipment that might have a longer lead time to them.","Dennis Coleman","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with the Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Shere","Picking up on Michael and Chris' questions on the dividend.","Terry Spencer","We can't hear you Craig, you're breaking up.","Craig Shere","Can you hear me now? Is this better?","Terry Spencer","That's better.","Craig Shere","As CapEx drops materially by the second quarter 2020, wouldn't you envision capacity to both sustain up to low-double digit dividend growth and consider share buybacks? And how do you think about fair value for the shares given the really massive very low-cost organic growth built-in with completion of both of those very large NGL pipelines with massive upsizing?","Walt Hulse","Well, Craig what I would tell you is that you're absolutely right that as we go into the back half of 2020 and then into 2021 and 2022, we expect to have a very significant cash flow in excess of dividends. And we basically have a three-tier approach to thinking about that. And our first approach is to try to find very attractive growth projects that we can go ahead and build.","Our second approach is to make sure that our balance sheet is as strong as we possibly can have it. And then after we've done those two, we surely will put the possibility of share buybacks in the mix and think about that. And -- but that will be a discussion at the board level as we get out there a couple of years.","Craig Shere","Do you have any thoughts on fair value? I mean, obviously, the leverage from continuing to fill up Elk Creek and Arbuckle II is substantial as we look beyond 2020. So one would assume that you could sustain above-average growth rates?","Walt Hulse","Yeah. No, if you're asking me if I think our stock is under priced the answer is, yes. I think we've got very significant growth ahead of us. And it really comes down to the cadence with, which that growth will come on the pipes. But I think the fact that we've been able to guide you achieving our 100,000 barrels a day in the first quarter of operation in Elk Creek and the significant contracting that's gone above and beyond that initial 100,000 really leads to very attractive growth going forward.","Craig Shere","That sounds good. And my last question, I don't know who wants to take it maybe Terry. But you guys built over like a decade and a half a dominant Bakken in the Mont Belvieu position that no one else has. But the Permian through Mont Belvieu to LPG export market is certainly comparatively more crowded. Certainly there's a lot of synergies from moving into LPG exports, but how do you think about the competitive landscape there?","Terry Spencer","Well, certainly it's significantly more competitive than our other areas. However, we've been pretty effective competitor. When we linked the West Texas system with our infrastructure in the Gulf Coast and basically brought it into the ONEOK's system proper, it changed the game for us, and we're seeing it in the volume performance particularly in the Permian.","So the exports are a natural progression for us in the value chain. And it's not something that we absolutely have to have, but we certainly believe that it's a strategic and important component for us that I think will do a great job as, if and when we get a project put together.","It certainly enhances our ability to market internationally for obvious reasons. I will now tell you that we market internationally today even though we don't operate a dock. But I think if you have a dock or an export terminal, it will certainly substantiate us as a true international player year. So, all that fits together well. And on top of that it's a business that's a fee-based component. So it fits well contractually as well and so there you go.","Craig Shere","Good. And how would you compare the all-in costs of that potential announcement to say a new frac or new processing train?","Terry Spencer","If you think about how we're approaching the project and I'll let Sheridan make a comment after me. But if you think about how we're approaching it which is primarily with a joint venture partner that there will be the export terminal itself will have some have partial will have partial ownership in that but then also there's infrastructure that has to be built around the terminal interconnection to storage facilities, connections to markets and connections to our system proper. You're talking about a cost net to ONEOK roughly in the $0.5 billion range. So from an order of magnitude of capital that's what we're talking about.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.","Q \u2013 Alex Kania","Thanks for taking my questions. This is just more of a clarification question. For the 2019 outlook, are you baking in kind of a consequence related to Shin Oak coming into service this year? Or were you talking mainly about the 2020 impacts?","A \u2013 Kevin Burdick","I think when we set out our guidance for what 2019 is going to be and we looked at what the Conway to Belvieu spread is in 2019, we did take into consideration that Shin Oak could possibly create some more capacity for purity products between Conway and Belvieu and I think that's why you see that our number is a little bit lower than it was in 2018.","Q \u2013 Alex Kania","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.","Q \u2013 Sunil Sibal","Yeah, hi good morning guys. Thanks for all the clarity and the call. Just wanted to go back to the balance sheet and leverage question a little bit. So it seems like there is a potential for you to kind of expand the fairway for potential projects and CapEx. I was wondering is there kind of a maximum leverage that you will look at when you think about that CapEx especially considering that some of these projects will be longer-lead projects?","A \u2013 Walter Hulse","Well, I'm not going to put a specific number out there. I think you can do the numbers based on the CapEx, but we've put out the significant cash flow growth that we expect to see this year and going into the coming years. We think we'll be in line with what the rating agencies have put out there publicly and kind of the expectation in the marketplace. We'll definitely be moving above four times for a very short period of time and as we get through the construction phase. But as we come down into 2020, the significant incremental EBITDA and cash flow delevers us very quickly than in the 2021.","Q \u2013 Sunil Sibal","Okay. So four and maybe 4.5x kind of max out there and then obviously 2020 cash flow growth will probably bring it on pretty quickly, is that the right way to think about that?","A \u2013 Walter Hulse","I think you're in the ballpark and you can do the math yourself, but I don't think you're too far off.","Q \u2013 Sunil Sibal","Okay. Got it. And then one last one from me. In terms of management's view on industry consolidation opportunities especially what we've seen so far is probably more like project consolidation. Do you see opportunities for even corporate consolidations opening up in the current environment?","A \u2013 Terry Spencer","Sunil I think you're right, we have seen a lot of asset consolidation and we've seen asset JVs too. But I think you're going to see more of that just I think that the corporate consolidation is obviously than other than some of the structural things we've seen over the course of the last year I think from a straight up corporate consolidation we still have time yet before that that starts to happen. I think -- again I think we're going to see it but it's going to take some time.","Q \u2013 Sunil Sibal","Okay, got it. Thanks.","Operator","We have no more questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola.","Andrew Ziola","Well thank you everybody.

Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thank you, T.D. Good morning and many thank you for joining today and for your continued interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phil May, Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines.","As noted in our second quarter earnings results release yesterday afternoon, key financial and operational information discussed during our first quarter earnings call has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 Web site. Please refer to this presentation and to the earnings releases for various explanation and key metrics.","With the information that has already been provided, I intend to keep my remarks brief today and focus on a few key areas. We\u2019ll spend the majority of our time answering your questions.","To begin, even in this continued weak commodity price environment, we expect that both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners will end the year within our 2015 financial guidance ranges. And as we exit 2015, we expect 2016 to continue to benefit from the completed and soon to be completed capital growth projects in the natural gas liquids, natural gas pipelines and natural gas gathering and processing segments.","We are seeing volume growth through the first half of the year as anticipated, particularly regarding natural gas liquids gathered and fractionated and natural gas gathered and processed. We expect these volume increases to continue into 2016. Overall, the Partnerships\u2019 year-to-date performance positions us to achieve our natural gas gathering volume and financial objectives for the year.","I will now turn the call over to Derek for a brief discussion of ONEOK Partners\u2019 and ONEOK\u2019s financials. Derek?","Derek Reiners","Thank you, Terry. Starting on partnership, 2015 EBITDA contribution continues to ramp up as strong volume growth is shaking up as we anticipated. We expect to grow our EBITDA in the second half of 2015 and be within our 2015 financial guidance EBITDA range of $1.51 billion to $1.73 billion. Our EBITDA growth follows the volume growth.","Even in this lower commodity price environment, the Partnership\u2019s year-to-date EBITDA of $712 million is only $40 million less than in the same period in 2014, which was a record in environment with much higher commodity prices. Our coverage ratio has improved to a 0.88 times coverage in the second quarter of 2015 and we expect continued improvement in our coverage the balance of the year.","The partnership has a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our current capital program including access to our commercial paper program and credit facility. As of June 30, ONEOK Partners had an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.5 times. ","As we said, investment grade credit ratings of ONEOK Partners remain very important to us. Through the first half of 2015 our ATM program was a very effective tool for issuing equity and we continue to evaluate the overnight equity markets and other sources of capital. We will continue to take a balanced approach and remain disciplined when issuing debt and equity. Additional equity is needed to continue to support our capital projects. ","We continue to remain confident in our ability to raise necessary capital to fund our capital projects at ONEOK Partners. At ONEOK our liquidity remains strong with a $150 million in cash and undrawn $300 million credit facility, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2 times at June 30.","We continue to retain access cash at ONEOK as we navigate these uncertain times.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Derek. Now let's take a closer look at each of our business segments, starting with our natural gas liquids segment. The segment's 2015 year-to-date results were supported by solid second quarter performance.","The segment's year-to-date operating income exceeds year-to-date 2014 operating income. This becomes a more useful statistic when you consider that first quarter 2014 results rightly benefited from a historically high demand for propane and that in 2015 the segment has experienced lower realized NGL product price differentials and narrower NGL location price differentials. So even though year-over-year the segment was competing with the 2014 propane benefit, operating income so far in 2015 has exceeded first half 2014 totals because of the continued strong growth of fee based revenues and volumes.","Our integrated NGL system continues to benefit from providing non-discretionary fee-based services to NGL producers by connecting growing natural gas liquids supply in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Permian regions with key market centers.","The natural gas liquids gathered volume on the Bakken NGL pipeline reached approximately 100,000 barrels per day in July and is expected to reach approximately 105,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2015. This is an increase of approximately 20,000 barrels per day from what we expected in the first quarter as a result of decreased ethane rejection in the Rocky Mountain region. We will talk more about the reduced ethane rejection in a moment.","The average bundle gathering and fractionation rate on the Bakken NGL pipeline is more than $0.30 per gallon.","Moving to our fractionated volume. In addition to the increased ethane fractionated due to the decreased ethane rejection, we also saw more than 20,000 barrels per day of incremental interruptible volumes on our system in the second quarter as we were able to utilize our fractionation assets to meet market demand.","We expect to continue to see approximately that level of incremental interruptible volume from our system into the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we do not include interruptible volumes in our fractionation volume guidance.","And finally, in recent weeks, we have seen Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials range from $0.02 to $0.03 per gallon and we expect this range to continue for the rest of this year. As you know our natural gas pipelines business is primarily fee-based with long-term firm demand charge contracts.","We continue to develop new projects and opportunities to grow our fee-based earnings. Just last week we announced plans to expand our ONEOK WesTex Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline System in the Texas Panhandle and Permian Basin. The expansion which will complement our previously announced Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline joint venture is already 90% subscribed with 25 years firm demand charge agreements. These projects and the expansion of our Mid-Western Gas Transmission Pipeline System are continued examples of our committeemen to stable long-term fee-based earnings growth.","The natural gas gathering and processing segment's second quarter results were significantly improved over the first quarter. Earnings for this segment are still expected to be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year which is in line with the expected growth of our 2015 natural gas gathered and processed volumes.","We have greater confidence in our Williston Basin volume projections with six months of operating performance under our belt and good visibility into the remainder of 2015. The segment is seeing the benefit of rigs concentrated in the most productive areas, new well connections, two compressor stations completed, and the current flared gas inventory.","We expect Williston Basin volume in the third quarter to reach approximately 650 million cubic feet per day as we continue to bring on additional field infrastructure. Additionally, our new well connections continue to exceed our expectations as we completed nearly as many in the first half of 2015 as we did in the first half of 2014. We remain on track to fill our plans to approximately 685 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter as we complete gathering system and compression projects through the second half of the year.","These new compressor stations will not only fill our existing plants but also will provide capacity to ramp up volumes at our Lonesome Creek plant, which is expected to be completed late in the fourth quarter 2015. In the Mid-Continent our volumes increased quarter-over-quarter due to incremental interruptible gathering and processing services we provide to third parties from time to time as demand dictates. In addition, a key producer in the Cana-Woodford as expect has now started the process of completing wells drilled in the first half of the year.","Our commercial team continues to make progress with customers on its recontracting efforts and has same positive results in increasing our fee based margin while providing enhanced services to our customers. Additionally, we reduced the level of ethane rejection in the Rocky Mountain region in June 2015 to maintain downstream NGL product quality specifications to ensure continued reliable delivery of high quality NGL products to meet the needs of our downstream markets. We expect the decreased level of ethane rejections to continue.","Our producer customers are continuing to find ways to reduce drilling cost, and are doing more with less. Said another way, our producer customers are increasing volume with fewer but more efficient rigs and advanced completion technologies are increasing well production rates to levels the industry has never seen before.","Our positive operating performance through the first half of the year, combined with what our producer customers are communicating to us, has given us greater confidence in our 2015 natural gas gathering and processing volumes and momentum into 2016.","Much like 2015, our 2016 volume growth is expected to be led by growth in the Williston Basin. In the Williston we connected more than 260 new wells in the second quarter 2015, bringing our year-to-date total to more than 560 new well connections. We still expect to reach our 2015 new well connection goal of more than 700 wells and our 2016 goal of more than 600 new wells. That continues to be an inventory of flared gas in the Williston Basin and we estimate approximately 145 million cubic feet per day is dedicated to the Partnership with the majority of the wells flaring already connected to our system.","As I touched on earlier, our producer customers are doing more with less. There\u2019re approximately 40 rigs drilling in the most productive areas at any given time on our acreage dedication in Northeast McKenzie, North Dunn and Southern Williams Counties. Additionally wells in the high producing areas continue to exhibit significant performance improvements; producing two to three times more natural gas than lower producing areas. Additionally, more than 900 wells, which have been drilled but not completed, remain in the basin.","The continued drilling flared natural gas inventory, improved well performance and significant backlog of uncompleted wells is expected to continue and help contribute to the Partnership reaching its 2016 natural gas gathered volume expectations. Our strong natural gas liquids and natural gas volume growth in the second quarter support the volume outlook we\u2019ve been communicating and provide our stakeholders additional visibility to support our volume growth outlook for the second half of the year; and most importantly, our financial guidance expectations for 2015 and the momentum into 2016.","As always, thank you for your continued support in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and thank you to our dedicated employees for your hard work and continued commitment to our Company. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we will take the first question today from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho","I just wanted to start with the reduced ethane in the Rockies. When you say to maintain downstream product quality specifications, are you talking about meeting natural gas pipeline specs?","Terry Spencer","No Christine we\u2019re talking about natural liquids specifications\u2026.","Christine Cho","So\u2026Yes, more color would be helpful.","Terry Spencer","Sure, and Sheridan, I\u2019ll let you talk about it.","Sheridan Swords","The NGLs coming out of the Bakken have a high oxygen content, and as we fractionate that oxygen, it\u2019s been driven into the propane, and the butane and to be able to get that by bringing more ethane on, we can driven it into the EP or we can treat it and we continue to make sure that the propane is on spec for delivery into the end use market.","Christine Cho","And then I guess a molecule [ph] from the Rockies. How much does that generate? I am assuming it's not the full $0.30 that we usually look at for Bakken.","Terry Spencer","It is -- we are having, it's close to that number but there is some offset versus that current ship wrecker pays are demand charges that we have. So this is going to offset, it gives demand charges as well. So it's not the full $0.30.","Christine Cho","Okay, but not something for off '15?","Terry Spencer","It's close, yes.","Christine Cho","Okay. I guess one of your competitors is in the process of connecting two of their NGL pipelines that would bring 50,000 barrels per day of propane from the Marcellus into the Midwest. Do you have any thoughts that you could share with us about what that level of supply could potentially use to the spread between Belvieu, Conway. Is that kind of supply going over along Conway or is that already enough excess capacity between Conway and Belvieu that it could easily go to Gulf Coast without any problems or does it just pretty prevent Conway from ever trading at a premium, again like it did last year. Any color would be helpful?","Terry Spencer","Christine what I would say is that obviously more volume into the Mid-Continent has nothing but improved spreads. We do think there is the ability to move some propane from Conway down to Mont Belvieu, especially if you displaced out a product. So these are all back spot ones that you may move more propane than butane and more propane than the EP or ethane that you have. But we do think there is capacity to move incrementally more volume between the two. But I think it will normally have a widening effect on the spread and it will have a dampening effect on Conway ever trading over Belvieu, you are correct.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then I guess last question from me. You guys have done a sizable amount of equity on the ATM year-to-date but like you said you are going to have to do more and because I think the market has somewhat of a wide range out there and what that number is, it kind of puts a bigger overhang on OKS. So that\u2019s EBITDA you guys report is always different than what I calculate and I suspect it's because of the project credit that\u2019s in there but how far does the credit rating agencies go in giving you that credit, is it year, 18 months, two years, any color on how they have used your balance sheet would be helpful?","Derek Reiners","Sure Christine, this is Derek. On an unadjusted basis, our debt-to-EBITDA has shown a 5.1 and we reported 4.5 on an adjusted basis, you are correct. The principal difference there is the material projects that we have on our way that we receive some credit for in our covenants so that's that delta. On a run rate basis, you are probably 1 or 2 basis points lower than that if you just took four quarter -- or excuse me second quarter and multiply that by 4. The agencies I think give us some credit for that, I am not exactly sure to what extent, they don\u2019t exactly share all their calculations with us. But they certainly understand that as we're in construction mode, we will be issuing equity and debt for that matter ahead of the realization of the earnings from those projects. And so I think there is some benefit afforded to us in that regard. Cleary agencies look forward and think about the nature of those projects and the earnings from those projects going forward as they think about, how does our leverage looks going forward.","Christine Cho","Thank you for the color.","Derek Reiners","You bet.","Terry Spencer","You bet. Thanks Christine.","Operator","And we will now go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hey good morning Terry.","Terry Spencer","Hey good morning Chris.","Chris Sighinolfi","Thanks for the added color this morning also thanks to Walt and T. D. for the slide presentation and the added disclosure, it's very helpful to us. So I just want to say thanks.","Terry Spencer","You are quite welcome.","Chris Sighinolfi","Couple of questions, I guess the follow on with where the screen going originally, the slide 4 where you have the volumetric data since the April update, clearly the Bakken NGL volumes are up materially from April end of July and you expected peak rates for the fourth quarter. You mentioned Terry the effects of reduced ethane rejection and interruptible volumes on 2Q and the guidance. But the wondering sort of those factors 2Q with an upside price for you on those fronts. So what are you seeing in the Bakken and I guess what gives you confidence with the forecast and could we see further upside from the products that you mentioned as we move into the back half?","Terry Spencer","Well Chris I mean we have increased confidence because our producers are performing and we continue to have lots of discussions to get a better understanding of where they are and what their plans are and they are executing those plans and as we said they are continuing to improve their cost structure and improve their technology and really significantly outperformed even in the midst of slight rig reductions in some cases.","So we've got good visibility into the quarter and that's the reason why we feel so confident about the volumes. That plays right into the natural gas liquids segment particularly as we produced more natural gas liquids out of the Rocky's and we produced more natural gas liquids out of the Mid-Continent that benefits the NGL segment. So it's about visibility, it's about continued communication with these producers.","Chris Sighinolfi","And so on the, I guess the downstream spec element, the Sheridan\u2019s comments. Is there further upside on that element, what you saw in Q2 and thus far in 3Q? Or are we fairly comfortable with their specs look like given base level and production volumes on is different?","Sheridan Swords","Well, one thing I would say is that in 2Q we discovered that we stated the ethane recovery or decreased ethane rejection in June, so you would have a full three months in the third quarter and full three months in the fourth quarter. So we think the level of ethane, or close to the level ethane that we were extracting today, is enough to bring these products into the spec and we can handle and get into the end use market.","Chris Sighinolfi","Sticking with that slide, slide number four, for a moment, it seems like the steepest projected ramp in July volumes to year end is on the West Texas system. So I just had a couple questions there. First, what is driving the ramp? Two, it looks also like the blended tariff rate on the system maybe came up a penny from the April update. I'm wondering if that was due to any recontracting if I am over-reading or reading too much and it\u2019s something like there is something else going on. And then three, Terry you had mentioned when you bought that asset the potential to fractionate barrels coming off gathering Permian volumes. So just wondering when we might expect to see the approach of that effort or if you could give us something on it?","Terry Spencer","The first thing I\u2019d say is July is down a little bit, the 2 15 is down a little bit from the fact that we had some outages on the system that caused the volume to be down. Also the reason the $0.04 we\u2019ve gone from $0.03 to $0.04 just because we have increased the tariff rates on the pipeline closer to market than from what it was. So you\u2019re seeing an increase in rates on the existing volume there. We continue to think that we\u2019ll have ramp up there as we talk to more producers out there and we think there is opportunity for that to grow. As you point out that the West Texas pipeline has the lowest margin on our system, so it doesn\u2019t have the biggest impact.","Chris Sighinolfi","And then on the fractionation side of it longer-term, just give an update on where we stand.","Terry Spencer","We continue to talk to producers and processors out in the Permian who are looking for a bundled service, not just transportation to fractionation and delivery into the end use market. So as we stated when we bought this pipeline, we think the ability to bring that bundled service to customers of the West Texas pipeline greatly enhance our ability to bring product to the line. And so we are in negotiations with various people on the line to be able to do that.","Chris Sighinolfi","Sheridan, anything to talk about?","Sheridan Swords","No, I didn\u2019t have anything to add, Chris.","Chris Sighinolfi","I guess one final thing on the asset side, it looks like Stateline de-ethanizer was moved out a little bit. Given the comments around reduced ethane rejection, I'm just wondering what drove that and any and that that movement in time would have on cost or return.","Kevin Burdick","The de-ethanizer was pushed back is regarding to the details of the design and it was really two drivers. One was as we work with our contractor. There was some long lead time equipment that got in and pushed the dates out a little bit. And then as we recast the dates when we apply for winter construction and looked at the efficiency we have when we run our projects through the winter, that cost us some time to -- don't think it will have a material impact on our \u201916 what we\u2019re thinking there.","Chris Sighinolfi","One final thing for me, just, Derek, the 4.5 times debt to EBITDA leverage metric that you quoted, that is consistent with how we interpret the covenants on the credit facilities, is that right?","Kevin Burdick","Yes, that\u2019s correct. It is exactly the way that we file with our banks for covenant compliance.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot for the added color today, guys, and congrats on a great quarter.","Kevin Burdick","You bet. Thanks Chris.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank.","Kristina Kazarian","Quick follow-up, first on leverage levels, can you talk -- I note you guys talked about this a little bit in two of the previous questions. But can you talk a little bit more about what I should be thinking on in terms of where the rating agencies want you guys to go on like a year-end run rate basis to keep an IG rating, and what that would mean for the use of the ATM or maybe even a block, and how you think about that given where the different currencies are trading right now?","Derek Reiners","The agencies I think have put out some guidance for us in their most recent updates. I think Moody's talks about a 4.5 times and S&P talks about 4.25 to be in those ranges. So certainly we think about that as we consider our equity needs during the year. We\u2019ve said many times the ATM has been a good tool for us and certainly would expect to continue to use that in the future.","But again, we have to kind of balance the balance sheet needs, the leverage with the issuing equity at a higher yield certainly than we would like to see. And of course as to additional you pay distributions on those units and so that impacts your coverage. So it's a balance and certainly we have regular communications with the agencies and let them know what our plans are.","Kristina Kazarian","And then bigger picture, I know we often talk about the desire to move more from POP to fee-based and to kind to get the business and at some in time you said you guys have sustained like the one-time coverage just off fee-based. I know you mentioned, again say in the press release but can we talk about progress that's been made there and time frame to that actually occurring in your mind?","Terry Spencer","Yes, I will just make a high level comment. It's going very well. Producers are engaged with us. We've had success. We've had some contracts. We are converted more to a fee-based structure than POP. So we are expanding the fee-based component and shrinking the commodity sensitive component that's gone -- it's gone well. Producers, they want additional services, other things added to their contracts with us, other features and we are working with them on those. So it's going well. When you think about the regions in which we operate and particularly in the Williston Basin, it's not like hundreds of contracts we're having to address, its key producers and just it's not a whole bunch of contracts, okay? So we expect to have some success as we continue to move forward, have success fairly quickly.","Kristina Kazarian","And so when we think about that, is it like a '16, '17, '18, how just roughly frame enough maybe?","Terry Spencer","Yes, it's going to be more of 2016 benefit to us.","Kristina Kazarian","Perfect. Thanks guys. That was it from me today.","Terry Spencer","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Good morning and congratulations.","Terry Spencer","Thanks Craig.","Craig Shere","So when you -- in the last questioning when you were saying Terry 2016 benefit and some of the conversion to more fee-based from POP processing and contracting, is that to suggest that the vast majority if not all of the distribution could be covered by fee-base by then or is that more a longer term?","Terry Spencer","Now that's Craig -- that would be a longer term proposition for us, okay. I think it's a practical goal, I think it makes more sense than perhaps trying to target a percentage of fee and percentage of commodity exposure but definitely it's a longer term goal.","Craig Shere","Okay. And Derek expressed the balance between topping ATM and keeping in mind the practical yields these units are trading at in the public market. Even with today's gains I think we are at stair step of lower price point than what you got on the ATM issuances in the second quarter. Is there a point at which you are just not interested in public issuances and at which without considering major structural changes that the OKE free cash flow and balance sheet strength could be used to bridge funding needs for few quarters?","Derek Reiners","Yes, Craig this is Derek. I think that's a good point. Certainly OKE has some additional cash on its balance sheet today and it has certainly got capacity to raise capital there at more attractive yields today. I think it is important to step back and think about the underlying assets of the Partnership and the types of projects that we have, even at these higher yields those projects make sense. And so it's something we certainly think about very often but and we could consider other types of securities other than just a common unit, we could consider -- OKE might consider participation in some form or fashion as well to help that need as well.","Craig Shere","And Terry as we think about bottlenecks in infrastructure in terms of actually filling out the Bakken Express Pipeline, I know that right now at the $45 oil that's not what people are thinking about. But thinking overtime, filling up that pipeline at $0.30 plus pricing that\u2019s bundled pricing including all downstream infrastructure. Is the bottleneck there fractionation that would need to be added and how we should think about how much more fractionation is needed to fill up that pipe in terms of the full issue of ethane rejection?","Terry Spencer","Well Craig it's a combination of both pipe and fractionation capacity. We are certainly not anywhere near to that point yet but if you think about it very broadly and longer term, if need to get to that kind of next stair step level of production assuming the prices stabilize and rebound, when we think about expanding that whole infrastructure it's got to be pipes, it's a combination of lubs, it's pumps and it's fractionation capacity you got potentially in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast. So you have to think about it broadly, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as just one particular component.","Craig Shere","And is there a bookmark you can give in terms of -- or book-ins you can give in terms of how billions of dollars of infrastructure we are talking about?","Terry Spencer","I\u2019ll let Sheridan.","Sheridan Swords","Well, what I would say, Craig, the other thing to realize is that fracs are not exclusive to one basin. Our system is we can move Y grade around. So would we have to add more fracs if we add more volume out of the Bakken? Possibly if we bring more volume as we\u2019re seeing more volume come out at the Scoop, the Stack and some of those areas, as that comes on that fills up our existing frac capacity as well, so it\u2019s go in there. But right now we think we have enough frac capacity for the volume on the Bakken today as it grows even in a C3 plus rejected volume. We do see a great opportunity out at the Central Oklahoma with the Stack and what\u2019s going on down there in the Scoop that we think -- we do think in the future we will be building more fracs.","Craig Shere","On a separate note, I was a bit surprise the optimization margins weren't more robust in the quarter, because propane spreads actually got pretty decent even though ethane was pretty anemic still. Can you update us on your ability to capture specific propane differentials even amidst the anemic ethane margins?","Sheridan Swords","Well, I think the biggest thing you have to look at is when you look at the propane differential through the second quarter -- you have to realize if you are going to the LONESTAR facility, which had the highest spread there\u2019s restrictions in getting to that facility. So a lot of what we were able to capture was between Conway and the non-TET or enterprise mark. So that was down cents per gallon from that.","We continue to, on the propane side, we continue to convert a lot of our optimization capacity to fee-based. So when we do that that reduces our ability to get a wider spread on margins on what we do ship down there, because we have to ship more and more volume for our third-party people that have, we\u2019ve given them Belvieu access.","Craig Shere","And just one more, the Bakken gathered NGL volumes are only forecast to rise 5% from July to the fourth quarter. But gathered volumes are guided to rise 14% from 2Q to 4Q. Can you elaborate on that?","Sheridan Swords","The reason that gathered volumes are continuing to go up, it is definitely a growth out of our Bakken, but we also see growth coming out of the Mid-Continent as we continue to go forward on that. So I think that may be where you are seeing some of that growth happen.","Craig Shere","I guess -- I am sorry, the first number was the NGL volumes and second was the guest gathered volumes all out of Bakken.","Sheridan Swords","Okay.","Kevin Burdick","Craig, this is Kevin. On the gathered volumes when you look at the information we provided in the quarter, that is not necessarily a quarterly average that\u2019s saying we will reach that capacity at some point. So, if you just do that math, that\u2019s not saying that there is a, what your number was that\u2019s the average growth, quarter-over-quarter, that just taking look at kind of a peak volume in the third quarter and a peak volume in the fourth quarter.","Craig Shere","So the numbers are a bit apples and oranges. That helps. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Chris on for Jeremy. I guess as noted earlier, I appreciate the color, extra color on the slide deck. When you look at the volume outlook for the second half of 2015 you noted that captured flare gas was one of the key drivers and you also have an inventory of about 145 million cubic feet a day in ONEOK's dedicated area. And so, we were wondering whether there would be -- whether that would be more weighted towards the second half of 2015 or how much of that goes into 2016?","Terry Spencer","Well, yes, there is a considerable amount in the second half, but it certainly gives you considerable momentum going into 2016. So, it is going to carry you well into 2016 along with the newly completed wells and the backlog of uncompleted wells. So it is all kind of working together. Kevin, you got anything to add to that?","Kevin Burdick","No, I would just -- the one statistic that I think is very interesting to kind of describe some of the improved performance is, if you look at the numbers provided by the state from January to May, oil production when up I think it was around 10,000 barrels a day. But gas production, which was basically flat or maybe a 1% increase, gas production actually went up about 150 million cubic feet a day during that same timeframe. So that demonstrates that as oil states flat with the improved gas to oil ratios, the improved performance gas oil ratios, the improved performance, the gas volumes have continued to go up.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, that's helpful. I guess moving to West Texas LPG, your JV partner there noted some pretty big expectations in terms of increased pipeline distributions. And so we\u2019re wondering, relative to your plans with that at the time of the acquisition, how are things trending? And with the recent tariff developments and your expectations for I guess returns going forward?","Terry Spencer","Well, it is going very well. With the tariff increases as well as the volume prospects that we continue to develop, we\u2019ve got high expectations for the pipeline, it\u2019s a great fit with our existing infrastructure, it is of course putting in this premiere basin that we wanted to be in for some time and sets ourselves for continued growth. The performance from a financial perspective is going to improve significantly with these tariff increases and as the volumes continue to be added it's going to be -- it is and it is going to continue to be a major contributor to the segment's profit.","Unidentified Analyst","So relative to your planned into time of the acquisition, would you say that's higher or?","Terry Spencer","I think the -- what our expectations when we had the acquisition we're progressing right along those expectations.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, it's helpful. And then I guess lastly from me. On the re-contracting front in terms of your percentage of proceed contracts. For 2016, would you expect any kind of lower returns from those contract negotiations or what kind of give and take do you have with producer customers in that regard. Anything there would be helpful?","Terry Spencer","Well the strategy is to enhance our returns and obviously these contracts have been affected by the lower commodity price environment and certainly at these price levels and the resulting margins it makes it difficult to realize an acceptable return. So we are not going to sacrifice return and as we continue to work with these producers and provide enhanced services and we have demonstrated that we have been able to put contracts together that make sense and get our returns to an acceptable level.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Terry Spencer","You bet.","Operator","And we will go to John Edwards with Credit Suisse.","John Edwards","Yes, good morning everybody and congrats on a nice quarter. Just coming back to the financing questions, you have indicated you are open to alternative approaches here. So I take it that you would also include things like subordinating yields, take units, perhaps even cash injections from OKE using OKE equity. Would that be fair?","Terry Spencer","Yes, that would be fair. We continue to evaluate all of those levers. ","John Edwards","And then I am just curious on the projects that have been suspended Terry, kind of what's the thoughts behind those perhaps any color on when you think you would be able to bring those back into say execution mode?","Terry Spencer","No specific dates at this particular point in time but again we continue to assess the current market environment which is very volatile and uncertain. It is -- and we continue to assess the environment and when the environment makes sense and when the producers need that capacity certainly we will fire those projects back up, okay. Right now we are continuing to -- we are still in a wait and see mode on those suspended projects.","John Edwards","Okay and then just any thoughts regarding your plans with all the recent increases in M&A activity?","Terry Spencer","Well, our plans are going to be the same. We are going to stay organically focused to the extent of we participate in M&A from a strategic asset standpoint that is we -- when people ask me about M&A I am like okay yes we are interested in M&A particularly as it relates to strategic asset acquisitions like our West Texas pipeline in the Permian. So yes we are going to stay active and focused and look at opportunities. But at the end of that day what happens out there in the M&A arena, we don\u2019t have a whole lot of control over that. We will just keep our heads down and stay focused and continue to drive risk out this business and serve our customers.","John Edwards","Okay. Great. That's it from me. Thanks.","Terry Spencer","Yes.","Operator","Next is Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Hi, thanks, so two quick ones. Just one more question on the West Texas LPG pipeline. When you acquired the asset you laid out a plan to spend a significant amount of capital over the next few years and expand the capacity of the line, obviously you have executed on increasing rate already. Has anything changed there or is that still all kind of on plan?","Sheridan Swords","Hi Michael this is Sheridan. Yes, we have been talking to quite a few producers out there that will backstop expansion. So we are progressing as planned on that and we are very hopeful hear pretty soon that we will be able to come out and announce expansion of the pipeline. So the Permian has still been resilient. We are still seeing growth and we are getting most people call on us about trying to get on this platform, as we still think with the assets that we have we can be extremely competitive versus the marketplace out there.","Michael Blum","And then just I apologize if I missed this but could you quantify the reduction in ethane rejection you saw this quarter?","Sheridan Swords","In the Bakken is about 20,000 barrels a day in June. So that's 20,000 barrels a day in June, so you can put over about 7,000 barrels a day on average for the quarter.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","If this already been asked, if it has just tell me to go listen to -- look at the transcripts, but on the ethane rejection, why is it occurring now? What has changed in having to add more ethane in to help the spec?","Terry Spencer","Well, Becca, I think the short answer, and I will let Sheridan follow-up, but I think the short answer is just the volume growth, significant volume growth that we kind of broke over to a point where the NGL production has gotten so big to the point where now this issue emerging is something significant.","Sheridan Swords","Yes, I would say you are exactly right. It is fundamentally that we\u2019ve had end use people call us and say that the propane is off spec and we need to clean it up.","Becca Followill","So, it is just you reached a tipping point?","Sheridan Swords","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Becca Followill","And then going forward, as you continue to produce volumes and you will have to produce more ethane in order to keep it in balance, is that correct?","Sheridan Swords","It will be. We are working on a long-term plan that we can clean this up at our fractionators so that we do not have to continue to extract this ethane. But that is going to take some time to construct and get in place. But we are working, our engineers are working on a long-term solution.","Terry Spencer","And the only thing I will add is that is not done for free.","Becca Followill","So your shippers will have to pay for that?","Terry Spencer","Likely so.","Operator","And next line is Eric Genco with Citi.","Eric Genco","I just wanted to go back to the -- and I guess not to beat a dead horse. The percent of proceeds to fee based. Your fee-based rate ticked up to $0.39 from sort of the mid-30s this quarter. Is that related to your efforts to move towards more fee-based?","Terry Spencer","I think the short answer is yes.","Eric Genco","And I guess as I was looking at it last night, is the strategy then to move towards more of a fee-based cut or a hybrid contract structure where maybe if commodity prices are low you get an extra fee payment? Because your equity volumes for NGLs and for residue gas actually ticked up a bit relative to the overall production levels. And I would have thought if that was moving towards fee-based that that would have been down or flat. So, I was just curious to whether this is more of a hybrid move or whether this is a pure conversion.","Kevin Burdick","Eric, this is Kevin. It will be -- it is a combination. I mean there we talk about converting to more of a fee-based margin. There are a variety of ways that we get there. One is, like you said, is just increasing the fees and increasing the POP percentages, that kind of trade-off. There is other ways that accomplish the same thing. So our goal, like Terry has talked previously, is each of our customers is different. They are looking for different services.","Those different services may require different strategies in how we go about working with them to get to the right mix of what is that. But in all the scenarios, it does result in a higher fee, but it may not, a fee-based margin, but it may not necessarily correlate to a lower equity volume.","Terry Spencer","And, Kevin, the only thing I would add to that is that when you think about our business as a whole, we\u2019re keenly focused on bringing new fee-based opportunities and fee-based projects to the table. And in Phil's business segment, as we mentioned in the remarks, the Roadrunner pipeline and its OWT expansion are important.","And on OWT expansion, in particular, is a good example of the additional projects that have spun off as a result of this Roadrunner project in establishing a conduit to those markets in Mexico. So we\u2019ll be very focused and remain very focused on fee-based opportunities and that will help bring that fee-based percentage up as we go forward.","Eric Genco","So is it fair to say then that that $0.39, at least, probably while commodity prices remain low, is probably fairly sticky at this point? And then perhaps as commodity prices recover maybe that falls back a little bit to where it should have been, but it doesn't matter because you have retained the upside in these contracts?","Terry Spencer","No, I don't think so, Eric. I think that as we continue to renegotiate that fee should go up. So, yes, I don't think that that rate is going to be driven much by or affected much by a move in commodity prices.","Eric Genco","And I had a couple other quick ones just to sort of -- some of the numbers you gave on the last quarter's conference call, and I think you repeated them, but I just want to double check. So there is about 900 drilled uncompleted wells in the Bakken right now and I think last quarter you said about 50% is on your acreage, so that is basically the same --?","Terry Spencer","That is correct, roughly 50%.","Eric Genco","And I think you said last quarter that there were 50 rigs drilling on your acreage. I was curious; did you give a number for that today?","Terry Spencer","Yes, we did.","Eric Genco","Okay, what was that? I'm sorry. I missed that.","Terry Spencer","We\u2019re in the 40 range right now.","Eric Genco","40 range\u2026.","Terry Spencer","Yes, and again that moves up and down. But all of that has been in line with our expectations.","Eric Genco","Okay.","Terry Spencer","The only thing I would add to that is keep in mind that these IP rates is the average initial production rates on these wells just continue skyrocket. And I was just reading some materials the other day from some of our customers or some of our producers rather, and it's really remarkable the improvement that we are seeing. So even if you see rig reductions we are seeing these increased IP rates that are more than offsetting some of those reductions.","Eric Genco","I think that's fair, I think in some of the instances we've been looking at -- some assumptions it takes about 24 days to drill well and some of these things but we are hearing some things maybe it's fallen down to almost the 16 range for some people so. I guess we would count as not the end all be all that it used to be.","Terry Spencer","Yes. ","Eric Genco","I also just wanted to ask real quick. Of the 900 drilling completed wells in the basin what you view is sort of being an equilibrium number for that? I mean there's always going to be some number of uncompleted wells and I was just curious overall for the basin what do you think is normal?","Terry Spencer","That\u2019s a tough one to answer. I mean because especially as producers have shifted almost entirely now to kind of the multi-well pads and those stick a rig and at a spot and then drill several wells and that -- so you kind of have an artificial working inventory if you will of completed -- of uncompleted wells. I think there is some as we have talked with others in North Dakota is that 300, 400 ranges that will kind of always be there as a working inventory as long as you are at this kind of a rig count, you may be in that range. But again that can fluctuate as again as rigs move around and what, where and how they are drilling.","Eric Genco","Okay. Well, thank you very much. That's all I had.","Terry Spencer","Thank you.","Operator","We will go to Andy Gupta with HITE Hedge. And it appears he does not have a question. So we will go to Matt Niblack with HITE. Please go ahead.","Matt Niblack","Hi. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you said at the beginning of the call properly that you had ample of liquidity particularly given how credit metrics are calculated by your borrowers that there is no need to issue okay equity at these FX valuations?","Terry Spencer","Well I don\u2019t know that I have said that. We have been pretty clear that we expect to continue to issue equity as we balance our credit metrics with issuing at this price.","Matt Niblack","Okay. But you said you're going at least avoid the disruptive overnight offering given the ATM program?","Terry Spencer","Well I mean we talk about the overnight markets all the time and we certainly continue to look at that option. As we said many times the ATM program has worked pretty well for us. We were able to get quite a bit done in the second quarter, so to avoid that overnight market issue but I can't wool that out for you.","Matt Niblack","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back for any additional or closing remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir.","T.D. Eureste","Thank you and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934.","Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thank you, T.D. Good morning and many thanks for joining today and for your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer. Also with us and available to answer your questions are Rob Martinovich, who is recently appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer, responsible for Human Resources, Corporate Services and Information Technology.","During his years with the company, Rob has served in a number of key leadership roles and without exception performed at a high level. Once again, Rob will step in to provide needed leadership in another important role for our company. I along with our employees will continue to rely upon his deep industry experience and leadership in this new role. Also on the call is Wes Christensen, our Senior Vice President of Operations; Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids; and Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing.","On this morning\u2019s call, Derek will start with a review of our 2014 financial results and then I will elaborate on our 2015 outlook and discuss ONEOK and ONEOK Partners revised financial guidance.","Before I hand the call over to Derek, I would like to discuss ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 accomplishments in 2014 and more importantly review our 2015 outlook and financial guidance.","At ONEOK Partners, our 36,000-mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids pipeline network generated record EBITDA of 1.56 billion in 2014, which is a result of completing a significant number of capital growth projects and acquisitions since 2006. Additionally, all three of our segments experienced double digit operating income growth compared with 2013.","Our most recent fourth quarter 2014 distribution declared represents a 98% increase since April 2006 when ONEOK became the sole general partner of ONEOK Partners. Since that time, our industry has experienced a wide range of market conditions both headwinds and tailwinds. And regardless of the conditions, the partnership is facing, we continue to believe it\u2019s in the partnerships and our unit holder\u2019s best interest to manage responsibly every dollar that comes in and goes out of the business.","As we leave 2014, I believe the partnership with its significant platform of feed-based business in growing basins in major market areas is well positioned to weather the current uncertain commodity price environment.","At ONEOK, we successfully completed the separation of our Natural Gas Distribution assets and became a pure-play general partner and provided ONEOK Partners, management and resources to execute on its growth strategies.","In April 2014, the board approved a 40% dividend increase clearly demonstrating the benefit of becoming a pure-play general partner. We remain committed to paying out the majority of our cash in the form of dividends, but we also intend to continue making prudent financial decisions that are in the long term interest of ONEOK and its shareholders.","Derek now will review ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 financial highlights. Derek?","Derek Reiners","Thanks, Terry and good morning. Fourth quarter 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $95 million or $0.45 per diluted share. 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately - I am sorry - 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $314 million or $1.49 per diluted share which includes a loss of $5.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share from discontinued operations.","ONEOK continues to benefit from its pure-play general partner strategy with $633 million and distributions declared by ONEOK Partners in 2014, a 16% increase from the same period last year.","Cash flow available for dividends for the fourth quarter was $142 million providing 1.13 times coverage of the ONEOK dividend. 2014 cash flow available for dividends was $621 million providing 1.28 times coverage.","ONEOK increased its quarterly 2014 dividend for the fourth quarter 2014 by $1.05 per share to $60.5 per share, 51% higher than the fourth quarter 2014.","Moving on the ONEOK Partners, fourth net income attributable to ONEOK Partners was approximately $263 million or $0.67 per unit. The full year 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK Partners was $910 million or $2.33 per unit. As Terry mentioned, all three of our business segments experienced significant operating income growth in 2014 compared with 2013.","Operating increased in the natural gas gathering and processing segment by nearly 40% benefiting from higher natural gas gathering and processing volumes.","Natural gas liquids increased 26% benefiting from higher margin NGL volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections and natural gas pipelines increased 19% benefiting from increased natural gas volumes transported.","Distributable cash flow was $306 million for the fourth quarter provided coverage of 1.06 times and approximately $1.17 billion for the full year, an increase of 23% providing coverage of 1.10 times. The partnership\u2019s fourth quarter distribution increased to $0.79 per unit, an increase of approximately 8% from the fourth quarter of 2013.","In the fourth quarter, approximately 3.5 million units were issued through our aftermarket equity program, generating net proceeds of $157 million. For the year, approximately 21.8 million common units issued, generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion included approximately 7.9 million units issued through the aftermarket program.","The partnership has a strong balance sheet and we are increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility as we notified our lenders of our intend exercise the option to increase the size of the partnerships revolving credit facility to $2.4 billion from $1.7, pending lenders approval which we expect to finalize in the next few weeks.","At the end of 2014, the partnership had $1.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility, total debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54% and a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility.","As discussed in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, we significantly reduced our debt and equity financing needs in 2015 by reducing plant capital expenditures to approximately $1.2 billion from our previous estimate of $2.8 billion. Terry will provide more color in a moment, but this reduction in capital expenditure reflects slower production growth outlook by our producer customers than originally planned.","We expect to continue financing our capital expenditures with debt and equity through the use our aftermarket equity program, overnight equity offerings, long and short term debt, while targeting a 50-50 debt-to-equity capital structure over the long term. These multiple sources of liquidity enables to be prudent and opportunistic from a timing perspective as we look to access the equity and debt markets.","We continue to remain confident and our ability to raise the necessary capital to fund the capital needs at ONEOK Partners.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Derek. That\u2019s a good setup to begin discussing our 2015 outlook and guidance. Our previous 2015 financial forecast and guidance was developed in November leading into our investor conference in early December. Since then, natural gas liquids prices are lower by nearly 40%, natural gas is down 13% and crude oil is down nearly 38%. This reduced commodity price environment has significantly impacted our producer customers 2015 capital expenditure programs and has created less clarity into 2016 and beyond.","Additionally the lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have impacted the partnership. Accordingly, we have lowered our ONEOK Partners\u2019 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance approximately 14% to a range of 1.15 billion to 1.73 billion. Our updated 2015 financial guidance is based on a $0.54 per gallon NGL composite price, a $3.50 per MMBtu for natural gas and $50 per barrel for WTI crude oil.","We expect ONEOK Partners earnings to grow significantly in the second half of the year relative to the first half due to continued volume growth in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. A significant ramp up in natural gas gathered volumes across our systems is expected to occur especially in the Williston Basin as we connect additional wells and complete field compression projects and in the Mid-Continent as a key Oklahoma producer drills wells in the first half of the year and completes those wells in the second half of the year.","We also revised our expected partnership distribution growth rate to 3% to 5% or a range of $3.16 per unit to $3.22 per unit in 2015 from the previous 8% with an expected coverage ratio of 0.87 to 0.97 times in 2015.","Although the partnership has slow the expected distribution growth rate in 2015 to reflect the current market, we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and our operating performance and reevaluate our distribution growth outlook each quarter.","Additionally, while our prospects for volume growth continued to look favorable, due to the current uncertain commodity price environment, we will not be providing financial forecast beyond 2015. While we continue to have a long term view in perspective, we believe it\u2019s prudent to show in our time horizon and communicate our financial forecast, distributions and guidance only for the current year and ability returns to the commodity markets. We will discuss our longer term thoughts on volumes in a moment.","Our track record of discipline growth continues and we are adjusting capital spending to reflect our producer customers\u2019 needs and their reduced volume growth expectation. We are suspended our Demicks Lake, Bronco and Knox natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, Powder River Basin in Wyoming and the Mid-Continent region of Oklahoma respectively.","We expect no more spending on these capital growth projects until market conditions improve and when they do, we will quickly reestablish completion dates. As a reminder, all three of those plants were originally scheduled to be completed at the end of 2016.","Our completed growth projects and our capital projects in progress will allow us to meet the current growth expectations of our producer customers in the basins where we operated and continue to ride us with growth opportunities.","In the Williston as we outlined at our Investor Day, our producer customers are focusing their drilling in their most economic areas. In addition, December production statistics showed statewide flaring was approximately 360 million cubic feet per day and there was an estimated 750 wells waiting on completion services. We expect 2015 Williston Basin natural gas gathered volumes to increase 39% over 2014 only 3% lower than our previous expectations.","In the Williston Basin, we had 3 million acres dedicated to us with approximately 1 million acres in northeast McKenzie, north Dunn and southern Williams Counties, which are considered core areas for many producers in the Williston.","We expect to complete our 200 million cubic feet per day Lonesome Creek processing plant and the additional field compression needed to take advantage of increased processing capacity and our Stateline I and Stateline II plants and the Garden Creek, Garden Creek II and Garden Creek III plants in the fourth quarter 2015.","This additional 300 million cubic per day in processing capacity is expected to help meet the flaring targets of 23% by January, 2015 and 15% by January 1, 2016. The Powder River Basin is a more challenged basin in this lower commodity price environment but some of our producers are incentivized to drill to avoid losing their leases. While the Powder River Basin development is in the early states and are currently providing significant natural gas or natural gas liquids volumes to our systems, we remain excited about the potential of this integrated opportunity. Similar to the Bakken, producers in the Mid-Continent are concentrating their drilling in their most economic acreage. We expect natural gas gathered volumes to be down approximately 4% in 2015 compared with our previous volume guidance with well completions weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year.","Producers are concentrating drilling in the best performing areas of the Cana-Woodford, Stack and SCOOP plays. Additionally improved well performance and better well completion results are positively impacting producer drilling economics.","Now for our longer term thoughts on volume; in the Williston based on dialog we are having with producers, we are expecting natural gas gathered volume growth of 27% in 2016 over 2015. For the natural gas gathering and processing segment, we expect natural gas gathered volume growth of 16% in 2016 over 2015.","Now for a quick update on our recently acquired West Texas LPG pipeline system. While it has only been a few months since we closed the acquisition, we are making progress with our super customers in the development of future system expansion. As a reminder, this pipeline was essentially full when it was acquired. Based upon discussions with our super customers, our expectations have not changed to reach a six to eight times EBITDA multiple between 2017 and 2020.","Now brief outlook on the NGL markets; the current ethane rejection by natural gas process and plants connected to our NGL system is approximately 155,000 barrels per day. Current ethane demand is nearly 1.1 million barrels per day and is expected to push ethane inventories lower through June. The Conway and Mont Belvieu location price differential per ethane is under $0.02 per gallon in favor of mobility and we expect these narrow differentials to continue for the rest of this year.","Propane exports are steady and we are seeing more propane buying in Conway for winter demand. As a result, we expect propane location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu to be in the minus $0.02 per gallon to plus $0.06 per gallon range for the remainder of 2015.","At ONEOK, we revised our expected dividend growth rate to 4% to 8% in 2015 or $2.42 per share to $2.52 per share from the previous 14% and slightly lowered guidance midpoint for cash flow available for dividends to 610 million from 620. In these uncertain times, we believe it is prudent to retail additional cash.","I would like to briefly touch on cost reductions. Regardless of the environment we may be operating in, we are also focused on managing our costs and operating safely and efficiently. On an ongoing basis, our employees are constantly challenging themselves to find new ways to be more efficient and reduce costs while maintaining safety, reliability and environmental responsibility. While the current market conditions, creates challenges, it also presents opportunity. Recently, we\u2019ve seen decreases in service rates, reduced chemical costs, lower fuel prices, reductions in third party contractor costs and other lower service rates.","Before I close, I would like to welcome and introduce Walt Hulse. Walt, who have known and worked with for many years, brings a tremendous amount of investment banking in energy industry experience to our company. As Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs, he has tremendous value as we identify and assess strategic opportunities as well as enhance our relationships with the investor community. Walt if very familiar to ONEOK story and has provided a counsel to us on a number of strategic acquisitions, the most recent was the separation of the distribution business into ONE Gas.","Walt and his family will soon be relocating to Tulsa from New Jersey; we\u2019d like to welcome Walt to the ONEOK family.","In closing, this is not the first time that we experienced management team and skilled employees have faced a challenging and uncertain market environment. We\u2019ve been here before with our assets, experienced people, financial flexibility and discipline and our legacy of doing the right things to create value for our customers, we are confident that we will emerge as better and stronger company, continuing to deliver value to our shareholder and unit holder.","And finally, I would like to thank our many dedicated and hardworking employees for delivering on the many accomplishments achieved throughout 2014. And in particular, many thanks for conducting our business in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manger each and every day.","Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Tim Schneider.","Tim Schneider","Hey, good morning, it\u2019s Tim Schneider with Evercore ISI. Quick question for your guys and I appreciate the color on some of the 2016 volumes. In terms of thinking about your integrated nature of our system, should we kind of think of the processing volume increase in running through on the NGL side as well, what I am saying is, is that show off on NGL volumes and fractionation volumes?","Terry Spencer","Tim, that\u2019s exactly the way to think about it. As we increase volumes particularly from our gathering and processing segment that will positively impact volumes that we fractionate and volumes that we transport through our NGL network.","Tim Schneider","Okay and can you talk a little bit about the contract structure of that, is that mostly under the bundled contracts that you\u2019ve had in the most.","Terry Spencer","Yeah, most of those contracted and those, the NGLs that we transport out of our affiliated plants as well as third party plants. Their fee based contracts they are bundled where you refer to them is exchange contracts and in those contracts, we provide the fractionation, gathering and transportation services to the market - to the market hubs.","Tim Schneider","Got it and last question for me is just on with respect to coverage, obviously OKS incrementally higher on OKE, I was just wondering what the thoughts were around that, that you are running negative coverage at OKS and why not you know maybe it supports OKS with bringing the coverage down a little bit at the OKE level?","Terry Spencer","Yeah, Tim, we think about those things - as we think about 2015 from a coverage standpoint at OKS, we\u2019re going to be below one or expected to be below one in the early part of year. But as we actually more through the year, we expect the coverage to be well above the one, okay. So our - the reason why we\u2019re carrying reported a negative coverage, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be in a below one coverage for an extended period of time.","Tim Schneider","Okay, guys, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets.","Carl Kirst","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I think I actually hit kind of on the question that I was going to get to and I think you perhaps answered it. And so but I guess as you look as sort of philosophically longer term, you have headwinds were to continue the tension between resetting distributions, running sort of sub one times coverage versus perhaps using OKE and IDR wavers, this should be basically just think of that you are willing to go under one times coverage but really only for very short periods of time?","Terry Spencer","Yeah, I think that\u2019s fair, that\u2019s been in the past, we\u2019ve been comfortable keeping our coverage below one at the partnership really for relatively short period of time.","Carl Kirst","Okay, thank you.","Terry Spencer","And it gets fair.","Carl Kirst","You know couple of other questions is from a base case standpoint, with respect to OKS and equity requirements with a much lower CapEx, should we still be expecting sort of use of GPM or is it down to where you think you don\u2019t even need equity for 2015 or any more color there would be helpful.","Terry Spencer","Carl, let Derek take that question.","Derek Reiners","Yeah, Carl, this is Derek. We do expect to continue to use the ATM program as we\u2019ve done in the past certainly been a program that has worked well for us in the last year and as we still do have $1.2 billion or so of capital in 2015 plan, we do expect to need to issue some equity.","Carl Kirst","Derek, can you - did you have a target range with respect to that 1.2 billion or should we think of it is roughly on far with 2014 as far as the ATM equivalents?","Derek Reiners","Well I think we\u2019ll continue to look at our credit metrics much the way we have in the past of course maintaining investment grade, credit ratings is extremely important to us at OKS. So that really will be our guidance to how much we would plan to issue either under the ATM or an overnight for that matter.","Carl Kirst","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe last question if I could, just with respect to and then I think these are similar numbers but just want to make sure I\u2019ve got sense of the colors. If we look at the maintenance capital spend for OKS, there is a 20% reduction. Is that something that is more reflective of the lower service cost you are seeing and thus is a new baseline or is that more sort of project deferrals that will just be done at later date?","Terry Spencer","Well I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and then Wes Christensen, if he has anything to add will jump in. You know in our maintenance capital, yeah first the short answer is yes, we\u2019re seeing some impact from the lower cost environment. But also there is also a trench of projects and our maintenance that are kind of more discretionary, okay. And so I think you are seeing some of those projects that are not really related to asset integrity. We will from time to time particularly in an environment like this, we\u2019ve got those discretionary project that we can dial out the maintenance capital, I think that\u2019s what you seeing. Wes, you got anything?","Wes Christensen","I think that would carry.","Terry Spencer","Okay.","Carl Kirst","Great, thank you, guys.","Terry Spencer","You bet. Thanks, Carl.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Good morning, guys.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Craig.","Craig Shere","Terry, in your prepared comments you said that you thought was prudent to retail cash at the OKE level with more conservative dividend coverage ratio, I know you\u2019ve already had a question to on this. But I wonder what purposes you might foresee cash and available balance sheet capacity at OKE, is it simply a backstop if necessary in worst case scenario to support OKS or are you keeping your mind open for other things?","Terry Spencer","Craig, yesterday what you inferred as far as okay. Yeah, we\u2019re keeping our minds open to other things, obviously we could, we could, we\u2019ll have that cash available to issue dividends in the future potentially. Obviously we have a cash tax low that could be coming down the road, that cash could be used for. OKE share repurchases is a possibility, the OKS support as you inferred and you many have opportunities there and it seems like in times like these there is always opportunity that presents itself, there may be some very compelling asset acquisitions that might present themselves and certainly that would provide us some liquidity for that. And of course obviously you could reduce - you could potentially reduce them debt. So those are all the things you could conceivably do in all the levels that we can potentially pull at OKE with that cash.","Craig Shere","Great and assuming full capacity utilization, I understand there is a question is to how quickly the growth CapEx portfolio when online will ramp up given the flaring and market conditions. But assuming full capacity utilization in current commodity pricing, what kind of updated EBITDA to CapEx multiples due or CapEx to EBITDA multiples due fee for the ongoing projects?","Terry Spencer","Yeah, in this environment from a stated multiple range that we\u2019ve - for all these projects that we\u2019ve historically indicated was the 5X to 7X and we\u2019re probably now north, if you looked at kind of what the average multiple would be on these projects, in this environment you know you\u2019ll be little a bit north of six times. So still very viable projects but from a multiple base, it had bases they have been effected someone.","Craig Shere","Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. And are there any specific sign forces or market changes you be looking before we starting the three differed projects?","Terry Spencer","Yes, probably a bit more fundamental is that we would really like to see some meaningful industry crude oil supply reductions, okay and if we if and when we really start to see that and I think we could feel like that the foundation for higher cured prices is much more viable. We see prices popping at $654, $70, $75 barrel range here. As we move into the 2016 timeframe, it\u2019s very possible, we could fire those projects back. And I think we see those kinds of markers out there, more confidence is going to be much improved. And certainly that would drive more communications with the producers and certainly - and hopefully increase drilling activity over and above what we are already hearing.","Craig Shere","Great, last question, obviously suspending the long term guidance, probably make some sense given the uncertainty but always made stuff not have a good roadmap. If things do recover in that range you said the mid-$60 to $70 oil and CapEx spending in the industry kind of I guess back to more of a steady state. From this reduced 2015 level, can you provide some color to what we could see in terms of growing back towards or close to the prior 2017 targets?","Terry Spencer","Yeah, Craig I think if we could see prices in that $70 to $80 a barrel range and consistently in that range, we could very well head back toward that and get back toward that dividend and distribution guidance range, kind of get back on that old growth - dividend growth and distribution growth target range.","Craig Shere","Great, I appreciate it.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the color.","Terry Spencer","Hi, Christine.","Christine Cho","So if I look at your operating income guidance for the NGL segment, it looks like it went down 60 million from original guidance. Would you be able to give us an idea of roughly how much of that is from your own equity volumes being revised down as a GMP segment and falling through your NGL asset versus how much is from third parties?","And also how did you guys determined how much to reduce third party volume, is that you going by customer forecast or have you haircut it further, any color that would be helpful?","Terry Spencer","Christine, I am going to let Sheridan take that question.","Sheridan Swords","On the answer about how much of the 63 million is attributable to our own equity volume, I would it\u2019s a little bit more than half. And then as we look at volumes going forward that is multiple ways that we look at, a lot is talking to the producers and the gathering a processing segments out there. Determine what they are seeing and we also look like at what we are seeing through our own plants in the same region to be able to determine what we think is a fair volume forecast for those plants.","Christine Cho","Okay, thank you. And then just continuing on the NGL segment, you guys previously expected about 12% of the margin to come from marketing and optimization, is that still you are expecting with their revised guidance?","Terry Spencer","Christine, I think it\u2019s closer to 15%.","Christine Cho","If you include the amortization I think.","Terry Spencer","If you include - if you include the amortization adds, it\u2019s\u2026","Wes Christensen","It\u2019s marketing and optimization is still around 12%.","Christine Cho","Okay.","Terry Spencer","So if you include the amortization, what is that.","Wes Christensen","14%.","Terry Spencer","There you go.","Christine Cho","Okay, perfect and then\u2026","Terry Spencer","That\u2019s the number I was trying to say.","Christine Cho","And then so I understand why processing plants in the SCOOP and Powder River would get pushed out, but I was a little surprise it also went there just given McKenzie County houseful lowest breakevens in the Bakken, can you talk about the slowdown you are seeing and even the sweet sports and what are the utilizations that frequency line plans, are they full or is there some capacity left there, any volumes that would gone to them?","Terry Spencer","Christine, clearly it is a function of the drilling plants of the producers in that Demicks Lake area and some of those well lot out on the edge and not quite in the sweet spot of the play. And I\u2019ll let Kevin add some color to that.","Kevin Burdick","Yeah Christine, we definitely have seen a movement of rigs into the core as we kind of premise back at our Analyst Day. As far as capacities and utilizations, we still have available capacity in our existing plant and then as we add like Terry referenced addition compression throughout \u201915 and lump sum creep coming on at the end of the year, that provides us with an additional 300 million a day of capacity that will be able to handle the continued drilling and the completions that are being worked in the first half of \u201915 and will give us headroom for growth on into \u201916 as well.","Christine Cho","Okay, great, thanks. And then last question from me, can you remind us if you have any minimum volume commitments on any of your assets and if so are you expecting any payments this year?","Terry Spencer","Christine, we do have some and we referred to is MVAs in the gathering and processing segment, most of those I think have run their term. Then of course in the NGL business, we\u2019ve got those, we don\u2019t refer to those as minimum volume agreements, we referred those as just from shipper pay or from fracker agreements. And we have certainly those in the NGL segment, more of those contracts were entered into to support many of the capital investments that we made, the new fractionation and this new Sterling pipeline and won\u2019t have it [ph].","Christine Cho","I know you guys expecting any payment side to that this year?","Terry Spencer","Yes, we are and I don\u2019t know how granular we\u2019re going to be able to get on that.","Christine Cho","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Becca Followill with US Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","Hey, guys.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Becca,","Becca Followill","I just want to clarify the change in guidance on gathering and processing volumes, I think it was up 17% and now it\u2019s up 10% and 8% respectively. Yeah, you said that Williston Basin was only down 3%, can you reconcile that change where that\u2019s coming from?","Terry Spencer","Kevin, I\u2019ll let Kevin.","Kevin Burdick","That is coming from obviously the other basin, but the Mid-Continent we saw some initial pullback there in our volume forecast and then also some coming out of the power.","Becca Followill","Okay, I\u2019ll follow-up to get some more specifics. And then in the guidance for volumes up 16% in 2016, it seems kind of contrary to the rig count reductions that we are seeing, so can you help us get to how you get that increase of 16% in \u201916?","Terry Spencer","Well Becca, just at a high level and I\u2019ll some of these other guys address the question as well. But when we think about what\u2019s happening, producers are pulling into these much higher and much more productive areas. Certainly you are seeing the impact of that. I think the other thing that you don\u2019t always hear about is that fact they are enhancing this, they are continuing to enhance their completion techniques and getting more production per well. So I think that\u2019s got to be a key. And you guys got anything else you want to add to that, I mean.","Wes Christensen","No, I mean that\u2026","Terry Spencer","Okay.","Becca Followill","Okay. And I got three more quick ones. You talked about the flow through of gathering to the frac, I think you guys are looking at basically flat frac volumes in \u201915 versus \u201914 versus the gathering and processing volumes up 8% to 10%, so do we look at it as a multiple or are you looking for that at some uptick in frac \u201916 may be different in the pattern in \u201915?","Terry Spencer","Becca, the reason you are seeing in your frac line is flat between \u201914 and \u201915 is that we had quite a bit spot frac contracts that we did in \u201914 that we are not predicting we will do again in \u201915, so there were just frac only contracts. And so a lot of the gathering volume, they will now look like the gathering fee plus the frac, we continue to go forward, that\u2019s why you are seeing the flat volume there.","Becca Followill","Okay. And then the second half pickup that you are looking at, where the coverage ratio is going to get thicker, is that - you assuming any pickup in commodity prices?","Terry Spencer","No, pretty flat - pretty flat prices throughout the year that $50 scenario.","Becca Followill","Gotcha and last question, if the $0.54 composite NGL barrel, I know in the wording that seemed I think reduction but you\u2019ve got pour some of your barrel roughly 10% of that thing, so built into that $0.54 does that include some ethane in there?","Terry Spencer","Yeah, there would be a small amount of ethane. Kevin, do you have anything you could add that.","Kevin Burdick","No, it should be small amount of ethane that includes in there as well.","Terry Spencer","Less than 10%.","Kevin Burdick","Around 10-ish.","Becca Followill","Wonderful. Thank you, guys.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Becca.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin","Thank you. Question on the OKE cash tax rate down in \u201815, but as you look forward to \u201916 with a lower CapEx at OKS plus maybe the impact of bonus depreciation, I am just wondering if you can give us some help on where the \u201916 cash tax rate is shaping up, especially I think guidance performance around 20% to 25%?","Derek Reiners","That\u2019s right. We actually I think had guided kind of 18% to 24% in the future years, but since we\u2019re not forecasting out the OKS distribution providing financial guidance, really I can\u2019t give you any more color beyond that. Of course bonus depreciation as you know in was passed for 2014 which rolled into 2015 for us as we carried over our net operating loss, so we don\u2019t expect to be a cash tax payer in 2015. If bonus depreciation were to be in active again that would certainly favorably impact 2016\u2019s cash taxes.","Ted Durbin","Got it. Next one from me, just coming back to these plans or preplans that are being suspended, I guess where there contracts associated with those, I mean kind of what was the old versus the new the change that\u2019s you are no longer moving forward those plans, what do you maybe giving up in competitor who is coming in and build over top of you?","Terry Spencer","Well Ted, first of all we don\u2019t believe we given up anything, but suspending these projects until market conditions improve, okay. So - and from a contractual standpoint, it\u2019s the same contracts that have been out there for sometime this large acreage dedication there, they are part of this 3 million acreage dedication that we continue we talk about. So those contracts were in place. This just now a matter of when is the drilling going to occur, when do they going to get this production out of the ground. So it\u2019s a timing issue. And so how you have to think about the suspension of these projects is not a cancelation but a push to the right, a shift to the right of the curve if you will. It\u2019s really all about timing. When we all believe that the commodity price environment is going to improve and as it improves and as these producers provide more clarity about their drilling activity, we\u2019re not given up really anything by suspending these projects, okay.","Ted Durbin","Got it. The percentage of fee based margins now you\u2019re looking into \u201915, I think before you\u2019d said 66%, where does that shakeout now within your guidance?","Terry Spencer","It is going to be more in the 75% range fee based.","Ted Durbin","Got it, thank you. And then last one from me is just the - it is really kind of the same question in terms of the backlog, you have the on enough backlog of $4 billion to $5 billion, should we assume that is the similar size but just takes longer to implement or is that actual backlog come down?","Terry Spencer","No, that\u2019s exactly right. Those projects are all still viable projects and it really Ted, as you indicate, it\u2019s more function of timing, okay. The curve being shifted to the right a bit as these producers get more confident in their drilling and have provide more clarity on their forecast, these projects will come back into the tray.","Ted Durbin","Perfect, I\u2019ll leave at that, thank you.","Terry Spencer","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll hear from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.","Carl Kirst","Thank you. Sorry, guys, just two quick follow-ups, one I need to know if there are any GNP price hedges for 2016 we should be aware of? And I also just wanted to confirm if we just let the current slate of projects play out, what is that imply 2016 growth CapEx to be?","Terry Spencer","Well I guess both of those question, Carl, first of all on the hedging, no updates for \u201916 and then as far as CapEx for 2016, we have not guided in the out years as far as capital spend. We provide pretty much when we do guide we guide in the current year and we remain with that.","Carl Kirst","Is there way to ask just what\u2019s left to spent at the end of this year on just those projects?","Terry Spencer","I don\u2019t know if we can get.","Carl Kirst","Okay, fair enough.","Derek Reiners","I don\u2019t have the number in front of me and I don\u2019t think we really guide to that at this point.","Carl Kirst","Okay, I appreciate it.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Carl.","Operator","And we\u2019ll hear from [indiscernible] with RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi good morning. On the three plants that have been suspended, have you spent any capital on those plants here and if you did want to kind of bring them back, you know how quickly could you kind of turn them on I guess?","Terry Spencer","I\u2019m going to let Wes Christensen to take that question.","Wes Christensen","Yeah, each one of the plants were in different places, but as we put them kind of into a part position, we have spent some money for long time items for Demicks and for Knox but we will have them all position, so that when the timing is right for them to be restarted that will be well prepared to do that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, thanks a lot.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning.","Derek Reiners","Good morning.","Jeremy Tonet","Thanks for the color this morning, very helpful. I was just curious if you might be able to comment now, you\u2019ve seen a competitor out there collapse the GP and LP structure for different reasons, I was just wondering if that\u2019s something that you guys had look that at all and if you see any benefits or how you think about the give and take on that type of transaction?","Terry Spencer","Well Jeremy, you know this company as we say last year, it was willing to entertain and execute on structural changes and it\u2019s no different here, we\u2019re certainly thinking about structural alternatives and we\u2019ll continue to think about it. From a timing standpoint, we\u2019re not ready to do anything that yet, so we\u2019ll just continue to look at it, it definitely had some merit and it might sense for that party to do it. And certainly we have to determine if it makes sense for us, but we\u2019re not at that point yet.","Jeremy Tonet","Great, thank you for the color.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Andy Gupta with High Hedge.","Andy Gupta","Hi good morning. So I just want to follow-up on the previous question, have you guys have any numbers on the taxes if you were to consolidate the GPLP and particularly with the ONE Gas unit sell [indiscernible], how does those that play into your thinking?","Terry Spencer","Well we have run numbers, but as far as trying to provide you some indication numbers probably would not be a good thing at this point in time.","Andy Gupta","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Hi, and last two question ticking up on that, I think the industry competitor that was referred to was thing very high tax even on distributions from the retained LP units of at least one of their large MLPs, are you still in the position for the foreseeable future that almost all of the OKS LP distributions are tax differed for still some years to go?","Derek Reiners","Yeah, Craig, there is still a fair amount of shield there. We\u2019ve been pretty well 100% shielded for a number of years and given that large capital that you\u2019ve us imply over the last several years, there is - that carries forward for a while. Of course in order to LP - the GP the IDRs are fully taxable the corporate rate but the LPs are do have that shield.","Craig Shere","Right, now I understand that, but a lot of your peers they lot more than zero on their LP distributions.","Derek Reiners","Sure.","Craig Shere","And since this particular industry competitor was brought up, they also happen to make a $3 billion acquisition in the Bakken right in your territory perhaps a little more spread out then what you got in terms of those concentrated three core county areas and it\u2019s also a little more focused on oil. So the fact is somebody is going to make an acquisition in this troubled market in your backyard kind of speak some value, but could you talk about your competitive strength and maybe the advantages of begin in gas processing and gathering in the Bakken versus primarily oil, if volumes were to fall off from even the current levels?","Terry Spencer","Yeah, like from a natural gas perspective, we have a lot of backlog, okay and that\u2019s one of the advantages - one of the things that provides us energy through this downturn or momentum if you will through this downturn. So you don\u2019t have quite that same phenomenon with the oil, okay. This flaring backlog is inventory, it\u2019s well connect inventory, now you got all this - in addition to that you got these uncompleted well. So it just gives us a lot of energy and momentum as we move into 2016. With our size, we\u2019ve got tremendous scale and so we cover a light area and certainly there are others in the GNP business and you indicated one, there are others there, most of the asset footprints though have kind of their own core acres dedication that they are very focused on.","And so we do have some overlap, but when you look at the dense part of each one of our systems, we kind of have our own areas so to speak our own backyards if you will. And we actually tend to collectively actually work together to take advantage of capacity on our gathering systems that might be available at certain times of the month where offload gas between companies to help reduce the players. Through - we\u2019ve actually work together solving problem. So it\u2019s really worked well, I don\u2019t see the landscape changing significantly as a result of the acquisition that you indicated, so - and primarily because I think that we - with those assets we\u2019ve had a pretty damp good relationship.","Craig Shere","And last question, I am sorry taking so much time, but you had mentioned Terry the possibility which is I think the first in a while with the separation utility business of buying back shares at OKE and there is a lot of M&A and people talk about M&A in the market now and some deep pocketed people out there. If somebody came along offered immediate 20% bump in the value to OKE of current market, would you see as attractive, how do you view value for the company right now?","Terry Spencer","I think if somebody came in and offered an attractive value, we certainly would have - the prudent think is to consider it, so certainly we have to open minded, okay. Our focus remains on organic growth in this company and the best way to create value is to continue to prudently and appropriately deploy this capital and earn as high return on invested capital as we possibly can and then structure the business and manage the business with reduced commodity price exposure and we\u2019ll have. So those are the ways in which we really - those are things we can control and those are thing we\u2019ve remained focused on. But I mean if somebody were to come in here and put an attractive number on the table, the prudent things we would have to - we have to look at it.","Craig Shere","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Tim Schneider with Evercore ISI.","Tim Schneider","Hi guys, just one quick follow-up. In terms of the margin guidance, the lower margin guidance, how of that is from volume declines versus, are you baking in any reduction in tariffs or any renegotiations with your E&P customers, are they pushing back in you guys a little bit?","Terry Spencer","Well at a higher level of say this team is we are really not having any pushback, if anything we\u2019re thinking about restructuring our contracts with certain of our customers, there are some customers who want to go more to fee based types of structures. And so yeah, we are having some discussions.","Tim Schneider","Then lastly from me, did you guys take a look at Highland?","Terry Spencer","I can\u2019t really comment and we generally Tim, we don\u2019t comment about our participation or non-participation in processes.","Tim Schneider","Okay, got it, thank you.","Operator","And there are no additional questions at this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to your speakers to any additional or closing remarks.","T.D.

Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.","On today's call, we'll discuss ONEOK\u2019s second quarter financial and operational performance, our updated financial guidance included in yesterday's earnings announcement and share our progress on our more than $4 billion of capital growth projects. As we noted in our release yesterday, the high level of productivity continues in the basins where we operate. Our consistent volume growth underscores the strong performance of our supply customers across our asset footprint. ","And while NGL pricing spreads and optimization are noteworthy, the fact is our core business, the fee based services we provide for both natural gas and natural gas liquids customers continues to expand with incremental volume growth across our system and is the largest contributor to our earnings growth this year. And we are well positioned for additional volume growth through incremental investments at attractive returns. Our long term strategy remains focused on expanding our integrated assets through capital growth projects and strategic acquisitions that fit within our footprint and provides sustainable long-term fee based earnings.","Yesterday, we completed the acquisition of Martin Midstream\u2019s 20% interest in the West Texas LPG pipeline. With that acquisition, ONEOK became the sole owner of West Texas LPG, a strategic step in our broader Permian Basin strategy and further positioning us for expansion opportunities, some of which are in the late stages of negotiations. Construction on our organic growth projects is progressing as planned and Kevin will provide more detail on those projects in a moment.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt.","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry. ONEOK\u2019s second quarter operating income totaled nearly $450 million, a 40% increase year-over-year and a 7% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $602 million, a 30% increase year-over-year and a 6% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.795 and last week, we announced another 4% increase to $0.825 per share or $3.30 per share on an annualized basis, in line with our previous guidance. The dividend is payable on August 14.","At June 30, our debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.4 times and 3.66 times on a GAAP trailing 12-month basis. We generated more than $160 million [Later changed by the Company to $126 million] of distributable cash flow in excess of our dividends paid in the second quarter, a 9% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. Total distributable cash flow in the quarter was more than $450 million, with healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4 times. ","We have proactively managed our future debt maturities and liquidity with our $1.25 billion senior notes offering completed in July. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay short-term borrowings and together with excess distributable cash flow will fund our upcoming debt maturity and help fund our capital growth expenditures. As of today, we have approximately $900 million in cash and $2.5 billion available on our credit facility. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant liquidity as we construct our capital growth projects.","With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our net income and adjusted EBITDA financial guidance midpoint expectations and narrowed our financial guidance ranges. The midpoint of our net income guidance increased $30 million to 1.09 billion and our adjusted EBITDA midpoint increased $35 million to 2.35 billion. These guidance increases are primarily driven by expected continued volume growth and our NGL optimization and marketing results. If the optimization spreads maintain at these levels and no severe weather occurs in the fourth quarter, we could easily be at the high end of our guidance range.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our businesses.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt. Starting with the performance of our natural gas liquids segment, NGL volumes gathered in the second quarter averaged 903,000 barrels per day, a 12% increase compared with the second quarter 2017 and a 6% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. Volume growth remained strong, as we have averaged more than 930,000 barrels per day in July. Two new third-party natural gas processing plants were connected in the STACK and SCOOP areas in the second quarter where strong producer results and increased ethane recovery continue to drive higher volumes. ","Mid-Continent gathered volumes averaged 569,000 barrels per day during the quarter, an 8% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. Our Bakken NGL Pipeline remains full and we began railing NGLs out of the region during the quarter. We expect to be able to rail up to 30,000 barrels per day to provide interim takeaway capacity until the Elk Creek pipeline is in service. NGL volumes fractionated averaged 696,000 barrels per day during the second quarter, a 12% increase compared with the same period last year. We expect to be toward the high end of our guidance range of 650,000 to 725,000 barrels per day fractionated in 2018. ","As total NGL volumes increased across our system, ethane volumes are also increasing. We had approximately 60,000 barrels per day of additional ethane on our system in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2017. The increase has continued in July with more than 70,000 barrels per day of additional ethane on our system compared with the same month last year. With a strong volume growth across our system, pipeline utilization has increased, which has led to a higher than anticipated location price differential for ethane priced in Conway. ","This price differential is causing Conway priced ethane to remain in rejection. Even without the Conway priced ethane being recovered, we are well on our way to achieving our volume targets. We continue to expect ethane production across our system to increase during the second half of this year, as petrochemical companies complete expansion projects and exports increase. Last week, the startup of another Gulf Coast ethane cracker was announced, which is approximately 90,000 barrels per day of additional demand and we expect several additional petrochemical facilities to come online by the second quarter 2019, totaling more than 200,000 barrels per day of new ethane demand.","Optimization and marketing activities in the second quarter also contributed to the segment\u2019s higher adjusted EBITDA, with increases of $23 million compared with the first quarter 2018 and nearly $50 million compared with the second quarter 2017. Wider location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu and the sale of NGL inventory previously held contributed to the increases. We continue to expect transportation capacity from Conway to Mont Belvieu will remain highly utilized due to growing NGL volumes, which we expect will sustain current spreads until Arbuckle II is placed in service.","Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased 30% compared with the second quarter 2017 and increased 28% compared with the first quarter 2018, driven by volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas. Producer activity across our dedicated acreage remains strong. Second quarter natural gas volumes processed averaged nearly 1.8 billion cubic feet per day, a 17% increase compared with the second quarter 2017 and a 3% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. ","During the second quarter, ONEOK\u2019s natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region averaged 932 million cubic feet per day, more than 100 million cubic feet per day higher than the same period in 2017 and a 5% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. We connected 210 wells in the Williston Basin and 26 wells in the Mid-Continent during the second quarter. We now expect well connects to total approximately 680 for the year, with 550 well connections expected in the Williston Basin and the remainder in the Mid-Continent. ","We have approximately 60 million cubic feet per day of available processing capacity and we\u2019ll add an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity in Oklahoma in the fourth quarter of this year, with the expected completion of our Canadian Valley plant expansion, which remains on schedule. In the Williston Basin, we have approximately 125 million cubic feet per day of available processing capacity, including the recently completed expansion of our Bear Creek plant, which increased its capacity to 130 million cubic feet per day from 80 million. ","We continue to look at additional plant and compression and expansion opportunities in the basin in addition to our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake plant that is under construction and expect it to be complete in the fourth quarter 2019. The segment\u2019s average fee rate increased to $0.89 per MMBtu in the second quarter 2018, above our original guidance of $0.80. Higher fees have been driven by greater than expected volume growth in the Williston Basin and higher volumes on contracts that have higher fees. We now expect our average fee rate to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.90 for 2018.","In the natural gas pipeline segment, second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 6% year-over-year, benefiting from higher interruptible transportation volumes and decreased 9% compared with the first quarter 2018, primarily due to normal seasonality. In June, we announced four expansion projects to provide additional takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas by up to a total of 1.7 billion cubic feet per day. ","The projects include an expansion of ONEOK\u2019s WesTex Transmission system from the Permian Basin to the Texas Panhandle; a project to make Roadrunner Gas Transmission bidirectional to transport natural gas from the Delaware Basin to additional markets at Waha, and both westbound and eastbound expansions of ONEOK\u2019s gas transportation system in Oklahoma to accommodate growing volumes from the STACK and SCOOP areas. These capital efficient expansions will quickly create critical takeaway capacity and offer additional optionality for natural gas producers and processors in these areas. The open seasons have concluded on the WesTex, Roadrunner and ONEOK gas transportation westbound projects. We've received strong interest on the projects and we\u2019ll provide the results once all bids have been analyzed and contracts finalized.","Now, a quick update on our growth projects, starting with Elk Creek. We have begun construction on the southern portion from the Powder River Basin area to the Mid-Continent and we continue to expect this section to be completed as early as the third quarter 2019, which should help alleviate some capacity constraints in the Williston Basin before the entire line is in service. We expect the entire project will be complete by the end of 2019. We've also contracted an additional 20,000 barrels per day on Elk Creek since our last call, bringing the total contracted volume to approximately 140,000 barrels per day. We are currently buying right away [ph] for Arbuckle II and remain on schedule for that project, which is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. We've contracted an additional 30,000 barrels per day on Arbuckle II, bringing our total contracted volume to approximately 290,000 barrels per day.","Site work has begun on our 125,000 barrel per day MB-4 fractionator and we remain on schedule for this facility to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. We remain on schedule to complete our 110,000 barrel per day extension of our now wholly-owned West Texas LPG pipeline in the third quarter and we are in late stage negotiations with several producers and processors in the region for additional expansions. As those deals are finalized, we will announce them. Lastly, the 60,000 barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III pipeline is also on schedule and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2018, which will provide additional capacity for growing Mid-Continent volumes.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Kevin. These calls are a great way to discuss operational performance and earnings results, but they don't always allow time to discuss the many other valuable and business enhancing initiatives happening at ONEOK. Whether it's implementing new technology to help our employees stay safe, volunteering time in our communities, improving pipeline safety monitoring or protecting the environment, our employees are doing great things for our business and for the communities where we live and work. So thank you to our employees for all of your efforts. ","Within the next month, we'll be publishing our 10th Annual Sustainability and ESG Report, which will highlight these initiatives and many others. I encourage everyone to review the report. To all of our investors, thank you for your continued support of ONEOK, our operations and our strategy for growth.","So with that, we\u2019re now ready for questions operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","My first question, I was wondering if we can talk about kind of the drivers related to guidance. You tightened up the low end of the guidance range and so forth, but I was wondering if you can talk about the higher end of the guidance range? What we would need to see to be able to hit the higher end? Is there some specific drivers that you think that are likely to happen? Are there some macro events that we should be thinking about? Any color around hitting the higher end would be appreciated. Thank you.","Terry Spencer","Sure. Shneur, as Walt indicated in his comments, he mentioned that optimization margins, going forward, if they stay about where they are, we could see hitting the high end of the guidance pretty easily, particularly also if we see some -- a little bit less severe weather than we've typically planned in our G&P segment. So, certainly optimization spreads, as we've proven, are very difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty. We really don't see anything fundamentally that could -- that will change or compress these spread, but certainly we\u2019ve factored in some cushion in our current guidance. But again, let me reiterate, if we see these optimization spreads kind of stay in this $0.20 a gallon range throughout the end of the year, we can see some upside, particularly in this NGL business. Certainly, the high end of guidance is very achievable, if that happens.","Shneur Gershuni","So to clarify, kind of the midpoint of your guidance does not assume that the spreads that we're seeing maintain themselves, but if they do and you're not forecasting one way or another, then you would definitely be able to hit the high end. Is that a fair paraphrase?","Terry Spencer","That's right on.","Shneur Gershuni","All right. Perfect. And a follow-up question, just wanted to dig in on Mid-Con volumes a little bit and I think you guys kind of touched on it in pieces in your prepared remarks, but is it a scenario where ethane is backing up the gas pipelines, the Permian with what it's doing is sort of backing up the entire system, are there de-bottlenecking issues that just sort of need to be taken care of and we can see an upside opportunity for Mid-Con volumes, as [indiscernible] are worked out. I was just wondering if you can sort of talk about kind of the steps and where we are with that.","Kevin Burdick","Hey, Shneur. This is Kevin. No, we don't see bottlenecks from a standpoint of the ethane that's being left in, creating residue issues. Our producers, from what we hear, both are, on our G&P side and overall producers from an NGL standpoint, continue to have great results. We haven't seen them back off at all and we definitely expect those volumes to increase as we move through the rest of this year and into \u201819.","Shneur Gershuni","So is it fair to say the Mid-Con is kind of a timing issue right now?","Kevin Burdick","For our G&P business, yeah, a lot of timing and then the slight reduction in the well count in well connects that we put out there is just really, maybe slightly less than one rig and some timing is all that drives that, but no, still feel good about where we're at from a volume perspective.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","I was wondering if we can get an update on the utilization levels on Sterling and Arbuckle and if you could provide some insight into which products you're optimizing the most at the moment?","Terry Spencer","So, we'll turn that question over to Sheridan.","Sheridan Swords","Christine, this is Sheridan. Right now, in the Sterling pipeline, we're still in that 80% to 90% utilized range, even though we had a bit more volume in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. And then on the Arbuckle pipeline, we're in the 85% to 90% range and we were moving all of the Y grade [ph] we can out of the Mid-Continent on Arbuckle at this time.","Christine Cho","Okay. And which NGL product are you optimizing the most at the moment?","Sheridan Swords","Ethane and propane are the ones we\u2019re optimizing the most and that's just really driven by the fact that those are the two products that we have the most on our system. So, we're still optimizing butane as well, because it has a very nice spread, but we just don't have as much butane as we have ethane and propane.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then I noticed that you guys took out the language that ethane rejection is expected to decrease to 70,000 barrels per day by year end. With Conway ethane frac spreads expected to be negative and the producers that are priced off Conway expected to continue to reject ethane, what do you expect your ethane rejection exit rate to be now?","Kevin Burdick","I think, Christine, this is Kevin. I mean, we \u2013 clearly, we're not going to -- we won't be at the 70,000 barrels per day but \u2013 of rejection at the end of the year, with Conway still being rejected, but I think the key there is that ethane that's not coming on is giving us the space for the optimization and will more than make up the value, if you will, that wouldn't come from the Conway barrels that would be recovered, will more than make up for that with optimization. So that's kind of where we sit today with these widespreads, no, we don't expect that to come out by the end of the year, but we're going to more than make it up with the optimization.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then one more if I could. Can you give us an idea of how much your Mid-Con contracts are priced off Conway versus Belvieu? And then if -- and then are all the Bakken contracts priced off of Belvieu?","Terry Spencer","We won't give that much breakdown, but at the macro level, all the contracts, you're probably 60-40 Belvieu to Conway.","Christine Cho","60-40 Belvieu-Conway. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Hey, good morning, everybody. Just wanted to clarify or get confirmation. The incremental contracting you did on Elk Creek. That\u2019s coming from Bakken, producers of Bakken volumes. And sort of the follow-up question to that is, do you have any update on the potential to add either DJ volumes or even potentially Western Canadian volumes to Elk Creek?","Kevin Burdick","Yeah. Michael, it\u2019s Kevin. The 20,000 barrels a day is coming out of the Bakken. I mean, that's I think primarily coming out of the Bakken, maybe a little bit out of the Powder. But in -- and discussions continue to go well up there. I mean, you're seeing a lot of growth across all the G&P companies in the Williston, as producers continue to have great success in the Williston and we've seen a lot of activity in the Powder as well and the DJ. So, a lot of conversations going on with producers about additional volume.","Sheridan?","Sheridan Swords","The one thing I would add is, we talk to the contract that we\u2019ve already \u2013 the people we've already contracted with, their ramp-up schedules have been moving forward, so we think that we will ramp up to our contracted volume quicker than we originally thought.","Michael Blum","And then kind of a minor issue I guess, but just more curious on the dynamics. The North System, is there anything out of the ordinary going on there, given the delays with Mariner East II getting into service and who they\u2019re servicing [Technical Difficulty] over there? Thanks.","Terry Spencer","Shifting on the North System that's been affected by Mariner East or what's going on there, I mean, the North system was down in the second quarter versus the first [ph] quarter, but that's more seasonality that we see every year. We still do receive volume into the Conway off of rail out of the Marcellus and that's probably driven by the Mariner East issues, but we\u2019ve been receiving those for quite some time. But I don't think it's enough to really affect the North-South spread or affect anything on the North System.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets.","Elvira Scotto","Hey, good morning. So what are some of the benefits that you guys see with the full ownership of West Texas LPG versus only owning 80%? Is it just the ability to deploy more capital?","Terry Spencer","Well, so, Elvira, one of the key things to make note of with -- when you have a partner and particularly if that partner is trying to monetize and create liquidity, you could wind up with a partner that doesn't necessarily fit with us. So, you have some risk there. So we've taken that risk off the table, but I think probably the most important thing is the ability to freely integrate that pipeline system in with our existing NGL business. ","When you've got a partner that's got a 50-50 vote, which is basically how it the JV was structured, long ago when Chevron owned it, you've got -- you want to be on the same page obviously and so the thing that -- the risk that you \u2013 the risk that you run is that you can't -- you don't -- you're not perfectly aligned, if you've got somebody else involved and as a result, you may not be able to do all the things you want to do with that pipeline asset. So by taking out Martin, we clean that up and now we own it 100% and now we can more effectively, without risk, integrate that business and take advantage of all these synergies that that asset has with our existing business and existing assets.","Did that help you?","Elvira Scotto","Yes, very helpful. Thanks. And then in your -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you were looking at expanding your integrated footprint through organic growth projects and strategic M&A. So, can you maybe talk about your appetite for larger scale M&A and what sorts of assets you\u2019d consider to expand your integrated footprint, is it more downstream sort of export type capacity?","Terry Spencer","Well, first of all, from an M&A perspective, certainly, we're very -- we remain very interested in M&A, but I think what you saw with the West Texas pipeline acquisition, I mean, that's a perfect example of what we're really interested in. Certainly, as we think about acquisitions and acquisitions from a more strategic standpoint, if they simply don't fit very well or have a real compelling strategic logic, we're not going to be very interested in it. So that's how we think about it.","I think broadly speaking, in terms of the types of assets again that we -- that we're interested in, certainly, downstream assets, particularly as it relates to terminal and storage, transportation of liquid products that don't have to be NGL, it could be crude oil, could be refined products, could be petrochemical products. That infrastructure as well as long haul crude oil transportation up -- further upstream could certainly make a lot of sense and we've been very vocal about that over the past couple of years, but then just candidly what I'll tell you is those assets, people don't want to let go of very often, so the opportunity from an acquisition perspective sometimes is limited as well as -- there\u2019s certainly quality fee based assets that everybody wants, including us.","Elvira Scotto","Great. All right. Thanks a lot.","Terry Spencer","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.","Danilo Juvane","Thank you and good morning. Guys, [indiscernible] gathering fee being as strong as it has been for the first six months of the year, is it fair to say that the new guidance number that you provided, I think it was $0.85 to $0.90. Should that be something that we should carry over into 2019 as well?","Chuck Kelley","Yeah. This is Chuck. I would say that in \u201919, you'd probably see similar range on our fees as we move forward with the mix of volumes coming out of the Bakken, primarily driving that.","Danilo Juvane","Got you. And I guess switching gears, I noticed that you're still stating, no equity needs well into 2019. Does that change at all, just given how strong you\u2019ve performed so far this year and of course you do speak about having additional opportunities next year, do you see a need of potentially issuing equity at some point in \u201919.","Walt Hulse","This is Walt. We obviously have experienced strong cash flows, which is helpful, because we get to reinvest that back into the business and that helps us from a debt capacity standpoint as well. So we don't see anything today with what we have on the table that would change our view that we want to issue equity in 2018 or well into 2019, if at all in 2019. Now that said, we are seeing opportunities for growth projects that are on the horizon and if they come sooner as opposed to later, we have to leave that door open, if we need to manage the balance sheet. We think the investment grade credit rating is incredibly important and we're going to do what we need to do to protect that, but as those move out further on the timeline and these pipelines start cash flowing the way they will, we continue to expect to de-lever very quickly 2020 and beyond.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks, Walt. Last question from me, you mentioned in the press release some impact to NGL segment earnings from the timing of unfracked NGL volumes, should we be expecting a positive impact over the next couple of quarters from that dynamic?","Terry Spencer","I mean, when we think about the frac volume, yeah, we did put some raw feed and inventory in the second quarter. We expect that will get fracked off over the rest of the year, so we should be -- you should see that come over the next couple of quarters. ","Danilo Juvane","Any estimates as to what the EBITDA impact would be from that?","Walt Hulse","Probably in that -- it would be in the $10 million to $20 million range.","Danilo Juvane","That's it from me. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Good morning. Thanks. I think you guys kind of touched on a couple of different times here with regards to guidance, but just kind of bringing it all back together as far as what kind of the main drivers were to the guidance increase, raising it here, was it just kind of strong first half is in the books at this point or now you kind of assume spread duration is going to remain at higher and better levels for longer duration in the back half of the year. And just want to confirm West Texas LPG acquisition is not in the -- not factoring in here as you guys already consolidated that, are there any other items that you'd say, if you kind of rank order, what was the biggest components to the increase in guidance here?","Terry Spencer","Well, Jeremy, I think you're right on in the comments you made, but the biggest mover certainly is optimization. Now, we do very typically, as I mentioned and Walt mentioned in his remarks, as we do factor in some weather degradation later in the year, if that and you know that weather can be severe, if it's not as severe as we've got factored in, we could certainly see some pretty significant benefits to our G&P segment, as we move through the fourth quarter. But the biggest mover is the optimization. And again as I said earlier, it's difficult to predict these spreads with any degree of certainty, but what I will tell you is everything that we're looking at today is leaning toward pretty consistent scenario where we see wide spreads for an extended period of time.","Jeremy Tonet ","That's helpful. Thanks. And then just going back to the 30 less well connects in Mid-Con you were talking about, it seems like it's kind of timing related I think. But just wondering if you could share kind of what areas this is, if this is a STACK, SCOOP or kind of legacy areas? ","Terry Spencer","No. It's pretty much just in general. And again, that's back to, rigs move around a little bit on our acreage and it's not that we're seeing any degradation overall in the STACK and SCOOP. It's just, maybe less than one rig that's been on our acreage versus somebody else and a little bit of timing, that's all that\u2019s driven there. There is no structural or fundamental change in our outlook of how we\u2019re viewing the STACK and SCOOP.","Jeremy Tonet","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America.","Dennis Coleman","Yes. Hi. Good morning. A lot has been asked, so just a couple of detailed ones from me if you would please. There's a footnote that says you may bring Elk Creek on the Southern in the third quarter and the whole thing on in the fourth quarter. Any meaningful earnings impact from that that we might expect to model in? ","Walt Hulse","The earnings impact would be, like we've said, we're using rail as a bridge to provide our customers those -- that service as it relates to their growing volumes in advance of the pipeline capacity. So -- one way to think about it is, as we move barrels, if we get that Southern section done, we're able to move barrels from the Powder River Basin over to that pipe and start collecting the full pipeline fee rather than the rail -- and not have to pay the rail cost, so that would be the uplift we would get. That's the way we're thinking about it and we haven't really talked about \u201919 guidance yet, but clearly, as we get closer and we do that, that will be considered as we provide that guidance.","Dennis Coleman","Perfect. Okay. And then obviously strong results here and potential for higher guidance, does that change anything about when you think you will become a cash tax payer?","Walt Hulse","No. We still have a -- as we've guided in the past, we won\u2019t be paying taxes through at least 2021 or beyond. It will be some point further out than that and that hasn't changed.","Dennis Coleman ","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","[indiscernible] but just a little confused on the last answer to Jeremy\u2019s question on guidance. You\u2019re assuming some discount to recent spreads from Conway to Mont Belvieu on the optimization into the second half, right?","A \u2013Terry Spencer","That's correct. Some degradation in the spreads going forward through the third and fourth quarter.","Craig Shere ","Okay. And so -- and to your point, if we just stay flat from where we've recently been, you\u2019ll hit the upside of guidance? ","A \u2013Terry Spencer","You got it. ","Craig Shere ","Okay. And then Kevin, on the additional 20,000 a day for Elk Creek and 30,000 for Arbuckle, any thoughts about how quickly that will ramp? I know Sheridan kind of mentioned that up in the Bakken, producer activity plan seem to suggest a quicker ramp than you guys had shared on the last call for your legacy contracts.","Kevin Burdick","I don't -- I mean, yeah, we continue to get good information or positive information from our producers about the volumes being stronger. That has translated into additional contracts and a little bit steeper ramp, but we would still expect it, the volumes are going to ramp over a year or two, as we move through these projects and once they come online.","Craig Shere","Okay. And any thoughts about what next in the Permian besides the West Texas LPG expansion.","Kevin Burdick","As we think, we've got a lot of visibility to volume growth. And when you look at what's going on out there, I mean, clearly, the Permian with the number of rigs and the growth expectations on the liquids side, we have a lot of targets out there and again are in late stage negotiations with several of them. So, we would look to continue to expand and loop West Texas all the way from the Permian to where it connects with Arbuckle II and now that we wholly own it, we\u2019ll be able to integrate eventually that pipe into Arbuckle II and achieve some significant capital savings by leveraging the Arbuckle II pipeline and the capacity there versus laying another line that's part of West Texas LPG.","Craig Shere ","Okay. So it's just maximizing what you\u2019ve got, nothing on the crude side or any other ideas there?","Kevin Burdick","So Craig, we're always thinking about the crude business, we're always thinking about the potential to take existing assets and repurpose them to crude and vice versa. So, we're always thinking about those things. I would never rule out the opportunity, particularly in a basin where crude is being produced as prolifically as it is. We're certainly always thinking about it and in particular in the Permian.","Craig Shere","Okay. And last question, a bit of a follow-up to Elvira\u2019s M&A question. She referenced export possibilities. I know that Terry, you've kind of commented in the past, you wouldn\u2019t mind moving into LPG exports. Any kind of update on the market there, your thoughts?","Terry Spencer","Well, we continue to aggressively pursue export terminalling opportunities, that has never stopped. We like the prospects that are in front of us today. Our commercial teams are working very hard and looking at a lot of options. We're talking to a lot of international markets that we\u2019re spending a lot of time hopping across the pond, speaking with potential customers and potential partners in the project such as an export terminal. So very high on our list and certainly a business or an activity that makes a lot of sense for us.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over back to Mr. Andrew Ziola.","Andrew Ziola ","Well, thank you, everyone. Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in early October and extends until we release earnings in late October. We'll provide details on the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry?","Terry K. Spencer","Thank you, T.D. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. On this conference call is Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial results. Also with me and available to answer your questions are: Rob Martinovich, our Executive Vice President of Commercial; Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids; and Wes Christiansen, our Senior Vice President of Operations.","On this morning's call, we will review our second quarter 2014 financial and operating results. I will expand on sequential variances comparing first quarter 2014 results, which were impacted by strong seasonal demand with the second quarter 2014 at the partnership. I will discuss our recently announced capital projects, which increased our capital growth program to a range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. I'll expand on what I consider an incredible capital growth days we are entering. And then, we'll discuss our commitment to reducing natural gas flaring in North Dakota plus an NGL market and Conway-to-Mont Belvieu price differential update.","Before we review our second quarter performance, I would like to briefly discuss our 2014 financial guidance. We remain confident that we will meet our 2014 financial guidance expectations and reaffirm guidance that both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. We will continue to review our expected performance as the year progresses and make any adjustments as appropriate.","Now our second quarter performance. Operating income from continuing operations attributable to ONEOK reflects higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold. And higher natural gas liquids volumes sold in the natural gas gathering and processing segment as a result of recently completed capital growth projects.","Second quarter 2014 results reflect the first quarter that ONEOK has operated as the pure-play general partner of ONEOK Partners. We remain committed to providing management and resources to ONEOK Partners to execute its growth strategies.","Derek now will review ONEOK's and ONEOK Partners' financial highlights, and then I'll review our operating performance. Derek?","Derek S. Reiners","Thanks, Terry, and good morning. Second quarter 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $62 million or $0.29 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations attributable to ONEOK was approximately $70 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared with second quarter of 2013 income from continuing operations of approximately $75 million or $0.36 per diluted share. ONEOK is benefiting from its pure-play general partnership strategy, receiving $287 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners in the 6 months of 2014, a 9% increase from the same period last year.","Cash flow available for dividends for the first 6 months was $341 million providing 1.45x coverage. We're reaffirming ONEOK's cash flow available for dividends guidance range of $560 million to $640 million. ONEOK increased its quarterly 2014 dividend $0.015 per share to $0.575 per share, effective for the second quarter of 2014, resulting in an annualized cash dividend of $2.36 -- excuse me, $2.30 per share.","Moving onto ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners' second quarter income was approximately $214 million or $0.54 per unit compared with $202 million or $0.62 per unit in the second quarter of 2013. Distributable cash flow was $272 million for the second quarter, providing coverage of 1.02x.","For the first 6 months of 2014, distributable cash flow was $570 million, providing 1.14x coverage compared with $445 million for the same period last year, providing coverage of 0.99x. Our long-term annual coverage ratio target still remains at 1.05x to 1.15x.","We increased our second quarter 2014 distribution to $0.76 per unit, an increase of approximately 6% from our second quarter 2013 distribution of $0.72 per unit. We also reaffirmed ONEOK Partners' 2014 net income guidance range of $975 million to $1.075 billion. Its adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.565 billion to $1.665 billion, and its Bcf guidance range of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion.","The partnerships slightly increased its 2014 capital spending guidance by $85 million to $2.1 billion, primarily as a result of our recently announced Demicks Lake and Knox capital growth projects.","In the gathering and processing segment, we've updated the margin estimate web model that can be found on the ONEOK Partners' website. This update improves the accuracy of estimating the net margin by adding an electric compression charge, which has become more significant with our Canadian Valley plant coming online and our growth in the Williston Basin.","In the news release, you'll notice changes in our hedge percentages reflecting expected ramp-up of volumes in the second half of 2014. During the quarter, we issued 1.9 million common units through our aftermarket equity program and a total of $3 million common units in the first 6 months of 2014 compared with 681,000 common units issued in all of last year through the program.","Additionally, in May, we completed a public offering of 13.9 million common units, which generated net proceeds of $730 million. We used the proceeds to repay commercial paper, fund our capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes. With this offering and excluding any potential acquisitions at the partnership, we don't expect to return to the overnight equity market again this year, based on our planned 2014 capital expenditure guidance.","We have ample liquidity to support the partnership's ongoing capital growth program, including access to nearly $1.7 billion under our commercial paper program or credit facility as of June 30.","At the end of the second quarter, the partnership had $278 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility, a long term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 51% and a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.4x.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry K. Spencer","Thank you, Derek. At ONEOK Partners, the natural gas gathering and processing segment second quarter 2014 operating income was up 19% compared with the second quarter 2013, due to higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold, and higher natural gas liquids volumes sold, as a result of recently completed capital growth projects and higher net realized commodity prices.","From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income for the second quarter 2014 compared with the first quarter 2014 was up 10%, due to a $17 million increase, due to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and Western Oklahoma, offset partially by a $9 million decrease in lower net realized prices and a $7 million decrease due to changes in contract mix. The segment's operating cost decreased $6 million sequentially, primarily due to the timing of materials and supplies costs. Volumes increased sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Natural gas gathered increased 10% and natural gas processed increased 14%. We have continued to see a significant ramp-up in natural gas volumes across our systems since February, and we expect to see this strong growth continue in the second half of 2014, especially in the Williston Basin as we connect more wells to our system and as we bring our Garden Creek II and III facilities into service.","Natural gas liquids segment's second quarter 2014 income was up 11% compared with the second quarter 2013, due to higher margin volumes delivered from the Bakken NGL pipeline and from new plants connected in the Mid-Continent region.","From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income following strong seasonal demand of the first quarter was down 10%, due to a $40 million decrease in optimization margins, primarily from narrower Conway-to-Mont Belvieu propane location price differentials. And a $15 million decrease in marketing margins due to lower propane margins, offset by a $34 million increase in exchange services margins, which resulted primarily from higher margin natural gas liquids volumes delivered from the Bakken NGL pipeline and increased volumes from new plants connected in the Midcontinent region, a $16 million increase in isomerization volumes due to wider iso-to-normal price differentials, and a $7 million increase in operational measurement gains. The segment's operating cost increased $11 million sequentially, primarily due to outside services and property taxes due to capital growth projects.","Volume growth increased sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Natural gas liquids gathered increased 9% and natural gas liquids fractionated increased 10%. We expect natural gas liquids volumes to increase during the second half of the year as previously connected natural gas processing plants continue to ramp-up. Also, 6 of the 10 plus connections to new processing plants we planned for 2014 have been completed through July with the balance occurring by year end.","During the fourth quarter, we expect to reach approximately 575,000 barrels per day, both for natural gas liquids gathered and fractionated. The segment's natural gas liquids volume was impacted in the first quarter of 2014 due to severe cold weather, which reduced supply deliveries to our systems. Ethane rejection also continues to impact volumes. The lower volume impact to the exchange services financial performance is partially offset by minimum volume commitments.","Additionally, our Bakken NGL pipeline is now gathering approximately 40,000 barrels per day and will increase as our Garden Creek II and III plants come online. The Bakken barrel is our highest margin volume in the entire NGL system.","The natural gas pipelines segment's second quarter 2014 income was up 14% compared with the second quarter 2013, due to higher natural gas transportation revenues related to increased rates on intrastate pipelines, and the higher contracted capacity and natural gas volumes transported in the natural gas pipelines segment. Sequentially, quarter-over-quarter, operating income following the strong seasonal demand over the first quarter was down 32%, due to a $6 million decrease in short-term natural gas storage services from reduced weather-driven demand in the second quarter of 2014. A $5 million decrease in park-and-loan services, also, as a result of reduced weather-driven demand in the second quarter of 2014. And a $9 million decrease related to lower net retained fuel, lower natural gas prices and lower contracted storage capacity.","Equity earnings decreased $8 million sequentially, primarily due to decreased park-and-loan services on northern border pipeline compared with the higher weather-related demand in the first quarter 2014.","On July 1, 2014, the North Dakota industrial commission, or NDIC, adopted an order drafted by the Department of Mineral Resources, which revised the state's rules for natural gas flaring. Earlier in the year, the NDIC also approved an industry goal to reduce natural gas flaring to 5% to 10% of total production by the fourth quarter 2020.","We remain committed to being part of the solution to reduce natural gas flaring in North Dakota as we continue to invest in critical natural gas and the NGL infrastructure. This commitment was demonstrated by last week's joint announcement with North Dakota Governor, Jack Dalrymple, on the Demicks Lake Natural Gas Processing Facility and related infrastructure in North Dakota, which will bring the partnerships natural gas processing in the Williston basin to 1.1 billion cubic feet per day by the end of 2016, 10x the natural gas processing capacity we had in the region compared with 2010.","Additionally, we expect to announce additional Williston Basin natural gas processing capacity by the end of this year, pending board approval. We are accelerating our capital growth program in the region as improved completion techniques and increased density drilling continues to drive higher production forecast.","We also recently announced the Knox natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure in the crude oil and NGL-rich SCOOP play in South Central Oklahoma. This 200 million cubic feet per day plant will accommodate increased production at NGL-rich natural gas in the emerging SCOOP, where we have substantial acreage dedications. This will increase our Oklahoma natural gas processing capacity to 900 million cubic feet per day by the end of 2016.","Now an update on our announced capital growth program. The Garden Creek II natural gas processing plant is mechanically complete and on budget, and we expect Garden Creek II to be operational and full by the end of August. As mentioned in last week's announcement, the Garden Creek III natural gas processing plant is ahead of schedule and expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2014 versus the first quarter 2015. And by constructing additional fuel compression, we will be able to take advantage of additional processing capacity at our existing and planned Garden Creek and Stateline natural gas processing plants by a total of 100 million cubic feet per day by the fourth quarter 2015.","The Sterling I and II pipeline reconfiguration was completed in July. And finally, our MB-3 fractionator and the Sage Creek NGL pipeline infrastructure are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2014. The news release incorrectly stated the Sage Creek NGL pipeline infrastructure completion was fourth quarter 2015.","Our capital growth program is now at $7 billion to $7.5 billion, and we are entering into another incredible capital growth phase at the partnership, with the announcements of the Knox and Demicks Lake natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure, and the expected announcement of additional processing capacity in the Williston Basin pending board approval.","Our announced capital growth program has approximately $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion remaining to spend between now and year end 2016 and our backlog remains at $3 billion to $4 billion.","We are well-positioned in the Bakken Shale and the Williston Basin. The NGL-rich area of the Niobrara Shale and the Powder River Basin with our Sage Creek acquisition, which is progressing as planned. And in the Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays in the Mid-Continent.","Now a brief review of our outlook on the NGL markets and Conway-to-Mont Belvieu location price differential environment. Planned and unplanned ethylene plant outages plus expansion delays continue to constrain ethane frac-ing due to the decreased ethane demand and increased ethane rejection, estimated to be approximately 300,000 barrels per day industry-wide. Ethane inventories continue to build and could reach approximately 40 million barrels by the end of August. As a result, we expect Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane location price differentials will be in the $0.03 to $0.05 per gallon range in favor of Mont Belvieu for the balance of the year.","Gulf Coast propane inventories are up approximately 24% over the 5-year average and Midwest inventories are 8% under the 5-year average. Propane exports continue to be strong, and we are seeing more propane buying in Conway in preparation for the fall and winter. And as a result, we expect propane location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu to be in the minus $0.02 to plus $0.02 per gallon range for the balance of the year.","Even in this narrow location price differential environment, our integrated assets have performed well, and we remain committed to our strategy of converting optimization margins to fee-based exchange services, which will continue to provide long-term value for our unitholders.","Normally, I close by thanking all of the ONEOK employees whose professionalism and dedication allows us to create exceptional value for our investors and customers for which I am truly grateful. Today, I would like to focus on my friend and one of ONEOK's most valued employees, Dan Harrison. As most of you know, Dan passed away last week following courageous and tough battle with cancer with his family by his side. Throughout his fight, he was surrounded by his beloved wife and daughter, extended family, friends and his ONEOK and ONE Gas family. The outpouring of support for him and his family has been truly amazing. His dedication and passion for ONEOK, its employees and its stakeholders cannot be put into words. His contributions to this company and our employees are numerous. Dan led several functions for us, among which were Communications and Investor Relations, for which he had tremendous passion. How Dan was able to tell the ONEOK story to the investment community was truly best-in-class.","I remember when Dan joined ONEOK in 2005, he immediately recognized that our employees and integrated assets and their history of creating exceptional value, he said \"Made for a story that needed to be told.\" So under Dan's guidance, we traveled east and west and wherever he wanted to take us.","Our stakeholders benefited from those efforts and this did not go unrecognized through our share in unit price. And by Dan's colleagues, as he was named to institutional Investor Relations Magazine's 2011 All-American Executive team. Even as Dan was battling cancer, he was instrumental in leading us through the separation from ONE Gas that we announced a little over a year ago.","He provided me invaluable counsel and leadership, especially as I entered my new role as CEO. I and the entire ONEOK family will be forever grateful for Dan's leadership, tenacity, kindness, professionalism, passion and dedication to this organization. Dan leaves behind a wonderful legacy, in the way he was able to tell the ONEOK story to the investment community, and we will always honor this and all of his many contributions.","Operator, we're ready for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And we'll first go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just starting off in the G&P business here, and if you can just talk a little bit about the returns profile that we should be looking for. I guess, and if you look at kind of the, whether it's your guidance or where the numbers are coming for the first half of the year, at least when we do the math, it looks like the returns are not up to 5 to 7x that you've been guiding us to. So, I guess, the ramp as the capital is deployed, as the volumes of ramp-up maybe just a little more help there in terms of how we should be thinking about that.","Terry K. Spencer","Sure, Ted. We still, in our view, still, the economic returns on these projects are still within that 5 to 7x in our view. But certainly, you do have to think about the impact of commodity prices over the course of the last 2 or 3 years, we have seen private prices come down, already has impacted returns somewhat, but we're still within that 5 to 7x range.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is it -- should we expect that in a year or a couple of years? Or what's the timing of when we think we hit the full run rate?","Terry K. Spencer","When we hit the full run rate?","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, exactly.","Terry K. Spencer","I mean, Ted, most of these plants, when we turn them on particularly Garden Creek II, Garden Creek III, and then the new process capacity that we've announced over the course of the last several months, we expect those to be full, pretty darn quick. Almost, as we start them up, they will be essentially full, day 1.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, great. And then if you can just talk about, again, sticking with the G&P business, it looks like you had a little bit of a sequential drop if I look at first quarter, second quarter versus first quarter in your equity NGL barrels. Is there anything behind that? Or was it kind of -- what was the driver there?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, Ted. Rob will take...","Robert F. Martinovich","We started the Canadian Valley sort of that process in April, so as you're going through the startup there or you're going -- you're not running at full efficiencies, quite frankly, as volumes are coming on, and you're getting plants lined up, so that was the primary factor.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then last one for me. On the 2 new plants for Demicks Lake and Knox. I guess, are these contracts going to be similar to the other ones you've had where we should consider them mostly acreage dedications? Or you started bidding at minimum volume commitments or any sort of other financial backstops on any of these projects?","Terry K. Spencer","They'll be very similar to contracts in the past, the acreage dedications, DOP percentage plus deed [ph] components.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Maybe just to start, if I could, with the projects in the queue, you guys obviously continue to be active, continue to point to more projects coming in the Bakken, yet you're still kind of looking at this $3 billion to $4 billion of unannounced. So I assume new projects are kind of coming into sort of help backfill. And what I wonder is has there been any shift in characteristic as you're adding new projects to that potential backlog, is the first question. And the second is as you look at that $3 billion to $4 billion, is it possible to break down from just a rough zip code of percentage, how much of that is coming from either processing or commodity exposed infrastructure versus more fee-based infrastructure?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Carl, I'll take part of this question and then I'll have to let Rob follow up with it. But yes, the characterization of the projects that are coming in to the backlog as we continue to announce are not really no different than in the past. It's all gathering and processing, it's liquids-related infrastructure. And it's in, of course, our core regions, the Bakken. We have expectations for the Niobrara or the Powder River Basin as well. But really, it's more of the same I think, the mix of the projects too from a spending standpoint have been pretty well, in the past, have been pretty well, 50-50 gathering and processing and NGLs.","And I'll let Rob speak to kind of to go -- to going forward his assessment.","Robert F. Martinovich","Sure, Carl. Step back and the only thing I'll add to what Terry said is certainly, what we're seeing in the Bakken, in the Mid-Continent Shale or some or the other shales is the newer wells are stronger than probably they were a few years ago. And so, with that, kind of, as an overall backdrop, certainly, what we're seeing is the opportunity for additional gathering and processing infrastructure in the areas be it the Bakken, the Niobrara, Oklahoma as we've demonstrated and then going forward, continuing in the Bakken. And then, from an NGL infrastructure, to support those liquids. So I'd say it's going to be, at the end of the day, maybe a little bit tilted towards the gathering and processing initially, but I think over time, it will works its way down to that 50-50.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. And then, also, if I could ask a question on the NGL volumes and this maybe more sort of geared towards the distribution lines, but noting that second quarter was relatively flat with first quarter, despite Sterling III having come online. And so I just want to get a better sense of the nuance there. Is that from more of the fact that just kind of the narrowed differential? Or was Sterling I and II, for all intents and purposes, down for the count for second quarter as it was finishing its reconfiguration work?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, I'm going to let Sheridan handle that question, but the only comment I will make, my contribution is that our business is a very complicated business in terms of the way we operate it. And when Sheridan gets done talking to you about that, you'll have an even better appreciation of the complexity. Sheridan, take it away, please.","Sheridan C. Swords","Carl, you kind of hit it on the nose. Narrow spread differential is overall, that's what's driving it. As we see spreads or prices are more in favor of the Conway market, we are moving more of the barrels up through our system to Conway, which has taken barrels away from Sterling system, than we had seen in the previous quarter. So that's really overall what's driving our system, driving the flatness in the 2 quarters that paces that -- more is just going north to the higher Conway markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then last question, if I could. And this is really more on the NGL volumes gathered. And Terry, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you indicated that you guys were targeting a fourth quarter run rate in the $575 million range, did I hear that correct?","Terry K. Spencer","That's correct.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And so that number seems to be a little bit lower than what we were looking for initially back last December, and I just wanted to make sure I knew exactly what was driving that Delta. It was primarily just a timing of gas plants coming on? But also, I wanted to ask to the extent that you have any contract renewals at the tailgate of any of these plants, do you see any headwinds of any of those plants going a different direction and or they -- is there basically a volume at risk that we should be aware of?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Carl, I'm going to take the last part of that question. I'll let Sheridan handle the first part. But the last part of the question, no. We don't have concerns, but we do remain very sensitive to the market and extremely aware of our competitions out there. And so we've been very successful competing in our area and really don't see any vulnerabilities. The one contract that you've heard us talk about a number of times in the past calls is -- we had a contract at the beginning of the year that we terminated and that was a below market, very, very low margin contract that have been in place for a number of years. And so we terminated that contract. And that's, of course, has impacted our year-over-year volumes. We haven't forgotten the question already. I think Sheridan will handle the first part of it.","Sheridan C. Swords","Carl, as we look into the fourth quarter of this year and why we've changed our volume, it kind of comes down to a couple of things. And one is we are seeing more ethane rejection across our system and so that's having an impact on us as well. We're also seeing, as plants ramp-up, they're not ramping up quite as fast as we thought they would in certain parts of our system. But also, we are seeing some -- the volume that's not coming on is more weighted towards our lower margin volume and the volume that is coming on is more of a higher margin volume. So that's a little bit unfortunate for us that we're kind of having that mix, that there are higher-margin volumes are doing well, if not exceeding our expectations.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. Just kind of maybe this is somewhat big picture, but just trying to think about fractionation utilization across your system, both in Mont Belvieu and in the MidCon. And you continue to add a lot of processing capacity in and around your system, of course, a lot of it up in the Bakken. Now I'm just wondering, does that -- should we expect that, at some point, you'll need to add another fractionator to handle all that incremental volume coming off of all those plants?","Terry K. Spencer","Okay, Michael, I'm going to give you the short answer and then Sheridan may give you a much longer answer, but the short answer is, yes. Do you have anything to add to that, Sheridan?","Robert F. Martinovich","Michael, you hit it. As we bring more of these plants on, not just from our own plants or from other plants, we are looking forward to having more fractionation capacity coming online, trying to make sure we understand where the right place to put it in our system is to maximize utilization of the capacity that we have now and in the future on both our pipelines and our existing fracs. So yes, you will see if everything continues to progress, you will see more fracs come out.","Terry K. Spencer","Michael, one other tidbit of information, I think may be helpful is that when we look at frac utilization in an ethane rejection environment like we're in right now, you may see the total utilization percentage be well below 100%. And I'm talking about anybody that operates fracs here in the industry. It's a little bit misleading because what's not being utilized in an ethane rejection scenario is the front end of the frac. The back end of the frac may be very full, okay? And so that's one little phenomenon or a characteristic that you need to be aware of that I think will be helpful to you to take you, particularly as we're in this ethane rejection environment.","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then back on the Sterling pipeline. Just sort of -- if you don't mind going over it again, so now that you've got I and II configured and III up and running, I mean, what's the best way for us to think about what's contracted versus what's available for optimization. Is III fully contracted or now you're using I and II for optimization, or just trying to get a feel for how those 3 lines now are going to interact.","Terry K. Spencer","Michael, I think the first thing you got to look at those 3 lines is working as one system. And so you have 3 different capacities that you can put the right mix of product on those lines. And with how we've configured today, we're also going to use one of those lines for raw feeds to move raw feed between the Mid-Continent and Mont Belvieu. So like when we're in certain situations where we have an ethane rejection, we don't have as much FEEP [ph] coming out of the Mid-Continent, we can put that on a smaller line and use one of the other lines for purity products or raw feed if that's what it dictates. So we'll be able to move product in between those lines to maximize capacities that we have going from Conway to Belvieu. So you kind of got to think them -- you got to think of them as a complete system, not as individual pipelines.","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My last question, just any updated thoughts you have on establishing a bigger footprint in the crude markets? Obviously, you've seen one Bakken crude line get that project -- get announced. Just not necessarily asking about that particular project, but just generally your thoughts in terms of getting into the crude side of the business more?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, Michael. We still are engaged in that process and still would like to establish a footprint, where it makes good sense and where it makes economic sense. The Bakken continues to be an area that we're continually prospecting for opportunity. The fact of the matter is though as you look at the crude oil landscapes, not many people want to sell or divest their crude oil assets. So those are very valuable -- they're very valuable assets to the most midstream companies. So we continue to look for logistical opportunities, storage, terminalling, pipelines, that type of thing. But of course, we, again, have to continue to weigh those investments against our alternative investments in our core areas like our Bakken gathering and processing, our Mid-Continent gathering and processing, our Mont Belvieu, Gulf Coast NGL position. So we want to be in the crude business. We are very aggressively looking for those opportunities, but certainly, we're not going to do them at the expense of economic discipline. And in particular, at the expense of investments we're making in our core areas.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Edwards with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to make sure I understood. You mentioned about reducing flaring in the Bakken down to, I think you said to 5% or maybe 5% to 10% level by 2020, and I'm just curious, your thoughts on how much capital do you think will be required to accomplish that in -- up in the Williston Basin there?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, certainly, we're going to -- it's going to take a lot of capital, as you can see. We have already announced our Demicks Lake processing plant and now we're telling you that we're going to announce, yet more capacity between now and the end of the year, pending board approval. Every time we announce these plants, they're now much larger plants than we built in the past. They're in that 200 million -- they're 200 million a day capacity range. And now, we've announced 2 of them in the last several months and you got -- from that, you've got a pretty good sense of what the capital is and the frequency associated therewith. We don't know exactly when the capacity is going to stop. That is what's happening that's making this challenging for us is that the increased density, the increased number of wells per spacing unit is increasing dramatically, seemingly quarter-by-quarter. And when you look at current density levels being at about 14, roughly 14 wells per spacing unit, that's compared to maybe 3, 4, 5 or 6 several months ago, that has a tremendous impact on your volume forecast. It makes it difficult to figure out where the top side of this thing can be. We have also heard, increased density to as many as 30-plus wells per spacing unit. Although, we've not assumed that in our economics. And certainly, we have a very large acreage dedication inventory, if you will. That is we got a lot of acres under dedication there. They're continuing to grow. So it makes that really challenging, John, I wish I could tell you an exact figure of what it's going to take to get to that point, because it may take more. If I gave you a number, I might determine 3 months from now, it's going to take a lot more. And certainly, that's a good problem to have for a midstream company.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So it sounds like you're capturing a very large share in this regard. I mean, would it fair -- and you've just announced these recent projects yet, and this is to Carl's question, you've not expanded your backlog under consideration, the $3 billion to $4 billion at all, but it sounds like potentially, there's upward pressure on that. Is that the right way to think about it?","Terry K. Spencer","Absolutely.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. So I guess, would it be safe to say this whole flaring issue you're talking many billions of dollars, and is it fair to say, you expect to get maybe half of that business, or just -- if you can just give us an idea share-wise how you think about it?","Terry K. Spencer","Sure. At least half, okay? When you look at the -- you look at our footprint within our footprint, we've got 5 million to 6 million acres that our asset footprint touches. We've got 3 million acres under dedication. When you look at kind of our share of the field within our reach, 50% is a pretty good number right now. And as we continue to put these larger processing plants in, that percentage will likely grow.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. All right, just -- and then just switching gears. I wanted to make sure I understood your comment about, what the optimization margin expectation is now. I mean, I think back at your Analyst Day, I think you're projecting for '14, I think it was something like $0.07 and...","Terry K. Spencer","That's correct.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And what's the expectation now?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, for the balance of the year, about $0.03 to $0.05 a gallon, on the ethane differential. As we look out further into 2015, 2016 timeframe, we're thinking $0.05 to $0.06, so we're tampering our thoughts on that a bit. So did that help you?","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that's really helpful. And then just lastly, you're speaking, and again, I think this was Carl's question, but as far as, I guess, kind of the ramp on your volumes offset by margin, how -- in terms of the return on those -- on your projects, given how I think you said you're getting more at the heavy end of the barrel where the margin is higher, so is your overall return relatively unchanged? How should we think about that?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, as I said earlier, in the earlier question, our returns are still within that 5 to 7x. Commodity prices have affected that particularly with these POP contracts to some extent, but they're still within that -- they're still comfortably within that range. What's happening -- what effects returns as well as margin is volume, okay? And the volumes continued to perform. We continue to build incremental gathering facilities in addition to these plants at lower cost. So I think to some extent, we've offset some of that impact from commodity pricing, lower commodity pricing.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so you're -- just because the volumes are ramping a little slower because of the mix, you're not really seeing significant return erosion? You're still within your...","Terry K. Spencer","We're still within that range. The other thing -- the other comment I'll make, John, is when we look at the returns on these gathering and processing investments in the Bakken, you got to remember too that we're bringing NGLs down, our NGL infrastructure, okay? And what happens is sometimes, we require -- it requires incremental capital to get those NGLs to market. And sometimes, for some periods of time, it won't. So the returns that you earn collectively when you combine the gathering and processing operation with the NGL investments, you get great returns. Do you follow me?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on some of the volumetric questions you made during prepared remarks. Carl asked about the fourth quarter expectation on the frac side. I wanted to touch base really quickly on your hedge percentages for NGLs came down in the last update with no real change to the absolute hedge position, so obviously, it implies some higher numbers in the back half. Just wondering how that sort of dovetails with the full year guidance that you gave for gathering and process volumes. Did you take those, did I miss it or did those figures go up?","Terry K. Spencer","Chris, I'm going to let Rob take that question.","Robert F. Martinovich","Chris, yes, we are expecting, at this point, a stronger second half than we had a couple of months ago. We expect to, from a processing volume standpoint, beat our guidance. At this point in time. And so as a result, you did see the percentage hedge reduce.","Terry K. Spencer","And Chris, of course, obviously that percentage hedged is now in that 57% range on the NGLs, we will look for opportunities to hedge as we move through the back half of the year.","Robert F. Martinovich","Exactly.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Well, that also brings me to the next question, Terry. Which is how do you guys think given the NGL market today across all the products, clearly taking into account what you guys have said about the light end products in the past, but how do you think about sort of the window in the '15 or even beginning to look into '16, on any of that hedging behavior. Is that -- are you finding any opportunities that are attractive at this moment in time? Or is it just going to be sort of a real-time opportunistic behavior?","Terry K. Spencer","Chris, it'll be opportunistic. We don't have anything right now at this 10 seconds, but yes, certainly we're looking at it every day. Hard.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so, historically, Terry, thinking about how much you guys were hedging, is the general goal going forward is still sort of get up to those levels as we enter any given period of time? Or are you comfortable running a little bit less hedged now given your internal view of the market?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, we -- actually this -- as you move into the later part of the year, we get a little more comfortable with our volumes. And then so we -- so as we move into the year, our tendency -- or as we move through the year, our tendency would be to get more hedged, okay? But we're -- the market today has limited opportunities for us. And like I said -- but it can change in a hurry. And we'll continue to use this opportunistic strategy, which gravitates around a 75% hedged across the board strategy, okay? So -- and it's not -- that's not real prescriptive and hard and fast. We have at times gotten above the 75%. Like I said, as we move later into the year and get more confident in our volumes, so I hope that helps.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, it does, it does. I want to switch gears, really quickly, Terry, a lot of questions on infrastructure opportunities. And obviously, we've seen additional build-out in the Bakken. You alluded to some more potentially coming with board approval by the end of the year. And so I'm just curious how we think about NGL take away capacity from the basin? Clearly, you have the NGL line today and you're doing expansion on it, but as we think out beyond that, just remind me, does that system have the capacity be expanded further? Or would we -- would additional takeaway above this expansions entail an entirely new system?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Chris, the short answer is, yes. It is expandable. We've done some expansion and some expansion projects are underway. And if necessary, more to come. I'll let Sheridan talk, give you a little more color on how we would expand those facilities.","Sheridan C. Swords","Basically, the last expansion that we did--let me back up--the first expansion, you saw we put intermediate pump stations in. The next expansion, we started loops on the pipeline, so any further expansions of the pipeline will continue to extend a loop, meaning that we're laying a line right next to the original line and tying it in, that we need more capacity, we'll continue to extend those loops to be able to get the right amount of capacity on the Bakken Pipeline.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So those adds sharing to be smaller in size, or just more incremental?","Sheridan C. Swords","Yes. The investment will be smaller in size than building a brand-new system. Now eventually, as you extend loops, you'll have a new system when you finish them all, but you do it incrementally, a little bit at a time.","Robert F. Martinovich","Just for -- from a numbers standpoint, were the pumps that Sheridan talked about gives us up to 135,000 barrels a day and that initial looping, up to 160,000.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right, okay. And then the final question, Sheridan, you have talked about reconfiguration of the Sterling systems. And I just want to confirm, I think, it was my belief Sterling I was the only one capable of going south to north. Is that accurate?","Sheridan C. Swords","That's correct.","Operator","We next move to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just looking at your guidance for the year. There seems to be a strong ramp-up in second half '14 EBITDA. And I was wondering, if you could provide just a bit more granularity on what's driving the ramp on an asset basis, if that's possible with which projects? And what's the shape of that ramp could look like between 3Q and 4Q?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Jeremy, I'm just going to just tell you, the short answer, it's all about volume. And Rob will give you a whole lot more color than that, I'm sure.","Robert F. Martinovich","Let's start, I guess with -- from a pipe standpoint and just kind of go segment by segment, I mean, obviously, we had a great first quarter with regards to the maximizing our assets during the severe winter with regards to park-and-loan, as did our equity interest in northern border. And so we've been able to keep that and that segment has continued to perform well as noted in the second quarter, and we expect that to continue going forward the balance of the year. So we certainly expect to keep those gains. While G&P--while the rest of the industry got stung a little bit on the outset side of that severe weather from a volumetric standpoint, again, we're emphasizing on what we said earlier, the second half of the year with those facilities coming on early with the continued strong volumes that we're seeing in the Mid-Continent, that facilities coming on earlier in the Bakken, that's giving us pretty strong indications that overall, volumes for the year are going to be stronger than what we guided to. And as a result, that's where we're going to see the benefits in the second half of the year. And as -- so that's the G&P. So obviously, expecting both those to continue to perform strongly for the year. From an NGL standpoint, while volumes are down where we thought we would be at the beginning of the year, certainly, we don't want anyone lose sight of the great first quarter with regards to, again, maximizing our assets to get propane to the Midwest market and the other opportunities have to continue to come along. Isomerization spreads, certainly were strong this quarter. The guys are doing all the, as Terry alluded, very complicated business, but they're doing a lot of things, maximizing our system, again, to take us the opportunity where spreads are. So while volumes, overall are down, we do have some better margins that are accounted for in that volume being off, as well as some additional volumes are mitigated with take-or-pay or ship-or-pay contracts as well. So net-net, that kind of where we see the 3 segments with GMP and pipes being up and then NGL being slightly down, but overall, that's the reason that Terry commented that we are reaffirming guidance for the year.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. When thinking about future growth, CapEx potential, I was wondering how much of the opportunity set resides, kind of in your existing footprint in particular, the Bakken, the mid Conway, you keep having lots of nice projects materializing. And how much of a focus is there on expanding the platform into new basins or growing a position there such as the Niobrara or entering the Permian, just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that trade-off.","Terry K. Spencer","Well, we -- as we said before, we're continually looking for opportunity to expand our footprint work where it makes sense and where we can utilize, in particular, our existing assets to enhance any competitive advantage getting into those areas. So yes, we continued to look. The Permian, certainly, as I've said many times in the past, is an area of focus for us. It\u2019s a target-rich environment in terms of production and it's underserved in some areas. So yes, we're going to continue to expand or at least look to expand outside our footprint. The Niobrara, of course, is one as you've mentioned, one that where things are going very well for us. We continue to contract more and more acreage dedications and enhance our contractual footprint there and the capital spending is coming. So yes, that's kind of the -- that's kind of how we look at it. Yes, we really would like to have another platform, well it be like -- whether it's for crude oil as I've mentioned before or perhaps it's gathering and processing and NGLs and in another region, perhaps the Permian, certainly, that'd be very attractive to us.","Operator","Next we'll take Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","So piggybacking a little on Carl's initial growth CapEx question and a number of the others, despite the $1.1 billion of incremental growth CapEx announced in recent weeks and the implicit increase in unannounced backlog, you're not getting much respect this morning at OKS in the market. Can you give some color around the pace of the timing of this $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental announcements, besides, the Bakken processing that will likely be disclosed by year end?","Terry K. Spencer","Sure. I mean, I think, what we can tell you as far as that capital backlog, we haven't provided specific timing associated with it, but generally speaking, it takes a couple of years to build these -- most of these projects, these plants and these pipelines. So I think if I were trying to make a swag at it, in terms of timing associated with that capital, certainly most of it would be spent over the next couple of years.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So you think most of that $3 billion to $4 billion would be announced in the next 6 to 9 months?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes. It would actually be announced -- well, yes, if you -- if it's going to spend -- if the spend rate is a couple of years, it takes you a couple of years to spend it, you're probably going to announce most of these projects in the next 12 months or so. But yes, I think that's fair.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, that's very helpful. And Terry, expanding on your ethane commentary and John's optimization question, the roughly $0.05 spread in outlook for '15 and '16 seems much more sober than I think what you all were talking about just last quarter. I don't know if Sheridan wants to respond to this more, but while delays in downstream projects like isomer are, obviously, having a near-term impact, what exactly are the catalyst you're seeing out 1 to 2 years that are making it a little more sober?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, certainly, I just at a high-level, what I can tell you is supply. Growth continues to be very strong and it's coming actually from a lot of different areas like the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. And of course, in our core areas, the supply continues to grow. So I can -- I'll let Sheridan provide you, perhaps a bit more color, at least his thoughts on that.","Sheridan C. Swords","Well, the other thing is, you have as is within '15, '16, you get in the end of '16 '17s, when the new big crackers come online. So you're kind of in this -- we think you're kind of in the situation you are today through those next 2 months -- next 2 years. Obviously, guys have heard some other plants that have been down longer than anticipated for both planned and unplanned outages have built ethane inventories higher than we anticipated at this time, and we think that's going to have a little bit of a drag into the next 2 years.","Terry K. Spencer","I think, its correct too, the other comments that I'll make is, there's been a lot of talk about ethane export facilities. And so, that the timing associated with those is not immediate. So they're still a year plus away. I think the other thing that you have working against you is the view, maybe that natural gas prices are going to stay fairly weak over this time frame, as well. So that will have a -- that will kind of have a drag down effect on your ethane prices.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. That makes some sense. And, Rob, I think you mentioned how the isomerization volumes were pretty good in the quarter, obviously, in the press release, there was some nice uptick in that margin. Do you see this as a seasonal optimization benefit or something that's really kind of a sustainable trend that we can see each year?","Robert F. Martinovich","I mean, historically, it's you would call it seasonal, Craig. I think there is some things as far as where that supply was coming from this year versus in past years, where it's been more focused on a Mid-Continent supply, so that's where we got the benefit from that standpoint.","Terry K. Spencer","Sheridan, you got anything to add?","Sheridan C. Swords","Yes, we're seeing a little bit more demand this year during the, what we call the driving season in the unleaded market. That is continuing over a period of time that we haven't seen in the past. Our customers are demanding more from us out of the Mid-Continent than they have in the past. And that could continue to go forward, but we don't -- it's still a seasonal spread opportunity asset.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Fair enough. And last question, I don't know if this is just beating Bakken growth into the ground, but the implicit guidance on well-connects, I think, is like 710 in the second half versus 590 in the first half and 560 last year for the second half, if I'm doing my math right. Do you see, I mean, when you talk to your producer customers, if you're able to stay ahead of their activity, do you see this growth trend continuing without any interruption? Is there a steady-state at some point in terms of total number per quarter that we should think about?","Robert F. Martinovich","Craig, I guess, certainly, we're into the period now where from a overall construction and specifically well-connects, July and August have historically been our industry's high watermarks. I mean, you're making a lot of hate now from that perspective. So those typically peak. And as you get into the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter, depending on whether, that tends to slow you down. So again, somewhere to the overall volume standpoint with the first quarter, severe weather that puts you a little bit behind where you thought, where you thought you might be. But at the end of the day, our well-connects aren't really ratable over the year because of just the seasons that we have. But overall, from a growth standpoint, again, when you, again, step-back from a growth, to support those volumes, they're going to be continued number of connects. Now obviously, as we go to the multi-well pads, you're laying one well in and as Terry said, as those number of wells per spacing unit continue to increase, you're going to benefit from that. But at the end of the day, the number of wells ultimately, that you're able to handle is going to continue to grow because that's supporting this ultimate volume growth that you're seeing from third parties that's just continuing to ramp up to the right pretty strong.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Helen Ryoo with Barclays.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of questions. Starting with the new Bakken project. It looks like the cost is like 80% of the plant is 80% higher than the Knox plant, although the related infrastructure cost is pretty much consistent and just wondering the higher construction cost for the plant, does this reflect maybe cost inflation in that area? And then as a follow-up to that is, if it's more expensive to build a G&P system up in Bakken versus other region, are midstream operators in general, able to charge more to compensate for the sort of the high-cost up there?","Terry K. Spencer","Helen, I'm going to let Wesley Christensen answer that question.","Wesley John Christensen","We have seen some upward pressure for cost for building plants and infrastructure in the Bakken area. It's primarily related to labor cost, that's have escalated in the area. As far as it goes with the equipment and supply associated with it, we're not seeing upward pressure as much on that, but we are seeing some scheduled impacts.","Robert F. Martinovich","And then, Helen, from a standpoint of margins, I mean, margins in the Bakken are stronger than the Mid-Continent. I don't want to say that, that's necessarily the reason for the cost that you charge more, but I mean, historically, they have been stronger.","Terry K. Spencer","I guess, one thing I'll add to this, Wes, you could add to it if you don't hear -- if you don't agree with what I'm saying. If you look at a plant, you build a 200 million a day plant in the Bakken versus a 200 million a day plant in Oklahoma, those are not the same plants, okay? The processing plant in the Bakken is designed to operate in extremely hostile conditions. And so, a lot of measures have to be taken in the design of that plant, okay? So I mean, that's a factor in the difference of some of these costs. And, of course, the richness of the gas is hugely significant in the design of these plants. It's basically, the NGL content sets the size of many of these towers that are used in the processing and facilities, so -- and the size of liquid pumps and what have you. Whether it's getting near to that.","Wesley John Christensen","That's true, Terry, that's true. And they're also -- there is additional infrastructure related to stabilizers and handling the inlet condensate because of the richness as well.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, it appears that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Ziola","Thank you and welcome to ONEOK's third quarter earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always we appreciate your continued interest in investment in ONEOK.","Joining me today's call are Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","Before I hand the call over and I have a few brief opening remarks. I am going to start up by saying how much I appreciate the efforts of our employees who personally endured Hurricane Harvey, employees at our Mont Belvieu area facility and countless others at our company work tirelessly to keep our assets running safely in order to provide needed services to our customers. I am very proud of them. And as expected, their dedication and commitment to this company continuous to be nothing shorter remarkable.","I should also mention that the swift recovery of the Mont Belvieu infrastructure following Harvey would not have been possible without the hard work and cooperation of many of our industry peers, customers, service providers and local governments. Many thanks to them.","I also wanted to extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims, their families and all effected by the senseless tragedy that occurred in New York City yesterday afternoon. The city and its people once again prove its courage and resolves as it copes with this tragic event.","Moving on to our third quarter performance, building off our second quarter results. Third quarter performance was strong benefiting from natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth and higher transportation revenues in our natural gas pipeline segment. These results demonstrate that we are well on our way to achieving our 2017 guidance.","As we stand today compared to a year ago, rig counts have increased in the states we served by 70%, driven primarily by technological advances in drilling which has made exploration more effective, more efficient and production more prolific. We are seeing petrochemical facilities and ethane cracker coming online and expect two more to startup in the next several months. The industry has been anticipating these startups for several years and now we are beginning to see real demand for ethane, which Kevin will discuss more in a moment.","We're also hearing from customers about the next wave of petrochemical facilities to be designed and built on the Gulf Coast. I mention this because it's important to point out the energy industry is once again proving its resiliency and its adaptability to the market place. I believe ONEOK has played a big part in that by continuing to invest capital to aggregate supply and deliver it to the markets.","We are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers today and we are committed to continue investing in and around our assets to meet their needs into the future.","With that I will now turn the call over to Walt.","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $517 million compared with $462 million in the second quarter 2017. The 12% increase primarily driven by natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth. As noted in our earnings release, third quarter results included approximately $20 million in non-cash impairment charge related to non-strategic assets and equity investments in our G&P segment which impacted third quarter earnings per share by $0.03. We estimate that without the disruption of Hurricane Harvey, the NGL segment's earnings would have been approximately $4.5 million higher for the quarter or $0.01 per share.","Last week, we announced our quarterly dividend of 74.5 cents per share or $2.98 per share on an annualized basis unchanged from the previous quarter when we increased the dividend by 21%. Dividend coverage was healthy 1.3 times for the quarter. Management still expects to recommend annual dividend increases of approximately 9% to 11% beginning in 2018 and annual dividend coverage of 1.2 times or greater.","Since June, we've announced nearly $0.5 billion in attractive, low multiple growth projects supported by commitments from anchor customers. In September and October, we issued 3.3 million shares through our ATM equity program resulting a net proceeds of $184 million.","The proceeds of these issuance along with gas generated in excess of dividends support these recently announced high return projects as we prudently manage our balance sheet.","We continue to see opportunities to make attractive investments supported by customer commitments. To the extent that we make additional future investments, the ATM will be one of the tools available to fund future growth.","ONEOK's trailing 12 month GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved again to 4.9 times at September 30. Our annualized third quarter GAAP debt-to-EBITDA run rate was 4.6 times. We continue to expect leverage to be around our target of 4 times or less by late 2018 or early 2019.","We continue to proactively manage our balance sheet. We repaid $1 billion in its outstanding debt in July and September combined and completed a $1.2 billion senior notes offering in July, essentially extending the term of the debt at a very attractive rates. We are well positioned with ample liquidity to effectively manage our debt maturities and continue to finance growth investments.","As it relates to review of rates on West Texas LPG, in late September, the Administrative Law Judge provided its findings to the Railroad Commission of Texas, which the commissioners may expect, modify or remand for further preceding. There is no deadline for them to take action. That we anticipate the commissioners may consider the findings in any exceptions filed by the parties this December.","Regardless of the outcome, we do not expect the Railroad Commission's decision to have a material impact on our financial results. They will also not impact our current our future negotiated rates on West Texas LPG. [indiscernible] our ability to secure new NGL supply from producers and processors. As noted by our recently announcement to expand into the heart of the Delaware Basin.","In yesterday's earnings announcement, we maintained our 2017 guidance outlook which was updated last quarter to reflect the completion of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction. We expect to announce 2018 guidance sometime after the first of the year. Please refer to our news release, investor presentation and 10-Q filing for additional details on the quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt. Starting with our natural gas liquids segments. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% compared with the second quarter 2017 including the impact from Hurricane Harvey which lowered our EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. We sustain mills significant damage to our facilities but experienced reduced volumes due to industry downtime and increased operating cost following the hurricane. We essentially realized no benefit from optimization directly related to the hurricane.","As we look forward, we had seen wider spreads so far early in the fourth quarter. NGL volumes gathered averaged approximately 812,000 barrels per day, a 5,000 barrels per day increase compared with the second quarter 2017. Higher Mid-Continent volumes and higher volumes on our West Texas LPG pipeline drove the increase. Volume on Bakken NGL pipeline decreased slightly from the second quarter due primarily to plan maintenance activities at our Garden Creek and Grassland's natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin and planned maintenance on the Overland Pass Pipeline.","As we discussed previously, our Bakken NGL pipeline can run above its nameplate capacity of 135,000 barrels per day and through October, volumes had return to levels at or above what we experienced in the second quarter. We continue monitoring producer customer activity as well as the current utilization of Overland Pass Pipeline and are evaluating our options to provide additional capacity out of the region.","Third quarter NGL volumes fractionated were down slightly compared with the second quarter 2017, primarily impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Volumes that were unable to be fractionated during the third quarter were stored and will be fractionated in either the fourth quarter of 2017 or first quarter 2018.","Ethane rejection levels on our NGL systems remained relatively unchanged in the third quarter 2017 averaging more than 150,000 barrels per day similar to second quarter levels. As multiple, petrochemical facilities are expected to come online in the next few months, we continue to expect ethane recovery levels to fluctuate in the fourth quarter and into early 2018 as the startups occur.","As we have moved into the fourth quarter, we had seen a significant increase in our gathered volumes. In October, we exceeded 900,000 barrels per day on numerous days. The increase in a combination of volume growth of overall raw feed and additional ethane that is being recovered.","For the natural gas gathering and processing segment, third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased to 11% compared with the second quarter 2017. With the segment once again posting solid volume growth in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas.","In the Williston Basin, volumes processed again established new highs with an average of more than 840 million cubic feet per day during the quarter. Despite plan maintenance act some of our processing facilities and the maintenance on Overland Pass Pipeline.","Mid-Continent volumes averaged more than 740 million cubic feet per day, an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2017.","Rigs remained steady across our acreage with approximately 30 rigs operating on a dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin and approximately 15 rigs on a dedicated acreage in the STACK and SCOOP areas combined.","In the Williston Basin, we connected 130 wells during the third quarter for a total of 313 through the first nine months of the year, well on our way to completing our target of 400 in 2017. We now estimate the drilled but uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage increased between 350 to 400, compared with 300 previously. We continue hearing of improved efficiencies across the basin including indications between 10% and 15% productivity improvements in wells completed in 2017 compared with 2016.","At current rig activity levels, in addition to inventories in the basin, we expect continued volume growth into 2018.","Growth in the Mid-Continent continues as well. We connected 35 wells in the Mid-Continent during the third quarter and it connected 76 through the first nine months of the year, well on track to reach our target of 100 by the end of the year.","The segment's average fee rate was $0.86 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2017 compared with $0.76 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2016, a 13% increase which was driven primarily by increased volumes on contracts where we received higher fees. We still expect the segment's average fee rate to be approximately $0.85 to all of 2017.","In the natural gas pipeline segment, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% in the third quarter 2017 and 13% through the first nine months of the year compared with the same periods in 2016. The segment continues to benefit from high fee based earnings and increased transportation capacity contracted.","We continue discussions with producers and markets to develop long term natural gas take away solutions across our footprint especially out of the Permian Basin where we had a long standing asset position with our West Texas Pipeline system and recently our joint venture Road Runner pipelines.","As Walt discussed, we've announced nearly $0.5 billion of capital growth projects with the most recent being the $200 million expansion of the West Texas LPG pipeline into prolific Delaware Basin, one of the fastest growing plays in the U.S. The project is supported by long term dedicated NGL production from two third party natural gas processing plants which we estimate will produce up to 40,000 barrels per day. The project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018. Fees on this project are negotiated bundled rates at market based transportation and fractionation rates.","Because this is an extension and expansion of an existing pipeline asset, we expect EBITDA multiples to be in the four to six times range better than our typical five to seven times. Additionally, the lateral is sized to allow for future growth beyond the initial two plants. We continue to discuss opportunities with numerous customers in the Delaware regarding potential contracts with more than ten new processing plants in the area.","Terry that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thanks Kevin. I have just a couple of closing comments as it relates to our future growth projects before we take your questions. Following the West Texas LPG expansion announcement, we still continue to develop our unannounced inventory of potential capital growth projects. We've updated that inventory which is now between 2.5 billion and 3.5 billion compared with 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion previously. This inventory remains heavily focused on NGL infrastructure which we anticipate could be announced between now and 2020.","We are expanding our existing businesses and continuing to focus on deploying capital prudently at attractive returns and in ways that will create value for our customers and investors.","Finally I want to once again thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and their commitment to safe operations, our customers and the communities we operated in.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shneur Gershuni from UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good morning, guys.","Terry Spencer","Good morning.","Shneur Gershuni","Just a couple of questions. Just to start off, I was wondering if you can talk about your CapEx funding strategy going forward, you tap the ATM this past quarter and I'm trying to understand is it more because you were during a blackout during the merger process and needed to get leverage in line post close and no longer expect to use it and use retain DCF or alternatively do you continue to plan using the ATM as a primary source of funding?","Walter Hulse","Fortunately, there was no relation to the period of time between the announcement of merger and the closing of the merger. I think it's important to note that we've announced this 500 million or so of new growth projects since June and we wanted to use the ATM to make sure that we funded those because they were in addition to the CapEx that we had previously been discussing. So it was more of a getting ahead of the game and making sure that as we look at forward growth projects, we maintain a very strong balance sheet.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And then secondly, the 500 million of identified CapEx for 2018, are there any other projects that you're very close to approving or moving forward with that could take the number materially in 2108 or is that kind of the run rate we should be thinking about?","Terry Spencer","Well, I think you should always - this is Terry. I think you should always think about that, got this base run rate of kind of routine growth but we're continually working this backlog of new projects. And as contractual commitments and anchor customers come together, certainly we'll go forward and take those projects to our board. So we've got a number of projects that are in various stages of development, as those things those things mature like we've always said, we will not only - once we get those approve, our board will certainly go public with those.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And final question, you've had this forecast out there for dividend growth around the 10% range for several years going forward. How much capital you need to be investing in to achieve that growth rate over the next couple of years? Is it a couple 100 million, is it more you're running at last just kind of wondering what the cadence to being able to achieve that growth rate, operating leverage versus needing to invest capital?","Walter Hulse","Sure Shneur. This is Walt. The dividend growth rate that was previously announced was supported by base growth CapEx in line with the past couple of years. New projects enhance these cash flows and will produce more free cash flow to reinvest in our business and maintain our strong balance sheet.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Walter Hulse","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet, JP Morgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning.","Jeremy Tonet","Terry, just want to pick up on one of your last comments there with regard to the upsize in the kind of growth project up evaluation last going up to 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion there. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what specifically is driving that what's changed, sounds like this NGL pipeline is part of the driver there. But is there any more you can share as far as what basins or anything else in the market that evolve that you guys see as better opportunities now?","Terry Spencer","Well, so certainly Jeremy at that at a high level what we're seeing certainly is core in NGL growth in the basin that we operate certainly in the Williston Basin we continue to grow. Their prospects as Kevin mentioned on the call, on his call remarks rather look great and continue to see strong development STACK and SCOOP. And certainly this recent announcement of West Texas is certainly an indicator of the opportunity that's in front of us there. So the bulk of the CapEx this increased CapEx in this unannounced backlog is going to be in the NGL segment and it will be in the form of pipeline loops, pumps, pipeline, infrastructure, potentially fractionation capacity that could be some storage in there possibly. So projects of that nature primarily what they consists of.","Kevin, you got anything that you could add to that?","Kevin Burdick","Just growth of our existing again significant growth of existing assets.","Jeremy Tonet","That makes sense. Thanks. And then just another question on funding growth CapEx going forward, there's been kind of an increase use of hybrid securities out there and wondering how you think those STACK on versus the ATM when you walk into you know minimize dilution for future growth?","Terry Spencer","Well, of course we will look at every opportunity that we have to fund the business going forward. We're pleased to be in a position with a very strong investment grade balance sheet and traditional capital access is something that we enjoy and it would probably be where we would lean more towards. But we'll say though that price of everything that's in the marketplace and evaluate whether as it fit into our cap structure or not.","Jeremy Tonet","Got it. Thanks. And then just looking at the STACK and SCOOP, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the dynamics there, it seems like STACK continues to have good opportunities moving forward the Canadian value there and knocks seems like it still on the back burner at this point, I was wondering if you could share any more on what you see there?","Terry Spencer","Kevin can help you there?","Kevin Burdick","Yeah Terry, again we excited about STACK and SCOOP. And I think our volume growth sequential quarter-to-quarters just shows that and just demonstrates some of the potential. On the G&P side, we do have the 200 million a day off load that we've got out there that's expected to be complete by the end of the year, so that's the first tranche of capacity. Then we've also got the Canadian Valley two expansion which we've announced. And beyond that our NGL segment with the footprint we've got in the STACK and the SCOOP there, there's a lot of other additional plants I think they just came out yesterday and announced a new plant that would be under our contract with them. So a lot of activity going on in the STACK and the SCOOP, producers have come out here, in just the last couple calls I've seen and talked about moving to kind of the full development program which just drives the efficiency of the rigs up. And so there's a lot of opportunity for us given our footprint in the STACK.","Jeremy Tonet","Thanks for that. And then just last on the Bakken. On the processing side there, I was just wondered if you could update us and competitive dynamics you see in some other NLPs moving forward processing expansion such as Bear and others and I was just wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts there.","Kevin Burdick","You know with the volumes that we have seen in the Williston, we probably especially as we moved into the third quarter and gotten past some of this maintenance, we're probably - excuse me into the fourth quarter and gotten pass some of the maintenance, we probably have 125 million a day of capacity left. So with the rig activity we're seeing and the well performance that we're seeing then clearly we could see additional processing capacity that we would need.","Jeremy Tonet","Okay. Great. Thanks for that. That's it for me.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi.","Eric Genco","Hey, good morning, guys. I was just wondering what you've been hearing from producer customers in the Williston kind of heading into next year in terms of rig counts activity, you targeting about 400 wells here and 30 rigs it seems like that's about 27 days to complete a well which seems high. So do you expect the rig counts to taper off and if nothing changes is 400 a conservative number going forward or how do you think about all that?","Kevin Burdick","Hi, Eric, this is Kevin. I got some thoughts and Mike Fitzgibbons may have a couple of thoughts as well. But our conversations with the producer customers continue to be very positive. The rig counts have held and we've seen some price strength here over the last few weeks. We see no indications that those rigs are going to back off. So yes if you maintain this activity level at 30 rigs, the 400 would be light as we think about 2018. Not ready to get out there with the guidance yet, we will do that as we as we release our financial guidance. But clearly you're right, the 2017 is high in and so we would expect the well connects to go off in 2018. Mike?","Michael Fitzgibbons","I agree with that. The only thing I will add is we've had a couple of producers announced, they can achieve their volume growth target with less rigs because of the efficiency increases. So we may see a rig or two drop, but we're still seeing very productive wealth and forecast of volume growth from those rigs.","Eric Genco","Great. And just one quick follow-up. I'm curious as you look out at the - I think it's sort of asked in couple different angles, but you got the 485 million to 495 million of projects since June and 40 million that is finished in 2017, sort of I guess the rest is overwhelmingly in 2018. Do you expect your overall debt balance, you debt today is at quarter end was around 9.5 billion, do you expect that to drop or do you meaningfully at all or do you think it hangs in there maybe drifts off a little as you have the EBITDA growth that sort of gets to the year leverage target?","Kevin Burdick","Well, we're not going to give specific guidance 2018, but I would say that we do expect to have significant EBITDA growth that will help those levers statistics along in the most dramatic fashion.","Eric Genco","Okay. So 9.5 billion is of net that is that - do you see it materially dropping over the course of the next year or no?","Kevin Burdick","I think given level of our CapEx, we expect to see our deleveraging come more from the increase in EBITDA than a drop in that.","Eric Genco","All right. Thank you.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital.","Danilo Juvane","Good morning, everyone.","Terry Spencer","Good morning.","Danilo Juvane","I was looking at the - I want to go back to 2017 guidance. The G&P segment specifically the wave how strong the gathering perform this year would imply decline in 4Q, just to get to the high end of the guidance range there. So is seems that you've been a little bit conservative but not raising guidance in my opinion. Is there any other assets that we should be thinking about whether there be related to Harvey or maybe some of the ethane volumes that you had baked into your forecast they're going to be late end because of the outages in the Gulf Coast?","Terry Spencer","No, I mean specific to your question about G&P, yeah when you do that math that where you get to. The one dynamic that we always at least consider as we're thinking about the fourth quarter for gathering and processing is weather, especially when you look at the month of December, we do historically see a little bit of a pullback of our volumes. So we do factor that in. I don't think we see any lingering effects related to Harvey from our business. As we've talked about we've seen it transitioning a little bit just overall we talk about the volume growth we have seen in October in our NGL segment. Clearly a decent chunk of that volume growth would be ethane which would since signaled that the ethane recovery story starting a little bit. So that's - I mean that's how I would frame up kind of how we're thinking about guidance in still holding that firm.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks for that. And then with respect to growth CapEx, I think the previous guidance was $500 million for the year, thus far we've paid I think $250 million, so should we expect a big chunk in 4Q here or is that going to extend over into 2018?","Terry Spencer","Yeah, we will - I mean yeah with that with the recent announcements obviously we're getting - we're hot and heavy into the construction on those projects that we've announced, so you would see that capital ramp up in the Q4.","Danilo Juvane","Okay. Thank you, those are my questions.","Terry Spencer","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brian Zarin [ph] with [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","On the West Texas expansion project, could you elaborate a bit on the volume assumption on 4 to 6 times multiple expectation?","Terry Spencer","Sure. As we think about those the - up to 40,000 barrels a day, it goes room service on the back half of 2018, we would expect that volume to ramp up maybe over a year to two, past in service date.","Kevin Burdick","Right, within two years, we should be at or above 40,000.","Unidentified Analyst","So the 4 to 6 time multiple the same as around 40,000 barrels a day volume?","Terry Spencer","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then on those new barrels, what type of fractionation opportunities are there potential with those go to third parties?","Terry Spencer","Well the 40,000 that we referenced in the press release, we do have a bundle of service with them. We will be fracing those barrels. So it's a total package deal for us. The pipeline does give us the opportunities, we talk to more people to bring more volume on that and fractionated as well at or below multiples that we will see on this project.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Just to summarize the 4 to 6 times multiple expectation seems about 40,000 barrels a day of volumes including now fractionation fees?","Terry Spencer","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's helpful. And then obviously have excess capacity, how do you view the competitive landscape in the Permian for NGL take away increase the utilization of the expansion?","Sheridan Swords","Brian, this is Sheridan. It's a very competitive landscape out there, but as we've said before with have an existing pipeline that we can incrementally add capacity to it to dial in to what the customer actually needs. We can do it much cheaper and faster than other pipelines, brand new pipelines that are coming in there. So we see ourselves being very competitive. And with this new expansion in here, we get this us into position that we can compete even better for these Delaware barrels.","And we have been talked to multiple producers and processors out there in the short term before we announced this. And after we announced this, we've even had more come to us and want to get on this pipeline, we want to talk this about. So we're very excited what this bring to us and very excited about seeing more expansions come out.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And for updates on the expansion, so obviously a lot of focus on your organic opportunities. As we moved into 2018, how do you see M&A playing overall in your growth?","Terry Spencer","Well, certainly in our thinking we don't have any M&A factored in but we're always going to be thinking about those opportunities and certainly we've got a strong currency to work with, certainly, financially sound company. But I can tell you what our focus will be heavily organic and any M&A whether it's a bolt on asset or whether it's something even broader from a strategic perspective will certainly just be an opportunistic approach. So heavy organic will be the key strategy, key focus for 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you, Terry.","Operator","And our next question will come from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Hey, good morning.","Terry Spencer","Hey Michael.","Michael Blum","Just one more question on West Texas the new pipeline project. I think you mentioned you're also be expanding the existing system, how much - if that's correct, how much you also expanding that by?","Terry Spencer","Michael, we expanded by equally amount of 40,000.","Michael Blum","Okay. So I guess since the extension line is 110, as you move above that 40,000 on the extension line, so that imply that you have to then probably further expand the mainline and I guess what is the capability to do that?","Sheridan Swords","Michael, you're exactly right that you will have to continue to expand the mainline that's when we get into we can expand and spend that capital on the mainland as we get the commitments on the lateral coming in there. So we don't have to spend it all upfront, we can incremental life that capital in there. And as I said we expect those projects that we're working on now to expand the mainline to bring more volume in on the lateral will be in at or better than the 4 to 6 times that the original one is. We did put some upfront capital in there to put a bigger piece of pipe in the ground, so that we are better able to compete in the Delaware.","Michael Blum","Okay. And then my other question was just this on the cadence of dividend increases as you go out in time, are you planning to do like one dividend increase per year or you planning to do every quarter, what's thought there?","Walt Hulse","Well, Michael, obviously the board will address that on a quarterly basis, but our expectation would be to be in line with the past practice and most likely look at the quarterly and the board will evaluate the facts and circumstances each quarter and then act accordingly.","Michael Blum","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tom Abrams with Morgan Stanley.","Tom Abrams","Thanks. What's left here, G&P strong margins in the quarter, can you just break that down a little bit on how much you might attribute in NGL prices and spreads versus fees?","Kevin Burdick","Tom, this is Kevin. Yeah, it's again, we converted so much of our through the contract restructuring, we've moved so much of the commodity exposure to fee, it is primarily fee and when you combine that with our hedge position for 2017, virtually all that is just volume growth with the fee increase.","Tom Abrams","Good. And then on the distribution, last question, not so much for 2018 but more for 2019, is the philosophy around issuing equity to make a 10% or so distribution growth when you want to strengthen your balance sheet, your capital spending is clearly very strong and the industry itself seems to be moving more toward that mid-single-digit type being acceptable for the larger companies. Just wonder how you've traded off those kinds of dynamics?","Kevin Burdick","Well, we were in a position today were in this particular quarter, we cover the dividend by 1.3 times and we expect to have significant dividend coverage going forward which will give us a lot of excess cash flow to put back into the business and reinvest in the business. We as I said previously, the dividend growth that we had previously guided to was based on kind of the run rate dividend - run rate CapEx that we've been spending over the last couple years. So as we have these lot of multiple projects, we just expect to have even more cash flow to invest in the business going forward.","Tom Abrams","All right. Thanks a lot and great quarter.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","Hi, everyone. I just have a couple of operational questions. The Bakken G&P volumes were up but the NGL pipeline volumes were down sequentially. What went on there, was it just more ethane that was you tested versus last quarter?","Terry Spencer","Yes, Christine, that was primarily around ethane and it also relates to the maintenance activities that we saw at our assets and how we had to move gas around and to continue to process as much of the gas as we possibly could. We did end up projecting more ethane than we had the previous quarter. In addition to that, another dynamic that was going on during the same time is our deethanizer at state line really ramped up during that time period. So the NGLs produced actually went up, but yet the NGLs we were pushing down the pipe went down a little bit.","Christine Cho","So, if the NGL volumes were up but the pipeline volumes were down like where did the incremental NGLs go, do you guys have storage up there?","Terry Spencer","No. it was - again it was primarily ethane that was rejected due to a lot of the maintenance and other activities that were going on. And then the ethane that's going through the deethanizer does end up in markets in Canada as well.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then in your prepared remarks, you alluded to evaluating opportunities for providing additional takeaway out of the Bakken. Your 10-Q says that you're expecting to add capacity to the Bakken NGL line by third quarter of next year. And if you do that, don't you have to expand Overland Pass, I thought that was full, or if there are other alternatives?","Sheridan Swords","Christine. This is Sheridan. Yes, we are looking at the total system both over the past and Bakken pipeline to look at all alternatives to expand it. But you are correct, Overland Pass is full, so any expansion on the Bakken pipeline will have to take into account takeaway from the bottom end and we're looking at all options. But all options to expand that system as we continue to see the robust growth in the Williston.","Christine Cho","And that would have to be looping, I'm assuming?","Sheridan Swords","There's a lot of different options there, it could be looping of the existence system or completely new system.","Christine Cho","I see, okay. And with natural gas production increasing out of the Bakken, is the incremental residue gas still going down northern border, or do you guys have an idea of how much of the gas is going there?","Sheridan Swords","Well, again physically all the gas out of the basin is virtually all of it is ultimately ending up on Northern border that ends up in the Mid-Continent the upper Midwest markets. So how it gets priced is really a separate from an acre prospective is really a little bit, it's a different question. But all the gas and we're confident that with the growth projections we see out there that we will continue to be able to move all the residue out of the region on board.","Christine Cho","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Theodore Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin","Good morning. I just wanted to verify, I think in your prepared remarks you said your NGL gathering volumes are up to 900,000 barrels a day in October, is that right?","Terry Spencer","That's correct.","Theodore Durbin","That's a big pickup versus what you did in third quarter, what's the driver there and can give us a breakdown of whether it's mostly mid corner which is come out of?","Terry Spencer","Well, we're really seeing increasing in all of our regions. We talked about we talked about the Bakken barrels being down and now we're back up to those levels before. Mid-Continent volumes are up as well. A chunk of that is going to be ethane. As we have seen ethane recovery pick up during the month of October. We still think that will fluctuate a little bit when this come online and go through the startup. But again, we've seen some nice volume growth out of all the areas.","Theodore Durbin","And is it fair to say the margins on that additional will be in line the sort of your rules of thumb $0.30 and $0.09 in that $0.03?","Sheridan Swords","This is Sheridan. There will be close. Typically we have a little bit of a breakdown for ethane, a little bit of an incentive, but it's going to be materially in the line of what we've given.","Terry Spencer","Remember a lot of ethane's pipe come on is going to be value based barrel coming out in Mid-Continent which would be at a higher. Then the average rate that we have in our presentation because that has booked Conway and Bellevue and we talk about the Mid-Continent. So probably just slightly higher than that.","Theodore Durbin","So Sheridan, it's fair to say that in many of your contracts, you have a structure slightly lower transportation and frac rate for ethane versus your propane plus?","Sheridan Swords","That's exactly right. But we expect the Bellevue barrels to come out first which would be higher than the Conway price barrels.","Theodore Durbin","Right. Okay that makes a lot of sense and it's really helpful. And then can you talk about the overall returns, I guess blended returns both on the let's call it $500 million of growth CapEx you have announced since June and as we think about that bigger chunk the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, what kind of the EBITDA multiple should we think about for both of those buckets, please?","Walter Hulse","Well, I think you're going to see a lot of those projects in that unannounced backlog are going to be similar to the routine growth that we've seen historically. So you could see a good chunk of this coming in at 4 to 6 times but I think broadly speaking overall some of the larger infrastructure projects that are in that mix are going to be in your 5 to 7 times that we've historically indicated. Is that help you?","Theodore Durbin","Yeah, it's helpful. And then last one for me, just operating costs look like they're up a decent amount here third quarter sort of year-over-year. Is that all just sort of new assets something like the rest of hurricane costs in there, what sort of a good new run rate on op costs or is there anything any kind of onetime items in there?","Walter Hulse","Yeah the op costs are really just more of our growth in dealing with that. Yes, there was a little bit in there for the hurricane but again every quarter typically we will see some one time attributes. But I think that be - it would probably be a decent run rate as we think about going forward.","Theodore Durbin","All right. That's it for me. Thank you.","Walter Hulse","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Shere","October saw another even larger stares step-up in the Conway to Belvieu. How sustainable do you see that could this trend combine with your dividend coverage mitigate the need at ATM as more projects are announced?","Terry Spencer","Well, as we - I mean yes, Craig you're right. We have seen an increase in spreads through the month of October. We do think there's some likelihood that those will kind of maintain for two to three months here or beyond that. On the flip side as our volumes do increase that will reduce a little bit the amount of volume we can actually move on the pipes as we physically are flowing more volume on our assets. So there's a little bit of a give and take there but yes it's nice to have that tailwind of the stronger spreads. Sheridan?","Sheridan Swords","Yeah, I definitely agree. And you are very right, there is more of this ethane, and we talked about more volume growth. We will consume more of the pipeline for fee based business and that will leave less capacity for optimization activities.","Craig Shere","Understood. And with respect to the 200 million was the excess LPG expansion, I guess 116 that's OKE. I think three years ago, the guidance was given that you are hoping to achieve on the original acquisition and you know follow-on this is including maybe 500 million of expected growth CapEx, you are expecting to achieve an all in 6 to 8 times multiple by the end of the decade. It seems like maybe the growth CapEx figures coming well under the 500 million you all envisioned years ago. Do you see that due to efficient but the EBITDA you know expectation would be untacked or how do you see that multiple playing out overtime.","Walter Hulse","Craig, I still thing we still reach that by the end of the decade as we go through especially as we look at all the projects and all the plans that we are looking at right now and how that kind of drills. But we knew it will take us sometime when we bought the assets to get our strategy in place because lot of the plans that are coming on. When we first bough the assets, we are already committed, so we knew we had to wait for the second wave of gas plants have been built that were not committed, and that's where we all right now and we are finding that we can very effectively compete for these gas plants. And so I still think that we will reach that 6 to 8 times by the end of the decade.","Craig Shere","Okay. And one last follow-on. I was under the impression that are original guidance did not corporate any additional upside from associated fractionation, does that continue to be the case and does a 4 to 6 times for 200 million project include or exclude related fractionation?","Walter Hulse","We got to look at it, fractionation is - our fractionation system pulls from all across our assets and then we see growing to the whole things. So it all depends on when those fractionation capacity is needed. As we keep room like this, as Terry mentioned, we will probably end up happened to build more fractionation capacity and we will see the Permian is being able to help support that growth and we will get market rates for that.","Craig Shere","But does that feed into the original multiple expectation for the West Texas acquisition you originally made?","Walter Hulse","The original when we get that originally was more based on just pure cares and not the fractionation piece.","Craig Shere","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hey, good morning, Terry.","Terry Spencer","Hey, good morning, Chris.","Chris Sighinolfi","Last think asked and answered. I appreciate all the color, except two follow-ups I could, there more sort of structure. I was just curious you know Bakken has done quite well this year, obviously the DAPL Pipeline was sitting out there for a long term, had a story history to get into service, but that is and we see a clear bit pricing at Permian, I was wondering your conversation with producer counterparts out there, how much the pipeline actually being in place in the pricing dynamic, if that all is shaping decisions and how long they might - how they see that I guess evolving overtime?","Terry Spencer","I mean obviously with DAPL, it clearly anytime we can provide more pipeline takeaway capacity for crude, it benefits the producers from a reliability perspective and also just a net bag perspective. I mean, we typically hear their net bags are maybe 2 or 3 bucks better than they were before DAPL. So you know that's just increased strength and helping their cash flow to fund more drilling.","Kevin Burdick","Certainly operational reliability has have improved significantly.","Terry Spencer","Absolutely, I mean you know you can look at some of the state and in rail who is really taken it downward trend, so that clearly the pipe is going to be more reliable than rail.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess switching gears probably for share and just this is question to Michael Fitzgibbons. What is your expectation, have your guys looked at what happens with ethylene, polyethylene markets when we bring on this much same cracking capacity in the window of time, I am kind of blind what happens for their downstream and so I am just wondering if you could help us think about the effects of that and maybe what you're customers or are saying and thinking about it and if there's an opportunity for you to spend it on that into it?","Terry Spencer","What I would tell you on what we look at Chris for that we hear from our customers on the polyethylene market, so they think that these crackers are going make ethylene but you're already seeing these companies bring on ethylene to polyethylene units. So you're really talking about where the ethylene is going. In worldwide, with the low cost of feedstock so we have the United States they're all saying the Gulf Coast crackers are much further to the left on the supply stack. So if we would overbuild and the world cannot consume that much polyethylene, you will see more the crackers and more east crackers being shut down, maybe some European crackers a long time before you see the Gulf Coast crackers shutdown. So that's why everybody - that's why you are seeing the next wave of crackers being talked about on the Gulf Coast, because this is the most advantage place today to build crackers due to the cost to feed stocks.","Chris Sighinolfi","So the multiyear view then is I guess if I were to paraphrase, it is something similar to what we've seen with other our hydrocarbons where U.S. markets simply because of advantage cost structure pushes out higher costs like globally and so we're basically going to make inroads via exports that's the expectation?","Terry Spencer","That's right. You're exactly right.","Chris Sighinolfi","And if I could, I don't know if you know the answer but are there particular foreign markets we could pay attention to it, maybe get a sense of from where that demand or where that supply competition is going to be most I guess most severe?","Terry Spencer","Well, I think from a demand side, you're going to see the growth from China and India. We also see some from Latin America and maybe a little bit from Europe but China and India are going to be the big movers on the demand side. Competition\u2026","Chris Sighinolfi","No, no that's\u2026","Terry Spencer","You said on a competition for supply. I think it's a big - don't think it's going to affect that is the gas to oil ratio, if you would see oil and gas on the BTU basis come back closer together and it would become more advantage you may see that would I think where you would see on supply. We are seeing, it depends on how you look at supply competition, obviously we are exploiting propane and ethane which are going to crackers that would compete against polyethylene, against our polyethylene this mean produced in United States, but that still pull hydrocarbon through our system and now the United States.","Chris Sighinolfi","Right. And so I guess the next wave, I guess this is the instant question for me is that if we're seeing the next wave of ethylene crackers that talked about to be built domestically. It would seem like that communities making a determination that the facility better exists here then to export the ethane to whatever foreign market there? Is that - I guess is that fair or is there something about the nature of all this and I don't understand?","Terry Spencer","I think it's a combination you're seeing, where we're seeing in most of the people that want to export ethane for cracking or even propane for cracking are really in India and China and I think they want to build their own facilities over there and get advantage of feed stock from United States. The big the - people that are building the next wave of crackers are the ones that built the first wave, they're going to be obviously already heard about the Exxon Mobil Saavik cracker down the Corpus Cristi that's been announced there's and all the other people are also talking about when do they build their next cracker and all of them are saying it's probably going to be in the Gulf Coast.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. Great. I know unrelated to third quarter, but it always good to get your thoughts on market structure over time, so appreciate it.","Terry Spencer","Thanks Chris.","Operator","And that thus conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Terry Spencer","Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Our quite period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until earnings are released after the market closes in late February. Have a great rest of your day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this just concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"16081":["ONEOK, Inc.

Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment remained well positioned to expand its fee-based natural gas export capabilities, particularly to Mexico where we have key relationships through our joint venture Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline and our extensive Natural Gas Liquids business maintains a growing position in the Rockies, Texas and emerging STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, providing us a large and diversified base with which to serve our end-use customers. ","The partnership's distribution coverage increased to 1.06 times in the first quarter, up from 1.03 times in the fourth quarter 2015 and significantly higher compared to the beginning of 2015 which is a reflection of our increasing stable cash flow as we now have a significant amount of infrastructure completed and are able to harvest earnings, particularly in the Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Liquids businesses.","ONEOK Partners first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $445 million represents a nearly 40% increase compared with the first quarter 2015. Executing on our growth projects, contract restructuring, capital and cost savings and consistent operations were key drivers to delivering the greatly improved results from a year ago, even in the face of deteriorating industry fundamental throughout 2015.","From an operating perspective, volume growth across our businesses, increased fee-based earnings, and ongoing cost reduction efforts across ONEOK Partners business segments have all contributed to a solid first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of 2016.","In the midst of some of the industry's most challenging conditions, our employees once again performed exceptionally well by successfully executing on our strategies to mitigate risk, reduce capital spending and operating costs, and manage our balance sheet. It is through their hard work and determination that our company delivered impressive results quarter after quarter in 2015, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering even better results in 2016.","Through our key strategies and well managed and operated assets, our employees have, with a high sense of urgency, met the challenge, just as they have many times in the past. I'd like to thank them for their hard work and commitment to deliver value to the bottom line safely and reliably.","We\u2019ll cover each of the segments in more detail later in the call, but first I'd like to have Derek give us some brief financial update. Derek?","Derek Reiners","Thanks, Terry. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners first quarter distribution coverage was 1.06 times. ONEOK's first quarter dividend coverage was 1.31 times, which together with cash on hand entering the year maintains ONEOK flexibility to provide financial support to the partnership if needed.","In yesterday's earnings news releases, we maintained our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our proactive financial actions in 2015 and early 2016 and enhanced earnings from the partnership has allowed the partnership to deliver on distribution coverage, while also reducing leverage.","The partnership's capital expenditure guidance remains $600 million, including $140 million of maintenance capital for 2016, as the reliability and integrity of our assets is the foundation of our success. However, we are seeing aggressive bidding from our vendors on maintenance projects and the timing associated with our maintenance activities can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to seasonal impacts in varying maintenance cycles across our ever-changing asset base.","Typically our maintenance capital spending is lower in the first quarter. Sequentially maintenance capital decreased $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to our maintenance project plan for the quarter having fewer projects compared to the fourth quarter, which is not unusual when compared to our historical spending profile. We are on plan for our scheduled maintenance projects for 2016.","Similarly, as it relates to operating cost, we continue to see competitive, lower pricing and rates from service providers and we have significantly reduced contract labor across all of our segments. In the first quarter we realized $15 million sequential decrease in operating cost. And as Terry mentioned, we continue to focus on internal operating cost reduction efforts company-wide. We expect these cost savings to continue throughout the year.","In January, ONEOK Partners entered into $1 billion three-year unsecured term loan, effectively refinancing our 2016 debt maturities and enhancing financial flexibility. With approximately $1.9 billion of capacity available on the ONEOK Partners credit facility at the end of the first quarter, the reduction of more than $2.2 billion in capital growth projects in two years and higher earnings, the partnership does not need to access public debt or equity markets well into 2017.","The partnership continues to progress towards deleveraging as our trailing 12 months' GAAP debt to EBITDA improved to 4.5 times at March 31st. And we continue to expect annual GAAP debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.2 times for the full year 2016 as a result of prudent financial, operating and commercial execution. As always, we remain committed to the partnership's investment grade credit ratings.","On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $130 million of cash and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 and an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us financial flexibility as we continue to navigate a challenging market environment.","In February, we provided detailed information on our counterparty credit risk. We\u2019ve included similar information again this year in our Form 10-Q but there haven\u2019t been any substantial changes. We have a very high quality customer base and no material counterparty credit concerns. The majority of our top customers are large petrochemical and integrated oil companies, which have a higher tolerance for volatility and commodity prices.","Our track record of prudent and proactive financial decisions during uncertain times resulted in ample liquidity, too strong balance sheets, and a strong customer base. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners remain well positioned to withstand a volatile commodity and financial market environment.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments.","In the Natural Gas Liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year with first quarter 2016 volumes gathered up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared with the first quarter of 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter 2015, volumes gathered and fractionated were lower primarily due to decreased spot volumes, higher ethane rejection and seasonal impacts. We continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted toward the second half of the year as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp up.","In the first quarter, we connected three additional third-party plants to our NGL system and we continue to see volumes ramp at the eight plants we connected in 2015. We expect to connect one additional third-party plant this year in addition to completing and connecting our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin where additional flared natural gas remains ready to come online.","Williston Basin NGL volumes, our highest margin NGL volumes with bundled rates more than three times of those in other regions, remained strong in the first quarter. The average volume gathered on our Bakken NGL Pipeline increased nearly 12% compared with the fourth quarter 2015, driven by the completion of the Lonesome Creek plant in November 2015 and compression project. I'll also talk about ethane and provide an update on our ethane opportunity outlook in just a moment.","As it relates to the West Texas LPG system, in July 2015, we increased rates on this system to be more in line with market rates. In March, the Texas Railroad Commission suspended the rate increase until it is determined by the Commission if the rates are in line with the market. We are confident that our increased rates are just in reasonable and in line with the market. However, regardless of the outcome of the pending case, our current 2016 financial guidance remains as indicated. As you all can appreciate, due to the legal process now underway with the railroad commission, it will not be prudent at this time for us to discuss this case in any more detail. We will provide future updates or commentary when and if it is appropriate.","In the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, Williston Basin volumes were a key driver to our first quarter performance. Our Natural Gas volumes processed reached 810 million cubic feet per day as we captured previously flared gas and connected new wells to our system. Average natural gas volumes processed in the Williston increased 44% in the first quarter 2016 compared with the first quarter last year, and increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2015.","Our producer customers continue to drive improvements in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, and combined with the higher natural-gas-to-oil ratios in the core areas where virtually all of our new wells are being connected, have helped offset the reduction in drilling and completion activity. We will continue to benefit from more than 820 wells connected in 2015 and the 115 wells connected to our system in the first quarter 2016.","The vast majority of these high performing wells are in the most productive areas of Williams, McKenzie, and Dunn counties in North Dakota where we have more than a million acres dedicated to us and an extensive network of interconnected gathering lines, compression, and processing plants. There are currently 900 drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin, with nearly 400 on our acreage. We saw a decline in the drilling rig count across the Williston Basin during the first quarter and currently have approximately 15 rigs operating on our acreage under dedication.","Flared natural gas in North Dakota was reported at approximately 185 million cubic feet per day for the state in February, with approximately 70 to 80 million cubic feet per day on our system. This continues to present an opportunity for us as we add processing capacity to our system in the third quarter 2016 with the completion of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant.","In the Mid-Continent, first quarter 2016 processed volumes increased 8% compared with fourth quarter 2015 volumes. Similar to the Williston, our producer customers continue to drive significant increases in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, especially in the STACK, Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays.","Procedure delays on completions of some large multi-well pads are expected to impact our volumes over the next several months and potentially through the remainder of 2016. However with the recent improvement in commodity prices and breakevens in the STACK competing favourably with the best plays in the country, we could see acceleration of the delayed completions.","Contract restructuring in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment has significantly decreased the segment's commodity price sensitivity and was another major contributor to the partnership's first quarter results. The segments average fee rate increased to $0.68 per MMBtu, compared with $0.35 in the same period last year and $0.55 in the fourth quarter 2015. We expect the segment's earnings to increase to more than 75% fee-based this year, driven by this contract restructuring efforts.","Moving on to the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, first quarter results remained steady as the segment continued to provide the partnership with stable, predominantly fee-based earnings. The segment completed two capital growth projects in March, the first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project and a compressor station expansion project on our Midwestern Gas Transmission pipeline which will add an additional 170 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the pipeline.","The Roadrunner project is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based commitment and the second phase of the Roadrunner is expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. Additionally, the Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion is also fully subscribed under 15-year firm fee-based commitments.","Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment is primarily market connected, meaning we are directly connected with large stable customers who provide services to end users. These customers such as large utility companies, electric generation facilities and industrials have specific volume needs that don't fluctuate based on commodity prices.","Additionally, we work closely with these customers to design our systems to fit their specific needs. Unlike basis-driven pipelines, there is minimal financial risk associated with our Natural Gas Pipelines or our customers. We like the stability of our Natural Gas Pipelines business and the customers we serve, and we'll continue to develop additional fee-based and market-driven long-term growth and export opportunities in and around our asset footprint.","I'd like to close by providing an update on our ethane opportunity outlook. For the past three years our industry has experienced an unprecedented period of heavy and prolonged ethane rejection. The partnership continued even in the face of sustained ethane rejection to increase our Natural Gas Liquids volumes gathered and fractionated. We are starting to see ethane prices improve in relation to Natural Gas as a result of improving NGL prices and weakened natural gas, increases in NGL exports and expected incremental ethane demand from new world scale petrochemical crackers.","Since last quarter, we've seen ethane recovery economics improve. Some natural gas processing plants on our system have intermittently started to recover ethane, which we expect to continue throughout 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful amount of processing plants to move into full recovery in early 2017. We average 175,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system in the first quarter, and we expect anywhere from 175,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system as new natural gas plants, we are connected to, continue to ramp up, and as we see the impacts of increased volumes in the Williston, STACK and SCOOP plays throughout 2016.","We are well positioned to benefit from this ethane opportunity and have more than enough infrastructure to bring these incremental barrels or approximately $200 million in annual earnings to our system with no additional capital requirements. We also have the opportunity to utilize our assets to capture pricing differentials if any dislocations in pricing occur between the Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas market centres as a result of increasing ethane demand.","Ethane recovery presents a major opportunity for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but it certainly isn't our only opportunity. We remain focussed on additional fee-based growth opportunities for our businesses, cost effective ways to enhance our assets, and employee retention efforts. So we are fully prepared when market conditions improve.","Congratulations to our employees on a solid first quarter. We continue to face headwinds from challenging industry conditions, but we've shown once again that we're uniquely positioned to handle these challenges and deliver on the financial results we've laid out for ourselves and our investors.","Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we will take our first question from Eric Genco with Citi.","Eric Genco","Hey, good morning. I have a couple of follow-up questions on ethane. Just wanted to kind of go over. I think you mentioned it basically, but in moving to 175,000 to 200,000 barrels a day of ethane opportunity in '16 versus the 150,000 to 180,000 last quarter being rejected, is that basically -- that's basically third-party plant and a shift towards more liquid rich drilling overtime, is that what's accounting for that increase?","Terry Spencer","Yes, Eric I think, yes, most of that is a result of the new plants that we've connected here fairly recently. And, of course, the growth that we're seeing behind those facilities that we indicated in my remarks, so, yes, most of that is from the new plants. Sheridan, anything?","Sheridan Swords","No, that's it.","Eric Genco","All right. And I guess the other thing I was kind of curious about is we\u2019ve been sort of talking about this little bit more, just trying to get a better handle on some of the ethane recoveries that are likely to come out of the Bakken eventually. And so I think I understand based on bundled costs and how that works economically, and you guys have said that basically that Bakken would theoretically be one of the later basins to be culled. But I'm also curious too because I know -- you know, you've referred to some of your services being non-discretionary in the past and it's not like ethane economics specifically is going to drive drilling in the Bakken. So I'm curious is there a way to look at or think about pipeline stacks in the Bakken and sort of -- you know, as things come back, just sort of push ethane recovery and how that might impact you. Is there any way to sort of numerically think about that or is that still something that will just have to kind of wait beyond?","Terry Spencer","You know, Eric, broadly as you think about where we deliver ethane across our systems, we really don't have any quality issues or any concerns really on a large scale. We may periodically in certain specific locations dependent upon the location of those pipes to end-user, we sometimes do have some issues with respect to quality specs, but I don't see quality specs being a big driver for ethane emerging from the Bakken, nor really anywhere else for that matter. And when we talk about these non-discretionary services, we talk about producers have to have the process and they got to have the liquids extracted from the gas in order to meet quality specs. Ethane tends to be one of those -- is one of those NGLs that can be -- can easily go into the gas train and be diluted without causing much of a problem, unless you've got industrial customers or commercial customers right near -- located in pretty close proximity to the processing plant, okay? That helped you?","Eric Genco","Yes, it does. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time.","Operator","And we will go next to Brian Gamble with Simmons and Company.","Brian Gamble","Good morning, everybody.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Gamble","On the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, that fee rates increase obviously excellent year-over-year and even quarter-over-quarter. I know that we'd talked about some of those new contracts hitting in January and that creates a bump. Maybe you could walk us through how we should think about that rate moving through the year. I think there is some contract that come up mid-year, maybe some Mid-Con things. But if I remember correctly, there was a pretty healthy chunk of the Williston that they got repriced? And just want to make sure, being realistic about how I'm thinking about that rate for the rest of the year.","Terry Spencer","Yes, I'll just make a couple of general comments and I'll turn it over to Kevin. You know, as far as our contract restructuring effort, the lion share of the contracts or the bulk of what we set out to do in the Williston Basin, that's done. And so don't expect a whole lot more to occur. There's still some work in progress, but don't expect a whole lot more impact from that. The Mid-Continent is just going to continue to be work-in-progress. We have a much larger producer base of, that is, we have a lot more procedures that have much smaller volumes and consequently it takes -- it's a lot more involved in the Mid-Continent than in the Williston, just because of the sheer number of contracts that we're talking about. So that's caught from in a broad sense. Kevin, you've got anything else to add to that.","Kevin Burdick","No, I think that's right on.","Brian Gamble","That works. And then as far as the connections in the Williston, you mentioned 115 wells, I believe, you said in Q1. You mentioned the flared gas that's still on the system as well as the potential duct completions that would go in. But as far as well count adds that you\u2019re anticipating for the rest of the year, are there wells that are completed that are sitting there that now the system can handle that we\u2019re working on, or are we waiting for ducts for the majority of the opportunity to, I guess, incrementally add new wells to the system more for this year?","Kevin Burdick","Brian, this is Kevin. Yes, that will come from -- the way we think about connecting the wells, it will come from a couple of -- from both of those places. I mean as rigs continue to work the basin as those wells that are being drilled or completed, we\u2019ll connect those up. But there is also the backlog of ducts that are on our acreage that as we communicate with producers and realign the schedules, we'll connect those as well. So our future -- our 2016 connections will come from the combination of both of those. And we still expect we'll be in that 250 to 350 range for total connects for the year.","Brian Gamble","That delta between what we\u2019ve done so far and that midpoint of the range, so call it 185, how should I think about that as far as the buckets are concerned. Just I mean broadly speaking, can you give me a percentage breakdown between the two?","Kevin Burdick","Broadly speaking, it might be half and half.","Brian Gamble","Great, that's helpful. I think that's it for me. Appreciate it you guys.","Terry Spencer","Thanks Brian.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.","Danilo Juvane","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning.","Danilo Juvane","You guys obviously seeing sort of an increase in your fee-based gathering margins here for the rest of the year. So as you think about guidance for 2016, is the sort of pending issue with the rates in West Texas LPG the only downside risk that you see to this year's guidance?","Terry Spencer","You know, as far as West Texas, as I said in my comments, I'm not going to go there for obvious reasons. But you know, as we think about our fee-based activities, we have certainly taken out a lot of risks, okay? And so -- and as far as renegotiation of contracts, we've been successful at increasing our rates across the board, okay, not just in the NGL space but in the gathering and processing space in particular. So, you know, as we move forward we really don't see any -- we don't see from a rate standpoint backing up anywhere. Okay?","Danilo Juvane","Got you. Over the last couple of months, we've seen sort of more bullish NGL sentiment in general. How do you guys think about continuing to reach special contracts given that some of the part exposure that you've had before sort of is rebounding right now. Is there a percentage that you're targeting of fee-based versus commodity?","Terry Spencer","I'll make a general comment. You know, we don't have a specific target for any of our businesses in terms of, this is how much fee-based margin we want to have. Obviously, we want to have as much fee-based margin as we can possibly get. And obviously we're continuing to push on that re-contract and negotiate everywhere we can, certainly bringing new assets and new businesses to the table or new opportunities to the table that are fee-based. When we think about the reduction of risk, we think about it more from a coverage standpoint, okay? What do we need in this business, what do we need in this business segment in order to maintain an appropriate coverage level for each one, and certainly an appropriate coverage level for the entire entity. So that's kind of how we think about it. Sheridan, do you have anything you want to say about our contracts in NGLs?","Sheridan Swords","Well, I think the thing that comes out is even in NGL's we're continuing to change our optimization exposure into fee-based, and we will continue to do that even in widening the spreads. When we say widening spreads, we think that's even a better opportunity to start locking in margins. So as you said, we always want to go to more fee-based and take our commodity exposure out.","Danilo Juvane","Got you. Last question for me. You mentioned coverage being a big reason as how you're managing some of these contract restructures. Is there a target coverage ratio that you're looking at long term?","Terry Spencer","Well, certainly, as we've said in the past, you know, at the partnership, 1.1 to 1.15 longer term is a coverage that you know, it could make some sense for us, potentially higher. But certainly as we've driven the risk out these businesses, we don't have to maintain this quite as big a coverage. But that's kind of how we think about it.","Danilo Juvane","If you take that statement and sort of think about what you're thinking about sort of your debt metrics, where do you see yourself being more comfortable starting to bump distributions?","Terry Spencer","Well, certainly we've told you 4.2 times debt to EBITDA ratio is what we're targeting, but we really would like to be sub-4. I mean, ideally that's where we'd like to be. And that's the longer term plan.","Danilo Juvane","Okay. Thank you. That's it for me. Thanks.","Terry Spencer","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","Hi, everyone, congrats on the quarter.","Terry Spencer","Thank you.","Christine Cho","When I look at how much ethane is being rejected on your system, the capacity of your NGL pipes and the utilization on those pipes, I have that your pipes are going to be full once all of the ethane behind your system is extracted. Can you talk about the expansion opportunities on the Sterling and Arbuckle line compression or looping? Would you charge a similar rate as you are now? And is it safe to assume that the economics of an expansion, if through compression, is going to be better than the 5 to 7 times multiple you usually give out?","Terry Spencer","Christine, what I would say is that we feel that we have enough capacity on our existing pipelines to handle the ethane that's being rejected, but it will push the utilization of those pipelines to pretty high rates. If we get to the opportunity to expand our pipelines, the cheapest expansion is sitting on Sterling 3 and we had said we can take that up 60,000 to 70,000 barrels a day with relatively inexpensive pump stations on there, which would be at a very high multiple to add that kind of space for a very little capital. The other pipelines Arbuckle and the other two Sterling pipelines are fairly expanded with cheap expansion. It would be inter-looping, so it still would be much cheaper than laying a new line but it would be more expensive than what Sterling 3 has. But we think right now we can handle all the ethane that could potentially come out of our system.","Christine Cho","Okay, and then just piggyback on that, I mean, I have that ethane demand that's going to be 800,000 barrels per day if we include the ethane export projects along with the cracker additions. Obviously, we've been thinking that in the near- and medium-term ethane price is going to go up to equate methane equivalent plus CNF. But do you think over the longer term, we could be short ethane, this would imply that ethane price could approach naptha prices?","Terry Spencer","Christine, I think what would happen is that first thing if ethane prices increase, you're going to run into the other LPGs that can be cracked, especially in the existing cracker. So you're going to hit into propane, butane, and natural gasoline before you get to naptha. So I don't think we'll see in the long term ethane prices approach naptha prices. I think propane and other ones will put a lid on the price of ethane.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then last one for me, very helpful, thank you. What's the average contract life on the NGL pipelines? And you've kind of mentioned this before, but I'm assuming that you have less optimization capacity than you did kind of at the peak, but as these contracts with customers come due, how should we think about how you guys decide whether or not to extend the contracts versus not renew it and maybe retain some capacity for optimization opportunities? Are you kind of happy with the levels that you have now or you want to decrease it, increase it?","Terry Spencer","Christine, what I would say is that these contracts that you're referring are contracts that we have with the processing plants. So it's a bundled service for not just transporting product to Belvieu but also for fractionating it as well. So what we would want to do is always continue to extend those contracts. And if we can get the right prices to take them into Belvieu, we would rather put them on a fee-based business than be open up to the spread between Conway and Belvieu. So if we could, we would contract the whole pipe if we could get it at good rates.","Christine Cho","Would you say that the bundled rate probably has room to come up then?","Terry Spencer","Potentially yes.","Christine Cho","Okay, and one more\u2026","Terry Spencer","We would\u2026","Christine Cho","Go on, sorry.","Terry Spencer","Any time we look at the rates when we go out and look at a plant, we look at what the competition is, we look at how are our services that we provide and all that and try to price our services accordingly. So as prices continue improving going into Belvieu, I think there is some opportunity to increase our rates into Belvieu.","Christine Cho","And what's the average contract life?","Terry Spencer","Most of our contracts, substantial amount of our contracts do not expire until we get into the 2020's. We do have a little bit that expires between now and then, but most of it is in the 2020's.","Christine Cho","Okay, great. Thank you.","Terry Spencer","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please proceed.","Craig Shere","Good morning. Congratulations on another good quarter.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Craig.","Craig Shere","So I think you said 115 well hook-ups in the quarter, Terry. But guidance I think is still only 250 to 350 for the full year. And if I'm not mistaken one of your major customers has just added a frac crew on a farm to work done, that's duct inventory. Given all this, is your reiterated guidance for well hook-ups perhaps conservative?","Kevin Burdick","Craig, this is Kevin. I don't know if I'd use the word conservative but yes, we've had a strong showing out of it for the first quarter. But then again, rigs have dropped off quite a bit as well during that same timeframe. So we continue to talk with our customers daily and understand as commodity price moves around, kind of their sentiment towards either adding frac crews or adding rigs changes a little bit. But right now, we feel good about that 250 to 350. If we have some more movement with producers that are going to accelerate completions in the Williston and then yes, that number could go up.","Craig Shere","And on the remaining 70 million to 80 million a day of flaring on your Bakken footprint, any thoughts on maybe a run rate as we exit the year? Obviously, new well hook-ups will contribute to potentially some incremental flaring. So this isn't going to go down to zero. Any thoughts on where we could exit the year? And also over time, are we perhaps seeing the actual amount of flaring that's reported perhaps be on the conservative side so that you could get most likely higher uplift?","Terry Spencer","So, a couple of things there. One is as we look at our flaring, keep in mind, there is probably 30 to 40 million behind Bear Creek, so when we bring Bear Creek online, we expect that a chunk, approximately half of that will get put out with that -- as that plant comes up. As for the other, yes, there will always be some level of flaring that occurs, but we do have quite a bit and we\u2019ve got some head room from both our field infrastructure and processing plants. So as new wells come online, I don't know that that would contribute much to the flaring. So I do think we expect that number will go down significantly as we move into the back half of the year once the Bear Creek is up. And yes, when you look at the numbers over the last few months, it does appear that some of the reporting has been conservative for overall -- for total kind of state-wide flaring.","Craig Shere","Great. And on the ethane question, in terms of specs, I think I forgot when, it's some quarters ago, you had a 20,000 barrels a day of recovery to mid downstream Y-grade requirements. At the time I think you mentioned the possibility of that going away with the downstream solution, obviously still plotting margin for you. Could you see that margin opportunity expanding over time as the Y-grade growth out of the region continues?","Sheridan Swords","Craig, this is Sheridan. The ethane coming out of the Bakken is for purely products specifications that we have downstream. And right now with the ethane we have coming out there now, we are able to manage that situation. As we continue to look forward, we are trying to find the most economical way to extract, to solve this solution in another way, but we're still looking at that. It's capital intensive. So we're still trying to work on with the right solution for that is. In terms of getting more ethane out of the Bakken for uplift there, we see the opportunity is there as increasing ethane prices with the new petrochemical facilities come online is where we think the most opportunity is.","Craig Shere","Okay, great. And just a little more color around the NGL segment headwinds, including the $10 million decrease in exchange services and $5.6 million in marketing would be helpful. Maybe just more of a discussion about specific spot and about some volumes and about summarization and trends there.","Terry Spencer","Craig, the marketing was down mainly because we had a warm winter and also we had less volume from our marketing department going into refineries. We have already seen that tick back up as we move into the second quarter. The extreme services were down, it's because we had spot volume in the fourth quarter, we had a little bit more ethane rejection in the first quarter, and we had a little seasonal or weather effects also in the first quarter. Volumes that have already rebounded as we move into the second quarter and today our volumes on our gathering systems are at or a little bit above 800,000.","Craig Shere","Great. And last question. Derek, on the favourable comments you had about favourable bidding for your maintenance CapEx and the falling OpEx cost, how much opportunity is there for further improvement in '16 and could you see these benefits continuing in the '17 or is it very kind of variable quarter to quarter?","Derek Reiners","Hey Craig, I'm going to turn it over to Wes Christensen to answer that question.","Wes Christensen","Yes, Craig. We continue to have contact with our contractors and find as they are looking for work to keep their crews busy, that there's opportunity there to improve it. We have already captured quite a bit from them through '15 and '16 and expect it to continue in the current environment.","Craig Shere","Great. Thank you very much and congratulations again.","Terry Spencer","Thanks Craig.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Becca Followill with US Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","Good morning, guys.","Terry Spencer","Hi Becca.","Becca Followill","Hi. On processing, guidance for the year is 1.9 to 2 for the year, but the quarter you were more like 1.95, and you talked about volumes being back-end loaded. Is that back-end loaded for NGLs? And you also have new processing coming on in a year or so, help me out with guidance relative to Q1.","Terry Spencer","So, yes, it is. We do have some back-end loading, in particular in gathering and processing because the Bear Creek plant coming on in the third quarter is going to fetch you there. And you're going to see some back-end loading a bit on the NGL side as well. Sheridan, you got anything to add.","Sheridan Swords","Yes, I mean we do have plants coming online, the Bear Creek plant will add more to the NGL gathering. We have another plant in the Mid-Continent that's coming on. We just had a plant yesterday, start delivering -- a new plant start delivering into the West Texas pipeline asset. So here we are still little bit. We should see growth from here forth.","Becca Followill","But you're already at the mid point of the guidance? That's where I'm coming from.","Terry Spencer","Becca, could you kind of clarify when you say the -- we're at the mid point of the guidance, which?","Becca Followill","I'm looking at gas process, it was 1.948, I think your guidance was 1.9 to 2.","Terry Spencer","Okay. So that's -- again, we had a strong Williston volumes and that's in -- you're referring to the MMBtus and so that's driving that. The gas being much richer coming out of the Williston, so that's what you're seeing there. Our volume profile just at a high level in the Williston is going to be more flattish for the year. So that's the reason you're seeing that.","Becca Followill","But you're also adding Bear Creek in Q3?","Terry Spencer","Right and that will open another -- again, that's 40 million a day in cubic feet. So when you're talking about the total, it's not going to move -- it'll move it some. But again, volumes between now and then are going to be flattish and then you'll see a little uptick. And if thing don't -- depending on completions at the end of the year, you could possibly see a minor decline post Bear Creek.","Becca Followill","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered several times, but I just wanted to just clarify a couple of things and I think you've sort of answered it with Becca's question before. But the results this quarter with respect to volumes, was that what you expected the first quarter to be, is it better or worse? Does it sort of change because you didn't change your guidance, does that mean that you still think that you're within your guidance or are you more towards the upper end now versus the lower end? I was just wondering if you can sort of give us some color as to 1Q performance relative to your official plan.","Terry Spencer","Yes, we came in pretty much as expected. I mean, as you would expect, you got some areas that performed a little better than expected and others that weren't quite as good. But overall, this first quarter performance is not a surprise to us and it's certainly consistent with our guidance we provided for the year. Just a bit more specific, in the Williston Basin, we continue to perform extremely well. In the Mid-Continent, we've not performed quite as well but when you look at it on the overall basis, particularly for a G&P segment, we are right on plan, right on our guidance.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, perfect. A couple more follow-ups. You stated in the past, I think I saw it written as well too, that OKE stands in support of OKS. Do you expect to have to execute on that this year, or it's just more of a statement at this point in case if needed? Maybe you can sort of discuss that in context with any discussions you've had with rating agencies recently and so forth.","Derek Reiners","Shneur, this is Derek. The OKE cash balances there, really just is a prudency matter. We like having that flexibility. But as we've stated before, we don't have any plans really to issue equity at this point. So we'll continue to watch it, but no plans at this point. And in terms of rating agencies, I mentioned in my remarks certainly at the partnership we're committed to the investment-grade credit rating and that allows us some additional comfort should things not turn out exactly the way we would expect.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And then one last question just technical in nature, Roadrunner, what's the expected ramp this year?","Terry Spencer","I'll turn that question over to Phil.","Phillip May","Could you -- did you say ramp?","Shneur Gershuni","Yes.","Phillip May","Okay. Yes, it's first phase is in service as of March, so it is flowing 170 million a day. Second phase is due in service in the second quarter of '17 and that will ramp up to 570. And then third quarter will follow in 2019 and that's another 70 million a day. So total 640 million a day.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, perfect. All right. Thank you very much guys.","Terry Spencer","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning Jeremy.","Jeremy Tonet","I was just wondering for the NGL gathering, if you could help us think through kind of what leads to the cadence of the ramp over the year. Is that kind of new plants ramping up or is it more on the connection side, or is it more ethane recovery or if you could just help us with that a little bit, that will be great.","Terry Spencer","Sheridan.","Sheridan Swords","I think to know that coming out of the first quarter, we always see a little bit of a downturn on our existing plant because of the seasonality in the first quarter. So we ramp up through the year, some of it will be that. But most of it will be from the ramping up of the plants that we connected last year and the new plants that we're connecting this year. We really don't expect any incremental -- any substantial incremental increase in ethane recovery in 2016 in our guidance numbers. So mainly, it's going to be from new plant connections.","Jeremy Tonet","Okay. That's great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Jeremy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to John Edwards with Credit Suisse.","John Edwards","Yes, good morning everybody. Just I wanted to kind of come back to the incremental ethane opportunity little bit, is the basic cadence of realizing the $200 million, is it more or less in line with what you've laid out on your slide eight of the deck you provided with the release where you're showing the expected incremental petrochemical ethane demand? Or is it going to be some other trajectory? Is it more kind of rateably each year the next few years? Help me understand that a little bit better.","Sheridan Swords","John this is Sheridan. I think the best way to explain it is currently today we supply about a third of the ethane demand in the United States. And as you see that demand increase, as you see on page eight, I think that ratio will stay the same. So of that increased demand, we'll be able to see about a third of it on our system.","John Edwards","Okay. So is it proportionate then to the timing that you've laid out there or is it some other pace?","Sheridan Swords","No, I think it's about proportionate to that timing.","John Edwards","Okay. That's really helpful. And then as far as you had made some reference to the potential for improvement to optimization margins, I think your guidance is $0.02. I mean what are the prospects you think for that number actually improving this year and perhaps next year?","Terry Spencer","Well, I think the spread between Conway and Belvieu will be -- move around quite a bit this year, but I don't think we'll see any material substantial increase in that spread until you see the ethane come online which will fill up the pipes between Conway and Belvieu and give you an opportunity for wider spread. So probably more better opportunity in '17.","John Edwards","Okay, great. My other questions have been answered. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question and answer session and also concludes today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect."],"16079":["ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call February 23, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","T. D.

Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thank you, T. D. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest in investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.","On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phil May, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines.","Additional key financial and operational information has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK's and ONEOK Partners' websites.","Let's start by discussing ONEOK and ONEOK Partners accomplishments in 2015. Then I'll hand it off to Derek for financial update, and finish by reviewing our 2016 financial guidance, which we maintained for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners in last night's release.","Our uniquely-positioned assets delivered higher ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and 2015 adjusted EBITDA in a very challenging market, and we delivered on our expectation to significantly grow natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes and earnings in the second half of the year.","The partnership grew its adjusted EBITDA throughout the year by nearly 40% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter 2015, ending the year with $450 million in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA. The partnership also improved its quarterly distribution coverage to 1.03x.","These results were driven by a significant ramp in natural gas volumes gathered and processed across our system, especially in Williston Basin, as we connected more than 820 additional wells; captured more flared volumes from existing wells; completed six field compression projects and our Lonesome Creek natural gas processing plant; and restructured several contracts earlier than expected; and in the Mid-Continent volumes increased late in the year as a large producer customer completed wells that had been drilled earlier in the year.","The Natural Gas Liquids segment, which is connected to more than 180 natural gas processing plants, continued to benefit from natural gas liquids processed volume growth in Williston Basin. Seven new third-party natural gas processing plants were connected in 2015.","We also realized solid volume performance on our West Texas LPG pipeline system from our long haul customers as we continued to provide quality service at a good value. With nearly 100% of its earnings fee-based, the Natural Gas Pipeline segment had another solid year. This segment is taking advantage of incremental demands due to lower natural gas prices through its uniquely positioned assets with the announcements of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline and WesTex Pipeline expansion, serving growing markets in Mexico.","In 2015, we made significant progress toward reducing commodity risk in our business, which is expected to reduce earnings volatility over the long-term. As a result, we expect 2016 fee-based earnings to be approximately 85%, a significant improvement from 66% in 2014.","Drivers of this increase include, growing the fee-based exchange services volumes in the Natural Gas Liquids segment and contract restructuring in the Gathering and Processing segment. The efforts of contract restructuring in the Gathering and Processing segment can be seen by the increase in our average fee rate. The average fee rate for the fourth quarter 2015 was $0.55, a nearly 60% increase compared with $0.35 in the first quarter 2015.","At ONEOK, we remain committed to being a supportive general partner, as evidenced by the $650 million equity investment in the partnership in mid-2015, which we expect to result in increased distributions from ONEOK's higher ownership percentage in ONEOK Partners. Our extensive integrated network of natural gas and natural gas liquids assets delivered solid results in 2015 and has positioned us well for 2016.","That concludes my opening remarks. Derek?","Derek Reiners","Thanks, Terry. I'll start by highlighting the financial steps we took in 2015 and early-2016 that positioned us well for 2016 and into 2017.","With a high priority on maintaining the partnership's investment grade credit ratings, we took decisive steps to manage its balance sheet by high grading its growth projects and reducing capital spending by nearly $1.6 billion in 2015 from our original 2015 capital guidance. We issued $750 million of equity in August, along with nearly $280 million of additional equity through the at-the-market program during 2015.","Termed out $800 million of short-term debt in March and most recently entered into a $1 billion three-year unsecured term loan, which effectively refinances the 2016 long-term debt maturities at a low cost. With the financial steps we've taken and the momentum and volume growth and earnings leading into 2016, we expect to achieve our 2016 financial guidance.","At ONEOK Partners, we expect not to need public debt or equity issuances well into 2017, which includes no equity from the aftermarket equity program to keep distributions flat for the year, deliver distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016, and obtain GAAP debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.2x or less by late 2016.","At ONEOK, we expect to keep this dividend flat for the year, pay no cash income taxes in 2016, and generate approximately $160 million of free cash flow after dividends in 2016, which along with $90 million of cash at the end of 2015 provides ONEOK with significant flexibility to support ONEOK Partners, if needed.","For growth capital in 2016, we expect to spend $320 million in the Gathering and Processing segment, and $70 million each in the Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Pipelines segments for a total of $460 million as previously guided. As producer needs evolve throughout the balance of the year and into 2017, we have the flexibility to significantly reduce growth capital, particularly in the Gathering and Processing segment as we optimize our systems and available capacity.","Additionally, we have been able to realize reduced operating costs and capital costs from our service providers across our operations. We continue to control operating costs and have reduced contract labor. We expect this trend to continue into 2016.","As it relates to maintenance, capital expenditures we take a conservative approach. We're extremely careful not to underestimate expenditures when establishing guidance of spending for the integrity and reliability of our assets. It is very important to the partnership's success. Over the long-term, our assets have operated very reliably as a result of this approach.","In 2015, a number of our large maintenance projects came in significantly under budget, especially the projects scheduled towards the second half of 2015 as service providers reduced costs and did very aggressively due to market conditions.","On the topic of counterparty credit risk, we consider our credit exposure to be low across all three of our operating segments. The partnership had no single customer representing more than 10% of revenues and only 15 customers individually represented 1% or more of revenues.","Additionally, of the top 10 customers, which represented 38% of revenue, nine are investment grade or provide full credit support. Many of our top 10 customers are Natural Gas Liquids segment customers comprised of large petrochemical and integrated oil companies.","Taking a look at our credit profile within our three segments, where we consider investment grade is rated by the ratings agencies or comparable internal ratings or secured by letters of credit or other collateral. The Natural Gas Pipeline segment received more than 85% of its 2015 revenue from investment grade customers, who were primarily large electric and natural gas utilities.","The Natural Gas Liquids segment has limited credit exposure in its exchange service fee earnings, as in those contracts the natural gas liquids are purchased and proceeds are remitted from the partnership to the liquids producer less fee. And more than 80% of 2015 commodity sales were to investment grade customers.","And finally, the Gathering and Processing segment's credit risk is limited, as in most contracts the partnership remits the proceeds under the percent of proceeds contracts to the producer, net of ONEOK Partner share of those proceeds as well as the fees charged. 99% of the segment's 2015 downstream sales were to investment grade customers.","2015 results at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners include the impact from non-cash impairment charges totaling $264 million, primarily related to investments in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin. The partnership remains highly committed to maintaining our investment grade credit ratings, having a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our capital program, ending 2015 with $1.8 billion available on its credit facility. The partnership's GAAP debt to adjusted EBITDA on a run rate basis is 4.1x, reflecting earnings growth during the year.","Distribution coverage remains an important metric for us as well. We expect distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016, by growing our cash flows through volume growth, cost savings and efficiency improvements. ONEOK on a standalone basis ended 2015 with over $90 million of cash and an undrawn $300 million credit facility.","The partnership is advantaged by having a strong supportive general partner in ONEOK. With a significant excess dividend coverage, ONEOK has the resources, that may be used to further support the partnership, if needed, as it navigates these uncertain times.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Derek. Let's walk through our 2016 financial guidance and key assumptions by segment. Starting with our largest segment, the Natural Gas Liquids segment is expected to contribute $995 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2016. Additionally, we expect the natural gas liquids volumes and earnings to be weighted towards the mid to second half of 2016. Approximately 90% of the expected earnings in this segment are fee-based from the exchange services and transportation businesses.","We continue to expect the partnership's natural gas liquids volumes gathered to increase in 2016, primarily from Williston Basin natural gas liquids volume growth expected from our gathering and processing assets in the Basin, including the expected connection of the Bear Creek plant and one third-party natural gas processing plant in 2016.","Approximately 60% of the segment's natural gas liquids volumes gathered come from the Mid-Continent, with the majority of the gathered volume coming from third-party processing plants. Our unique natural gas liquids position in the Mid-Continent is similar to the position we have in the Williston, with the partnership's gathering and processing assets as we are connected to most of the third-party plants in the region.","We expect to continue to benefit from natural gas liquids volumes gathered through our West Texas LPG system, where nearly 26% of the segment's volume originates. The segment is connected to more than 60 natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and is expected to connect one additional plant in 2016, and we expect to receive the full benefit in 2016 of increased tariffs.","Finally, we moved the completion of the Bakken NGL pipeline expansion to the third quarter 2018, due to a slower expected rate of volume growth. The realigned timing of the expansion has no impact on financial or capital guidance for 2016.","Driving the earnings growth in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment in 2016 is natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and enhanced margins due to the contract restructuring efforts. In the Williston, we expect to average 740 million cubic feet per day of natural gas gathered volume in 2016.","Our gathered volumes early in the year have been very strong, as we reach nearly 800 million cubic feet per day in February. The recently completed Lonesome Creek plant and compression projects have already added nearly 100 million a day of incremental volume to our system, most of which has come from capturing previously flared gas.","We continued to have approximately 24 rigs operating and more than 500 drilled uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage. Given this activity, we expect 250 to 350 new well connections to our system in 2016.","To put the expected 2016 volume outlook into context, if every rig were to have stopped drilling on January 1, 2016, and we did not connect any new wells in 2016, we would expect an average gathered volume of 720 million cubic feet per day in 2016, slightly below our guidance for the Williston.","Natural gas volume growth in 2016 will not reflect a pronounced second half ramp up, as we experienced in 2015. We do expect volumes to slightly decline through the summer, until our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant comes online and we expect to capture an incremental 40 million cubic feet per day of gas currently flaring in Dunn County.","In the Mid-Continent, we continued to be in constant communication with our producer customers regarding their drilling and completion activity. And similar to the Williston, the Mid-Continent volume exited 2015 at a high rate.","As I mentioned earlier, the segment did receive an early benefit from our contract restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter 2015. However, 2016 is expected to receive the full benefit of these efforts and we expect another increase in the average fee rate in the first quarter 2016 from the $0.55 the segment averaged in the fourth quarter 2015.","In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, 2016 earnings are expected to remain more than 95% fee-based, with more than 90% of the segment's transportation capacity and more than 75% of its natural gas storage capacity contracted for the year. The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline is on schedule to be complete next month, and is fully subscribed under 25-year firm demand charged fee-based commitments, with the second phase expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017.","Before closing, I would like to discuss future demand growth for ethane, which we expect to be a significant opportunity for the Natural Gas Liquids segment, as we move through 2017 and 2018.","Approximately 400,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane demand from new world-scale petrochemical crackers is expected to come online by the third quarter of 2017 and nearly 164,000 barrels per day more by first quarter 2019. We expect this new demand combined with additional ethane exporting infrastructure to significantly reduce the ethane excess supply overhang and put pressure on ethane prices, and bringing most natural gas processing plants into full ethane recovery some time in mid-2018.","Nearly one-third of U.S. ethane or approximately 180,000 barrels per day is dedicated and connected to our natural gas liquids systems, but it's currently not producing due to insufficient ethane demand. We are well-positioned to transport and fractionate substantial incremental ethane volumes, once the natural gas processing plants we are connected to transition into full ethane recovery in response to growing U.S. petrochemical demand.","We expect little to no additional capital expenditures needed to bring this ethane onto our system, as we already constructed the natural gas liquids infrastructure necessary to connect supply to the Gulf Coast region. The total incremental adjusted EBITDA benefit to the partnership, if all of the natural gas processing plants we are connected to enter full ethane recovery, could be in the range of $200 million per year.","With the Natural Gas Liquids segment's unique and extensive asset position, we can deliver significant ethane supplies to the Gulf Coast markets from the Williston, Mid-Continent and Permian Basins.","Since we issued guidance in December, the commodity price environment has continued to be unstable, and many of our producer customers have reduced their capital expenditure plans for 2016. While these challenges remain, we will continue to remain focused on serving our customers, reducing risks, controlling costs, managing our balance sheet prudently and reducing capital needs.","As we have discussed on this call, more than 85% of the partnership's operating income and equity earnings comes from primarily fee-based activities, underpinned by its large 37,000 mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids network, with opportunities to grow its cash flows, even in a lower capital spending environment.","In 2016, we expect to finish the year within our financial guidance, driven by our uniquely positioned assets. We are less than 60 days into 2016 and we expect similar to 2015 opportunities and challenges throughout the year. We will be proactive in our approach to these opportunities and challenges and prudent in our decision making, all while keeping in mind the long-term interest of our investors.","I'd like to thank our employees across the country for their strong performance, hard work and dedication in 2015. Many of our employees have experienced these difficult industry cycles before, and they know what to do. Manage costs, be efficient, be creative and operate safely and reliably, all while being focused on providing quality service to our customers. And many thanks to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Genco with Citi.","Eric Genco","My first question is actually a little bit of a two-parter. I just want to dig a little more on the potential on the ethane recovery. It obviously seems like this is a pretty major opportunity and no incremental capital. Not really if, but maybe when. And I know it's early, I just would like to get a better sense for the timing and maybe the mechanics, and how that some of this might play out in terms of the split between where you'll feel the impact in the Permian, Mid-Continent, and the Bakken?","And I guess also in light of the comment that you alluded to in your remarks that perhaps the Permian is going to see a meaningful uplift even in '16 in terms of the rate, bringing that more to market rates. I'd just like to get a better sense for that, if you can?","Terry Spencer","Sure. Eric, I'll just make a couple of comments, and then let Sheridan kind of follow this thing. You see, in the slide deck that we provided, there is actually a slide in there that kind of shows you the sources of where that incremental ethane originates. And if you think about it in terms of which ethane is going to come on, obviously those with the lowest transportation cost burden will come on sooner.","So you have to think about it in terms of the Gulf Coast probably coming on sooner, the Mid-Continent and the West Texas probably next, and then you\u2019ve got to think about the Marcellus and the Rockies. It's kind of in that order and we provided that table to give you as industry what that volume impact is. So Sheridan, you want to provide little more color and then talk about West Texas?","Sheridan Swords","Only thing I would say is that, I think we'll start seeing -- as we enter into 2017, is when we will start seeing meaningful ethane starting to come out. And as Terry said, West Texas of our system will be first, but that is where we have the least amount of ethane rejection on our system followed by the Mid-Continent, where we have the most volume off currently, and then last which will be '18 or beyond, which will be the Bakken.","In terms of West Texas pipeline and the rate increase, in July of 2015, we brought the tariff rates, the uncommitted tariff rates on the West Texas pipeline closer to market, so we only realized half the year of that rate increase, which in 2016 will realize the complete year of that rate increase.","Eric Genco","But that's not necessarily getting you to the sort of 5x to 7x as sort of the long-term target, it's more just the benefit of half the year at this point?","Sheridan Swords","Yes, that\u2019s been the half and the [multiple speakers] full year. We don't anticipate raise in rates. We don't have in our guidance raising rates further on West Texas in 2016.","Eric Genco","And I guess, in switching gears a little bit maybe, I'd just like to get some of your thoughts on your most recent conversation with the rating agencies and how that's going. I mean, you have alluded to all the accomplishments and the things that were kind of on their checklist in 2015, the equity offering in August, renegotiating POP, addressing refinancing for '16, but in light of it, I guess, some of the more recent actions sort of in the E&P space, I'm curious, if there's been any shift in the tone or the targets they've set for you?","And I'm also curious to what extent they have looked at the potential uplift for ethane. And I know it's typical in some leverage ratios to make an adjustment for capital that's already in the ground and earnings slightly to come on. Is that something that they are considering and looking at, at this point, or is it too early to tell?","Derek Reiners","We do communicate regularly with the credit rating agencies, and certainly we intend to continue to do so. I think we've got a long track record of taking those prudent actions and you\u2019ve checked them off the list pretty nicely, just as I would. The term loan and sort of being ahead of our financing needs, I think, is helpful and those things are driving commodity risk out, reducing capital, I think all of those sort of credit-friendly actions that we have taken over time plays into their thought process.","I can't tell you to what extent they may or may not be including ethane uplift. I suspect not much. But historically, they've understood and added back some credit, I think, for the capital spending over time. So what I think they look for is a track record, a plan to continue to reduce leverage. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the GAAP debt to EBITDA of 4.1x on a run rate basis is certainly supporting that we're headed in the right direction. And I think the unique aspects of our footprint, the tailwinds in terms of volume that Terry mentioned in the Williston, capturing the flare gas, those sorts of things I think all play into their thought process.","Terry Spencer","Derek, the only thing I would add to that is that I think the rating agencies from a macro perspective are aware of the growth that's happening in that petrochemical space. Now, whether they actually take that into consideration in any of their analysis, as Derek indicated, we don't know. But I think, they're certainly aware of it. And I think if you were to ask them about it, I think that they do view it as a strong positive, but whether they've actually factored that into any analysis, again, we don't know.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","In the presentation, you guys showed that the Natural Gas G&P volumes are 662 million cubic feet a day in the Rockies for the quarter. Would you be able to split that between Powder River and Williston?","Terry Spencer","Christine, I'll let Kevin handle that.","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Christine, you can assume there is roughly 30 million a day of Powder Gas in that number.","Christine Cho","And then I just wanted to touch on the ethane opportunity that you guys talked about. As you guys say, and on the slide you guys point to that 150,000 to 180,000 barrels per day being rejected across your system. Could you split that up a little better from Williston, Mid-Continent, and Permian? I know you said the least amount is coming out of the Permian, but any sort of percentages or ballparks would be helpful.","Sheridan Swords","You have over 100,000 barrels a day of ethane off in the Mid-Continent, more like 120,000 to 125,000; 36,000 in the Bakken; and virtually 10,000 or less in the Permian.","Christine Cho","And then as a follow-up to that question, you guys have a whole bunch of NGL distribution pipes leading to the Gulf Coast from Conway and Mid-Continent. What's the utilization currently on all the pipes between those two points and are you guys collecting minimum volume payments for any of the volumes? Asked another way, are customers currently paying for volumes they aren't shipping?","Sheridan Swords","See the capacity we have between Conway and Mont Belvieu is about 60% utilized between the Sterling pipelines and the Arbuckle pipelines. And when we think about our minimum volume commitment that's usually for a bundled service, so yes, there are some minimum volumes that have Belvieu redelivery that we are collecting today.","Christine Cho","I'll follow up offline, but lastly, is there sufficient ethane fractionation capacity in storage along the Gulf Coast to accommodate all this ethane that's going to have to come out?","Sheridan Swords","On our system, we have enough ethane through our fraction -- we have enough capacity through our fractionators to fractionate all of the ethane on our system. And we do have the storage capacity and the connectivity into the petchems to be able to deliver that to market.","Christine Cho","But that's specifically for your system. I was kind of more asking like does the industry have enough?","Sheridan Swords","Christine, you'd have to ask all the other individuals, fractionators down there. But my sense is yes, there is plenty of capacity to frac this ethane. Most of the fractionators when they are constructed, they are constructed for a full ethane slate. And so when this ethane is being rejected, it just takes it out [multiple speakers] first tower of the fractionators.","Christine Cho","Perfect, that's what I thought.","Operator","And moving on, we'll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","I think you guys talked about that your guidance included about 300 to 350 well connects in the Williston Basin during 2016, for I'm correct?","Terry Spencer","It's 250 to 350.","Becca Followill","What I'm looking at on Page 8 of the presentation on your guidance of 740 million a day, it looks like that includes a 100 well connects?","Terry Spencer","I'm going to make just a general comment about that slide, Becca, and then I'll let Kevin jump into more of the detail. But that's a theoretical depiction assuming that all of the flare gas gets connected and that we experience a 20% decline, and based upon that, you would need 100 wells. But now, I'll let Kevin take it the rest of the way.","Kevin Burdick","Yes. So Becca, there are a couple of things and dynamics that are going on in that, transitioning from that slide to our guidance. Like Terry mentioned, that's kind of a theoretical, assuming all the flares were out. Well, in our guidance volumes, we factor in some level, a minimal level of flaring. And keep in mind; we've got Dunn County where gas is going to flare until we get the Bear Creek plant built in the third quarter. We also factor in a little bit for weather during the winter months. And then just some general operational cushion or whatever you want to call it just to pull volumes back a little bit.","So that's the incremental difference between the 100 well connects that's referenced in the stair-step slide and our guidance. But we do feel strong when you look at the activity that's currently there in the basin, and the number of rigs on our acreage and then you look at the drilled and uncompleted backlog, we feel that the 250 to 350 is a really good number to achieve.","Becca Followill","And that's even despite recent announcements by some of the producers about suspending completion and pairing back budgets, correct?","Kevin Burdick","Yes.","Operator","And next we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","So expanding on Eric and Christine's ethane recovery question, how should we be thinking about margins regionally as ethane recovery rolls in? It's not going to be -- you're not going to get over $0.30 out of the Bakken, are you?","Sheridan Swords","We will not receive $0.30. Typically across our whole system ethane has discounted to the C3 plus, so we will realize a lower margin than the $0.30 out of the Bakken.","Craig Shere","I mean, roughly speaking, against what you're getting on the C3 plus, should we be thinking like nickel-plus spreads or what should we be thinking? Is it even those spreads across the system?","Sheridan Swords","No, it will not be even across the system. Some volume will come on that will have Conway options, some volume will have Bellevue options. And they have all different kind of spreads depending on where they are. Obviously, if you're in the Bakken, they are going to have the highest margins and the Mid-Continent will be lower, and obviously a little bit in the Permian will be the lowest.","Terry Spencer","And Craig, just let me step in here. So you used the word spreads, I think they are fees. It's not a spread play; it's a fee. And so there will be different rates, as Sheridan indicates, for different areas. And it's very common for us to have a lower fee rate for the ethane component than the C3 plus barrel.","Craig Shere","I kind of meant the discount to what you're charging for the C3 plus, that's the spread I was referring to.","Terry Spencer","I understand now. I was just trying to make sure, I don't have any misunderstanding.","Craig Shere","And thinking about 2017 capital needs, I understand you don't have any need to raise debt or equity until well into '17, but your growth CapEx in '17 for the already approved projects and execution should fall off really materially year-over-year. So when you think about incremental capital needs in '17, is that just terming things out, rightsizing the balance sheet a little bit, I mean there's not a lot of spend that you have planned, right?","Terry Spencer","I think that's a fair assessment Craig. We don't have anything of major strategic significance, in particular, in the G&P segment for 2017. So yes, you are thinking about it the right way. And in particular, if we get in this lower-for-longer mode, we do have the ability to flex down our current rate of capital spend down considerably. Now, we've not guided to that, don't intend to guide to that in this call, but I think you're thinking about it the right way.","Craig Shere","Is there some range or percentage that you think you can shave-off in a worst-case scenario?","Terry Spencer","Well, let me give you this, it's significant, and you could get to a point where just your routine growth, well connects, small infrastructure projects, compressor type projects could be the -- the core of your organic growth opportunities is that kind of stuff. And so it would be a significant reduction in the capital spend that we're experiencing here in '16; significant reduction in '17, if the lower-for-longer environment persists.","Craig Shere","And last question, following-up on Becca's query about the 100 well connects on that theoretical slide versus the 250 guidance. I know we're in a period of flux and who knows what's going to happen next quarter, but implicit in that questioning is that you continue to have a cushion supporting your operations in a worst-case scenario, even in '17, because you're not using it all this year in terms of flared gas and the drilled, but uncompleted well inventories. Do you want to address any of that in terms of how measurably things may or may not fall off next year in a worst-case scenario?","Terry Spencer","Well, let me make a comment and then Kevin can kind of clean it up. So flared gas, let me just tell you, it's not an exact science. And it's quite possible we could have more flared gas than we actually believe we have, because every time we turn on a compressor station it seems like the wells behind that particular compressor station outperform our expectations. Time and time again, more gas is showing up than what we thought.","And so that's what we're dealing with here, that's what we dealt within the fourth quarter of last year and that's what we're dealing with, as we plow through first quarter 2016. So yes, I think we would expect that it's probably not going to turn out exactly the way we think. And it could very possible that we're a big conservative on our assessments and thoughts about flared gas. Kevin, do you have anything to add to that?","Kevin Burdick","The only thing I would add, Terry, is that, again, back to the drilled, but uncompleted backlog, when you think about that we've got 550 or a little more than that behind our acreage. I don't think there's any expectation that all of that's going to get worked up this year. So as you move into through this year and you move into '17, even if the flared gas volumes go very low, you've still got some support from that drilled, but uncompleted backlog, that producers can bring on relatively quickly as prices improve.","Operator","And next we'll go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Just wanted to touch back on the call, as far as the $0.55 fee that you guys saw, how do you expect that to trend during 2016 again?","Terry Spencer","So Jeremy, we're not going to guide in the first quarters to what that fee rate is going to be, but we are expecting it to increase. And if there's any other color, I'll let Kevin address it.","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Jeremy, I mean we did experience an increase in the fourth quarter that was a little ahead of our expectations by getting some of the restructurings done earlier than anticipated. So while we do expect it to increase, I don't think it would be as pronounced as the increase from Q3 to Q4.","Jeremy Tonet","One of the questions we commonly get in this space is thinking about maintenance CapEx. How do you guys think about it as far as the depletion to the wells, how do you think about well connects as far as maintenance CapEx? And did that impact the maintenance CapEx revisions over the course of the year or any color you could provide there would be great.","Terry Spencer","Yes, Jeremy, how we look at it -- and Derek can jump in here if I mess this up. But when we think about growth capital, well connects, and those types of things, the volume through our systems, we consider that growth capital. If it's attached to revenues, if it's a revenue generating activity, we call it growth. If it's related to the straight-up maintenance of the pipelines systems and mechanical integrity of the assets we call that maintenance capital. And that's the distinction, we've used for a long time and I think many of our peers use that same thought process. Does that help you?","Jeremy Tonet","Maybe just in general, as far as maintenance CapEx coming in lower across the year, if you could just help us think through that a bit more as far as like savings through reductions in contractors or any color there would be great?","Terry Spencer","I'm going to let Wes Christensen to take that.","Wesley Christensen","Sure. In 2015, we did benefit from lower contractor costs across our projects, as well as using less contractors. Also our materials and supplied that we consume inside of those projects, we've seen some benefit in lower cost there as well. And then the last item maybe just the timing of the projects, we expect to see these types of trends continue through 2016.","Jeremy Tonet","And then just one last housekeeping item. I think there was an asset sale gain of about $6 million in the quarter. Could you provide some color on that please?","Derek Reiners","We routinely will sell-off small pieces of pipe for things like that, that really aren't integral to our systems. So that's all that is. I think it's fairly consistent from year-to-year actually we've got kind of a kind of a small amount every year, it really only impacts DCF by less than $1 million.","Jeremy Tonet","So the $6 million, was that non-cash item that's backed out in DCF then?","Derek Reiners","Exactly.","Operator","And next will go to Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank.","Kristina Kazarian","Just wanted to make sure I was understanding something that was asked earlier about leverage and rating agencies. Can you just help me understand how the conversations have been going, because I think OKS is still on negative at both? I mean you guys have listed a bunch of positives you guys have executed on since then, so what should I be watching for or thinking about or have they communicated what you guys need to execute in order to have OKS removed from negative outlook at either?","Derek Reiners","Of course, they wanted to see us execute on those things I mentioned before. Broadly the macro environment, I think is difficult for them to take us off of any sort of a watch at this point. We really forced our hand last year in August, when we did the ONEOK bond deal where they had to rate that debt, that's when they put us on negative outlook. So my personal opinion is it's difficult for them to remove that given the broader macro environment, the low pricing and so forth.","Terry Spencer","Just Christine, and the only thing I would add to that as I think they've been appreciative of the fact that we've decisively cut capital spending, have made some really prudent decisions and that we've voiced to them our willingness to continue to cut capital, if the environment dictates.","Kristina Kazarian","That's great, which leads into my second follow-up one. And I know you mentioned this earlier about the flex down on possible spend, and I'm not looking for a number at all there, but if I think about it being a lower-for-longer environment, can you touch on maybe some other things you might think about, too? So are there small like non-core asset sales? How do I think about maybe -- I know there was a number in the press release, but financial support OKE could provide for OKS and just things in that vein?","Terry Spencer","Well, Kristina, we obviously evaluate our assets at all times, but we don't see asset sales as a primary driver for us going forward. The financial flexibility that we have from ONEOK generating excess cash gives us plenty of different tools that we can use, whether it be equity purchases or considering thoughts around the IDR. We constantly evaluate what would be best for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and we're happy to have those tools at our disposal as we move forward.","Kristina Kazarian","And then last one from me, so I know we saw the fee increase in the 4Q was ahead of expectations. Just an update on progress and in terms of like how many contracts left, could I see renegotiations on or anything color there?","Terry Spencer","Kristina, most of our objectives have been met in the Williston Basin, but generally speaking, we continue to, where we can, renegotiate contracts to reduce commodity price exposure and where we can increase margin. So that's just an ongoing process. There might be a few more in the Williston, but as I said, for the most part we're done there. Western Oklahoma and Kansas, of course, will be areas of our continual focus.","Operator","And next will go to Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets.","Elvira Scotto","Thanks for all the color that you provided on sort of your volume expectations in the Williston Basin. But do you think maybe you can provide a little more color behind your Mid-Continent volume guidance, especially given how the commodity price environment has changed and producer commentary? And can you provide any, I don't know, maybe some sensitivity around that guidance?","Terry Spencer","First of all, Elvira, my contribution is going to be that rig counts in the Mid-Continent have been pretty resilient even in this latest leg down compared to some of the other basins. So I think that's been somewhat surprising to us. So Kevin, if you want to talk a little bit more specifically on volumes?","Kevin Burdick","Yes, the Mid-Continent area, especially the Stack, Cana, SCOOP areas, it's kind of interesting; because you've got really competing data points. Even as late as last week with some calls that we're out there, the performance and the results that many of our customers and other producers in the area are seeing are really outstanding, but yet there is some discussions of some delays.","And we are watching that very closely, we're in constant communication with all of our customers in the Mid-Continent. I guess the way I think about it; it's really a function of just time. Those reserves are there, the results are strong, so the volumes will come, it's just, okay, is it going to be fourth quarter of this year, third quarter of this year or a push into '17, we'll be watching that closely over the next couple of months.","Elvira Scotto","And then in terms of cost cutting opportunities, do you see any cost cutting opportunity in 2016 and is that baked into your guidance?","Terry Spencer","Elvira, yes, we do have some continued management of our cost. And obviously, we're still seeing a downward pressure on vendor cost and we've got contractor costs that are coming down, particularly as we're in a lower growth mode. Wes, do you have anything else you could add to that?","Wesley Christensen","No, I think that's consistent. We'll see that in our O&M, as well as we been seeing it in our maintenance capital.","Operator","And our final question will come from John Edwards with Credit Suisse.","John Edwards","Terry, I'm just curious on the guidance, you affirmed the guidance, but obviously since you've provided it things have deteriorated significantly. So what improvements, I guess, are you looking to in your own performance there that would enable you to affirm if you could?","Terry Spencer","Well, certainly, John, the outperformance and the exceedance of expectation in volume performance is really key. We continue to be very well hedged, as you can see from the information that we provided to you. And we're going to get the full year of the contract restructuring benefit in 2016. So from a pricing point of view standpoint, we think that there's going to be some correction or some significant improvement in prices, as we move throughout the year based upon our current point of view. So as we sit today, we like our guidance. And as Kevin indicated, we're going to continue to assess producer activity and try and get as much visibility as we can. And if we think updates are necessary, we'll come back to you.","John Edwards","And then just you may have covered this, I got disconnected part of the call. But in terms of the, you were pointing on the NGL segment sort of a second half volume story there. If you could just provide a little bit more color or detail on how you see that playing out?","Sheridan Swords","Well, first, we start up in the Bakken as you saw the volumes, even though they're slower growth than we saw last year, they continue to grow, especially with the Bear Creek plant coming online. And also, we're going to connect a third-party processing plant up there as well this year. And we have plants in the Mid-Continent that are in the SCOOP and the Stack that will be completed later on this year. So that's basically where we see the volume ramp up coming from in our volumes is from those two plays.","John Edwards","And then lastly, just in terms of counterparty risk, to what extent are you baking that into your guidance?","Derek Reiners","Yes, John, I've covered that in our remarks. And there's a new slide in the presentation that accompanies the news release that gives you a lot of detail on that. We actually feel very good about the counterparty credit risk that we have. And we're not overly exposed to any particular customer, so good diversification. So we're not expecting any sort of material credit losses.","Operator","And I'll turn it back to Mr. T. D. Eureste for any additional or closing comments.","End of Q&A","T. D. Eureste","Thank you. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in early April and extends till earnings are released after market closes in early May.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements, and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Gibson, Chairman and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. John?","John Gibson","Thanks, Dan. Good morning and many thanks to you all for joining us today. We always appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me this morning are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly financial performance and update our three-year growth forecast; Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer, who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and update you on the partnership\u2019s growth projects; and Terry Spencer, our President, who will discuss our NGL supply and demand outlook, followed by an update on our new Bakken Crude Express Pipeline.","On this morning\u2019s call, I will briefly review our first quarter results, discuss our rationale for building the crude oil pipeline out of the Bakken and then conclude with some perspective on our updated three-year growth forecast.","Let\u2019s start with our first quarter performance. Again, ONEOK Partners turned in an exceptionally strong performance, while our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly lower results, and our Energy Services segment reported a loss because of the continued decline in natural gas prices. Pierce will provide more detail on each segment\u2019s operating performance in just a few minutes. We remain confident with our 2012 earnings guidance ranges for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Although it\u2019s still early in the year, we expect the continued strong performance at the partnership to offset the weaker performance at Energy Services.","Now, a few comments about our Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Building this crude oil line is consistent with our vision statement, which includes applying our core capabilities of gathering, processing, fractionating, storing, marketing and distributing the natural gas, natural gas liquids, and other energy commodities. Our physical presence in the Bakken provides us a unique opportunity to apply our capabilities to crude oil. It\u2019s very similar to what we did when we entered the NGL business more than a decade ago.","Whenever we evaluate opportunities, whether they\u2019re capital projects or new business ventures, we answer three questions. First, how does the opportunity fit with our vision? Second, what is our competitive advantage? And finally, are we creating value for others besides ourselves? In this case, the opportunity fits our vision very well. We believe our unique knowledge of the Bakken, the presence of our existing assets, our relationships with producers and our strong commercial, construction and operating capabilities represent a competitive advantage that will create value, not only for investors, but also for producers and refiners.","For producers, this new pipeline provides a reliable mode of transportation at a lower cost versus other alternatives. It allows them to increase their net backs and receive the benefits of their high-quality crude oil. Demand for light, sweet crude has never been greater. Despite improved technology to refine heavier, sour crudes, light sweet crude is still refiners\u2019 preferred feedstock.","This new platform also is a \u2013 excuse me, this new pipeline also is a platform for future growth, creating additional opportunities to provide services to producers and refiners. As Terry will discuss later, we are well on our way to securing the supply commitments to make this pipeline economically viable. Consistent with our past practice, we only announce projects in which we have a high degree of confidence that we can secure producer commitment.","Rob will now review ONEOK\u2019s financial highlights, and then Pierce will review ONEOK\u2019s operating performance. Rob?","Robert Martinovich","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. ONEOK\u2019s first quarter net income was $122.9 million compared with $130.9 million for the same period last year, due mostly to losses in the Energy Services segment as a result of the continued decline in natural gas prices.","This quarter included a non-recurring, non-cash $10.3 million or $8.5 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge that reduced Energy Services\u2019 goodwill balance to zero, and a required $29.9 million non-cash reclassification of deferred losses to earnings on certain financial contracts related to our Storage business. This loss is similar to an LCM, or lower of cost or market charge on inventory that you may be familiar with. However, this charge relates to losses on purchase hedge contracts rather than on physical inventory. We still have gains that will be recognized in earnings during the 2012, 2013 heating season.","In February 2012, we sold ONEOK Energy Marketing Company, a natural gas retail marketing business, to Constellation Energy Group. We received net proceeds of approximately $32 million and recognized an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $13.3 million. During the quarter, ONEOK invested approximately $460 million to acquire an additional 8 million common units from ONEOK Partners in a private placement transaction. ONEOK also contributed approximately $19 million to maintain its 2% general partner interest, demonstrating our bullish view on ONEOK Partners\u2019 future growth.","ONEOK\u2019s first quarter 2012 stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $69.2 million. As the general partner and significant limited partner owner, ONEOK will receive $107 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners for the first quarter, a 32% increase from the same period last year.","We also reaffirmed our 2012 guidance with net income expected to be in the range of $360 million to $410 million. The continued strong performance at ONEOK Partners, especially from its natural gas liquids business, should offset the lower results from Energy Services. We expect ONEOK\u2019s net income to grow approximately 18% annually from our 2012 guidance through 2014, as incremental earnings from the growth at ONEOK Partners flow to ONEOK.","In April, we declared a dividend of $0.61 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. Subject to board approval, we expect to increase the dividend $0.05 per share in July. We also expect the dividend to grow by approximately 40% between 2012 and 2014, following an 18% increase from 2011.","ONEOK\u2019s liquidity position is good. At the end of the first quarter, on a stand-alone basis, we had $419.8 million of commercial paper outstanding, $34.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $188.5 million of natural gas in storage, $778.2 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility, and our total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 49%. ONEOK\u2019s significant cash flow and outstanding liquidity position continue to give us incredible financial flexibility.","Since ONEOK Partners announced the Bakken Crude Express Pipeline, we\u2019ve been asked if this project changes our uses or preferences of ONEOK\u2019s free cash flow. The short answer is no. ONEOK remains committed to providing sustainable value to our shareholders and solidifying our position as an attractive investment, whether it\u2019s by increasing our dividend, repurchasing ONEOK stock and\/or purchasing additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options, and don\u2019t view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favorable conditions.","Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK\u2019s operating performance.","Pierce Norton","Thanks, Rob, and good morning. Let\u2019s start with our Natural Gas Distribution segment. First quarter 2012 earnings were slightly lower because of higher depreciation expense primarily related to the installation of automated meter reading devices last year. The warmer weather reduced some of the commercial customer transportation demand that is not subject to weather normalization. But these decreases were partially offset by higher rates in Texas as a result of regulatory activity.","Now, a brief regulatory update; Kansas Gas Service plans to file a rate case this month that will include rate design options, further reducing our volumetric sensitivity in this area. In March 2012, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed a performance-based rate change application seeking to increase base rates by $16.2 million, resetting our regulated return on equity to 10.25%, which is slightly below the current approved 10.5%. A hearing with the commission is set for the end of June.","Now, a brief business overview of Energy Services. As we have said on previous earnings calls, we are aligning or right-sizing the transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium services customers, which means we are turning back or renegotiating transportation and storage rates. By 2015, approximately 90% of the storage capacity and more than 75% of the transport capacity will expire, providing an opportunity to either renew them at lower rates or cancel the leases.","For example, we did not renew 35 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity that expired in the first quarter and an additional 46 million cubic feet per day that expired on April 1. We do not plan to renew another 60 million cubic feet per day that will expire in the fourth quarter of this year. We began this year at just over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity, and we\u2019ll exit the year at around 0.97 billion cubic feet per day. As disclosed in our last analyst call, we still expect to reduce our targeted leased transportation capacity down to 0.8 billion cubic feet per day and our lease storage capacity to 60 billion cubic feet by 2015. John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK.","John Gibson","Thank you, Pierce. Now Rob will review ONEOK Partners\u2019 financial performance. Then, Pierce will come back to review the partnership\u2019s first quarter operating performance and growth projects, which I\u2019m pleased to say, are on time, on budget and continue to attract additional supply commitments.","Robert Martinovich","Thanks, John. In the first quarter, ONEOK Partners\u2019 net income increased 58% compared with the first quarter of 2011. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $238.8 million or $0.91 per unit compared with last year\u2019s first quarter net income of $150.9 million or $0.58 per unit. Distributable cash flow increased 51% compared with the first quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.74 times.","The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins, increased NGL volumes transported and fractionated and increased natural gas gathering and processing volumes from the growth in the Williston Basin, including the startup of the Garden Creek plant in late December.","In 2008, when commodity prices were at record levels, we used the incremental cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to use a portion of the incremental cash flow likewise in 2012 to help fund our more than $5 billion capital growth program, reducing our debt and equity financing needs.","At the same time, we are increasing distributions to our unitholders in a meaningful way. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the first quarter, and subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.025 per unit per quarter in 2012. We still expect to increase our distribution by an average of 15% to 20% annually in 2013 and 2014.","In March, we completed a public offering of 8 million common units and a private placement with ONEOK of 8 million common units, which generated total proceeds of approximately $920 million, providing significant capacity for our capital expenditures program. We also repaid $350 million of senior notes at maturity in April. With the strong performance of the NGL segment expected to continue through 2012, we\u2019ve reaffirmed and expect to be at the high end of the partnership\u2019s 2012 earnings guidance net income range of $810 million to $870 million and its distributable cash flow range of $925 million to $985 million.","We expect ONEOK Partners\u2019 EBITDA to grow approximately 20% annually from our 2012 guidance through 2014, as our growth projects go into service. We also reaffirmed our 2012 capital expenditure guidance of $2 billion, approximately $1.9 billion in growth capital and $109 million in maintenance capital.","We continue to actively hedge to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Our 2012 natural gas hedges are 78%, while our 2012 NGL hedges are 72%. The news release also provides hedging information for 2013.","At the end of the first quarter, the partnership had $746.7 million in cash and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 46% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times.","Now, Pierce will review the partnership\u2019s operating performance.","Pierce Norton","Thank you, Rob. As John said, the partnership had a strong first quarter. Operating income increased 44%, driven primarily by higher margins in the Natural Gas Liquids segment from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu, an increased fractionation in transportation capacity available for these optimization activities. Earnings also increased as a result of higher volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, specifically in the Williston Basin from the startup of the new Garden Creek plant that went into service in late December.","The natural gas gathering and processing segment\u2019s first quarter financial results were higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin and Western Oklahoma, offset partially by lower natural gas and NGL product prices on our unhedged portion of these commodities, primarily ethane and propane.","The Garden Creek plant is already processing over 90 million cubic feet per day, less than four months after going into service with full capacity expected in the very near future. Operationally, the plant has exceeded our expectations, and we continue on a record-setting pace for new well connections.","The natural gas pipelines segment\u2019s first quarter results were lower, due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas prices on our retained fuel position. Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were relatively unchanged, as the pipeline maintained its position as a low cost provider to transport Canadian supply to Midwest markets. Northern Border is substantially contracted through March 2013, and has been successful in capturing three year or longer extensions as current contracts expire.","Our Natural Gas Liquids segment continued to benefit from wider NGL differentials and more capacity available for optimization activities. The segment also benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated. We fractionated 18% more volume during the first quarter 2012, averaging 585,000 barrels per day, including the volumes fractionated at the Targa facility under our agreement that began during the second quarter of last year.","NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 25%, averaging 498,000 barrels per day during the quarter as a result of increased NGL volumes gathered on the Arbuckle Pipeline into the Mid-Continent. We still expect the Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to average $0.32 per gallon this year. While the ethane differential was $0.24 in the first quarter, we anticipate ethane differentials for the remainder of the year to increase to sufficient levels to support our average ethane guidance differential of $0.32 per gallon, as petchems ramp up demand following their maintenance turnarounds where additional capacity was added.","We have started our planned maintenance turnaround on our Mont Belvieu fractionator MB-1 and expect it to last until the end of May. During this turnaround, raw NGL volumes that were being fractionated at MB-1 either will be sent to other fractionators and\/or placed in storage. Because of the advanced planning that goes on in a turnaround, we expect this turnaround will not substantially affect our customers\u2019 operations and it\u2019s factored into our earnings guidance.","Now a quick update on our new projects. First, the Stateline I plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year, with completion of the Stateline II plant in the first half of 2013. Last month, we announced the Divide County project in the Bakken Shale that includes 270 miles of natural gas gathering system and related infrastructure that will gather natural gas in the Bakken and deliver and practically fill the remaining capacity at Stateline II.","We continue to see significant increases in drilling rig counts within our core areas in Western Oklahoma, in the NGL-rich Cana-Woodford Shale. As a result, we will construct a new 200 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, the Canadian Valley Plant, and related infrastructure. The contracts are percent of proceeds with an additional fee component, and we have significant acreage dedications in most active development areas in the Cana-Woodford Shale. Terry will discuss the new Bakken Crude Express line in a moment.","The 500-mile plus 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline, along with the expansions of the Bushton Fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline are either on or ahead of schedule and on budget. We\u2019ve acquired more than 90% of the right-of-way needed for the Bakken NGL Pipeline. We\u2019ve purchased and started taking delivery of the steel pipe. Construction is set to start in late May or early June.","Let\u2019s turn to our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast projects look. The Arbuckle Pipeline expansion was completed in April, with gathering volumes already approaching its expanded capacity of 240,000 barrels per day. In addition, our 230-mile Mid-Continent NGL gathering system expansion in the Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash was also completed in April. This project connected our NGL gathering system to three new and three existing third-party natural gas processing facilities, and is expected to add 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of raw NGLs into our NGL system.","The Sterling III Pipeline and MB-2 fractionator are progressing as planned. We have approximately 75% of the capacity committed on the 193,000 barrel per day Sterling III, which is the level of supply commitment we targeted for this project to achieve its required returns. All the capacity is committed on our 75,000 barrel per day MB-2 fractionator. Our commercial team has done a terrific job securing these supply commitments well before the assets go into service in 2013.","We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities. This backlog totals substantially more than 2 billion and it\u2019s growing.","Some of these investments will free additional redundancy and reliability and improve our connectivity to our petchem customers while others will provide the critical infrastructure that producers, processors need to get their products to market. As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we have sufficient producer and\/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.","John, that concludes my remarks.","John Gibson","Thanks, Pierce. Terry will now give you an update on our view of the current and longer-term NGL market dynamics, as well as discuss in more detail the Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I\u2019ll provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets and close with some additional color on our recently announced Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. On the NGL demand side, the petrochemical industry continues to take advantage of using ethane as its feedstock due to its strong price advantage versus oil-based feedstocks.","In the short term, several petrochemical facilities are currently conducting maintenance turnarounds reducing the immediate need for ethane. We also understand that several of these petchems are in turnarounds to increase their ethane fracing capabilities by a total of approximately 100,000 barrels per day. Dow also recently announced a world-scale ethylene cracker in the Gulf Coast to be completed in 2017, adding another estimated 100,000 barrels per day of ethane demand.","Once these planned turnarounds are completed over the next few months, demand from the petchems for ethane and the price of ethane should strengthen, particularly in Mont Belvieu. Some experts are projecting ethane demand will reach new record highs later this year and will continue to grow over the long term, especially with the petrochemical plant restarts, expansions and new facilities. As a consequence, we expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain tight, but only gradually ease as new fractionators come online over the next few years.","On the supply side, as you know, rigs have moved away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing especially on crude oil and liquids-rich plays, such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippian Lime and the Eagle Ford Shales. Fortunately, for us, our assets are well positioned in all but one of these areas. As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years, there will be some periodic over-supplies of ethane as new NGL production and infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. As we approach and move through the 2015 and 2017 timeframe, we believe there will be sufficient demand for NGLs, as new petrochemical expansions come online, as well as from growing Gulf Coast export activity.","Last month, we announced plans to build 1,300-mile Bakken Crude Express Pipeline, enabling us to serve the rapid crude oil supply growth in the Bakken Shale in the Williston Basin. Producers continue to aggressively drill in the Williston Basin, with current crude oil production in North Dakota exceeding 0.5 million barrels per day with over 200 active rigs. By comparison, in January 2011, crude oil production was approximately 340,000 barrels per day, and there were 150 active rigs.","With crude oil production expected to increase to well over 1 million barrels per day within the next five years, additional crude oil take-away capacity is required. A pipeline compared with rail or truck is the most efficient and reliable method of transporting crude oil to the marketplace, especially in the Williston Basin, where the weather is harsh and very unpredictable. More than 80% of our pipeline is designed to parallel our existing and soon-to-be-built NGL pipelines, including the Bakken NGL pipeline, that will begin construction very soon.","We will still need to acquire right-of-way for the pipeline, but knowing the geography and regulatory landscape provides us a significant advantage in estimating construction costs and understanding permitting and other regulatory requirements. Additionally, the pipeline will primarily serve those producers of light, low sulfur crude oil originating from the Bakken, as well as production from the Niobrara and in Kansas.","New connections to consuming markets along the route, particularly in Kansas, are also being considered in addition to the Cushing market center. At the moment, we are in various stages of negotiations with almost 30 producers who represent nearly all of the 0.5 million barrels per day of Williston Basin crude oil production, many of which we already have relationships with for their natural gas and NGLs. They have expressed strong interest in our pipeline because of their expected crude oil production is ramping up at an even faster pace than recent years.","Based upon current producer interest, we expect to have all of the pipeline\u2019s capacity committed within the next couple of months. However, we do plan on having an open-season process in the late summer, early fall of this year. Based on our latest estimates, we expect to generate EBITDA multiples of 5 to 7 times, a similar return from our previously announced projects. For obvious competitive reasons, we are not disclosing the proposed tariff at this time, however, it will be more competitive and cheaper than rail, with producers able to lock in rates for a longer term compared with the contract for rail capacities.","Many have asked if the partnership will need to own storage in Cushing to make this project viable. Several storage and terminal operators have contacted us about having our pipelines connected to their storage facilities. Cushing remains a key market center for crude oil due to its massive storage position, expanding capability and extensive connectivity, and several companies are building additional storage capacity to handle the incremental barrels from the Bakken and other producing regions.","While the crude oil market is well served, this fact does not preclude us from further participating in crude oil-related opportunities within the value chain to serve our customers, just like we have in the natural gas and especially the NGL business. Our company has the commercial construction and operational expertise to execute this project with an experienced team of individuals who have constructed and operated crude oil systems before. With a history of successfully building and operating long-haul liquids transportation pipelines across the country, our capabilities in developing and operating NGL pipelines will serve us well, as we move into crude oil. We are well-prepared to execute on this important project.","John, that concludes my remarks.","John Gibson","Thank you, Terry. Before we take your questions, I\u2019d like to provide some additional context to our long-term growth forecast that Rob mentioned earlier. While growth in the Bakken and the Mid-Continent will create more commodity price exposure in our gathering and processing segment and our Mid-Continent NGL assets both current and future create opportunities to capture price differentials.","Our projected earnings growth by 2014 is driven primarily by volume growth, not by higher projected commodity prices or wider differentials. If our assets or contracts allow us to capture upside, we will certainly do so, but it is not factored into our three year plan. As I\u2019ve said before, we are not in the business to predict commodity prices or play the spread. We are in the business to provide value-added fee-based services to our producers, processors and other customers.","In closing, I\u2019d like to again thank our 4,800 employees who operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day, creating the exceptional value for our investors and our customers. Our success as a company depends on their contributions, and our entire management team appreciates their efforts.","Operator, we\u2019re now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to John Tysseland with Citigroup.","John Tysseland \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, guys, good morning.","John Gibson","Good morning, John.","John Tysseland \u2013 Citigroup","Can you discuss the re-contracting environment on your Mid-Con to Belvieu NGL transportation capacity? I guess, on the existing capacity as those current contracts expire, clearly the optimization is benefiting, but are customers willing to sign some long-term firm agreements for their existing capacity? Or is the competition from, I guess, some of the newer build projects keeping customers on the sidelines in the short term?","Pierce Norton","John, this is Pierce. I\u2019ll take that question. The short answer is yes. In what we\u2019ve seen is, is that part of our optimization in the first quarter came about because we actually got the Arbuckle expansion into service sooner than we expected, and the laterals that feed to that are now being tied in. Long term, those contracts are in place. They are fixed fee, and as those new projects have now come in to feed Arbuckle, then those volumes will be fee-based volumes and will slowly diminish the amount of optimization opportunity that we have.","John Tysseland \u2013 Citigroup","So throughout the rest of the year, should we expect that some of this optimization volumes kind of decrease as those fee-based volumes increase kind of like what we were \u2013 thought was going to happen at the beginning of the year? Is that fair?","Pierce Norton","Yes, they will.","Terry Spencer","John, this is Terry. The only thing I would add to Pierce\u2019s comments is that the contracting is going very well, and as you probably recall from our discussions in previous calls that we are \u2013 we\u2019re contracting with these customers under these long-term contracts and giving those who need and desire that access to Belvieu, we\u2019re contracting them at higher rates, okay? So those rates or bundled services will get them to Belvieu. And what will happen is, is we\u2019re replacing that capacity use for optimization with this fee-based business. And that\u2019s going very well.","John Tysseland \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Secondarily, I guess when you think about the Bakken Crude line project, clearly you have good relationships with the producers in the Basin given your processing plant investments up there. So, do you envision this project just as a start of a new strategy in the crude business? And if so, where else do you think ONEOK can compete effectively? And would you look at acquisitions to jumpstart this kind of \u2013 yeah, this piece of your business?","John Gibson","John, as I indicated at the beginning, the crude oil opportunity fits us very well, because we\u2019re able to take advantage of the capabilities we already have in place, the assets we already have in place, the relationships we have in place. So building this particular crude oil pipeline makes sense for us as opposed to, let\u2019s say, building a crude oil pipeline on the East Coast or West Coast. I think obviously what has followed for us on the NGL side may also have the potential to follow on the crude oil side, i.e., secondary or third-order effects where we can serve the market and be consistent with our vision. So, short answer is, yeah, I mean, it\u2019s going to create more opportunities.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to clarify something that Terry said on the Bakken Express, if I could. I apologize, Terry, did you say that you thought that you guys would be in a position that even with kind of a binding open season coming later in the fall that you\u2019d be in a position to have all of that pipeline capacity committed? Meaning that the 200,000, or is it getting to that minimum level to make it economically viable?","Terry Spencer","Absolutely. That \u2013 we absolutely believe that and expect to be contracted for all of that capacity within the next couple of months, based upon the way discussions are going at the moment. Now, what we\u2019ll have? Once you have that in place, then we will move forward with this open season process to ensure that all possible customers who want capacity on this pipe will have the opportunity to bid on it.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great. Okay. And then that\u2019s what I was trying to get to. So it\u2019s almost as if the way you\u2019re envisioning it now is the open season is really kind of almost more with \u2013 again based on where discussions are today, is almost upside \u2013 or upsizing the 200,000 rather than the base volumes. Is that fair?","Terry Spencer","Absolutely. I mean, even as this project \u2013 as we continue to have discussions with producers, we have more potential customers coming out of the woodwork. We would expect even more to come out of the woodwork and potential opportunity, not just upstream, but downstream as well, to come out of the woodwork as we move through that open season process.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","And last question on that, if I could. You mentioned the return metric of the same 5 to 7 times. And is that something that is necessitated by achieving market-based rates on the pipeline? Or that\u2019s not required?","Terry Spencer","I\u2019m not sure I follow your question. The 5 to 7 times reflects a rate that we believe the market will bear, okay, just based upon our current assessment of the market and also relative to competitive alternatives. When you apply the volumes, and I\u2019m not going to disclose to you what volumes we have in our economics, you come up with that return in that 5 to 7 times. Does that help you?","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Yes, it does. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. I hate to beat the dead horse in the Bakken Pipeline, but I\u2019m just wondering, it is a pretty fragmented market up there. How do you think about the terms that you\u2019re looking for on the pipeline, the credit quality maybe of some of the producers that you\u2019re going to be signing up there?","Terry Spencer","Sure, Ted. From a term standpoint, we\u2019re looking at 10 plus years with a combination of firm, and there\u2019ll be dedications as well. So, when we look at the \u2013 we compare this project to the competition, to the fragmented competition, clearly its advantage is being able to lock in the long-term rates, which at the \u2013 in the current environment it\u2019s difficult to get those long-term rates, particularly as it relates to rail. Does that helps?","John Gibson","(Inaudible).","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then switching over, Pierce, you talked a little bit about thinking the spread is going to be back to $0.32 a gallon and that was in your guidance versus the $0.24 on the first quarter. It sounds like you\u2019re expecting that to be sort of flattish Conway prices and then upside to Belvieu prices. Is that what you\u2019re thinking is going to drive it closer to the $0.32 for the year?","Terry Spencer","That\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking right now. Right, Pierce?","Pierce Norton","Yeah, that\u2019s right. We expect it to widen primarily on the Mont Belvieu side.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just because of the demand side with the petchems you talked about?","Pierce Norton","That\u2019s correct.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it.","Terry Spencer","Yeah, as we \u2013 as we \u2013 this is Terry. As we talk to these petrochemical customers, particularly about their business as they come out of the turnarounds, we expect to be at record volumes with many of these customers. So, I mean, with that outlook, we\u2019ll really see the opportunity for these spreads to go considerably higher for certain periods of time in the back half of the year. But of course, as we said and as Pierce indicated in the call, that $0.32 still appears to be a pretty good number.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then the last one for me is, at the OKE level, this \u2013 in participating in 50% of the equity there, I\u2019m just wondering if you can walk us through your thinking there, the use of free cash flow at OKE relative to, say, a bigger buyback, faster dividend growth. Is there a sort of price target you have on the OKS where you\u2019d say, boy, that looks too rich for OKE to participate? Or, just walk us through the thinking on the use of free cash flow.","Robert Martinovich","Hey, Ted, this is Rob. I guess trying to think of that beyond what we\u2019ve said on the comments, but again, we\u2019re \u2013 ultimately we\u2019re targeting our capital structure at 50\/50. And so, the options kind of excluding acquisitions are dividends, share repurchases and (inaudible).","John Gibson","(Inaudible).","Robert Martinovich","So, bottom line is, I mean, those \u2013 we continue to think of those as in a mix. And depending on the time that the opportunity is in front of us, such as a share repurchase, such as the increased dividend, such as the equity offering we had earlier in the year and our projection of growth, we look at those and consider can we do it, can we do more than one. And ultimately, our financial flexibility has allowed us to do that. So I guess I don\u2019t want to say there\u2019s not a set target, but ultimately we\u2019re driven by our capital structure targets and the opportunities that we have in front of us.","John Gibson","Ted, I would add that we may have it wrong, but we don\u2019t perceive it\u2019s prescriptive. And so we look at all these options and where the market is particular point in time and try to decide what\u2019s the best thing to do.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good afternoon \u2013 good morning, guys. Quick question from me on the Bakken Crude Pipeline. Terry, I think you alluded to this or you briefly mentioned it, but are these \u2013 are you envisioning take or pay contracts when you talked about those 10-year contracts? Or is it a different type of structure, and how do you envision the mix if it\u2019s the latter?","Terry Spencer","Yes, Michael, at the moment, that\u2019s where we are, primarily ship or pay structured contract.","Michael Blum \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Helen Ryoo with Barclays Capital.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks. Good morning. I guess on OKS distribution outlook, I guess John mentioned that you still believe that you could grow OKS\u2019 distribution by 15% to 20%, and that will be driven by volume, not price. So is it reasonable to assume that even if the NGL price environment stays relatively flat or even down a bit, that level of growth is achievable?","John Gibson","Yes, Helen, it is.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Great. All right, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Becca Followill with US Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill \u2013 US Capital Advisors","Good morning. On your entering into the Crude Oil Transportation business, beyond the $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion that you talked about for the Bakken line, how big of a magnitude, or what\u2019s a magnitude of what you see as opportunities in this business?","John Gibson","Beyond the pipeline?","Becca Followill \u2013 US Capital Advisors","Yes.","John Gibson","Pierce, I\u2019ll let you answer that.","Pierce Norton","Well, I think I\u2019d mentioned, Becca, in our comments that we have well over $2 billion of growth opportunities. That\u2019s included of the entire mix. It\u2019s natural gas pipeline, it\u2019s natural gas liquids, it\u2019s gathering, processing and the crude oil business. We don\u2019t specifically talk about what those crude opportunities are out as a segment, but in total it\u2019s above $2 billion.","John Gibson","But relative to gas and gas liquids, crude oil is smaller at this point in time.","Becca Followill \u2013 US Capital Advisors","Okay. Okay, thank you. And then just clarifying your guidance, I may have missed this, but I think you talked about 40% dividend growth 2012 to 2014 for OKE. Was the prior 50%\u2013?","Robert Martinovich","The prior was 50%, but that was from 2011 through 2014. And so what we\u2019ve done, Becca, is that 2012 to 2014 is 40%, and then there was 18%, whatever the year-over-year change from 2011 to 2012 projected on, that\u2019s on top.","Becca Followill \u2013 US Capital Advisors","And that is in a commodity-neutral environment, correct?","Robert Martinovich","That\u2019s \u2013 t here\u2019s a slight uptick in commodity prices, but it\u2019s not a hockey stick by any means.","Becca Followill \u2013 US Capital Advisors","Can you tell us what commodity prices are assumed in those periods?","Robert Martinovich","No. We would go ahead and do that at our investor day in September when we lay out the full three-year financials.","Becca Followill \u2013 US Capital Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Yves Siegel with Credit Suisse.","Yves Siegel \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Two quick ones, if I could. Number one, when you think about the crude business, do you need to add management for that business?","John Gibson","Well, we \u2013 this is John. We are building that capability internally, plus we are using some industry experience that we have access to. But the plan is to build it internally.","Yves Siegel \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. And then the second question is, as the industry across the board is building all this infrastructure, what kind of cost escalation are you folks seeing? Or is there any in terms of pipe or contractors, I mean, what kind of cost pressure is there?","Terry Spencer","Certainly, Yves, this is Terry, there is cost pressure. When I think about cost pressure, I put it in perspective of what we experienced back in that 2006 and 2009 timeframe when we were executing like Overland Pass and Arbuckle. The environment today is drastically different from that environment. We are seeing some cost escalation regionally, particularly as it relates to labor and materials as well, but not anything to the extent that we saw back in that timeframe.","If you remember, Rex was under construction. Mid-Continent Express was under construction. Those are big inch pipelines and they were absorbing and taking up a lot of slack in the industry as it related to labor. So today, we\u2019re in a lot better position. But we are seeing some pressure and that\u2019s factored into our numbers.","Yves Siegel \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.","Ross Payne \u2013 Wells Fargo","How are you doing, guys? Obviously, you\u2019ve got a very de-leveraged balance sheet right now. It\u2019s looking quite good. Have you changed your parameters on how you think on leverage? And I know you\u2019ve got a lot of build to do and it\u2019s probably going to creep up from here somewhat. But if you can just kind of talk about how you see leverage playing out for the next, say, 12 or 18 months?","Robert Martinovich","Sure, Ross. I think much like we\u2019ve maybe talked before, and maybe the best thing to do is using the earlier example. In our previous build-out in 2006 to the 2009 period, the balance sheet was probably flexed up to 54% at that time in 2009. But once the projects were completed, we were back down to our 50\/50. And that\u2019s really much the way that we think about it and also that we talk with our rating agencies about as far as our plans, and recently reviewed that with them on a go-forward basis. And so, there\u2019s a slight amount of flex, but at the same point we certainly plan at the end of the build to be back at our 50\/50 capitalization target, as well as our debt-to-EBITDA targets.","Ross Payne \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And can you speak maybe a little bit more on the debt-to-EBITDA targets?","Robert Martinovich","Well, again, we just \u2013 as we stated that we\u2019re targeted less than 4.0.","Ross Payne \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. All right. Very good. Thank you.","Robert Martinovich","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Bernie Colson with Global Hunter.","Bernie Colson \u2013 Global Hunter","Hi, everyone.","Robert Martinovich","Hi, Bernie.","John Gibson","Hi, Bernie.","Bernie Colson \u2013 Global Hunter","Hi. I was just hoping you could provide us some commentary maybe about the Crude Oil Gathering business up in the Bakken and whether that\u2019s a business you care to develop.","John Gibson","Yeah, I can \u2013 I\u2019ll make a very brief comment and then turn it over to Pierce. The Crude Oil Gathering business is entirely different than the Crude Oil Transportation business that we\u2019re getting into. We do not feel necessarily we have the competitive advantage to get into gathering.","Pierce Norton","I guess what I\u2019d add to that, Bernie, is that we see maybe some spurs coming off to centrally-located collection points. We can also strategically place our pipeline in that area to connect up to the existing gathering systems, which actually adds capacity for those gatherers up there currently. So it\u2019s a win-win for everyone.","Bernie Colson \u2013 Global Hunter","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays","When the Bakken crude oil pipeline comes online in 2015, how long do you think it will take to get to this 200,000 barrels a day? Are you getting the sense it\u2019s going to be phased in over some time period? Or does it pretty much come on all at once?","John Gibson","Well, I would say that it\u2019s more than likely going to come on pretty strong, probably maybe not exactly at capacity, but very near there. And like Terry said, we\u2019re looking at ship or pay type contracts. So everybody is aligned to get that pipeline as full as possible, as quick as possible.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays","Okay. And then you talk about crude oil production going to over 1 million barrels a day later this decade, and yet your pipeline is at 200,000 a day for now. I know it\u2019s still early days, but when you decide how big you\u2019re going to size this pipeline after the open season and firming up commitments, how much room are you going to leave so that you can actually add additional capacity with pumps?","John Gibson","I think the best way to look at this is, is we\u2019ve done a lot of study on the right size for this. So we think the 200,000 really fits the growth profile. And so if you look at the various sizes of pipeline, you can actually add a second line very economically that works for both us and our shareholders as far as a risk profile, and it doesn\u2019t disadvantage or increase the prices to our customers. So we would look at it more as a phased-in where you add multiple lines, and also gives you a lot of flexibility if you do that.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays","Okay. And the economics are better that way versus just adding it with pumps?","John Gibson","Yes. We think that\u2019s correct, although you will add pumps to add capacity.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays","Okay. That\u2019s it from me.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Hi, guys. I just want to follow up a little on Ross\u2019 question about financing the expanding projects, growth projects at OKS. I understand you want to keep flexibility with free cash flow at OKE, but OKS itself is kicking out on the strong quarterly results on optimization, greater cash flow than was expected a couple of quarters ago. What are your thoughts about the need for future OKS equity funding, in light of the one you just did not long ago, and the fact that we\u2019ve got all these announcements coming right and left with you guys, and you still say you\u2019ve $1 billion backlog of unannounced projects?","Robert Martinovich","Ross, this is Rob. I guess with regards to \u2013 a couple of things, how we look at the \u2013 our CapEx spend. One, yeah, that we are having a fair announcement, but as with the timing on that Bakken crude line, that\u2019s going to be insignificant this year, really the bulk of that coming in 2014 from a spend standpoint. So as we place those capital investments on top of the \u2013 what we\u2019ve already got, plus the Woodford Shale investment, we still come back to recognizing that the optimization margins are \u2013 that we\u2019re currently realizing are not going to be sustainable, as we\u2019ve said.","And so we are using some of that cash flow to pre-fund our capital projects. We did have the equity project offering in March, a year ago in January we had $1.3 billion of debt. I think you all can figure out kind of what would be mixed in the tranche, but the key thing on that is the optimization margins and how we use that going on.","And as we\u2019ve said before, we typically do not \u2013 we don\u2019t signal when we\u2019re coming next to market and what tranche, but we\u2019ve got this obviously planned out. And we feel good with regards to supporting Terry and Pierce\u2019s business on the existing projects, plus, as you heard Pierce say today, the $2 billion of unannounced projects.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","But it\u2019s fair to say that you are very willing to, given the EBITDA that\u2019s going to hit when these things come on, to let those things stretch a little bit and obviously not lead with the equity offerings?","Robert Martinovich","When you mean to stretch, can you come back on that? I think I know what you want, but I just want to clarify that.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Well, so your \u2013 let your credit metrics stretch again the way they did before, before the most recent equity offering.","Terry Spencer","Oh yeah. Yeah. And when I was talking to Ross, I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t clear on that, but that\u2019s exactly right. When I referenced that, 2006 to 2009 period, that\u2019s what we would do and that\u2019s what we have reviewed with the rating agencies. And so, again I think from our standpoint, obviously there\u2019s got to be a point that you come back, and that\u2019s what we clearly communicated and that\u2019s our expectations to get back to that 50\/50, as well as those debt-EBITDA targets that we\u2019ve laid out for ourselves.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Louis Shamie with Zimmer Lucas.","Louis Shamie \u2013 Zimmer Lucas","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","John Gibson","Hi, Louis.","Robert Martinovich","Good morning, Louis.","Pierce Norton","Hey, Louis.","Louis Shamie \u2013 Zimmer Lucas","So, I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on one of the comments you made regarding the crude pipeline where you thought you could pick up some volumes from Niobrara, and it sounds like potentially the Mississippian Lime play. Can you talk a little bit more about that opportunity and how that might shape how the pipeline is ultimately developed, if you see strong demand for shippers out of those regions?","Terry Spencer","Sure, Louis. As you\u2019re probably aware, that Niobrara and that Mississippian Lime activities has been really phenomenal. There\u2019s absolutely no doubt that we\u2019re going to have the opportunity to move crude out of those areas. That crude happens to be a sweet, low sulfur. It\u2019s a little bit more sour, slightly more sour than Bakken crude, but still is going to fit very nicely within the design parameters of this pipeline and within our operating objectives. So \u2013 I mean, we really do believe that we\u2019re going to have some supply from that area. However, it is possible that the Bakken absolutely satisfies all of the pipelines and fills all of the pipelines capacity and we may not necessarily have to move crude out of those areas.","Louis Shamie \u2013 Zimmer Lucas","Would it make sense to do something like have a telescoping line or something like that where your capacity is greater as you get closer to Cushing, or \u2013 if there\u2019s material demand coming from both places?","Pierce Norton","Louis, that\u2019s \u2013 you could either telescope or you could loop the line. And if you loop the line, and I kind of alluded to this a few minutes ago, is that you get the flexibility to kind of bifurcate those qualities of crude. So, you\u2019ve got both of those options available to you.","Louis Shamie \u2013 Zimmer Lucas","That\u2019s pretty interesting. All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with UBS.","Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 UBS","Hey, good morning, guys.","John Gibson","Good morning.","Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 UBS","Rob, just a quick question and I wanted to follow-up on Becca\u2019s question about the dividend. Is that predicated on the same sort of previously-stated payout ratios you guys had outlined?","Robert Martinovich","It is, sure is.","Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then, given the notion that sort of in a roughly priced neutral environment, most of the growth is sort of throughput-driven, we see what\u2019s going on at the producer level. Given that the peer \u2013 some of your peers are sort of ever sort of increasing, I guess, inching up on their payouts, is there any appetite to maybe move beyond sort of that 70% threshold? Or are you guys pretty comfortable with the range?","Robert Martinovich","Yeah, we took a hard look at that late last year. And certainly, it\u2019s an inexact science, but at the end of the day, looking at peers, and we felt that, that 60% to 70% was good. What we needed to do, quite frankly, or maybe even, you would say, target more of that upper half of the range, that 65% to 70%, but what we needed to do was to execute on that. And that was certainly one of the driving factors for the increase in dividend that we came out with in January, upping from $0.04 that we had guided in September, to the $0.05.","So, we\u2019re trying to be mindful of that and get a little bit of history on that. The clarification that I would like to add, that I mentioned with regards, we\u2019ve got slightly escalating commodity prices. But on the flip side on that, as we\u2019ve talked about in these calls before, we\u2019ve got our spreads going down as well between Mont Belvieu \u2013 or Conway and Mont Belvieu. So that\u2019s, you\u2019ve got a little bit of an offset to that as well when you look at the total commodity environment.","Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 UBS","Sure, okay. Appreciate the color, guys. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Reichman with Simmons.","Mark Reichman \u2013 Simmons","Just a quick question on the Bakken Express. I\u2019m assuming that $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion is just for the 200,000 barrels per day of capacity. And if you get increased interest, you mentioned the possibility of looping the line, which I appreciate would give you added flexibility. But would it be a substantial bump up in cost just to go to a larger diameter pipeline? Or, how do you think about that?","Pierce Norton","Actually, it is. I mean, if you look at the numbers, when you go up into the 30 to 36-inch range, you\u2019re in kind of a totally different element when it comes to cost. Because of the weight that you\u2019re handling, it\u2019s just a different construction method. So it\u2019s significantly more costly when you get to 30, 36 as opposed to the 20, 24-inch range.","Mark Reichman \u2013 Simmons","So your preference is to loop it?","Pierce Norton","Yes.","Mark Reichman \u2013 Simmons","Okay. Great. Thanks.","John Gibson","Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. This ends our conference call. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in early July and extends until earnings are released after the market closes on July 31, followed by our conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern, 10:00 a.m. Central on August 1.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead.","T.D.

For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Starting our earnings conference call is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry?","Terry K. Spencer","Thanks, T.D. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.","Joining me on the conference call today is Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial results. Also with me and available to answer your questions are: Rob Martinovich, our Executive Vice President of Commercial; Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids; and Wes Christiansen, our Senior Vice President of Operations.","On this morning's call, we will review our first quarter 2014 financial and operating results, we'll discuss the repositioning of ONEOK as a pure-play general partner, we'll discuss our increased project backlog and bring you up-to-date on our completed capital-growth projects, and then we'll review the NGL markets.","Let's start with our first quarter performance. ONEOK's income from continuing operations attributable to ONEOK was up more than 60%, and reflects higher operating results at ONEOK Partners from higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold, wider natural gas liquids location and product price differentials, primarily related to increased seasonal demand for NGLs, and higher natural gas transportation and storage revenues due to increased park-and-loan services due to strong seasonal demand for natural gas in the Midwest.","Today, we are reaffirming our 2014 financial guidance, both at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but as is our practice, we will continue to review our expected performance as the year progresses and make any adjustments as appropriate. We also expect our natural gas liquids volumes to continue to increase during the year. I'll provide more color on that in a few minutes.","This is our first quarter during which ONEOK operated as a pure-play general partner. Our primary purpose now is to provide the management and resources to ONEOK Partners to execute on its growth strategies, so that the Partnership can increase its distributions to unitholders, including ONEOK, enabling ONEOK to maximize its dividend payout to shareholders.","In April, the Board approved a 40% increase, clearly demonstrating our commitment to pay out the majority of our cash in the form of dividends. We plan additional dividend increases in 2014, and expect an average dividend increase of 20% to 25% between 2013 and 2016.","Derek now will review ONEOK Partners' and -- ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' financial highlights, including the one-time expenses and charges that we mentioned in our news release. And then I'll review our operating performance. Derek?","Derek S. Reiners","Thanks, Terry, and good morning. First quarter of 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $94 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. Both the former natural gas distribution and energy services segments have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Income from continuing operations attributable to ONEOK was approximately $92 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with first quarter of 2013 income from continuing operations of approximately $57 million, or $0.27 per diluted share.","First quarter 2014 net income was affected by onetime items reflected in continuing operations and discontinued operations, related to the separation of ONE Gas and the wind-down of the energy services segments as follows: Income from continuing operations includes net onetime benefits of $4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which includes a net increase in deferred income tax expense of $26 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, associated primarily with a reduction in ONEOK's estimated effective state income tax rate; and an after-tax expense of $22 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, as a result of the early retirement of debt.","Income from discontinued operations includes net onetime benefits of $2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, which includes $48 million of operating income from the former natural gas distribution segment in January; $15 million operating loss from energy services segment; $22 million in costs associated with the ONE Gas separation; and $9 million in other expenses, primarily interest and income taxes.","As a reminder, our 2014 guidance assumed a January 1, 2014 effective date for the separation of the natural gas distribution segment into ONE Gas versus the actual January 31 date. We received approximately $61 million of cash flow from that segment in January and funded ONE Gas with $60 million on January 31. So the impact of the later separation date on our guidance for cash flow available for dividends was insignificant.","In the first quarter of 2014, ONEOK received $141 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2013. First quarter 2014 cash flow available for dividends was $211 million, providing 1.82x coverage. ONEOK increased its quarterly 2014 dividend, $0.16 per share to $0.56 per share, effective for the first quarter 2014, resulting in an annual -- an annualized cash dividend of $2.24 per share.","During the first quarter, we deleveraged our balance sheet and reduced our credit facility to $300 million, supporting our pure-play general partner strategy. We used a one-time cash payment of approximately $1.13 billion received from ONE Gas in January to repay $600 million of commercial paper borrowings and repay early $552 million of senior notes. We do not anticipate any short-term borrowings going forward, and now have $1.1 billion of long-term debt, with the next scheduled maturity in 2022.","And a clarification in our news release. A word was inadvertently dropped from the initial release in one paragraph regarding our 2014 dividend guidance. Our dividend declared in April of $0.56 per share represented a 40% increase, rather than a $0.40 increase.","Now let's move on to ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners' first quarter net income was approximately $265 million, or $0.81 per unit, compared with $157 million, or $0.42 per unit in the first quarter of 2013. In the first quarter, distributable cash flow was $298 million, a 54% increase compared with the previous period, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.28x for the quarter. We increased our first quarter 2014 distribution to $0.745 per unit, an increase of 4% from our first quarter 2013 distribution of $0.715 per unit.","In the news release, we provided some updates on our hedges, as we continue to hedge commodity risk when appropriate. At the end of the first quarter, the Partnership had $115 million in cash and cash equivalents; $125 million of commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility; a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55%; and a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7x.","During the quarter, we issued $57 million, or 1.1 million common units, through our at-the-market equity program, compared with 680,000 common units issued all of last year. We expect to continue to utilize this program to manage our equity issuances over time. We have ample liquidity to support the Partnership's ongoing capital growth program, including access to nearly $1.6 billion under our credit facility as of March 31.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry K. Spencer","Thank you, Derek. At ONEOK Partners, the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment's first quarter operating income was up 78% due to higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold, and higher natural gas liquids volumes sold as a result of recently completed capital-growth projects and higher realized natural gas liquids prices. The segment continues to grow natural gas volumes in the Williston and add well connections.","Growth volume in the first quarter 2014 compared with the fourth quarter 2013 did increase slightly. However, natural gas volumes were affected by well freeze offs across our system due to severe cold weather. We have already seen a significant ramp-up in natural gas volumes across our system as the weather has improved since February. Our 2014 natural gas gathered and processed volume growth is heavily weighted towards the second half of 2014.","As you know, we proactively hedge to mitigate our commodity exposure, created by our percent-of-proceeds contracts. Since we were approximately 70% hedged in the first quarter 2014, prices were less of a factor.","The Natural Gas Liquid segment's first quarter results were 65% higher, due to significantly wider natural gas liquids location price differentials, related primarily to weather-related increased seasonal demand for propane. Midwest propane demand increased in the first quarter 2014 due to much colder-than-normal temperatures. And propane demand and prices were higher at the Mid-Continent market center in Conway, Kansas than they were in the Gulf Coast market center in Mont Belvieu, Texas. We were able to benefit from these market conditions because of the operational flexibility of our integrated assets, which enabled us to quickly respond to the needs of our customers.","The severe cold weather temporarily affected our natural gas liquids supply deliveries into our systems. Natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated were sequentially down for a second consecutive quarter, as a result of severely cold weather and the termination of a contract. While our natural gas liquids volumes were down sequentially, our fee-based exchange services revenue has increased each year, as our customers secure more capacity under long-term firm contracts. As I mentioned earlier, our natural gas liquids volume guidance is weighted more toward the second half of the year. We expect natural gas liquids volumes to increase during the remainder of the year, as weather-related conditions continue to improve, along with the continued ramp-up of previously connected natural gas processing plants. Also, 5 of the 10 connections to new processing plants we plan for 2014 have been completed through April, with the balance occurring between now and the end of the year.","The Natural Gas Pipeline segment's first quarter 2014 results were significantly higher, up 53% due to increased rates and park-and-loan services as a result of strong weather-related seasonal demand. This level of park-and-loan activity was driven by strong Midwest weather-related demand, and clearly demonstrates the value of our market-connected natural gas pipeline assets, particularly during periods of peak demand. These assets primarily serve on-system customers, such as local natural gas distribution companies, electric generation facilities and large industrial customers -- or consumers, that is, that require natural gas to operate their business.","In general, ONEOK Partners' natural gas pipeline customers need natural gas supply to run their businesses, regardless of location price differentials.","As oil and liquids-rich natural gas development continues within our core areas, the need for midstream infrastructure grows. We are increasing our unannounced capital project backlog estimate to a range of $3 billion to $4 billion, from the previous range of $2 billion to $3 billion. This updated backlog does not include any potential acquisitions or the multibillion dollar crude oil pipeline project that we continue to discuss with producers in the Williston Basin. The backlog represents more of the same type of midstream projects that we continue to successfully develop and execute. This capital backlog reflects our continued commitment to serve our customers' needs in the Mid-Continent, Midwest and Gulf Coast regions and in particular, the Williston and Powder River Basins, where the majority of this incremental capital increase is targeted, and where producers continue to successfully develop acreage positions within our asset footprint. As we said previously, once we receive sufficient contractual commitments, we will announce these projects.","Now an update on our announced capital growth program. In March, we completed approximately $1 billion of capital-growth projects on top of the almost $4 billion in previously completed projects and acquisitions since 2010. The recently completed projects include: The 550-mile Sterling III NGL pipeline that has the ability to transport up to 193,000 barrels per day of either unfractionated NGLs or NGL purity products from the Mid-Continent to the Texas Gulf Coast; the Canadian Valley plant, a 200 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility in the Cana-Woodford Shale of Oklahoma; and the Mont Belvieu ethane\/propane spitter, a 40,000-barrel per day deethanizer. All of these completed projects will contribute to earnings during the remainder of 2014.","Now a brief review of our outlook on the NGL markets. We still believe that ethane rejection by natural gas processing plants connected to our natural gas liquids system will continue through at least 2016, after which new worldscale ethylene production capacity is expected to begin coming online. We believe the propane location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu will continue to widen, as Midwest inventories have been increasing more rapidly than Gulf Coast inventories. Current Midwest inventories are down 9% compared with last year, and 11% lower than the 5-year average, while current Gulf Coast inventories are down 36% compared with last year, and 14% below the 5-year average.","The industry has experienced deep ethane rejection since late 2012, and has experienced some market disruption due to the extreme weather conditions. Our integrated assets have performed well in these extreme conditions, further demonstrating their value. In closing, I'd like to thank the employees of the new ONEOK, whose skills, experience, commitment and dedication allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day, and create exceptional value for our investors and customers. Our management team and Board appreciate their hard work and commitment to make our company successful.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ethan Bellamy with Baird.","Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Do you guys want to be in the ethane export business?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Ethan, we do. And for us, it's still a bit early. We obviously have been listening to the enterprise's project updates, with respect to ethane exports. We've always been supportive of it. We've always believed that ethane exports in this industry will happen. The right time for us will be a function of our relationships with customers, developing international markets. But it's still a bit early for us. Certainly, it's something that we're -- that we consider, along with other export opportunities, particularly as it relates to propane and LPGs. But I guess, the short answer is yes.","Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. With respect -- something a little bit more granular. With respect to potential incremental restrictions on gas flaring in the Bakken, Williston, is that a risk or an opportunity for you guys? And is it changing your strategy at all there? Or are you just pedal to the metal in terms of construction activity?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, the flaring certainly creates a very high sense of urgency from our producers. And that in and of itself creates the opportunity. We are absolutely committed to reducing the flaring, building the infrastructure necessary to allow these producers to not only reduce their impact to the environment, but also enhance their sales revenues. So certainly, as the flaring continues in the Bakken, it is clearly creating opportunity for us. Ethan, let me just make one comment, going back to the ethane question, which, I think was a great question. With respect to ethane exports, our role does not necessarily have to be operating or managing export docks, okay? Our role could be on the upstream side, and most likely will be on the upstream side, providing that infrastructure -- transportation infrastructure, storage and fractionation infrastructure necessary to get that ethane to those facilities. So I just wanted to add that comment.","Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. From a perspective of OKE tax rate, can you give us any guidance over long-term, what we should expect there, current thinking?","Derek S. Reiners","Sure, Ethan. That -- I think what we have guided there is a 15% to 25% cash tax rate. As we look at 2014, we haven't -- a net operating loss it would be working off. But we expect to pay cash taxes beginning in 2015. Of course, that's all subject to any legislation that may come down, particularly as it relates to bonus depreciation.","Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you elaborate a little bit on that? I just want to make sure I understand that.","Derek S. Reiners","Sure. If bonus depreciation were enacted for 2014, say, then that would generate additional deductions for the unitholders. ONEOK, of course, being a large unit holder. And so that would provide those additional deductions, would push out further the cash taxes that we'd have to pay.","Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you quantify that? Is that low end of that range or...","Derek S. Reiners","No, I really can't. We've provided that 15% to 25%. It's a fairly difficult number to get to, as you think about the timing of projects coming on and capital spend and that sort of thing. That -- all those things influence the depreciation deduction at the unitholders. So I think we'll stick with that 15% to 25%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Terry, can we get a little more color, if possible, on the sequential drop in the NGL volumes? And I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, is how much of the impact came from the contract termination versus, perhaps, the well freeze-offs? Was that contract termination something that you had envisioned in the 2014 guidance? And I guess, do you still think the numbers that, perhaps, we discussed in December are still feasible to get to for the year?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, first of all, the impact from weather, as it relates to the Natural Gas, Liquids business, is about 5% to 10%, roughly. The contract that we've referenced, the termination of the contract, we're not going to talk and provide any details. We typically don't, as it relates to our relationships with our -- contractual relationships with the customers. So I can't comment on that. But what I can tell you about that contract is that it was a sizable contract, and that it was one of our very thin margin arrangements. So it was, I would say, out of the market. So that was the reason why that contract was terminated. As far as the last, I think...","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","It's just as far as being able to still make the guidance as far as the NGLs fractionated, gathered, et cetera for the year?","Terry K. Spencer","Absolutely. We have a number of things going on in that segment, supplies from new process and plant connections. We've got the Sterling III Pipeline, and that we're going to have 9 months of that. We got the impact from NGL supplies coming from our own affiliated processing plants. So we got a lot of things -- a lot of things happening, ramping up, back-end loading that financial performance. So that's kind of how we fill that gap.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Understood. And maybe then last question, if I could. Just shifting gears. Certainly, nice to see the growth in the unannounced backlog. I didn't know really, 2 things off of that. One, as you see more products going into the development evaluation, perhaps, even competitive bid phase, do you see any changes in the returns, perhaps, as more competition has come into the Williston Basin, for instance? So that's one question. And the second is, is there any sense of -- notwithstanding whatever shippers will find, but any sense of timing, if we're looking at things that are possible over the next 12, 18 months, or if these are much more back-end, 2-, 3-year type of baking horizons?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, first of all, from an economic performance perspective, these projects, we're still seeing these things come in, and at 5x to 7x. So we really don't -- because of the strength of our footprint, and in particular, in the Bakken, we haven't seen much pressure on the economics. From a timing standpoint, it runs the whole gambit [sic] [gamut]. I mean, we -- certainly, the projects that are more infrastructure-related, it is projects that are gathering upstream of our processing facilities in the Bakken. Those projects are going to happen faster. That is well-connect type projects. But the ones that will be longer lead time will be processing plants, large trunk lines, compression facilities. That type of thing will take more time. Infrastructure projects, like fractionators, will take longer time. Those will -- certainly, the construction period for fractionator's a couple of years. But -- so I hope that maybe that gives you a sense. We've not been real specific on the timing of our growth -- capital growth backlog, but hopefully, that gives you a sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Question on the nat gas pipelines. Given the strength that you guys saw in the segment, and given the low levels of supply out there in storage, did you guys have an opportunity to lengthen out average contract duration on the pipes or on the storage? Did that -- did market conditions tightening up and helping you on that front?","Robert F. Martinovich","Jeremy, hi. This is Rob. With regards to the -- our contract term, it's about -- it's pretty similar to what we talked about the last quarter, in that approximately 7- to 7.5-year timeframe. So, I mean, as renewals -- obviously, as renewals come up, they -- coming up all throughout the year, and so, well you certainly had some come up at, in the first quarter, but I -- it wasn't markedly different because at end of the day, as we stated in the release, and as Terry did, we don't see this as sustainable. And people recognize that.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then, just going back to the unannounced project backlog. I was wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit of color as far as which segments might seeing more of this backlog increase? And also, could this potentially include LPG exports or just any updated thoughts on that?","Robert F. Martinovich","Sure. I guess, Jeremy, with regards to the kind of the incremental, where Terry kind of focused in on was specifically in the Williston Basin and the Powder River Basin. So that would be the gathering, processing plant's infrastructure, and then appropriate connects from a standpoint -- of a liquids standpoint. But certainly, as you broaden out that, and look at the overall, kind of the $3 billion to $4 billion, excluding that incremental increase over the 2 to 3, those are exactly the type of things that we're talking about, that from G&P, but also get into the NGL functions, with regards to fracs, pipelines. And certainly, we're still evaluating export opportunities, both from a supply, as well as facilities themselves.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to dig in a little bit more on this $73 million pick up in the optimization revenues here. And it looks like -- can you guys talk a bit more about the -- I think it was propane location differentials versus ethane, and then maybe come back to some of your comments around the differences and where the -- we're seeing in storage for Gulf Coast versus Mid-Con, and how that impacts how you're thinking about the optimization opportunity going forward?","Terry K. Spencer","Sheridan?","Sheridan C. Swords","On the -- as we said, the $71 million as it relates a lot to propane, just by using our infrastructure, everything we're have, we were able to capture a portion of that Conway to Belvieu spread on some volume that helped us going forward. On the propane spreads between Conway and Belvieu going forward, we do believe that as export demand continues to be strong, and as we get -- as we're in the fill season in Conway that, that spread will widen out from where it is today. And on the ethane side, it's more crackers, more demand comes on this summer with Geismar and La Porte coming on that, that will also increase the demand in Belvieu for ethane, which will allow ethane spreads to widen as well.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. So you're thinking that spread -- because we obviously, had it reversed in the first quarter on propane, where Conway was higher. You're just thinking the Gulf Coast is going be higher-priced for both products? And just sure -- making sure I understand?","John K. Tysseland - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. From here forth, not from an average for the year, but from here forth, that, that will be there and it will widen a little bit from where it is today.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then, I was going to ask just about the -- any shifts that you're seeing and coming back to sort of the question on flaring on the contracts that you're going to sign in the Williston here for potential new processing plants, moving beyond maybe just acreage dedication, given that some minimum volumes, do you want to stick with sort of that POP contracts, would you rather do some more fee-based, given that you're probably going to see high demand, I would imagine, from your producer customers?","Sheridan C. Swords","Ted, we're going to stick with the current structure. I mean, what's that the market -- that's what the market wants. Those POP structures, with the fee-based flavor to them are what's working for us, what has worked for us. And we expect will continue to work for us, as we go on in the future.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a last one for me. Just -- you've increased the backlog, it sounds like, for OKS. And then, presumably that would then push through to higher cash flows and distributions, and then up to OKE. I'm just wondering if we can talk about, as you look out to '15 and '16, and your dividend growth guidance, maybe just focusing on OKE of 10%. Could we see that number notch higher as we bring these projects in?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes. I mean, potentially, you could. Certainly we -- as far as the -- our dividend strategy is certainly to be in line with our peer group.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, sorry, I did have one more, if I could ask. Just on the balance sheet for OKE. Any thoughts -- updated thoughts, now that you've closed the ONE Gas spend, in terms of where you want to target the leveraged metrics? Do you want to be investment grade there?","Derek S. Reiners","Yes, Ted. We'd sure like to be investment grade there. Of course, Moody's does have us there. S&P's got us a notch below. It's not critical to our strategy to be investment grade at OKE. But I think it'd be nice to have a differentiator for us to be there. Our leverage is going to be sub 2x, I think, as you look out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to circle back on basis. I mean, I probably ask you this every quarter, seemingly. But on the gas side, it did seem like the price realizations, given the level of hedging and the price of the hedging, suffered some basis disconnect again. I know we saw this in the third quarter, and you mentioned some Bakken issues that were resolved. And we saw them resolve in the fourth quarter. But curious with the first quarter, if that was weather-driven, if there was something else going on, if you could sort of help me understand how it might resolve itself as we move through the year?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, I would say that certainly on the spot side or cash side of the business, the unhedged side, certainly, there were some realizations due to the weather -- some impacts due to weather, rather. But Rob, did you get -- anything you can add to...","Robert F. Martinovich","I don't think there's any -- any additional color on that, Terry.","Terry K. Spencer","I mean we've -- the prices -- the net realized prices stay pretty close to the same in-line, quarter-over-quarter. It's a function, Chris, of where you set the hedge prices at. And we set them at a price that -- that, I mean, we've got that clearly in our hedge tables. We set it at a low $4 price. That's reflected in this net realized price. It's -- as we -- our hedging policy, we target a 75% hedging level, okay? We don't try to pick prices as we move throughout the year, because we're not very good at picking prices. We try to exercise discipline and systematically hedge ourselves as we move through the year, regardless of where the prices trade. And so, they fall out where they fall out. I hope that helps.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Yes, just, I guess, given the hedge level, the price and then sort of what happened, certainly with gas pricing in the quarter, I would've thought -- we would've maybe seen a better aggregate realization. But I'll just dig in a little bit deeper on that off-line, Terry. I guess, switching real quick to Sterling III. Congrats on having that come in. I did notice in last night's release there were some very minor adjustments to some of these specs listed there, in terms of capacity -- expandable capacity, CapEx link, things like that. I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about those amendments, the implementation was a little bit delayed over the winter. Was it tied to that? And did you get any additional commitment to carry for that line? I think we were at about 75% before.","Terry K. Spencer","Rob? Take that one?","Robert F. Martinovich","Sure. With regards to the timing, it was weather. Weather got us at the tail end of the fourth quarter, and then the severe weather that we saw in the first quarter was the reason for the delay. With regards to the cost, we're still feeling good with regards to the -- where we've got that bracketed, where we just have. Obviously, there are some invoices still coming in on that, as we wrap up the payment. But at the end of the day, I don't think we're concerned with regards to where that CapEx is going.","Terry K. Spencer","Wes, do you have anything you want to add to that?","Wesley John Christensen","No, I agree with Rob's comments. I believe we're confident in our range.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess, just -- there was like an extra 10,000 barrels a day of sort of the expandable capacity. So is that just -- I -- and I realized it's very minor, but I was just curious, is that just better understanding of the project itself, or what would sort of change the scope on that upper end?","Terry K. Spencer","Sure. We can -- as we continue to look at that pipeline and where we position boosters and everything else like that, there's a potential that we can move the expandable capacity higher, as we continue to go forward. That's what you're seeing in that number.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. Final question for me, guys. Just realize 1Q was seemingly all about propane and propane spread. But we've seen consistently strong deltas on isobutane. And just wondering, Terry, if you can offer any commentary about the, sort of the ability to capture. I know you have an isom unit in the Mid-Con. And we're still seeing some nice premiums up there.","Terry K. Spencer","Yes. And I can assure you, it's running flat out. Sheridan, you got anything to add?","Sheridan C. Swords","I mean, yes, obviously we capture the spread in the isom unit, but also that demand up in Conway allows us to increase throughput on our door system as we deliver ISO into the refineries in the upper Midwest as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","[indiscernible] talked to today on their earnings release about an upsized frac, on new completion technology in the Cana-Woodford. Do you guys have exposure to them there as they ramp up drilling?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, we have lots of exposure to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","So picking up on Ted's question on spreads and Sheridan's comments about Geismer, and I think, a Lyondell plant expansion coming online in the summer. And Terry, your comments around changes in propane supply and demand creating some permanently expanding basis differentials. Can you put some more color on what exactly you all expect to see in terms of the Conway to Belvieu spreads? Are you still thinking the high single-digits? And how do you see ethane exports impacting this, going out a couple of years?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes. Well, let me -- I'll take this, and then Sheridan can kind of follow up with it. Yes, as we look -- as we move into the balance of the year, we see spreads widening out from where they currently are, particularly for ethane and propane. Both spreads, we expect to be in that $0.08 to $0.10 a gallon range, as we move through the balance of the year, driven by those very things that Sheridan mentioned earlier, stronger petrochemical demand, lower inventories. Inventories for ethane are coming down, and of course, the strong export demand for propane. So Sheridan, you got anything else to add to that?","Sheridan C. Swords","The only thing I'd add is your other question was on exports. That exports, obviously, that -- it's just like bringing on more demand in '16 that we didn't see. And it's not as dependent upon the big buildout of the crackers. So that's -- and in long-term helped ethane prices.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Right. No one has been modeling that up until now in their supply and demand picture. All right, and digging more into the expanded growth CapEx pipeline line of sight, can you elaborate on the capacity to expand into the Niobrara and specifically, to break into oil opportunities?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, we can, Craig. That footprint was a natural extension of our existing footprint. And it's connected by our NGL position. It's a great platform for us to get into a new basin, to participate in gathering and processing, as well as liquids. I think the opportunity for us to invest in the crude oil side of the business up there as well is there. So, yes. I mean, it's a great extension, and it is going to afford us lots of opportunity. I think the drilling results have been very good, and we're continuing to see a lot of development. We're having success at signing up new acreage packages to our facilities, and our expectation is for this asset footprint to be a big part of our business.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Sounds good. And last question I've got, on the credit side. The credit agencies kind of take a jaundiced view of assets that -- as cash flows trickle down, or in this case, trickle up to support debt, that's not at the entity that actually directly owns the asset. If it's just too tough to run up and down the escalator here, and you're just not going to get an S&P investment-grade credit, at a certain point, do you say to yourselves, \"Well, given that we have such a strong balance sheet, should we think about this as dry powder?\" And instead of worrying about keeping the, or achieving investment-grade, should we just think about maybe levering up, up to a comfortable point, to support a very economic ongoing expansion, be it acquisition or organic growth at OKS, or even temporarily at OKE?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Craig, certainty, that's something you could consider. But certainly not high on our list. Our strategy is very clear, to operate ONEOK as the, a pure-play holding company. We really don't have any plans on the horizon to make investments or to lever up OKE. The strategy of maximizing the cash dividend to our shareholders is top priority. And we won't operate with blinders on. We'll always be aware of opportunities that are out there. We'll have -- we'll be flexible. But as we sit today, this is our priority.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Edwards with Credit Suisse.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one more follow-up on the increase in the backlog. What kind of changes to the mix of those projects are you seeing?","Terry K. Spencer","Rob?","Robert F. Martinovich","Hey John. Well, with regard to that incremental, it's going to be more weighted towards GNP, as Terry mentioned, from a processing opportunity, in both the Bakken and the Powder River basins.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's something incremental. And are you seeing any changes to that underlying?","Robert F. Martinovich","The underlying? No. I mean, there's little things that float around, but pretty much that's staying within what we've previously thought the backlog would turn out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Helen Ryoo with Barclays.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The -- on the optimization margin, the -- was there a change in the capacity you've allocated to the optimization business this quarter versus a year ago?","Terry K. Spencer","Sheridan, let me take this first part, and you can follow up with it. But we've -- Helen, we don't, and have not historically talked about our optimization capacity and optimization throughputs. So we won't change that now. Sheridan, have you got anything you want to say?","Sheridan C. Swords","The only thing I can say is that actually, we continue to try to turn that into fee-based. Return our optimization capacity into fee-based revenue.","Terry K. Spencer","And you certainly see that in the exchange revenue portion of our business as it continues to grow. So Helen, for competitive reasons, that's why.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, I understand. I -- Just directionally, I was wondering, I know you don't give out the actual capacity number, but just directionally, this quarter versus a year ago, whether there has been a significant change in how much optimization volume you were running or not. But I understand. And then just, I guess, related to this and maybe you won't be able to answer this, but I'll just throw it out. You just talked about how you expect the ethane and propane spread to widen going forward. And I guess, Sheridan kind of answered just now that despite sort of your outlook, you expect to have sort of more capacity allocated to the third-party business, rather than trying to keep a bit more optimization capacity than before. Am I understanding you correctly?","Terry K. Spencer","Absolutely. I mean, that's a well-defined strategy that we've employed for those -- for several years, and we'll continue to do so. We'll have some level of optimization capacity, I'm confident. But it will be greatly diminished from where it has been in the past.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just last one. Your Canadian Valley plant just came online in March. What do you see in terms of your volume ramp-up expectation there?","Terry K. Spencer","Rob?","Robert F. Martinovich","Hey Helen, this is Rob. It's doing very well. We're pushing capacity as we speak. We had a large tranche of gas that we had -- that we're offloading to several other facilities that we're bringing back on to our system, as well as we balanced our overall system. So we've got that benefit, plus just the continued strong growth that we've seen from our producers over the last couple of months. So it's doing very well, a very quick ramp-up.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In terms of when you see that plant filling up, is there sort of a rule of thumb we should think about?","Robert F. Martinovich","It's going to vary by area. I mean, this one ramped up -- we thought it would ramp up within 45 days, or be full effectively within 45 days. And we're there. Plants that we have in the Bakken, Garden Creek II that comes on in the third quarter, we expect also a very quick ramp-up on that because it's going to be waiting for processing capacity. When you get to Garden Creek III in the first quarter of next year, that's going to be a little bit slower ramp-up, just because of the short interval between those 2 plants coming online. So it really depends on the area and the volume.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Did you say full in 45 days after coming into service? I mean, the plants that fill up quickly, would fill up that quickly?","Robert F. Martinovich","If the gas is there, and we can bring it on, it definitely can. And that means both infrastructure-wise, as well as the gas available. And like I said, for Canadian Valley, we knew that was -- we had the opportunity to ramp it up very quickly because of the amount of gas that we were offloading to third-party processing facilities, as well as the pent up demand that we had on our system itself.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Just a quick follow-up. I noticed in the first quarter, on the G&P side, the equity NGL volumes at 18,000 a day seemed a little bit stronger than we were expecting, I guess, in part because of, some of the well freeze-offs. And I'm not sure if I'm looking at apples and oranges, but when we look, for instance, on a go-forward basis and the hedging profile and how much is sort of expected to be hedged, if you will, it kind of backs into sort of a go-forward number, close to the 13,000 to 15,000 barrels. I just didn't know if anything was going on in the first quarter that we should be aware of.","Robert F. Martinovich","No, there's really not, Carl. I mean, that just, I think is showing the growth that we've seen with regards to the Bakken plants coming online, Stateline II coming online last April, the 30% of Maysville that we now have, as well as just your continued ramp-up of volumes in each of our existing facilities, both in the Bakken and the Mid-Continent.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Rob, perhaps maybe a better way I should asked that question is, is as we look forward, is there any reason why those equity NGL volumes would be going back down?","Robert F. Martinovich","As we go forward, did they go back down? I guess, as you -- as Canadian Valley comes on, and you're rejecting more ethane, then that would tend to drive those volumes down.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speaker, T.D. Eureste, for any additional or closing remarks.","T.D. Eureste","Thank you for joining us.

Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, T.D. Good morning. And thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me on the conference call today is Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial results.","Also with me and available to answer your questions are Rob Martinovich, our Executive Vice President of Commercial; Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids and Wes Christenson, our Senior Vice President of Operations.","On this morning\u2019s call, we will review our fourth quarter and year-end 2013 financial and operating results, bring you up-to-date on our current capital growth projects and review the NGL markets. We\u2019ll discuss my areas of focus as CEO and what\u2019s important to me and we\u2019ll answer your questions.","Let\u2019s start with our fourth quarter performance. ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter performance was driven by continued volume growth in ONEOK Partners with increases in natural gas gathered and processed and natural gas liquids gathered as a result of the capital growth projects we completed offset by higher operating costs and one-time costs associated with the separation of our natural gas distribution business into ONE Gas.","ONEOK Partners, fourth quarter 2013 results were up as a result of the volume growth I just mentioned. Derek will now review ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 financial highlights, and then I\u2019ll review our operating performance. Derek?","Derek Reiners","Thanks, Terry. ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter net income was approximately $91 million or $0.43 per diluted share, including $22 million or $0.11 per diluted share of non-cash charges related to the wind-down of the energy services segment and costs related to the separation of ONEOK\u2019s natural gas distribution business into ONE Gas.","In the fourth quarter 2013, energy services reported a $5 million after-tax net non-cash charge as we continued to reduce capacity contracts to wind-down the business and paid approximately $12 million related to previously released transportation and storage obligations. Also in the quarter ONEOK incurred non-cash after-tax charge of approximately $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share and expenses of approximately $7 million after tax or $0.03 per diluted share, both one-time items related to the separation. Excluding these one-time costs ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 net income would have been approximately $113 million or $0.54 per diluted share.","ONEOK\u2019s 2013 net income was approximately $267 million or $1.27 per diluted share. These results include non-cash after tax charges of $87 million or $0.42 per diluted share associated with the energy services segment wind-down and a previously mentioned non-cash after tax charge of approximately $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share and after tax expenses of approximately $9 million or $0.04 per diluted share, both related to the ONE Gas separation.","The energy services charges for the year were $139 million on a pre-tax basis and as cash payments related to the released contracts were approximately $18 million. We expect future cash payments associated with the released transportation and storage capacity for the wind-down to be approximately $80 million on an after tax basis through 2023. 2014 tax payments are expected to be approximately $33 million on an after tax basis, which is included in our 2014 financial guidance.","In 2013, ONEOK received $536 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, the 23% increase over 2012. In connection with the ONE Gas separation, ONEOK received approximately $1.13 billion from ONE Gas in January of 2014 and used the proceeds to repay approximately $600 million of commercial paper borrowings $150 million of senior notes through an early tender offer and exercised a make\/hold call on $400 million of senior notes that we expect to repay in March 2014.","Additionally we reduced ONEOK\u2019s credit facility to $300 million from $1.2 billion and terminated its commercial paper program. The future cash distribution [proceeds] from ONEOK Partners are expected to be the principal source of cash for ONEOK defined quarterly cash dividends.","We are affirming ONEOK\u2019s 2014 guidance and expect cash flow available for dividends to be in the range of $560 million to $640 million reflecting growth in cash distributions received from our general partner and limited partner interest in ONEOK Partners. Please refer to our earnings release and Investor Day materials for more information on our 2014 guidance.","Now let\u2019s move on to ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners\u2019 fourth quarter net income was $228 million or $0.67 per unit and full year 2013 net income was $804 million or $2.35 per unit. In the fourth quarter distributable cash flow was $245 million resulting in coverage ratio of 1.02 times for the quarter and nearly $950 million for the year resulting in a 1.03 times coverage ratio.","We increased the distribution by $0.005 per unit to $0.73 for the fourth quarter of 2013, the increase of 3% from the fourth quarter of 2012. In the earnings news release we provided some updates on our hedges as we continue to hedge commodity risk when appropriate.","At the end of the fourth quarter, the partnerships had $135 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial paper or borrowings on our credit facility outstanding, long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55% and a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.0 times. As a result of the debt and equity financings, we completed in the second half of 2013, we began 2014 with $135 million of cash, full access to our credit facility that has been increased to $1.7 billion and our at-the-market equity programs available to fund our ongoing capital growth rate.","With the ample liquidity, we are able to be opportunistic in the timings of putting place permanent financings. We are affirming the partnerships\u2019 2014 financial guidance and expect the partnerships\u2019 distributable cash flow to range from $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. Please refer to the earnings release and our Investor Day material for complete ONEOK Partners guidance.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you Derek. Let's start with our former natural gas distribution segment. It is fourth quarter 2013 earnings benefited from new rates, which were more than offset by higher operating costs and onetime charges related to the separation into ONE Gas.","The energy services segment\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 operating loss was higher than the same quarter in 2012 and reflects the non-cash charges related to the wind down of the segment which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2014.","At ONEOK Partners, the natural gas gathering and processing segment\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was slightly lower. It benefited from higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed, offset by lower realized NGL product prices and higher operating costs and depreciation expense due to completed capital growth projects.","Natural gas volumes gathered and processed continue to grow driven by increased well connections in the Williston Basin as a result of more efficient drilling programs. While the absolute number of Williston Basin rigs has decreased, multi-well pad drilling has increased significantly. In addition, the quality of the producing acreage yields some of the highest returns in our producers\u2019 portfolios. Also the transition to the manufacturing mode from exploration continues to accelerate. We expect to see continued drilling in the Williston Basin as more than 90% of economics come from crude oil production.","We connected 210 wells in the fourth quarter and 1,160 wells in 2013 compared with 940 wells in 2012. And we expect to connect approximately 1,300 wells to our Williston Basin and Mid-Continent gathering systems in 2014.","We experienced extreme weather conditions in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent in the December that marginally affected our processed volumes which increased by almost 25% in the fourth quarter 2013 compared with the same period last year. We plan accordingly for these conditions and the loss of productivity during the winter months.","ONEOK Partners\u2019 natural gas liquids segment\u2019s fourth quarter results were higher due to increased NGL volumes gathered and more favorable NGL product price differentials. NGL exchange-services margins and NGL volume gathered continued to grow and we saw an increase in marketing margins compared with the same period in 2012. Our integrated NGL system enabled us to capture higher margins from more favorable NGL product price differentials.","The NGL exchange-services business will continue to see volume growth in Williston Basin and Niobrara, not only from our natural gas processing plants but also from third party plants connected to our system. This volume growth also was occurring in the Mid-Continent region through connections to our plants and others. We expect 10 plus new natural gas processing plants to connect to our system in 2014. The partnership\u2019s natural gas pipeline segment\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 results were slightly higher compared with the same period in 2012.","Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were lower in the fourth quarter 2013 due to reduced transportation rates that became effective January 1, 2013. Northern Border\u2019s long-haul transportation capacity continues to be the most cost advantage provider from Western Canada and the Williston Basin. Substantially all of Northern Border\u2019s long-haul transportation capacity has been contracted through June 2015."," ","Now an update on our capital growth projects. The MB-2 NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu was placed in service in December 2013. The Sterling III Pipeline is expected to be completed in March 2014 with the flexibility to transport either unfractionated NGLs or NGL purity products from Mid-Continent region to the Texas Gulf Coast.","The Canadian Valley plant, a 200 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility in the Cana-Woodford Shale of Oklahoma is also expected to be completed in March 2014. And the Mont Belvieu ethane -- propane splitter, a 40,000 barrel per day deethanizer also is expected to be completed in March 2014.","Now a brief review of our outlook on the NGL markets. We still believe that ethane rejection by natural gas processing plants connected to our NGL system will continue through much of 2016, after which new world scale ethylene production capacity is expected to begin coming on line.","The industry experienced a volatile propane market in January and February as a result of higher seasonal demand from lake drying in the upper Midwest followed by extensive and prolonged cold weather covering much of the U.S. and the decision by many NGL producers to access the traditionally higher valued Mont Belvieu NGL markets which have been bolstered by strong propane demand. These events led to a significant decline in Mid-Continent propane inventories and periods when the propane price at Conway was higher than at Mont Belvieu. This propane price volatility highlights the fact that much of the NGL industry\u2019s infrastructure is primarily designed to move products from the producing basins to the Gulf Coast markets.","Our fully integrated NGL system with its connectivity to major supply basins and market hubs has on a limited basis the flexibility to deliver certain NGL products between Conway and Mont Belvieu. While we don\u2019t comment on the specific operational actions we have taken, we did utilize the flexibility of our assets to help meet the Midwest propane demand.","In closing, I would like to make a few comments about my new role and areas of focus. ONEOK is a different company today than it was a month ago following the separation of our natural gas distribution business into ONE Gas. But the talented, experienced and dedicated team of employees executing our growth plans remained the same. However, our vision for the future is different, as a pure play general partner we will provide the management and resources for ONEOK Partners to continue to grow so that ONEOK can continue to increase its dividend.","We will maintain prudent financial strength and flexibility while focusing on attracting, selecting and retaining a diverse group of employees to execute our growth strategy which will not change. It goes without saying that I will focus on successfully executing our 2014 to 2016 strategic and financial plan that we shared with you all in December.","We will continue to foster a culture that enables us to be successful as a company and as employees with special emphasis on being more entrepreneurial which means understanding how our customers view us and making sure it\u2019s how we want to be viewed.","We need to be creative, fast moving, responsive, committed to continuing to solve customers\u2019 problems and reducing the time it takes to get things done and satisfy our customers. We will maintain and continue to strengthen our strong commercial and operating capabilities and focus on developing new supplies in markets either organically or through acquisitions in our natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses as well as develop a new growth platform in the energy value chain.","We will continue to provide reliable energy and energy related services in a safe and environmentally responsible manner to our stakeholders. We will continue to seek opportunities to acquire assets at ONEOK Partners that fit with the partnership\u2019s vision while maintaining financial discipline to ensure they create exceptional value for our investors as our internal growth projects do.","And finally, we will continue executing our long-term growth objectives at ONEOK Partners to continue increasing distributions to the partnership\u2019s unit holders and giving ONEOK the flexibility or the ability rather to continue to increase dividends to its shareholders.","As I have assumed the CEO role, I\u2019d like to thank the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Boards for their support of and confidence in me and in particular John Gibson for his willingness to help prepare me for this new role through mentoring, guidance and encouragement as well as the many other people, who have helped me during my 30 plus year career in the energy industry.","John has been an exceptional leader, trusted advisor and coach, but more importantly, a good friend. He will continue to play an important role in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners through his new role as Non-Executive Chairman. His accomplishments as our CEO are many, but most easily summarized in his genuine desire to help people and a balanced and tireless approach to creating value for all of our stakeholders, employees, customers, communities and our investors.","As in employees, I think we\u2019ll all agree that ONEOK is a wonderful place to work due to John\u2019s many contributions over the years. And for all of our stakeholders, I look forward to continuing to build on the accomplishments of John and the leaders before him. I\u2019m honored and appreciative of the opportunity to lead this growing and dynamic company and its hardworking and dedicating employees. And I look forward to 2014 and the opportunities ahead.","I\u2019d also like to congratulate Pierce Norton and the 3,000 employees who now work for ONE Gas on the successful completion of the transaction. And thanks to 2,000 employees of the new ONEOK whose commitment, dedication, skills and experience allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly everyday and create exceptional value for our investors and customers. Our entire management teams appreciate their commitment and hard work to make our company successful.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","Thank you. Good morning everybody. I\u2019ve got a micro question maybe on hedging and then maybe more of a macro question and just happen to [newest] that the NGL price realizations in the fourth quarter for instance were sequentially down from third quarter with the market I think sort of more advancing. I did know that was basically just due to entering fourth quarter with essentially and just full hedged profile. And I just want to confirm that it was that reversal say for instance perhaps wider structural basis being experienced?","Terry Spencer","Carl, you are correct. That\u2019s exactly right. We came into the quarter fully hedged basically and so the prices that were carried into the quarter obviously were slightly lower than where the actual market turned out third quarter.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","No, I understood, I appreciate that. And so we look at say for instances fourth quarter and you all may obviously wretch it up prudently, the hedging profile for 2014. Is that something that we should take as roughly equal through the year or is that something where again maybe because there has been so much price also in the first quarter, should we be thinking that the first quarter is already fully hedged out at that same level, I just don\u2019t know if there is maybe any additional color you can provide there?","Terry Spencer","Yes Carl, I think that would be true statement. We\u2019re going fairly levelly hedged throughout the year. So I think that\u2019s right.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","Okay. And then lastly and I understand this is maybe more challenging to answer, given the volatility that we have seen in the first quarter, I didn\u2019t know if there was any additional color you could provide on optimization opportunities in the first quarter, I think there maybe desire to look back on some prior years given how well the optimization had done in periods of volatility, but the same token with exchange services ramping which seem to be not quite to say an exposure, and then with Sterling III kind of now coming in March maybe there wasn\u2019t the same opportunity to perhaps capture those spreads. I didn\u2019t know if there was any color you could provide as far as what the market should be expecting or not expecting given the volatility?","Derek Reiners","Well Carl, we can\u2019t give you, we can\u2019t talk about first quarter financial performance obviously, but what we can do is talk about what happened in the first quarter, what was the market response if you will. And really what we saw in the first quarter was just unprecedented demand driven by going into the winter obviously with low inventories and unusually cold winter.","We have seen producers have an increased desire to move their production to Mont Belvieu that obviously to take advantage of more attractive prices at Belvieu. So that all equated to what we saw, a shortage of propane. January and February heavy demand pool have subsided though as we look at the market currently, prices are now trading today by down below $1.20 a gallon and clearly the market has demonstrated that it\u2019s getting the volume that it needs and at least as far as that relates to ONEOK certainly we were able to utilize the flexibility of our assets to make sure the propane got to where it needed to go. And as far as we are aware, there are absolutely no customers that did without propane during this season.","So that\u2019s really about all I can say. I think that propane demand will continue to be somewhat robust as we move into the year. Certainly as we go into the sales seasons, we won\u2019t see prices back at these levels. During the year, we will see prices certainly moderate.","So I think one of the key things too that I\u2019ll say is that we will see more propane supply come online during the year to satisfy the market, market needs. So we feel pretty good about where we are and with respect to the propane markets. Does that help you?","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","No, it does and I understand you can\u2019t talk about the first quarter at this point, but I do appreciate all the color. So, thank you very much.","Derek Reiners","You bet.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ted Durbin, Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Ted.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Hey, so I want to talk a little bit about you\u2019ve sighted this favorable NGL product price differentials as being helpful to you, I am just wonder if you can give us a little more commentary around that just sort of a normal butane to iso-butane spread or where are you benefiting from the price differentials?","Terry Spencer","Sure. I think well, at least as far as the location differentials with Conway-to-Mont Belvieu, I think we guided you to about $0.07 to $0.08 a gallon. And so that\u2019s what we expect for the balance of the year. I think in iso to normal spread we\u2019re in that $0.10 to $0.15 a gallon range for the balance of the year.","So I mean compared to last year, we see significant improvement in that iso to normal spread, I think we averaged less than a nickel last year. So this year we are looking for some improvement.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Got it, okay. So it\u2019s really on the prices (inaudible) looks fine. And then next question from me was just in the Bakken itself, the outlook here for need for additional processing plants up there, how are you thinking about the contract structure if you were to go forward with that, maybe just talk about your plans in the Bakken?","Wes Christenson","Sure, Ted. As far as contract structures, we don\u2019t anticipate any changes at all. We continue to enter into acreage dedications with percent of proceeds contracts with the fee-based component. In certain areas where there might be heated competition, we may have to flex that percentage upward a bit, but for the most part, we have been able to stay pretty much in line with our historical percentages that have support the past capital investments for the future.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And then how the conversations going around your need for additional process, obviously lot of flaring going out there?","Terry Spencer","Yes. I mean, we continue to have a lot of planning going on. We are doing a pretty good job up there keeping the flairs inline, we have actually we\u2019re at about 30% flaring within our footprint even in the midst of just tremendous growth that we have experienced, producers have a very high sense of urgency to get these players put out and to reduce the flaring level. We've got a targeted expectation of around 10% to 15%, down from 30% to 10% to 15% over the next couple of years. So yes, high sense urgency and as a result it's certainly increasing the need for more processing capacity and gathering systems.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And then if I could just ask one more, the operating cost here particularly the gathering and processing segment looks like they have continued to pick up pretty quickly. I'm just wondering in particular this is continue to go up here, do you have the new processing plant capacity or there is some maybe operational synergies that we should see as you bring on additional plants are unable to do some shared services or what not let\u2019s say in the Bakken?","Terry Spencer","Well, Ted yes, some of our operating costs and I\u2019m going to let some of these other guys talk about this. But some of our operating costs are kind of more fixed. And so you are feeling that right now, now as we low these plants up and feel that capacity, there will be less and less incremental operating cost to go against that revenue.","So, I mean we don't -- nothing here surprises us from an operating cost standpoint. And so, what I'm saying on a per unit basis, we'll see those operating cost continue to drop as we fill these plants.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Perfect. That's very helpful. That's all I had. Thank you.","Terry Spencer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Jeremy.","Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan","I was just wondering after the OGS spin, if you could provide any updated thoughts on, does this change ONEOK's appetite for strategic or transformational acquisitions. Just any thoughts you have on M&A would be great?","Terry Spencer","","Sure, I would be glad to. Certainly as I said in my remarks ONEOK is a different company today. And our strategy certainly in terms of maximizing the dividend is to do of course in fact that and to operate this company as more of a holding company. Our strategy is for our M&A opportunities to be done at ONEOK Partners and so I don\u2019t see ONEOK considering M&A opportunities that we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t keep blinders on, we can\u2019t ignore the fact that we have got a great currency at ONEOK.","But as we sit today our strategy is pretty straight forward and at this point in time, I don\u2019t have any intentions of pursuing M&A opportunities at the OKE level.","Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan","","Okay. That's helpful, I was just wondering if you could might be able to bite a little bit of color as far as CapEx timing throughout the year, it seems like there is a lot of projects. It could be coming on early in the year, is that CapEx more weigh towards the front end?","Terry Spencer","Actually for 2014 our CapEx spend is going to be weighted more towards the backend. Those projects that are coming online early in 2014 their capital spend is winding down of course, but that we've got other projects that are coming online during the year and that will heavily weight capital towards the backend.","Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan","Got you. That's it from me. Thank you.","Terry Spencer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ethan Bellamy, Baird.","Ethan Bellamy - Baird","Good morning gentlemen. How is the Sage acquisition tracking versus your expectations at the time of purchase?","Terry Spencer","","Well the acquisition actually is going very well. We are having considerable success at signing up new acreage dedication from producers. We\u2019ve generated a lot of interest and certainly as you\u2019ll recall as we said many times before this is a significantly underserved basin which fits well for us having the ability to not just gather and process gas but as importantly transport natural gas liquids out of this basin. So, because of that flexibility we\u2019re able to generate a lot of interest and have a lot of success at signing up customer. So it\u2019s going very well.","Ethan Bellamy - Baird","That\u2019s good to hear. With respect to your 2014 guidance can you give us the delta that you would expect from if you did not reject ethane this year?","Terry Spencer","We actually have not provided that level of detail. So I can\u2019t really comment on that. So that\u2019s better what I got to say about that.","Ethan Bellamy - Baird","Okay.","Terry Spencer","It\u2019s the only I can't anything.","Ethan Bellamy - Baird","Yes, sure, all right. What impact if any has there been positive or negative on the timing or the amount of maintenance capital spending due to weather?","Terry Spencer","Well good question. There really has not been that much impact from weather as it relates to the maintenance capital spending. The weather is occurred over such a very short period of time, so it really hasn\u2019t impacted us. I think we\u2019ve probably been more impacted by our decisions as it relates to discretional capital spending. So there is a tranche within all of our maintenance capital budgets discretional spending that we may choose from time-to-time during the year to do or not do and we had some of that this year and that\u2019s one of the reasons why our maintenance capital is lower.","Ethan Bellamy - Baird","Okay. Last question should we be worried about any issues with natural gas pipeline volumes just maybe Northern Border or anything long term obviously that\u2019s been a big question for the industry?","Terry Spencer","Really as it relates to our assets, all of our assets including Northern Border are market connected direct market connected and they don\u2019t really -- they are not really exposed to the classic base spreads that you might see in other pipelines that are kind of more hub connected. So the end user customers have to have gas, they have got to have the gas. And in many cases they don\u2019t have the economic alternatives. So in that scenario that need the service. So from a re-contracting standpoint, we really don\u2019t anticipate any problems in particular in the case of border, it\u2019s a very low cost provider, so it\u2019s extremely competitive in the marketplace as the rest of our asset.","So they are very well connected that needs specific customer needs. So when we get to point in time, where renew contracts, we generally don\u2019t have any problem renewing them. Certainly as long as the right and fees which are for the services are fair.","","From a macro perspective our typical contract life is about seven years across all our interstates and intrastate. So we are really in pretty good shape.","Ethan Bellamy - Baird","Okay, thanks much.","Terry Spencer","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies & Comp.","Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies & Comp","Hey, Terry, how are you.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Chris. How are you doing?","Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies & Comp","I am great, thanks. I was just hoping to hit real quickly on a couple of points Carl had asked about the NGL price realization. I was curious, if you could add some color to what happened on the condensate front? Seems like they are very similar step down. We obviously saw natural gas do sort of a similar head take last quarter and you explained it was related to some acute issues in the Bakken. I was just curious if you could comment on the condensate front.","Terry Spencer","","I think some of it\u2019s the same as what you, what I indicated at the call, but I think in particular why you see a lower condensate price is; in that realized price we have transportation costs that are netted out, okay. And so in the case of condensate we will see anywhere from $10 to $15 a barrel transportation charge applied to that net realized price. So that\u2019s why you can\u2019t get that price to really correlate to the WTI posting.","Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies & Comp","Got it, okay.","Terry Spencer","","Does that help?","Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies & Comp","That does, that\u2019s very helpful, thanks. And then I guess one comment obviously a lot of commentary about what NGL pricing supply and demand trends have meant for the ONEOK assets and sort of responding to the market. I was wondering within that given the strong propane price particularly in Conway that 4Q and that\u2019s why 1Q what have you seen ethane rejection wise across the system, is that sort of create a corresponding desire to recover more in order to boost up the propane yield, can you comment about that?","Terry Spencer","","Yes Chris that\u2019s a great question. We really have actually not seen that, we have actually seen a slight ever so slight increase in amount that we are rejecting actually. Part of it is from new supplies that we are connecting that are not recovering ethane. So our impact from ethane rejection actually is slightly higher, you think you -- you understand what I am saying? We haven\u2019t seen ethane come off, so what we have seen is from the new supplies that we have connected they are not coming out of the box recovering ethane.","Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies & Comp","Understood. So on a total basis the implied rejection number then picks up?","Terry Spencer","Sure, that\u2019s correct.","Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies & Comp","Okay, understood. And then I guess a final question from me. Can you give a little bit of color around the delay for Sterling III sort of -- I know you still had a bit in the last, naturally some capital to deploy on that, we\u2019re saying March in service, just an update on that and update real quickly on the outage you had at to Belvieu frac and Belvieu plant outage in January, just if everything went sort of to plan on that and then a reminder on Sterling I, just the size of that pipe.","Terry Spencer","Chris, we\u2019d be glad to that. So, I\u2019m going to let Wes Christenson take that Sterling III and Mont Belvieu frac question.","Wes Christenson","Sure (inaudible). Sterling III pipeline construction was primarily delayed due to the weather conditions we had from both (inaudible) and we had construction [period] that was primarily (inaudible). In the Mont Belvieu area, we took -- we started in the two (inaudible) capacity as well as (inaudible).","","Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies & Comp","Okay. I had a little bit of difficulty hearing, but I\u2019ll look for the transcript for details, I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. Thanks for your time, Terry.","Terry Spencer","Okay, great. Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question will come from Helen Ryoo, Barclays Capital.","Helen Ryoo - Barclays Capital","Thank you. So Terry, I appreciate your color on the NGL market and I realize that it\u2019s difficult for you to comment on Q1, but just so that I understand in general how your optimization business works the -- are you limited by your physical capacity to move product from ONEOK to the other or is some part of your optimization business entails barrel exchanges and therefore you are not limited by actual -- the amount of barrels you have to move around?","Terry Spencer","","Well, it\u2019s a combination of all those things, Helen. We are in fact affected by unlimited, not just by the capacity of the pipelines themselves as we have multiple diameter pipes between the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast. The other thing that affects us to capacity is the type of product, what product you are actually moving and to where. So that can affect you as well. The heavier the barrel, the more difficult it is to pump those barrels, it requires more horsepower per mile. So that will affect you as well. And we did -- we had extreme demand and certainly when you have periods of extreme demand, you may or may not be able to meet on an hourly basis the delivery rates that are required. So, we did have some of that.","Helen Ryoo - Barclays Capital","Okay. And does it matter in general which hub has a higher price, let\u2019s say, like in this quarter, propane -- Conway propane so much higher than Belvieu, but in the past it was always the other way around. Does it matter which hub has a higher price or as long as there is a deepen spread, I mean it\u2019s the absolute level of spread that matters more?","Terry Spencer","","Helen, I\u2019m going to let our resident expert Sheridan Swords answer that question.","Sheridan Swords","","Helen, I think your answer is that our systems are designed to move barrels from Conway to Belvieu because as you\u2019ve said, historically that\u2019s been a higher price. So it\u2019s actually more advantageous for us, most of the time at Belvieu it\u2019s higher than Conway.","Helen Ryoo - Barclays Capital","","Okay. But I guess given that you have these projects coming on line, I mean with Sterling I and II, having by directional capability, does that change the ability or not really?","Sheridan Swords","Actually, only Sterling I has bidirectional capabilities.","Helen Ryoo - Barclays Capital","Okay. That\u2019s right.","Sheridan Swords","So, you are limited even if that was the choice to do that, you would be limited by that capacity.","Helen Ryoo - Barclays Capital","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just switching on to your comment on these 10 more -- 10 plus processing plants being connected to your systems during 2014, are these plants like solely connected to your system, or you guys be sole, sort of NGL takeaway solutions for these new plants or are they connected to I guess other third-party lines?","Sheridan Swords","These plants will be solely connected to our system.","Helen Ryoo - Barclays Capital","Okay, great. And then just lastly, what\u2019s the size of the ATM program you have in place?","Derek Reiners","It\u2019s a $300 million program.","Helen Ryoo - Barclays Capital","Have you used any of that?","Derek Reiners","We have, we\u2019ve used a little bit during 2013. We just kicked that off during 2013, I think I said in the last quarter remarks that we expect to use that bit more heavily in 2014.","Helen Ryoo - Barclays Capital","Got it, all right. Thank you very much.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Helen.","Operator","Our next question will come from Becca Followill, U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Good morning guys.","Terry Spencer","Good morning.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Could you talk a little bit about your expectations, [wasn\u2019t a lot of] changes in your expected volume growth in the NGL segment for gathered volumes to be up 13% and fracs volumes to be up 8% given that volumes were down sequentially and that 2013 came in a little bit below guidance?","Sheridan Swords","Becca, I think the answer to your question is, is that fractionated volumes are down because we frac some barrels that we don\u2019t gather especially coming off of OPPL. So, we saw a bigger decrease in volume coming off of OPPL. We continue to think that we will meet our guidance for 2014. The new plants that are coming on which most of them we will be gathering as well.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Thank you. And then can you discuss on those 10 plus coming online what\u2019s the capacity of those plants?","Terry Spencer","They range from $50 million to over $200 million.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","But in total, do you have that capacity?","Terry Spencer","That I don\u2019t have them top of my head right now what they are total have to be.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Okay. Thank you. And then last question is you guys have a meaningful storage position in Mid-Continent area to store LPGs. Can you talk a little bit about how this winter\u2019s shortfall or shrink conditions have impacted producers\u2019 decisions to maybe contract down the road, is that storage formally fall, what happens to rate as a result of this?","Terry Spencer","Sure. The storage season, back of the storage season, we are confident to use the storage about March when we start re-contracting and that goes through April. It\u2019s kind of the season for the next year for re-contracting, so we will see as we get into that time period if this winter has change the appetite of the end users on the propane side for more or less storage.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","So it\u2019s truly to talk at this point.","Terry Spencer","Yes.","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Derek Reiners","Thank you, Becca.","Operator","Our next question will come from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Terry congratulations on running your first policy year.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, sir.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","So kind of a follow-up question here, given your existing contract structures and the capacity of existing Sterling pipelines, when into does the capacity to take advantage of the by directional nature Sterling I in other words reverse flow north increase of Sterling III comes online?","Derek Reiners","","No, it does not.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Okay. And can you provide some color around trends and bundled NGL services from the Bakken down to Belvieu maybe something directional than not absolute natures response like the proportion of such business represents a contract to capacity on the Bakken NGL line now or say on the Sterling lines now down to Belvieu?","Terry Spencer","","Craig let me take this question at a high level then Sheridan kind of cleaned it up. The barrels that we move out of the Bakken you understand originate from our own processing plant, our third party volumes will grow.","So we\u2019ve contracted those volumes at competitive rates. That business because it is some of longest haul business that we got it is those barrels are the furthest away, we move those barrels through multiple pipes, and fractionation facilities those will be some of the highest per unit margin barrels that we move. So from a revenue standpoint much like the margin we generated in the Bakken these would be some of the highest margin barrels and most valuable barrels, yet the volumes are going to be relatively speaking small.","So to get to your question, they are not going to take up a whole lot of capacity in the downstream infrastructure relative to movement say out of the Midcontinent or other parts of our system. Sheridan anything?","Sheridan Swords","","I don\u2019t have anything to add to that.","Terry Spencer","","Okay. I didn\u2019t do that bad, good.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","So, just as a follow-up, I think historically one of the concerns the margins has had is that on the optimization revenue there was always a little unclear for commercial proprietary reasons, what was available and obviously no one knew the future. And so there wasn't much of a multiple put on those types of revenues. And of course you didn\u2019t distribute them when you got win falls.","But to the degree you are able overtime to make this a little more of a bundled less volatile, more bundled fee based type business as far as these spreads between basins or hubs. Then obviously you should get more of a multiple on that. Are you saying that though the Bakken margins are very high, there is never going to substantially derisk some of these basis points?","Terry Spencer","Well, okay Craig let me try and address your question this way. We have hand for some time. And we've been very open about this, a strategy to reduce our exposure to that Conway to Belvieu build this spread i.e. our optimization business. We've been very successful at doing that and contracting that capacity under fee-based contract. And I guess included in some of that is the Bakken barrels move through some of that capacity.","What happens during 2013 is the ethane rejection created some available capacity that we wouldn't otherwise have. So as I result, we took advantage of that available capacity and captured whatever spread was there. So generally speaking, we are making very good headway with taking that volatility out and our associated dependents on that spread.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Okay. And there is still a market for long-term contracting regardless of the level you have currently in the very high single-digits maybe upwards to the dime with Belvieu and Conway, I\u2019m sorry.","Terry Spencer","","Sheridan is looking at me; I\u2019ll let him handle that question.","Sheridan Swords","I think to answer your question is when we look at our bundled service, if we have a customer that wants to go down to Mont Belvieu, it all comes down to where they are located at (inaudible) determine what the rates going to be and what the competitive position there in at that time.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Okay, understood. Thanks for all the answers.","Terry Spencer","","Thanks Craig.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from Lin Shen, HITE Hedge.","Lin Shen - HITE Hedge","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Ziola","Thank you and good morning, and welcome to ONEOK's Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live, and a replay will be made available. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions.","A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and '34. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.","2019 was an outstanding year, a year of project execution and record-setting safety performance for ONEOK, positioning ourselves for exceptional growth in 2020 and 2021. Yesterday, we announced fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, announced our 2020 guidance and provided a 2021 outlook. We also announced 3 expansion projects that will further strengthen ONEOK's position in the Williston and Permian Basins, and increase the needed natural gas processing and NGL transportation capacity for our customers. It is important to point out that these high-return projects build off of our existing assets. These projects include the Demicks Lake III plant in the Williston Basin, the full expansion of the Elk Creek pipeline to 400,000 barrels per day and the fourth expansion of the West Texas LPG pipeline since October 2017.","Our growth program is providing critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure to our customers, including assets to help significantly reduce natural gas flaring in the Williston Basin and provide increased connectivity all the way to the Texas Gulf Coast. Upon completion, our announced projects will expand the backbone of our NGL business and will add processing capacity to further strengthen our position as a leading midstream service provider.","As for project updates, we announced that Elk Creek was completed in mid-December, Demicks Lake I and II were completed in October 2019 and January 2020, respectively, and the first phase of the MB-4 fractionator was completed in late December. Kevin will provide more color on the projects that are slated for completion here in the first quarter. Our last earnings call in late October, I made a comment that 2021 is setting up to be another year of double-digits growth. With many of our projects being completed this year and into next year, we are confident in our 2020 [Later changed by the Company to 2021] earnings outlook of adjusted EBITDA increasing approximately 20% compared to our 2020 guidance midpoint.","With that, I will turn the call over to Walt.","Walter Hulse","Thank you, Terry, ONEOK's 2019 net income totaled $1.28 billion or $3.07 per share, an 11% increase compared with 2018. In 2019, adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.58 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year. Natural gas liquids and natural gas volume growth, higher average fee rates and increased transportation capacity contracted, all contributed to a strong 2019 performance. The natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas pipeline segments ended the year with adjusted EBITDA increases of 11% and 12%, respectively, compared with 2018, exceeding the high end of the 2019 guidance range in both segments.","The natural gas liquids segment adjusted EBITDA increased 2% compared with 2018, about 4% below the low end of the 2019 guidance range, due primarily to narrower-than-expected NGL price differentials. Distributable cash flow for 2019 was $2.02 billion, up 11% compared to 2018, with a healthy full year dividend coverage of 1.38x. We also generated nearly $560 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in 2019. Our annual dividends paid during 2019 were $3.53 per share, a 9% increase compared with 2018, in line with our previously stated guidance.","And in January, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, also an increase of 9% compared with the first quarter of 2018. Our December 31 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.8x. We continue to expect to be at 4x debt-to-EBITDA run rate in late 2020 or early 2021 with deleveraging continuing thereafter as volumes ramp and additional projects come online. We ended the year having no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and $220 million of commercial paper outstanding.","As Terry mentioned, with yesterday's earnings announcement, we provided detailed 2020 financial and volume guidance and a 2021 outlook. Our 2020 guidance includes increases in our earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA midpoints of 16% and 25%, respectively, compared with 2019. We expect double-digit year-over-year earnings growth in our natural gas liquids and our natural gas gathering and processing segments of 15% and 11%, respectively. Our natural gas pipeline segment had a strong 2019, and we expect another solid year of performance for the segment in 2020.","Key drivers to achieving our 2020 financial guidance expectations include volume growth expected from the Elk Creek pipeline and the Demicks Lake processing plants, and contributions from the Arbuckle II pipeline, the MB-4 fractionator and the second West Texas LPG expansion, all projects that we expect to be completed here in the first quarter. Our 2020 growth capital guidance range of $2.25 billion to $2.73 billion is a significant decrease compared with our peak CapEx spend in 2019 and incorporates the projects we announced yesterday.","As a reminder, what we call routine growth capital such as well connections and plant connections is included in this number. Our 2021 outlook of an approximate 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared with the 2020 guidance midpoint is driven by continued volume growth on Elk Creek resulting from the increased volumes from plants connected in 2020, the Bakken NGL pipeline extension and the Bear Creek expansion. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and the Gulf Coast from the completion of the MB-5 fractionator and the third and fourth expansions of West Texas LPG pipeline will also contribute to the 2021 increase.","With these project completions this year and early next year, total capital expenditures are expected to decrease significantly in 2021 relative to 2020.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our operating segments.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt. 2019 was an impressive year with strong producer activity across our operations, driving NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processed volume increases of 7% compared with 2018. We expect volumes to continue to increase in 2020 and our earnings to remain more than 90% fee-based. As Terry said, we completed our Demicks Lake II plant in the Williston Basin in January and expect to complete 3 additional NGL projects by the end of the first quarter. Overall, our projects are on time and on budget, positioning us well for continued growth as volumes on these projects ramp up.","Let's start with our Rocky Mountain region, which includes the Williston and Powder River Basins. Producer activity remains strong in both the Williston and Powder River basins. North Dakota continues to see natural gas production of more than 3 billion cubic feet per day, and the basin-wide rig count remains in the 50 to 55 range with approximately 25 rigs on our dedicated acreage.","Rig counts have remained consistent in this $50 to $55 WTI crude oil price environment, which we expect to continue. Natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region increased 11% in both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 compared with the same periods in 2018. Processed volumes averaged 1.05 billion cubic feet per day for 2019, above the midpoint of our volume guidance range. We expect processed volumes from this region to increase more than 25% compared with 2019 due to the completion of the Demicks Lake plants as we significantly reduce gas currently being flared. We connected 526 wells in the Rocky Mountain region in 2019.","Better-than-expected well performance and higher gas to oil ratios contributed to volume growth even with producers temporarily delaying well completions until our Demicks Lake plants came online. We expect to connect between 575 and 625 wells in 2020.","Our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant that was placed in service in the fourth quarter is expected to be full by the end of the first quarter. We expect our Demicks Lake II plant to ramp to full capacity over the next 12 to 18 months. With the latest reported natural gas flaring data of approximately 500 million cubic feet per day in the basin and approximately 300 million of that on ONEOK's dedicated acreage, we now have the capacity available to capture a significant portion of this flared gas. Our Bear Creek plant remains on schedule to be completed early in the first quarter of 2021, which will provide much-needed processing capacity to the highly productive geographically isolated Dunn County area, where we have substantial acreage dedications.","The Demicks Lake expansion will provide an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity when it is completed in the third quarter of 2021. With the completion of these 2 facilities, ONEOK will have approximately 1.9 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Williston Basin.","NGL raw feed throughput volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, which consists of Elk Creek and the Bakken NGL pipeline, increased 9% compared with the third quarter 2019 and 23% compared with the full year 2018. We expect our Rocky Mountain NGL volumes to continue to increase as approximately 850 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity from ONEOK and third-party plants has come online since the third quarter 2019. We recently reached more than 230,000 barrels per day of raw feed throughput on Elk Creek and the Bakken NGL pipeline combined and continue to expect to exit the first quarter of 2020 with more than 240,000 barrels per day.","Yesterday, we announced an expansion of the Elk Creek pipeline to its full capacity of 400,000 barrels per day. The expansion is supported by well over 240,000 barrels per day of long-term dedicated production from ONEOK and third-party plants, excluding any incremental ethane. Of the 160,000 barrel per day expansion, approximately 60,000 barrels per day of the capacity is expected to be available in early 2021 and the remaining 100,000 barrels per day by the third quarter of 2021.","We also see -- continue to see growth in the Powder River Basin as production results remain strong, benefiting both our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. Moving on to the Mid-Continent. Natural gas volumes processed increased 3% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guidance range, connecting 117 wells to our gathering and processing system. Based on recent discussions with our customers, we expect our natural gas volumes processed in the Mid-Continent region to decrease approximately 10% this year compared with 2019 and expect to connect 40 to 60 wells.","Total NGL raw feed throughput in the Mid-Continent region for the fourth quarter decreased slightly compared with the third quarter, due primarily to spot volumes in the third quarter that did not carry over to the fourth quarter. Outside of ethane rejection, we expect relatively flat Mid-Continent volumes on our system in 2020 compared with the fourth quarter 2019.","During 2019, we connected 5 new third-party processing plants to our natural gas liquids system in the region, and 2 previously connected third-party plants on our system were expanded. Our Arbuckle II pipeline remains on schedule for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Arbuckle II will play an important role in transporting incremental supply from the Williston and Powder River Basins, the Mid-Continent and the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. Arbuckle II is the lower end of the NGL backbone and will be our fifth pipeline that can funnel supply from across our entire system to the Gulf Coast markets.","Finishing with the Permian Basin and Gulf Coast. NGL raw feed throughput volumes in this region increased 22% year-over-year, and the average fee rate increased compared with the third quarter 2019. We expect average rates to continue to increase as we bring on new volumes with bundled rates from our completed expansion projects.","We announced our fourth expansion of the West Texas LPG system, 100,000 barrel per day fully contracted expansion with long-term dedicated production from third-party processing plants in the region. We now have announced approximately 260,000 barrels per day of expansions on West Texas LPG to support volume growth in the region. Our system-wide NGL fractionation capacity remains highly utilized. Phase 1 of our MB-4 fractionator, which was completed in December, has increased our capacity by 75,000 barrels per day. Phase 2 of the project, which will add the remaining 50,000 barrels per day of capacity, remains on schedule for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2020. And our MB-5 fractionator remains on track for completion in the first quarter 2021.","Our overall NGL segment raw feed throughput volume guidance is expected to increase 15% in 2020, driven by a full year of operations of Elk Creek and the completions of the Arbuckle II pipeline, the MB-4 fractionator and 80,000 barrel per day West Texas LPG pipeline expansion, all expected in the first quarter of 2020.","Continued growth from plant connections and expansions completed in 2019 will also contribute to higher volumes in 2020. We expect 6 to 9 new third-party plant connections or expansions, including the connection already completed with Demicks Lake II. Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Kevin. 2019 was another successful year for ONEOK, and I'm proud of our employees who continue to focus on safety, reliability and the execution of our growth projects. Operating our integrated network of assets in the manner for which ONEOK has a strong reputation remains our focus and is the foundation for all our successes we've discussed today, and will continue to be as we move forward as we transition from this build cycle to a period of significant cash flow generation.","Thank you to all our dedicated employees for your hard work and contributions in helping us achieve another year of company-wide growth in 2019. And 2020 is off to a great start as we are in the middle of many project completions and new asset operations that will position us well in the coming years.","With that, operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust.","Tristan Richardson","Appreciate all the commentary on the expansions. Could you talk -- just a quick one. The difference on the CapEx side between Demicks III. It seems like you've got a lot of efficiencies versus the first 2 as well as the Bear Creek expansion. Just the difference in costs, should we think of that as an opportunity for enhanced return profile for Demicks III versus the others?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Tristan, this is Kevin. Yes, that's -- I mean, that's the way we think about it. The reason for the lower capital is, again, kind of more expansions when -- as we've constructed Demicks I and Demicks II, things like power, a lot of the inlet handling for the plant, some of the pipeline infrastructure, we're doing -- we're expanding existing compressor stations rather than building new compressor stations. So all those things contribute to that capital being lower than the previous projects.","Tristan Richardson","Helpful. And then -- and just on the Elk Creek expansion, in terms of the volumes behind that, should we think of that as primarily there to serve Demicks III as well as Bear Creek? Or are there -- could you talk about the quantity of other third-party plants that could be behind the latest expansion?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. I mean, that's the way to think about it. As we continue to ramp volumes with more than 240,000 barrels a day now of contracted on the pipe, we needed to expand it. We also wanted to make sure we had the ability to handle any ethane that needs to come out incrementally. But again, the economics are really based more on just the traditional, the classic C3 plus volume growth that we see. We still have a lot of opportunities, and we're in late-stage negotiations with several customers north of the river as we build that lateral that's going to connect over to the Hess plant. So there's still opportunities out there in front of us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","I was just wondering if we can dive into the 2021 plus 20% EBITDA guidance a little bit. Just trying to understand what it assumes, I guess, with -- obviously, it's -- what part of it is a ramp-up of Elk Creek, but how much ethane recovery are you assuming from the Bakken? Is it full ethane recovery? Also I was wondering if you can talk about kind of the margin uplift? If you can sort of like walk us through what is the delta between '20 and '21 in terms of what's going into your assumptions?","Kevin Burdick","Sure. Shneur, this is Kevin. Clearly, it is a Bakken-driven story. I think you start and just kind of go down the list of projects that are coming on either late this year or early, early in '21. So you've got Bear Creek II, that expansion, which, again, there's going to be some flared gas behind that facility when it's up. We've got 4 large, well-capitalized producers that are just dying to go drill down there, but there's just no capacity currently. So there's growth there.","We've talked about the north lateral from our -- on our -- in our NGL segment that will go connect to the Hess Plant that will be completed in Q4 of this year. So we'll have a year of volumes on that.","You've got continued just core growth in -- of our existing plants, the Demicks Lake facilities that will continue to ramp up, and then we'll have a little opportunity for Demicks III towards the end of the year. And then you mentioned the ethane opportunity that -- yes, we do have what we would consider a modest level of ethane. If you look at the production growth, that -- just from capturing the flared gas and as these other -- ours and third-party plants ramp up, it's just some math that determines we're going to need to pull some ethane out. So we've got around 25,000 to 40,000 barrels per day of ethane that we believe will come out in '21 and that is a result of the BTU heat content issue on Northern border.","Permian and Gulf Coast, we've got the 3 expansions that are coming on between now and the middle of '21 that will provide additional volume growth, and we have a full year of the MB-5 fractionator in '21 as well. So you pull all that together, we see, both our NGL and G&P segments, volume growth continuing to increase, and it's going to be well into double digits.","Shneur Gershuni","That was very helpful. Really do appreciate that. Maybe as a follow-up question, kind of a two parter, if you don't mind. With your CapEx activity, I mean, despite the fact that you've announced these new projects, it is definitely lower than where it's been and you sort of see slowing producer activity. I was just wondering what are the opportunities for ONEOK to pivot and optimize on the cost side? Are there costs that you can now strip out now that you can sort of see where your business is running? And also, are you able to potentially pursue an asset-light strategy? When I sort of think about your Elk Creek expansion as well as the West Texas LPG brings a lot more volumes into -- on the NGL side, which would suggest you would need a frac. But given their excess frac capacity out there, are there ways for you to sublease others -- other fracs and sort of take advantage of that in pursuing asset-light strategy? Just sort of wondering if you can sort of talk about other ways to optimize for further earnings growth beyond 2021?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Kevin, again. I think we -- I believe we have been doing that already in a lot of ways. The previous question about Demicks Lake, that's a great example of a brownfield expansion to where we put it there. And again, we're able to significantly reduce the capital for that capacity.","As we think about the fracs, I think we've done that as well. We have clear line of sight to MB-4 being full and significant volumes, if not MB-5 being full. But if you remember, the other thing we've done is we've announced like 65,000 barrels a day of, again, expansions at our existing facilities that our team was able to go find for much less capital than building another greenfield frac. And so that has delayed any discussion of an MB-6 because our team has been able to find those types of debottlenecking and expansion opportunities.","So I'd like to thank our team. We've done that. And we -- that's part of our DNA as we think about how we provide the capacity for our customers. And I know you made a comment at the very beginning, I would like to just give you my point of view, and I don't think we have seen slowing producer activity on our acreage, especially when you talk about the Bakken and the Permian. Yes, the Mid-Continent has pulled back, but we haven't seen any slowed activity in the Bakken or Permian at all.","Shneur Gershuni","No. Fair enough. I do appreciate the color. Maybe one final question. When do you guys expect -- when is your next projection for ONEOK to be a cash taxpayer?","Walter Hulse","Shneur, as we've said in the past, when we did the acquisition of the partnership back in '17, we said we wouldn't be a taxpayer through 2021. We've built between $6 billion and $7 billion worth of assets with bonus depreciation that we've been able to take advantage on top of that. So we have a good runway here before we will become a taxpayer at all.","And then, at some point, there will be a limitation on the utilization of the NOL that was put in place with the last tax act. But that would -- at that point, going forward, we would have kind of a 4% to 5% marginal rate somewhere out there in the future. So we don't see a full tax paying situation well into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","If I could actually start as a follow-up to the ethane extraction in the Bakken. Should we think of this -- the ethane extraction that you'll potentially do next year as a temporary dynamic until another pipeline comes on and more Canadian gas can come back to blend with the Bakken gas? Or do you think it will be more of a permanent thing?","Kevin Burdick","Christine, this is Kevin. I think we believe it's going to be a long-term thing. Because if you think about new capacity, any new capacity that's going to come online in the Bakken, it is highly likely it's going to have a BTU spec on it also because it's not going to have other gas to blend down with like currently is going on Northern border. So at least the various projects that we've looked at and been involved with, all of those contemplate a BTU spec.","Christine Cho","Okay. That's what I thought. Just wanted to confirm. And then could you give us a breakdown of where the 6 to 9 third-party plant connections are regionally?","Sheridan Swords","Christine, this is Sheridan. Those are going to come in -- as you'd expect, in the Bakken and in the Permian. And the 6 is pretty much half and half on each one of them. The growth is going to be some plants that will be coming on at the end of 2020 that could either be in 2020 or 2021.","Christine Cho","Okay. And is the growth primarily Bakken? Or that's also split between Permian and...","Sheridan Swords","It's split.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then can you give us an idea of the cadence and the magnitude of the third-party frac costs and rail cost roll off in 2020?","Sheridan Swords","Yes. Christine, we won't see any third-party rail costs in 2020 or we haven't predicted any since Elk Creek coming online, that has been reduced to 0. But the third-party frac will be about the same level it was in 2019 as in 2020 as we get ready for MB-5 coming online.","Christine Cho","Okay. So those costs are not going to go down this year?","Sheridan Swords","Third-party frac costs won't go down in 2020 from 2019. And that's baked into our guidance.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Just wanted to follow-up, I guess, with your conversations with producers in this environment and given how the commodity price has declined a bit here. Just wondering if you could relate with us, I guess, expectations for drilling activity. Has that been moderating? Or it seems like it'd all be firmly baked into your guidance at this point, but anything that you can share with us, I guess, on this topic?","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin. Yes, we're looking at the commodity environment very similar to our producers. Really, we focus on the crude side. We don't -- we have reduced our direct commodity exposure so significantly that really it's not that big a deal just when you get into the NGL prices or the nat gas prices. Most of the producers, our customers are telling us they're planning for a $50 crude environment. And therefore, that's the activity levels we're kind of assuming of the activity levels that you're seeing in the Bakken and the Permian in the current landscape. So that's the way we're thinking about it over the next couple of years, which we believe is very consistent with the way our customers are thinking about it.","Jeremy Tonet","That's helpful. And just a couple of cleanup questions, I guess, with the NGL logistics side. How do you guys sit on the storage side at this point? Do you think that there's more expansions that are needed there to kind of do what you want to do in Belvieu? And then in the 2021 guide, I guess, the Conway-Belvieu spread, any thoughts you could share with us on how that lands at that point?","Sheridan Swords","Well, I'd just say on the storage side that right now, we are in the process of constructing two new storage wells, both are 1.5 million barrels. And we're also putting in a 3.5 million barrel brine pond. So right now, we do see the need to expand our storage facilities, and we are doing it, and those will come up -- one of those will come -- one of those wells will come up this year. The next one will come up next year. So we think that puts us in a very good position on our storage side to be able to handle our growth. And then on the Conway to Belvieu spread, as we said, with the Arbuckle II pipeline coming online, for sure, the spreads are going to be very narrow. And in our 2020 and 2021 guidance, we are predicting a historically low spread or very narrow spread between Conway and Belvieu.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. Great. And just to confirm, I think you had said $50 to $55 is kind of the price deck that you guys are employing when you think about this guidance going forward?","Walter Hulse","Yes. From a crude activity perspective, that's the level we're thinking about it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","A couple of questions. First of all, when thinking about flaring and flaring limits, just curious do you think there's potential for North Dakota to tighten the flaring limits further? And if so, what would have to happen for that? And second, do you have any read-through or read into the recent report put out by the Railroad Commission in Texas regarding flaring there?","Kevin Burdick","Michael, it's Kevin. I'll start and then let Chuck jump in. I mean, the flaring -- the gas capture targets or the flaring targets in North Dakota do step down at the end of this year. They step down from 88% capture or step up from 88% capture to 91% capture. So clearly, that is one step-up in conversations we have with the state and our producers. Obviously, we want to drive that number well below that. We have experience. When you look back at '15 and '16, when we -- when midstream kind of got caught up, we drove flaring to lower levels than that. So I think that's the goal.","As it relates to Texas, yes, we saw the report. I think any -- just from a regulatory perspective, I do think we'll see continued discussions around flaring. As to where that goes from a regulation standpoint, I don't know that I'd have a point of view at this point. But Chuck, anything?","Charles Kelley","Yes, I guess what I would add, in North Dakota, Michael, is that the -- kind of the interested stakeholders up there between the state, the producers and the processors have been meeting fairly regularly over the last, let's call it, 2 quarters, looking at the current flaring rules, flaring exemptions, how the interested parties can work more closely together to mitigate flaring. And there's some discussion of potentially changing some of these rules going forward, but there's nothing concrete as of yet.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then...","Terry Spencer","Michael, let me just make one quick comment to -- I'll follow-up. So with the Texas report, I think it's just indicative of the fact that the heat on producers is really going to be stepping up in terms of flaring. And I think for midstream companies, I think that actually creates, obviously, opportunity. And in particular, we're going to see, I think, a step-up in terms of infrastructure getting built or maximized in order to reduce the flaring. And obviously, when we maximize that throughput from that rich gas, we're going to create more NGLs coming out of the basin sooner rather than later. So I think that's going to -- I think it's really going to step up. And I think the step 1 was the fact that the Texas Railroad Commission acknowledged what was happening. I think they did some really -- kind of took a unique look at it in terms of intensity of flaring. I think it really showed a picture that it's going to have to be addressed. And the regulators are going to have to address it and midstream's going to be a big part of that solution, of course.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then one follow-up just on the guidance. The growth CapEx range is a pretty wide range to give in February of the prompt here. Just curious what anchors the low and the high end of that range?","Kevin Burdick","Michael, it's Kevin. Similar to last year, when we had an even wider range, it really comes down to timing. You look at the number of projects we have -- we're expecting to come online in the first quarter. If we're always looking for ways to pull those back, if those get pulled back and we start realizing the EBITDA sooner, we'd love to do that, but that may pull a little capital that would move you towards the high end. Conversely, if some of these things, if they go the other direction for whatever reason, it could slow down some of the capital spend in '20 that would move you towards the low end. So it's really just going to come down to timing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Colton Bean","So just to follow-up there on the 2020 capital program. Can you clarify how much of that is attributable to the $900 million of backlog additions you slated for 2021?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. About half of the $900 million we announced is 2020 spend.","Colton Bean","Got it. That's helpful. And then with Demicks Lake III announced slated for '21, how are you evaluating absolute residue gas takeaway, understanding the comments earlier on heat content, but just in terms of absolute dry gas capacity?","Charles Kelley","Yes. Colton, this is Chuck. What I could say, I mean, obviously, you're going to need residue gas takeaway. We've said before some time in '22, perhaps 2023. We're currently in late-stage negotiations, negotiating a proceeding agreement with the project coming out of the Bakken. We're under an NDA, so we can't go into that any further. However, we believe some time in the next month or two, you should see some information come out publicly.","Colton Bean","Understood. And just a final one from me. On the Elk Creek expansion, is that effectively an all or nothing type process? Or could you add horsepower more ratably as it's needed?","Sheridan Swords","Well, Colton, this is Sheridan. As you said -- we said in our remarks that we will get some of that early in 2021 and then the later will come in later 2021, so we are ramping up that capacity as we go through the year. And if some reason we could slow it down if we needed to. We don't see that happening, but we could. We will get some as we go through the 2021. So we are ramping up the capacity.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Derek Walker with Bank of America.","Derek Walker","Just a couple of ones for me. Maybe I'll follow-up on the growth CapEx. I think you've talked to sort of the routine CapEx before around well connects and plant connects. How much of the 2020 growth CapEx is considered routine CapEx? And then similarly, kind of going into '21, you mentioned a step down in growth CapEx again. Should we kind of think of a similar run rate for routine CapEx in '21? Or should we think of that directionally up or down?","Walter Hulse","Yes. Over the years, we've said that our growth -- our routine growth CapEx is somewhere between $250 million to $400 million or so. It varies depending on where the plants are that we have to connect or the wells we're connecting, but it always is in that range. It's included in our guidance for 2020. From a growth CapEx standpoint, it wouldn't be significantly different in 2021, but we expect a meaningful step down in CapEx from 2020 to 2021 in the range of $1 billion less in 2021 than we will have in 2020.","Derek Walker","Got it. And then maybe I'll just ask a quick one on the dividend policy. You hit 9% last year. Should we think about 9% again in '21? Or should we think about kind of a normalized sort of rate relative to either the dividend [indiscernible] or perhaps some of the larger midstream names in the space?","Walter Hulse","Well, we've guided pretty regularly since 2017 that through 2021, we would pay in that 9% to 11% range. We've been at 9% throughout. And we don't see anything at this point that will change that view through 2021, and we're not going to give a view pass that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Kevin, I just wanted to go back maybe to something Michael was asking, but ask it slightly differently. And that's on flared volumes on the Rocky's footprint today, I believe, in your January update, you'd noted, for November, it was about 300 million cubic feet a day net to your acreage. I'm just curious, I guess, as a starting measure, where that is today? And then if we look at the growth in gathered volumes you've modeled or anticipate for 2020 versus what you did in the fourth quarter, how much of that is like phasing growth versus how much of that is flared capture? And I ask just to better understand the walk, but also where is that -- sort of as a set up to where that leaves us in '21?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Chris, clearly, the -- I mean, the latest number -- we have another month, it was basically flat, maybe a little bit -- our flaring on ours was a little bit less, but we're still in that 300 range. As we look going forward, we -- sorry, there's an echo here that's kind of messing with me. But as we look going forward, the volumes of the flared gas capture will drive -- especially as we move through the early parts of the year, we'll drive that flaring down significantly. But again, with the DUCs, with the rig count that's still running, as we kind of get towards the back half of '20 and going to '21, you still got just straight production growth at the rig counts we're currently seeing and the productivity of the wells being drilled. And then the other -- again, I mentioned earlier that another key volume dynamic for the growth is Bear creek II, that there's going to be some flared gas behind that system because it's geographically isolated. And we fully anticipate, as we get capacity down there, you're going to see some rig movements into that region to drill that area up.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Okay. That's very helpful. I guess, as a related point, Kevin, for those watching, I guess, inlet volumes at this creek plants, are we likely to see volumes sort of wheel to your newer facilities for processing before the aggregate footprint more broadly fills up? Are there efficiencies in having, I guess, an expanded plant portfolio where you're not -- where certain plants maybe are not isolated, but connected? Or, I guess, a longer-dated question, when you start to recover as staying on the plan for '21, are we likely to see that sort of disproportionately affecting certain plants and not others? I'm just asking because I know some people track individual facilities.","Kevin Burdick","Yes. We look at our system in total. Again, with the exception of Bear Creek, that area, the rest of our system, we look at it in total. And absolutely, we'll see some gas move from, say, Garden Creek to Demicks Lake and from Lonesome Creek to Garden Creek as we optimize our system. We'll push the gas to the plant and the facility that we believe we can get -- do it for the least cost and take advantage of our assets. So you will see some of that go on, but it really doesn't impact ethane recovery. Again, it will be a similar argument or discussion. If we start recovering -- or need to recover a little ethane that will ultimately come down to what the -- how the tariff is worded from a Northern border standpoint if there is a change there and how we want to operate our facilities.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Okay. Great. And if I could ask one final question, totally different. Can you just remind me some of the drivers of outperformance for the nat gas segment -- pipe segment in '19? I noted a modest EBITDA reduction that I think you're guiding for '20. It looks like you remain very well contracted on the capacity there. So I'm just, I guess, wondering if it's a rate or a cost issue? Or if it's something entirely different?","Charles Kelley","Chris, this is Chuck. So our 2019 outperformance was really driven by the capturing -- or the -- excuse me, the interruptible volumes that we flow. There was great demand particularly in Texas and Oklahoma on our interruptible capacities. But within the Permian Basin, they're being less takeaway capacity alternatives. And certainly, we had a real strong Q3 with very, very good cooling and relative generational load for the heat generating cooling. So that was 2019, the uplift. As you compare it year-over-year, what we did in looking at 2020 guidance, we typically will normalize our spring and summer electric generation loads. So as you look at our midpoint in 2020, we do have some upside in there should there be a repeat of a good strong summer, so our interruptible volumes can help us to the upside. And I might add that, recently, Permian Highway has indicated that they will be delayed until Q1 of 2021. So that potentially presents another opportunity for our Texas intrastates to capture some more interruptible transport services.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Question on the 100,000 barrels a day West Texas LPG expansion. Is that -- are those new plants that are sort of fueling those commitments? Or are you taking market share from others?","Sheridan Swords","Michael, this is Sheridan. We're doing both. We're getting plants -- new plants that are being connected, and we are getting volume off of the existing plants that are going to other pipelines.","Michael Blum","Okay. And then just turning to the '21 guidance, how much of the growth coming out of the Rocky Mountain region is contingent on Powder River Basin development versus just continued growth in the Bakken?","Kevin Burdick","Michael, both segments. It would be a very modest level of increase. It's not a driver. The driver is the Bakken and the Permian.","Terry Spencer","But Michael, don't let that be an indication of how we feel about the Powder, okay? We think the Powder has got a lot of unrealized potential. It could be -- it could -- and it just needs a little bit of price help, and we're certainly well positioned to be able to exploit that if, in fact, it -- the Powder does get a little bit of price help.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.","Alexis Kania","I guess, just a follow-up question with respect to West Texas LPG. With the expansion, more or less set, how do you think about the timetable with respect to your options related to conversion or repurposing of the legacy pipe?","Sheridan Swords","Alex, this is Sheridan. We -- with this latest expansion that we announced, we still have a little bit more expansion to do before we can free up one of the pipes to go into an alternative service. We did contemplate making a full expansion of the pipeline to open up the legacy pipe into a different service, but with -- we want to have better clarity and better line of sight into additional volume that we predict will be coming on later before we would go ahead and do the full loop -- complete the full loop of the West Texas pipeline, freeing up the legacy system for a different service.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.","Sunil Sibal","I got on the call late, just a couple of clarifications. I know you might have touched it. On the leverage side, I think you mentioned that you expect to get to close to 4x leverage some time in 2020. Is that correct? And if so, any -- if you can talk anything about funding assumptions that go into that?","Walter Hulse","Well, what we said in the prepared remarks was that the expectation that we've said before remains the same that we expect to be at 4x debt-to-EBITDA on a run rate basis either in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in early 2021. So that doesn't change. And then we expect to continue to delever further as we go beyond that period in 2021 as these projects come on, CapEx goes down and cash flows increase. So nothing's changed.","Sunil Sibal","Okay. Got it. And then one kind of broader question. I think in the past, you've talked about corporate M&A and the industry environment not being that conducive to that. I was wondering if you're seeing anything different in the industry environment right now?","Terry Spencer","No. No difference. Still a tough environment from an M&A perspective. We're going to stay focused on this organic growth strategy. If we do take advantage of some M&A opportunity, it'll more be in the area of the strategic bolt-on asset type acquisition. So our thinking really hasn't changed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Mateer with Barclays.","Harry Mateer","Sorry, first, just a follow-up on the last question. But you guys previously have talked about a 3.5x aspirational leverage target. And just want to confirm if that's still the case? And have you given any consideration to making that less of an aspirational target and more of an actual target potentially with some firmer time guidelines, just given how shaky the macro backdrop feels?","Walter Hulse","Well, if you just do the projections out based on the guidance that we've given you, you'll see that we go towards and through that 3.5x pretty quickly. What we said is that we thought aspirationally, on a going-forward basis, that we would be around that 3.5x as we saw continued growth going forward. If we don't see additional growth from where we are today, we will be well below 3.5x.","Harry Mateer","Got it. Okay. And then financing needs this year, if you could just talk about what your plans might be? Your next bond maturity is until 2022, but you do have a 2021 term loan that's prepayable. And you guys will outspend cash flow this year, again, after all the CapEx and dividend. So just curious how you're thinking about possible debt capital needs, especially given that 10 years almost at 1.3% right now?","Walter Hulse","We'll obviously build some short-term debt as we finish up this construction program. And you're right. We do have the term loan out there coming due in 2021. So we'll keep our eye on the market. And when we think it's appropriate, we may access the debt market. Obviously, we have no equity financing whatsoever in our thoughts.","Harry Mateer","Got it. Okay. And then last one for me, just putting different parts together in terms of your EBITDA growth for '21 and then the indication you gave about $1 billion of less CapEx in '21 versus '20. It seems like things are aligning for you to be at least free cash flow neutral after growth CapEx and the dividend. So -- and there are a number of other -- of your large-cap midstream companies that are trying to get there next year as well. So is that something like true free cash flow generation that you're thinking of targeting as a matter of policy? Or is it really, at this point, still just dependent on what other projects you might find?","Walter Hulse","Well, we're not going to give forward guidance out there. Again, if you do the math on what we've had out there, it will be a reality that that's where we'll be going forward. And we'll see what the future brings. But we're in a position where, on a going-forward basis, the company is going to generate a very significant amount of cash, well above dividends.","Operator","And our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.","Danilo Juvane","A quick question for me. Did you guys outline what price assumptions you have for the gathering and processing business for NGLs and natural gas included?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Danilo, this is Kevin. Yes, we're -- like we mentioned, we're looking at the crude environment in that $50, $55 type environment. Again, we're not that -- the direct commodity exposure we have is very limited, but we're thinking about nat gas prices and NGL prices not out of the -- not significantly different than like we look at the strip over the next year or so.","Danilo Juvane","I guess, so your guidance is premised on this basically strip budget for the entirety of the year?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. When you look at our guidance, that's the way we're thinking about those prices.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Congratulations on the new project announcements. Apologies, I was on the call a little late. So if you already addressed, we can skip it. But any comments on the export opportunities. And Walt, as you kind of have answered 2 or 3 questions about leverage, is there a downside limit where it just doesn't make sense to let that ratio fall any further, if you don't have sufficient growth CapEx and M&A available, a point where you have to think about new dividend or share buyback policy?","Walter Hulse","Well, as it relates to the second part of your question, obviously, as our debt gets paid down to the levels that I was just discussing, it opens up a lot of alternatives for us, whether it be share buybacks or dividends or whatever. But I think the key is that it will be -- we'll have the flexibility to do what we think is appropriate at that time. And as for the docks...","Craig Shere","Like, are you willing to go under 3x?","Walter Hulse","I'm sorry.","Craig Shere","Are you just willing to go under 3x?","Walter Hulse","Craig, we'll cross that bridge when we get there and see what the market environment is. But we're not there today. And so we're not going to speculate as to what the market is going to be at that point going forward.","Kevin Burdick","And Craig, this is Kevin. On the dock, similar as we have been communicating. It's still part of the business we would love to have. It's not something that we think we have to have, but we have a team working it very hard. Again, we're very confident that our barrels will continue to clear. We're not directly -- we don't have the price exposure to determine what the relative that -- or what that real value of the prices are on the Gulf Coast. But we'll keep working that opportunity. When we get the markets -- when I say the markets on the customers that we would be selling to, we have a lot of conversations around the globe with them, at the same time having conversations with people in the Gulf Coast about what are the dock and partnership opportunities there. So we'll keep working those. And when we get it all lined up, that's when we might make an announcement.","Terry Spencer","Craig, I'll just [indiscernible]. Craig, let me just make one follow-up comment to Walt's comment, the company has historically always managed the balance sheet in a very prudent way with an emphasis toward being investment grade. I mean, that's -- if you want to look for some -- hard line somewhere, that will be a hard line for us. And so as we think longer term, the company is always going to do what makes sense and is prudent, okay? And we've shown a long history of doing that. So that's what you can hang your hat on. That there's my speech.","Craig Shere","Okay. Just as my last follow-up. I was just wondering -- I don't know if Kevin wants to come back. But if LPG's, ethane or anything else was looking like the strongest horse in the race in terms of your ideal opportunities?","Kevin Burdick","In regards to export facility, Craig?","Craig Shere","Yes.","Kevin Burdick","Okay. Yes. It would be -- LPGs is where the significant focus is right now. And we're not ignoring the ethane opportunities that may come our way. But I think LPGs are the ones driving the majority of the conversations at this point.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Sir, please go ahead.","Andrew Ziola","Thank you, Katie, and welcome to ONEOK's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available.

Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.","On today's call, we will discuss, among other topics, ONEOK's third quarter financial and operational performance; our financial guidance increase included with yesterday's earnings announcement; NGL fractionation capacity; and we'll share our progress on our now $6 billion in capital growth program. Our strategy to create value for our stakeholder remains the same with our assets well positioned. In some of the most economic and prolific basins in the United States, we continually find opportunities to serve our customers through long-term fee-based contracts. The NGL and natural gas volume growth we have experienced this year continues to result in high-quality earnings growth attributable to our core business of fee-based services. Our volumes in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas, combined with favorable optimization and marketing activities from our extensive, reliable and integrated NGL network, has resulted in another increase in our 2018 financial guidance.","Since our last call, we've announced additional capital growth projects anchored by long-term customer commitments, which include the second expansion of our West Texas LPG pipeline to serve the continued growth in the Permian; another NGL fractionator in the Gulf Coast, MB-5; another processing plant in the Williston Basin, Demicks Lake II; and an expansion of the Arbuckle II pipeline, which has already begun construction. Building off our extensive asset base allows ONEOK to expand at attractive returns, providing clear visibility to strong earnings growth in 2019 and accelerating thereafter.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt.","Walter Hulse","Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter operating income totaled $495 million, a 40% increase year-over-year and an 11% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $650 million, a 26% increase year-over-year and an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2018 financial guidance for the second time this year, driven by strong financial and volume performance year-to-date and our confidence in the fourth quarter. We increased guidance for net income by 9%, distributable cash flow by 7% and adjusted EBITDA by 5%, all compared with our previous guidance midpoints.","Our new adjusted EBITDA midpoint is now $2.47 billion, an increase of $120 million compared with the guidance we announced last quarter and nearly $500 million above our 2017 adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint for all three business segments also increased with the largest increase of nearly 11% in the natural gas liquids segment. Continued volume growth and strong optimization results drove the $145 million increase in the NGL segment's guidance.","And greater-than-expected volume growth and higher average fee rates drove the guidance increase in the gathering and processing segment. With two months left in 2018, we feel confident in our new financial and volume guidance ranges. Kevin will provide additional detail on our revised 2018 volume expectations.","During the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.825 per share and last week, we announced another 4% increase to $0.855 per share or $3.42 per share on an annualized basis, in line with our previous guidance. The dividend is payable on November 14 to shareholders of record on November 5. At September 30, our debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.4x and 3.78x on a trailing 12-month basis.","We generated $133 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in the third quarter, a 6% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. For 2018, we expect to generate more than $500 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends that we can reinvest in the business to fund our capital growth program. Total distributable cash flow in the quarter was more than $470 million, up 4% from the previous quarter with a healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4x.","With $1.6 billion of equity issued in 2017 and January 2018, we have satisfied our expected equity needs for our announced capital growth projects through the remainder of 2018. We expect to benefit from increasing cash flows from operations in 2019 and expect any additional equity financing to be considered in the latter part of 2019. This consideration will be based on the timing and amount of capital expenditures. We expect any additional equity financing, if needed, to be limited to issuance under our existing at-the-market equity program.","As of now, we have nearly the full capacity of $2.5 billion available on our credit facility. We remain focused on sustaining our strong investment grade balance sheet and having significant liquidity as we construct our capital growth projects.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments.","Kevin Burdick","Thanks, Walt. Starting with our natural gas liquids segment. NGL volumes gathered in the third quarter averaged 956,000 barrels per day, an 18% increase compared with the third quarter 2017 and a 6% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Mid-Continent gathered volumes averaged 614,000 barrels per day during the quarter, an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Volumes on our West Texas LPG system averaged 204,000 barrels per day, a 4% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Our Bakken NGL Pipeline remains full, and we continue to rail NGLs out of the region. We expect rail volumes to continue to increase until the Elk Creek pipeline is in service.","NGL volumes fractionated average 732,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year and a 5% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Fractionation capacity across the industry remains tight, and our fractionators have been running near capacity. With recent expansion and debottlenecking projects, we estimate we have more than 800,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity given our current product composition, which gives us approximately 60,000 barrels per day of available capacity to accommodate growth. We expect that this capacity, along with additional debottlenecking projects at our existing fractionators, our storage assets and a small amount of already contracted third-party offloads, will provide sufficient capacity until our and MB-4 fractionator comes online in the first quarter of 2020.","ONEOK's standard practice is to align our NGL transport and fractionation agreements pricing terms with the actual physical redelivery location of either Conway or Mont Belvieu, thus, avoiding the risk of pricing mismatch in our contracts. So the contracts that support Arbuckle II include Conway pricing terms until Arbuckle II is in service and then the terms will switch to Mont Belvieu pricing. The benefit of our integrated system, including our use of storage for unfractionated NGLs in both the Mid-Continent and Mont Belvieu, offers a number of ways to optimize available capacity and provide our customers the NGL services they need.","Our Sterling I and II pipelines are currently shipping purity products and running full. And our Sterling III pipeline is transporting unfractionated NGLs into Mont Belvieu.","Our Arbuckle Pipeline continues to operate close to its full capacity of 255,000 barrels per day.","We continue to expect the transportation capacity from Conway to Mont Belvieu will remain highly utilized due to growing NGL volumes, which we expect will keep spreads wider than normal until Arbuckle II is placed in service. When Arbuckle II comes into service, it will have the ability to move the unfractionated NGLs currently flowing on Sterling III. This will open up capacity for more purity products to get to Mont Belvieu, which we believe will narrow the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu NGL pricing differentials.","In conjunction with increasing the segment's adjusted EBITDA guidance, which Walt talked about earlier, we've also updated 2018 volume expectations. Our guidance for NGLs fractionated increased by approximately 5%. And we narrowed the range for NGL gathered volume guidance, keeping the midpoint at approximately 925,000 barrels per day due to better-than-expected C3 plus volume growth in the STACK and the SCOOP, which was offset by the continued rejection of Conway-priced ethane.","Total ethane supply on our system continues to increase with approximately 100,000 barrels per day of additional ethane gathered on our system in the third quarter 2018 compared with the same period in 2017.","Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased 12% compared with the third quarter 2017, driven by volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas. Contract settlement adjustments in the second and third quarters of 2018, together, resulted in a sequential quarter adjusted EBITDA decrease, but the core business continues to grow.","Volumes remained strong across the basins where we operate. Third quarter natural gas volumes processed averaged more than 1.8 billion cubic feet per day, a 15% increase compared with the third quarter 2017 and a 3% increase compared with the second quarter 2018.","During the third quarter, ONEOK's natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region reached a new milestone averaging more than 1 billion cubic feet per day, a 17% increase compared with the third quarter 2017 and an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2018.","In the Mid-Continent, third quarter natural gas volumes processed averaged 835 million cubic feet per day, a slight decrease compared with the second quarter 2018 due to several large well pad completion delays. In October, we have already seen increased production with processed volume reaching nearly 900 million cubic feet per day on several days.","We connected 137 wells in the Williston Basin and 29 wells in the Mid-Continent during the quarter. We've now connected a total of more than 550 wells through the first 9 months of the year, well on our way to meeting our increased guidance of 680 well connections.","Rig activity remained strong with nearly 35 rigs on our Rockies-dedicated acreage, including two in the Powder River Basin and 15 in the Mid-Continent. The strong producer activity we've seen around our assets year-to-date is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.","We updated our 2018 volume guidance for the segment with the main change being the expected volume mix by basin. Our Rocky Mountain processed volume midpoint increased and our Mid-Continent processed volume midpoint slightly decreased due to the timing of completions in the STACK and the SCOOP areas.","The segment's average fee rate increased to $0.92 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2018 from $0.89 in the second quarter 2018. Higher fees continue to be driven by greater-than-expected volume growth in the Williston Basin compared with the volume growth in the Mid-Continent. We expect our average fee rate for the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter.","In the natural gas pipelines segment, third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 6% compared with the second quarter 2018 and increased 3% year-over-year, benefiting from increased interruptible transportation volumes and firm transportation capacity contracted. We had successful open seasons on three of the expansion projects announced in June, which will provide additional takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas. Open seasons resulted in more than 900 million cubic feet per day of capacity secured on our project to make Roadrunner Gas Transmission bidirectional, 300 million cubic feet per day of capacity secured on the expansion of our WesTex transmission system in the Permian Basin and 100 million cubic feet per day secured on the westbound expansion of ONEOK's gas transportation system in Oklahoma, which is on track to be completed before the end of the year.","The eastbound expansion of the ONEOK gas transmit - gas transportation system did not have an associated open season, but was anchored by 115 million cubic feet per day of firm commitment.","Now a quick update on our growth projects. Since our last earnings call, we've completed the extension of our West Texas LPG pipeline into the Delaware Basin. We also completed the expansion of our Canadian Valley natural gas processing plant in the STACK, which brings our total Oklahoma processing capacity to approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day. Volumes on both projects are expected to ramp up over the next 12 to 18 months.","Additionally, we recently completed some meaningful fractionation expansions in the Mid-Continent, including an approximately 20,000 barrel per day expansion of our propane plus capacity or heavy-in capacity at our Bushton, Kansas fractionator. This expansion was part of the related infrastructure upgrades included in our Elk Creek pipeline project to help accommodate the heavier NGL barrel coming from the Williston Basin.","We remain on schedule to complete the 60,000 barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III NGL pipeline this quarter. Construction remains on track for Elk Creek, and we continue to expect - to complete the southern section as early as the third quarter 2019 and the entire pipeline by the end of 2019. We've also contracted an additional 30,000 barrels per day on Elk Creek since our last call, bringing total contracted volume to approximately 170,000 barrels per day.","Arbuckle II is under construction and on schedule for an expected completion in the first quarter of 2020. The expansion of Arbuckle II, which was announced in July and will increase capacity - total capacity from 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2021. We've contracted an additional 20,000 barrels per day on the system, bringing our total contracted volume to approximately 320,000 barrels per day. Also, our MB-4 fractionator is on schedule to be complete in the first quarter of 2020.","Finally, we are currently constructing an additional 400 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Williston Basin with our Demicks Lake I and II plants with Demicks Lake I on track to be complete in the fourth quarter 2019. Given our current volume outlook, we expect Demicks Lake I to open nearly full.","As a reminder, all these projects are backed by long-term commitments and\/or acreage dedications addressing the needs of our customers and are aligned with the expected volume growth we see across our operating basins.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Kevin. This has clearly been a quarter of operational milestones and impressive financial results that underscore the reliability of our employees and our assets and the success of our customers in the basins where we operate. I'm not one who typically focuses on statistical records because we've achieved more than I can count over the years. Our goal, after all, is to create value for our stakeholders and let our track record of capital discipline and performance speak for itself, including doing what we say we're going to do and working hard to improve each and every day.","But the milestone Kevin mentioned earlier about reaching 1 billion cubic feet per day of processing in the Williston Basin is one that, I think, speaks volumes about the growth of our operations and the ambition of our employees. Just 8 years ago, we had only one processing plant in the basin. Now we're processing 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and are the primary NGL takeaway provider from the region. The growth between then and now isn't just the story of the Williston Basin, which has been an incredible basin for us, but it's also a reflection of our bigger company story and our continued growth in all the basins where we operate. Our employees have taken a great base of assets across our system and built a fully integrated midstream operation with unique competitive advantages in each basin where we operate. This kind of ingenuity and drive while doing it safely is what our employees thrive on and what has enabled us to announce our long list of growth projects at attractive returns. This couldn't have been accomplished without the hard work and dedication of each and every employee or without the continued support of our long-time investors.","To follow up on my closing remarks last quarter, we recently published our 10th corporate sustainability and ESG report, which is available on our website. Stakeholder expectations have continued to increase for the energy industry to operate safely and environmentally responsibly. At ONEOK, our long history of good corporate citizenship is clearly reflected in this report and I'm proud of our progress.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital.","Danilo Juvane","I wanted to start with the Mid-Con and how the volumes were sort of light this quarter. Can you sort of explain what drove that decline?","Kevin Burdick","Yes, Danilo, this is Kevin. Again, as I stated in my remarks, it was really just a timing of some of the well completions that we had kind of scheduled out with the producers. We had a little maintenance activity. But I think, as it relates to the STACK and SCOOP, what I'd do is look at the Mid-Continent volumes of NGL. I mean, we have like a 45,000-barrel per day increase sequential quarter-to-quarter for the NGL group, which I think is a broader indication of we still feel very strong about the SCOOP and STACK as well as we've seen the volumes pick up significantly in October in our G&P segment.","Danilo Juvane","Got it, got it. I know you don't provide guidance until February at least. But should we expect the volumes in Mid-Continent to remain as strong, if not stronger, in 2019?","Kevin Burdick","Yes, I think we expect - if you see this rig count remain, which we expect and I think you will see volume growth. I mean, getting the Canadian Valley II expansion complete and having that capacity now, you've got some of the pipe constraints with our projects and others that have taken care of some of the residue. So I think you're set for growth as we move through '19 and beyond.","Danilo Juvane","Got it. One of your largest customers in the Bakken outlined a pretty bullish long-term view for the basin. By our estimates, you are tapped out on central processing capacity and that's without including the PRB picking up here. How much more Rocky-related growth are you guys seeing going forward here?","Kevin Burdick","Well, let's start, on the G&P side, we still have some available processing capacity that we think we'll see a little more flaring, but we'll get there with our Demicks Lake I plant that's coming up in the fourth quarter. From an NGL perspective, yes, takeaway, the pipeline is full, but we've got the rail capacity that we've got up to 30,000 barrels a day of rail capacity that we will take advantage of as we move through '19 until Elk Creek comes online. And with Elk Creek, again, the southern section being complete in the third quarter, that allows us to accommodate growth that we expect to come out of the Powder early by shifting those volumes over to that pipe. Does that help?","Danilo Juvane","Got it. Last question for me - yes, absolutely. I appreciate that. Last question for me is on the ATM. Obviously, you said that you may need limited equity next year dependent on project timing. As you are sort of developing these organic projects, is it fair to see that you continue to get something in the 4 to 6 times EBITDA range?","Walter Hulse","Yes, we continue to see very attractive growth opportunities that are in the range of our capital investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Maybe I - just to start off, I was wondering if we can talk about storage a little bit. I guess kind of two-part question here. When we look at the inventory builds on your balance sheet, can we just assume that's effectively unbooked EBITDA and that's due to timing? And then, secondly, when we sort of think about your storage positions and we sort of think about the spreads and the pipes being full and so forth, are you able to synthetically effectively sell volume at Mont Belvieu without actually moving the molecule by using your storage in Belvieu and using your store storage in Conway?","Sheridan Swords","I don't think so. I mean, we can sell volume - I'm sorry, this is Sheridan, we can sell volume forward and store it in Conway until it's ready to be shipped to Belvieu, but eventually, it's going to have to be shipped. We can't synthetically make the transaction without actually physically shifting volume. Does that answer your question?","Shneur Gershuni","Yes, that's essentially it. And also the value of EBITDA - of the inventories booked at the end of each quarter on your balance sheet, is that effectively unbooked EBITDA that just didn't happen due to timing?","Kevin Burdick","Yes, this is Kevin. I mean, Shneur, you're really talking about from a raw feed perspective, that would be an inventory, yes, that would be effectively unbooked EBITDA.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. And just a couple of follow-up questions here. You sort of addressed some of this in your prepared remarks, but just to try to nail it down for us less technical people. Given the questions in the industry about being short capacity, can you walk us through how you mitigated that risk? When you go to build a new processing plant, for example, do you already line up the transportation and frac capacity that you expected the output of that plant? If you can sort of walk us through that, please.","Sheridan Swords","Yes, this is Sheridan. Yes, that's basically what we do. So most of our bundled services that we provided and how we contract, we go and provide certain amount of capacity to each processing plant, whether it's us or whether it's other people. And we make sure we have the transportation and fractionation capacity available to get that to the pricing point in the contract. And that's when we talked about Arbuckle II. Until Arbuckle II comes up, some of our contracts will stay priced in Conway as we can't physically get that barrel yet to Belvieu. But we look at through our whole system to make sure we're balanced and we don't get out of whack and get into a spot where we are having to buy third-party or buy out of spreads to handle our contracts or commitments.","Shneur Gershuni","Perfect, that makes total sense. One final question just in terms of outlook both near term and longer term. Ignoring the optimization spreads just due to the volatility in that, the good results that we've had this quarter, you've raised guidance, which implies a stronger 4Q, how much visibility do you have a of the base business growing into 2019? And then if I recall correctly during your prepared remarks, you'd mentioned that Elk Creek is now 70% contracted. By the time it comes online, could we actually be in a position to be expanding that?","Kevin Burdick","On that last question, yes, this is Kevin. We would love for that to be the case. I mean, we continue with - the growth in the Bakken continues to be strong. I think a lot of people listened to the call yesterday of one of the large producers up there and they were clearly very bullish when you just look at the returns they're getting on the wells. So absolutely, we don't think we're done. And like we've mentioned, we could expand that pipe with minimal capital by just adding pump stations as we continue to grow our contracted volume. And you're also seeing growth in the Powder River as well, which would feed Elk Creek from that standpoint. So yes, we think that, that's something that we're keeping an eye on of when we might need to expand that.","Shneur Gershuni","And with respect to 2019 in terms of the trends in your base business, should we expect a similar cadence of growth that we're seeing in 3Q this year and what you're guiding to for 4Q this year?","Kevin Burdick","I mean, without getting into guidance, clearly, when you look at the rates that are in our acreage on the G&P side and you look at the rigs that are ultimately behind our significant positions in the Mid-Con and the Bakken on the NGL side, absolutely, you would expect growth. As we've talked about, some of the pipes are full, but again we definitely believe that core business is going to be in a great position not just in '19 but then as we move through 20 when these assets come in service","Terry Spencer","Shneur, this is Terry. We'll be coming out with guidance after the first of the year at some point in time in January. So and as Kevin indicated, all the fundamentals look incredibly strong for us as we think about '19. Certainly, you can't forget about 2020 and 2021, we're doing a lot of things in '19 that set us up for 2020 and 2021 in a big way. So you'll see more as we come out with guidance after the first of the year in terms of what our thoughts are as far as volumes, but - and all the indications we're seeing from all the producers and rig count expectations are all just - are outstanding for '19.","Operator","Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse.","Spiro Dounis","Just wanted to start off on the tightness in the frac market. Obviously, you guy have taken steps there with Mont Belvieu 4 and 5 in 2020, 2021. But I guess, just in the near term here, how do you guys think about some of the short-term solutions to help clear the market? Is it all just going to storage? Are there other creative solutions you guys come up with going forward? And then just around OKE specifically, what are the other benefits we could see you accrue to you guys over the near term here?","Sheridan Swords","This is Sheridan. I think what you're seeing happening in the market is obviously storage plays a big place in that. If you can store barrels, for us it could be in Conway or in Belvieu for unfractionated NGL barrels until your fracs step up in '20 and 2021. Also we continue to look at our fracs in very detail to see is there any minor debottlenecking that we can do to eke out 5,000 barrels a day here, 10,000 barrels a day and then look at the different compositions we have. So we have some plans for that as we get into '19, the first quarter of '19, we'll have a little bit of turnarounds to help - allow us to incrementalize and move some of our fracs up in capacity. So I think you're seeing some of those - by all the industry participants continue to look at each one of those. And also we have seen, it's been pointed out in other calls, that there's actually some petrochemical crackers now that are looking at cracking unfractionated raw feed as well, especially when the spot frack market gets as wide as we have seen it, you always then have those participants coming in. So I think all those things are what's going to be needed to get to 2020 or beyond 2020. I still don't think the frac market will - I think the frac market will still be tight in 2020. We need to get through 2021 to really loosen it up or get it back to more normal levels. But everybody is well incentivized to find every creative solution to get a little more frac capacity to do storage, do cracking through our petrochemical facility or increasing your own frac capacity.","Spiro Dounis","Got it, that's great color. And then just on West Texas LPG and the potential to, I guess, convert to a crude pipeline there. How are you thinking about the timing around that, which I think is kind of a big factor, I'm guessing, in the economics. But what are the other factors you guys are considering as you think about that decision?","Sheridan Swords","I think one of the things we're considering is whether or not, with all the growth we've seen out there and our ability over these last months to be able to contract new volume, which drove our announcement under the expansion out there, that it may be better served to leave it in NGL service. And so that's probably one of the biggest decisions we have is what's the best service and how do we make the most money out of it going forward. Obviously, there's a spread differential in crude out there right now that everybody's trying to get to, but what's the long-term aspect of being able to contract that. So there's lots of different things, but we're talking to people about it, trying to understand how do we make the most money with the assets we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","I apologize in advance, this is probably like a multipart question, but I'm trying to understand a little bit about some of the dynamics with the flows and the bottlenecks. So it sounds like the producers are getting close to flaring limits in the Bakken, which, obviously, one way to alleviate that would be to toggle ethane yet you got downstream constraints on frac capacity to fractionate. So just wondering like how those two factors are sort of playing out those dynamics? And I guess, related to that, what is your utilization of frac capacity currently at Conway? And is there any room there for additional frac? So I know there's a lot in there, so apologies.","Kevin Burdick","Michael, this is Kevin. We'll start with the flaring in North Dakota. Clearly, as you've seen the state report information published the latest one, it's ticked up little bit. I would remind everybody that, that information is the gross production and the gross gas capture levels. So then what happens with each individual producer then is able to, with the updated regulations, they're able to utilize or take credits, if you will, if they have beat the target over the last six months. And they're also able to exclude 60 days of IP gas on their new wells. So we believe many of our producers will be able to stay under and expect to stay under the flaring targets as they move through '19 till some of the capacity comes online. To the question about the ethane and the toggling there, clearly, we're managing that very carefully with all our processing plants to try to maximize throughput while still also managing the downstream impact. So obviously, we are rejecting at this point with the Bakken line being full and then the rail activity, we are rejecting as much ethane as we possibly can to give us as much NGL Takeaway capacity as possible to help them out. So that's the way we think about that. As for the Conway specific, Sheridan, do you have comments about the Conway?","Sheridan Swords","Michael, what I'd say about Conway is we stated in Kevin's remark that we have about 60,000 barrels a day of available fractionation capacity. And with our integrated system, we can make that fractionation capacity show up anywhere on our system that we want to as we move raw feed around. But with wide north-south spread, you would say all that fractionation capacity is in Conway because we're taking everything we can to Belvieu. So right now we'd probably say we have 60,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity in our Conway market. That is above what we're bringing in on gathering. Today, we're using that 60,000 barrels a day to reduce our raw feed in inventory, and we plan on ending the end of this year, end of 2018, with minimal raw feed in inventory to get ready for the ramp-up in volume in '19 and get us to the 2020 MB-4 fractionator.","Michael Blum","Got it. I appreciate the details - the detailed answer. My second question really is more of a balance sheet financing question. Just as we think about modeling going forward, is there a leverage ratio that we should think about where you'd start to then consider tapping the ATM for equity a little bit to keep that within some sort of range?","Walter Hulse","Well, Michael, what I would say is that with the increased cash flow and the earnings growth that we've had in '18, we've been able to reinvest that money back into the business so it's kept our leverage at a run rate basis right now at 3.4x. So we're sitting pretty good at the end of three quarters and going into '19. We've always said that our longer-term target is to be below 4x and nothing's changed on that. But we've also said that we expected it to creep up in the latter part of '19. The rating agencies have acknowledged that. And so we're going to have to keep an eye on it. But our expectation is that cash flows keep flowing as they are, we'll be in a pretty good spot moving throughout '19. So we're keeping ourselves flexible if we need some equity, but we think there's a good chance that there won't be any equity in '18.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","I have a follow-up to Shneur's question. If you fractionated the barrels, but put it into storage afterwards as purity product, then it's booked as revenue in your income statement, is that right? So there could be inventory on your balance sheet that already has been recognized as revenue?","Sheridan Swords","That is correct. If you fractionate.","Walter Hulse","It's when you actually sell the barrel that we get. The thing is that we fractionate and store so many barrels on a constant flow basis that they're constantly flowing through there, Christine, and bringing in as much as we do on a daily basis. But we actually recognize the revenue when it is sold. The Barrels are fungible and they're going in and out of storage every day.","Christine Cho","But I guess, when we look at the buildup in your inventory, I mean, should we - if more of that was purity product than y-grade, I'm just trying to get a sense of like whether or not most of that was already recognized versus not, if that makes sense.","Walter Hulse","It wouldn't be recognized until we got it solved. But obviously, if it's purity product we have ability to sell it into the marketplace at any time.","Sheridan Swords","We sell almost all our barrels every day into the marketplace. We don't take price risk on our barrels, so we're selling our barrels every day into the marketplace.","Christine Cho","Okay, but I guess I'm also trying to split to, Sheridan, your comments on earlier questions that you guys are trying to reduce your y-grade inventory in storage, is that right?","Sheridan Swords","That is correct.","Christine Cho","Okay, but the number one up, so I can only assume that your purity product storage went up, is that incorrect?","Sheridan Swords","Those aren't necessarily the same. If we fractionate our y-grade in inventory, we'll sell it into the marketplace. If we decide to keep y-grade in storage, we may still sell it in the marketplace and then sell it forward or something as we go with that. But just because we fractionate more barrels, more barrels in y-grade, doesn't necessarily mean that we have to store that barrels of purity product. We still have the ability to place it into the market.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then I think you kind of alluded to this in your prepared remarks. But for the last year and change, guys have told us that we should assume that your optimization capacity would decrease throughout the year if customer commitments grew. But it sounds like we should assume that what you have now is what you'll continue to have maybe actually go up when your Sterling III extension comes online. Is that the right way to think about it?","Sheridan Swords","Well, as our Sterling III expansion comes online, we will be moving - we'll have obligations to move more y-grade into the Mont Belvieu market. Not all of that y-grade that we move into the Mont Belvieu market we'll need to frac because some of the - the main contract that supported the Sterling III expansion was a transport-only barrel. So we still have that obligation to get those barrels into the Mont Belvieu market. But to the extent we have excess capacity on Sterling III and have the frac capacity and Mont Belvieu to frac it, we would increase our optimization.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then how much debottlenecking can we see out of the fracs? I mean, you guys already mentioned the 20,000 barrels per day of propane plus out of the Bushton frac. Was that included in your 800 number or no?","Sheridan Swords","Yes, it was.","Christine Cho","Okay. But how much more could we see beyond that? Do you guys have like a general sense?","Sheridan Swords","I think you can maybe able to see 20,000 to 30,000 possibly. A lot of depends on, when you get these higher levels depends, actually on the composition that you have coming into the system. So as we do different things, composition could change, they'll move around. But you could see 20,000 to 30,000 possibly.","Terry Spencer","So Sheridan, this is Terry. So that 800,000-barrel a day number could be higher number particularly if the feed composition change to a lighter barrel, more ethane.","Sheridan Swords","Yes. We can frac 840-plus thousand barrels a day as our nameplate if we had the right composition. And especially in the wintertime when you got colder temperatures, we can definitely get above nameplate with the colder temperatures in there. But right now, we still have some ethane being rejected on our systems, so we're still fracking very heavy barrels especially at the Bushton fractionator. So if we get live feed, we will go above that. But we're seeing we're at - at the composition we see today, we can get above 800,000 barrels a day.","Christine Cho","And we wouldn't see the 840-plus unless the Conway ethane frac spread went positive, is that right way to think about that?","Sheridan Swords","Yes, you need to get more ethane into the Conway fracs however that happens.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Just want to pick up with Conway-Belvieu a bit more here, and granted, it's a very, very difficult question to answer and you're not providing guidance at the time, but I was just wondering if you could provide us with your updated thoughts on how you think that spread could kind of trend over next year? Where do you see some of the give and takes there? And as it impacts your optimization, do you see more risk to the upside or downside in 2019 versus 2018 optimization margins there?","Sheridan Swords","Well, 2018 was pretty good. So if 2018 would repeat itself, that would be very good. But we think it will be volatile and - but it won't go back to historical levels or anywhere close to historical levels until we get Arbuckle II up and get more purity capacity in between Conway and Belvieu. But a lot to me depends on what the demand is in Belvieu for our exports on propane and petrochemicals on ethane, overall price, there's a lot of factors that go into that. But what we do know is it that we have volume in Conway that can't get to Belvieu due to pipeline constraints and that won't be allayed to Arbuckle II, which is what leads to a wide north-south spread.","Jeremy Tonet","Fair enough. And at the risk of asking about something besides NGL, just want to pivot towards the WesTex expansion there and really just trying to dig in a little bit more and see how much of that - this build-out is getting to destinations that really kind of clear the basin. I mean, does the extension kind of connect into north of Plainview or for NGPL kind of north of Amarillo? Just trying to see how much extra this helps get past choke point.","Charles Kelley","Yes, Jeremy, this is Chuck. The OGT - I'm sorry, the OWT northbound, it was pretty much designed to move the Waha gas molecules north to the Mid-Continent where the spreads were wider and they could access little different markets. So yes, you're seeing that gas up into the Texas Panhandle and potentially utilizing some of the Oklahoma assets as well.","Jeremy Tonet","So it connects in north of those kind of 2 hubs on those pipes?","Charles Kelley","Yes, you're looking at NGPL, Panhandle, Mid-Continent-based markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","We're six days out from election day, how are you guys thinking if the unlikely scenario plays out that Prop. 112 in Colorado passes? And I know you've kind of talked about it, but just how do you think this kind of flows through each of your three segments?","Terry Spencer","This is Terry. Really no significant impact if Proposition 112 passes. Doesn't look like it's going to pass, it's close. But it doesn't look like it's going to pass. But even if it does, don't expect any significant impact to us, to our business whatsoever.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then one other question really, just kind of balance sheet and credit metric perspective, you've got a lot of growth projects that you're going do fourth quarter this year through next year. What is the peak leverage level, the peak debt-to-EBITDA that you're willing to go to knowing that it's going to be temporary? Meaning knowing it may be just for a quarter or 2 or 2 or 3 quarters before the big backlog of projects comes online in second half of '19 through 2020?","Walter Hulse","Well, I think my answer is going to be the same as I said just before is that our long-range target's 4x and we will edge above that in the latter part of '19. But we're seeing very significant cash flows from the business that we're reinvesting into the business. So we think that if things keep trending that we'll be in a good spot from a balance sheet standpoint. But if we need a little bit of equity, we have the ATM available.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.","Sunil Sibal","A couple of questions for me. First, the clarification on the max frac capacity that you mentioned previously on the call, the 840,000 barrels a day and then you have 20,000 to 30,000 on top of that in composite, everything?","Kevin Burdick","We would have - the 20,000 to 30,000 would be on top of both the 800,000 barrels a day that we can frac with our current composition. So the extra 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day would be on top of that.","Sunil Sibal","Okay, got it. And then on the G&P segment contract settlements, which impacted this quarter, how should we kind of think about that going forward? Is that something of a bit of an ongoing issue? Or is that kind of resolved at this stage?","Charles Kelley","This is Chuck. No, that - we have approximately 2,000 contracts in the G&P segment. And from time to time, you're just going to see settlements and adjustments on some of these contracts. So no, that wouldn't be something we would anticipate going forward.","Sunil Sibal","Okay. And then, lastly, on the Canadian Valley processing plant that you brought online. I was just wondering based on the activity you're seeing behind that, what's the kind of the expectation for that plant ramping up and getting full?","Charles Kelley","We think - as we said in the remarks, it'll be - probably it'll ramp over the next 12 to 18 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Just a little nitpicky one maybe for me, Terry, if I could. On Slide 7 of the deck, you guys featured as you had in past quarters the anticipated bundled - average bundled rate by region. I just was noticing the Mid-Con, WesTex, I'm sorry if you mentioned this before, but there's now a tilde between those two ranges as opposed to a less-than symbol. So I'm just curious what sort of happened in those regions to maybe bump up modestly your view on the bundled rate?","Sheridan Swords","Well, I think on West Texas pipeline, you're seeing a bump up on that because as we brought these new volumes on, they're at-the-market rate, which is much higher than the legacy rate that some of the old volume was on. And some of that old volume has left and so we fill some of the existing volume with higher-market volume. So our average rate is starting to trend up on the West Texas pipeline as we thought it would as we bring on market-based barrels, market price barrels for T&F service. And the Mid-Continent is the same thing, we've been able to contract it at little bit higher rates. As we continue to go forward, we've had some volume decrease on areas like the Barnett Shale and places like that, but some that are smaller volume - smaller-rate volume and we'll put it in STACK and SCOOP, which is higher-rate volume at the Mid-Continent. We're seeing a shift towards the higher-margin volume from the low-margin volume on our system.","Christopher Sighinolfi","And is there - I guess, as you think about that then on profile forward, is there a meaningful amount of contracted volume that you guys know of that you think is going to be profiling off in the next couple of - next - in whatever period you want to define it that could cause that rate to go higher on just existing capacity? Or is this driven more of over time just by adding these stuff?","Sheridan Swords","I think on the West Texas pipeline over next year and into 2020, you will see a lot of our low-rate volume leave the system in favor of market-based or a more market rate volume. So yes, you could see significant increase in the West Texas LPG system average bundled rate.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Okay, great. Switching gears real quickly, a lot of questions on the Bakken from a gas recoverability and processing perspective. I'm just curious if we get it to crude, you had mentioned and referenced one of the largest producers up there talking positively about the basin. There's two pipelines that have talked about expansion opportunities. I'm just wondering your view on that from a crude perspective as both a major operator and someone who formerly had a crude project in the backlog?","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin. Yes, we've got a lot of questions when you have a differential blow out a little bit, that was primarily due to an abnormal amount of refinery maintenance that was occurring in the upper Midwest, you've seen that spread come back in. But as you look forward, clearly you've got an open season out there right now on DAPL. You've got some other expansions being discussed. I mean, clearly, the producer yesterday was in conversations about larger expansions that they think may happen over the next couple of years. And you've also got some rail - a significant amount of rail capacity that used to be in service and now is sitting there. So with the combination of those expansions and the rail capacity, I think, as we talk to customers, they're comfortable that, that's going to absolutely bridge them to the point if you did need another greenfield project to provide additional capacity out.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Okay. Yes, I guess, that's what prompted my question was the discussion of significant new capacity, which seemed to be bigger than what those current expansions have discussed. So when I was just dusting off who had at prior points in time talked about projects from there, you guys being one, I was just curious if that - obviously, you have a ton in flight and I'm not saying you should add anything more at this point. I'm just curious if Bakken crude express gets dusted off at any point.","Kevin Burdick","It's not on our radar at this point. I mean, we're absolutely locked and focused on providing the processing and the NGL takeaway. But you know, long term, we are a big player up there. Is it something we would consider, absolutely.","Terry Spencer","Chris, it's Terry. So what I'll tell you just from our experience the last time the challenge associated with getting the kind of commitments that you need to make these large projects like Bakken Express work very challenging, the things that these producers do are innovative ways - using their ingenuity to find ways to get barrels out of that basin, and Kevin just listed off all those things. An so we've recently talked to some producers in private meetings about this very thing. And they're working on a lot of things, they have a lot of options to get crude out of the basin and we really don't have concerns about crude takeaway, certainly, over the near term and broadly over the long term really.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","One quick follow-up on West Texas LPG repurposing. I was under the impression that the expansion connecting the line and Arbuckle II kind of sets you up for twining the systems so that you don't have to have an either\/or proposition, albeit maybe a couple of years out to really bring on an opportunity to enter into crude service. So can you kind of elaborate on that?","Sheridan Swords","I think what we're saying there is when we complete the loops that we're starting on these expansions we've done so far, we'll have a complete system from the Permian to Arbuckle II then we'll use Arbuckle II to get into Mont Belvieu, which will open up the legacy West Texas system for some other service. As we continue to go, we've explored looking at crude and what that looks like. But we're also seeing a lot of opportunity in the NGL services that we may be able to fill, all that we have are capacity we see going forward on this Loop and Arbuckle II and need additional capacity for NGL. So it may be better to leave it in NGL service or it may be better to put it in crude service. But as we go along, we'll make that determination. But it's not a foregone conclusion that we will move it to crude service. We'll move into the right service that makes us the most money.","Craig Shere","Understood. I know kind of breaking into services in the crude spaces then, along with LPG exports, has been kind of a focus for longer-term opportunities to add a leg to the stool, so to speak. If West Texas is most optimally used for NGL service for a number of years forward, is there anything else you're looking at to kind of provide additional multiple services to same producers?","Sheridan Swords","Well, I think we still would like to look at the crude side of it for sure, it just may not be through this method. There's - obviously, there's other methods to get into that side from different ways starting from gathering or further down the road, it could be M&A further down the road. You don't know. On the export side, we continue to work very hard on the export side and having a lot of meaningful discussions and growing. But when we're ready to announce that one, we'll announce that one when we get everything lined up. So we still see that as opportunity to where we could grow, it just may not be through the West Texas LPG side.","Terry Spencer","Craig, the only thing I'd add to what Sheridan said is that we've talked about other products, refined products, in particular, terminalling that could make some sense for us. So crude, refined products, LPGs, potentially logistical opportunities serving petrochemicals and refineries, those type of logistical assets could make some sense for us. Certainly, we don't see a lot of them popping up for sales. People covet those assets. But certainly, we're interested in those types of things and particularly bolt-on opportunities. When Sheridan indicated M&A, that's what he's referring to, just when acquiring assets that could make sense. So we're always prospecting through those opportunities, those types of opportunities. So as we think about the LPGs, we think about Mexico, we think about Canada potentially. We're actively pursuing or actually considering or developing opportunities in those spaces. So that's the kind of thing that we're in. And certainly, the export opportunity is something we've been working for years. We like where we are today and we're making progress. And certainly, when we get further down the road or ready to roll that project out, certainly we'll come out. I'd just tell you personally from the export dock standpoint, if we're not announcing something probably in the first half of '19, I'll be disappointed. But again, a lot of things have to happen in order for that to be successful.","Craig Shere","I appreciate all the color. It certainly sounds like a full plate.","Operator","Our final question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Just one very small follow-up. In your responses to Christine about the inventory levels and sort of the changes in value and so forth, is it fair to conclude that with NGL prices rising something like 20% or 25% from, let' say, June 30 to September 30, that, that's part of the remeasurement upwards as well also you're just booking something at a higher cost that's come in?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. So I think that's the way you look at it.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. So you can have a scenario where the actual volume of inventories goes down, but the value booked on the balance sheet goes up because of the price basically, that's a potential outcome?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Just as you work through that and work that off, then yes, you could see some changes.","Operator","At this time, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ziola for closing remarks.","Andrew Ziola","Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until we release earnings in late February. We'll provide details for the conference call at a later date. Thank you all for joining us, and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference.

Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Ziola","Thank you, Vicky and good morning everyone and welcome to ONEOK\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK\u2019s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I would like to start by welcoming Andrew back to the team and I also want to acknowledge T.D. Eureste for his many contributions to our Investor Relations efforts during some of the most challenging times over the last few years. T.D. is now Vice President of our Treasury team.","Joining me today on this call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","Our second quarter ended with the completion of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction, which included the acquisition of all of the common units of ONEOK Partners we did not previously own. ONEOK is even better positioned to execute our long-term growth strategy for the benefit of both our legacy and new ONEOK shareholders. We have many opportunities for organic growth across our businesses through our diversified and integrated midstream asset footprint in some of the nation's most active shale plays. We can provide our current and new customers with full service midstream capabilities. As I have said before, growth opportunities continued to develop in the areas we operate.","Our second quarter 2017 financial results were solid with volume growth in both our gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. Higher average fee rates in our G&P segment and higher transportation revenues from completed expansions in our natural gas pipelines segment. Walt will review our financial results and provide additional color on our 2017 guidance, which was updated to reflect the merger transaction and our business outlook for the rest of 2017. Kevin will discuss our operational results in more detail as well.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt.","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry. ONEOK reported strong financial results for the quarter, including healthy dividend coverage of approximately 1.5 times for both the second quarter and through the first half of 2017. As noted in our earnings release, second quarter results included approximately $43 million in one-time and transaction related charges, which impacted second quarter earnings per share by $0.12 per share and dividend coverage by 0.18 times. Last week, we increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.745 cents or $2.98 per share on an annualized basis. The successful completion of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction combined with the proactive steps we have taken to improve our leverage position and balance sheet are being recognized.","In July, ONEOK received credit rating upgrades to investment grade from both S&P and Moody\u2019s. Both agencies also have established stable outlooks on the company. ONEOK\u2019s trailing 12-month GAAP net debt to EBIT was 5x at June 30, including transaction costs, 4.9 times without the transaction costs. We continue to expect to reduce leverage to a target of 4x or less by late 2018 or early 2019 primarily driven by expected growth of adjusted EBITDA. In July, we took additional proactive steps to manage our future debt maturities and liquidity by utilizing ONEOK\u2019s cash on hand to immediately reduce commercial paper borrowings, completing a $1.2 billion senior notes offering redeeming all $87 million of our 6.5% senior notes due 2028 and repaying $500 million of our $1 billion term loan due 2019. As a result, we now have nearly $2.2 billion of available capacity on our $2.5 billion credit facility.","2017 guidance has been updated to reflect the June 30 close of the merger transaction with the only adjustment to the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA being the impact of transaction expenses. Our original guidance provided on February 1 did not include the one-time or transaction-related charges I mentioned earlier and the original guidance also assumed a January 1 transaction closing day. We narrowed ONEOK\u2019s adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.89 billion to $2.06 billion and increase our growth capital expenditure range by approximately $70 million to reflect recently announced projects. Please refer to our news release, investor presentation and the 10-Q filings for additional details on the quarter.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments.","Kevin Burdick","Thanks, Walt. Starting with our natural gas liquids segment, NGL volumes gathered averaged approximately 807,000 barrels per day, a 6% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and NGLs fractionated increased 8% compared with the first quarter. Bakken NGL pipeline volumes were up 8% averaging 141,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. NGL volumes gathered from the STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent and out of the Permian basin also increased during the second quarter. Mid-Continent volumes increased 4% and volumes on our West Texas LPG pipeline increased 7% compared with the first quarter 2017.","The Permian basin remains one of the most active basins in the country and we continue to have promising discussions with producers and processors in both the Midland and Delaware basins to expand our West Texas LPG system to capture expected production growth. We connected two additional third-party natural gas processing plants during the quarter both in the Mid-Continent in addition to the three plants connected in the first quarter of 2017. And we have already connected one additional third-party plant in the Permian basin in the third quarter. The total combined NGL production of these 6 new plants is expected to run to approximately 30,000 barrels per day by the end of 2017 and increased to more than 40,000 barrels per day in 2018.","Ethane rejection levels on our NGL system remained relatively unchanged in the second quarter 2017 averaging more than 150,000 barrels per day similar to first quarter levels. We continue to expect an increase in ethane recovery on our system through the remainder of the year as new petrochemical plants are completed. For the natural gas gathering and processing segment, second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 23% compared with the first quarter 2017 primarily driven by volume growth in the Williston basin and STACK and SCOOP areas.","The segment\u2019s average fee rate was $0.87 per MMBtu in the second quarter 2017 compared with $0.76 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2016, a 14% increase which was driven by increased volumes on higher fee contracts in the Williston basin. We expect the segment\u2019s average fee rate to be closer to $0.85 for all of 2017 as our volume mix shifts across regions and contracts depending on producer activity. We achieved our highest level of volumes processed in the Williston Basin during the second quarter, with volumes averaging more than 820 million cubic feet day, a 13% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017.","Mid-Continent volumes average more than 690 million cubic feet per day, a 4% increase during the quarter. Despite commodity price fluctuations during the quarter, drilling rigs have remained steady. We currently have more than 30 rigs operating on our dedicated acreage in the Williston basin in approximately 15 rigs on our dedicated acreage in the STACK and SCOOP areas. In the Williston Basin, we connected 108 wells during the second quarter. We expect to connect 400 wells in the basin this year and estimate there are still approximately 300 drilled, but uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage. With this new production that has recently come online, our available processing capacity is now approximately 150 million cubic feet per day in the Williston Basin.","Growth in the Mid-Continent continues to be driven by increased activity and strong production results from our customers in the STACK and SCOOP. Recent activity levels and production results continued to exceed expectations. We connected 27 wells in the Mid-Continent during the second quarter and we expect to connect approximately 100 wells on our dedicated acreage in the Mid-Continent in 2017 as our volume ramp is expected to be weighted more towards the second half of the year. In the natural gas pipelines segment, second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 18% compared with the same period in 2016. The segment continues to benefit from higher fee based earnings driven by increased firm contracted capacity in connection with the expansions of our West Texas transmission pipeline and our Permian Basin joint venture Road Runner pipeline, which will both completed in October 2016.","In our earnings release, we provided updated segment specific guidance and volume expectations. Overall, we have increased adjusted EBITDA for our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas pipelines segments and increased our G&P volume outlook. These increases were primarily driven by higher than projected volumes in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas and our expectation that drilling and completion activity will remain strong through the second half of the year based on recent discussions with our producer customers. We narrowed our adjusted EBITDA guidance in the natural gas liquids segment reflecting adjustments for the timing of the expected volume increases from recently connected third-party plants. In mid-June, we announced NGL and natural gas related expansion projects totaling approximately $170 million to accommodate growth in the STACK area. Projects include a 60,000 barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III NGL pipeline, increasing its capacity to 250,000 barrels per day and additional NGL gathering system expansions in the area, which are all backed by a long-term contract and plant dedications.","These expansions are expected to be complete by the end of 2018. Additionally, we announced the construction of a 30 mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of the STACK to connect with an existing third-party natural gas processing plant in Oklahoma, which will provide us access to an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity and is expected to be in service by the end of 2017. And most recently on Monday, we announced plans to expand our Canadian Valley natural gas processing facility in the STACK area of Western Oklahoma. The project will increase capacity at the facility to 400 million cubic feet per day from 200 million cubic feet per day and is expected to be complete by the end of 2018. It also will provide approximately 20,000 barrels per day of additional volume into our NGL gathering system. Combined with the third-party processing agreement I just mentioned, this plant will bring our total Oklahoma processing capacity to 1.1 billion cubic feet per day. The additional capacity is needed to support the rapidly growing production in the area and is backed by more than 200,000 acres of dedication primarily fee-based contracts and minimum volume commitments.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thanks Kevin. A couple final comments as it relates to our future growth projects before we take your questions. We continue to grow our backlog of potential capital growth projects that we are working hard to develop and earn customer commitments. Once we do so we will certainly announce those projects. Additionally I am confident that over time, we will add to our backlog as we have done in the past. We expect to continue to grow in our existing businesses and continue to focus on applying our core capabilities to create value for our customers and investors. Finally, I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work, dedication and commitment and operating our systems safely, reliably and environmentally, responsibly every day.","Operator, we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good morning, guys.","Terry Spencer","Good morning, Shneur.","Shneur Gershuni","Just two questions here, the first one is with respect to guidance, I was wondering if you can square something for me, I recognized that you have raised guidance at the operational level, because of Bakken volumes, however when I look at the kind of the midpoint it doesn\u2019t suggest a surge in volumes, but at the same time I look at your performance, I look at comments from E&P producers, it seems like the \u2013 your volume guidance should have been a little bit higher in the \u2013 in the Bakken, is there a hint of conservatism or is there a bottleneck that we should be thinking about. And then staying on the guidance question, the NGL segment revision sounds like it\u2019s a delay in some [indiscernible] by producer, is that just shifting earnings into next year, I was just wondering if you can give a little bit of color about that as well?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Shneur, this is Kevin, I will take the G&P question first. No, I don\u2019t know that we believe there is conservatism built into our volume guidance for that we provided. One thing when we think about the Williston, to me look you do the math, we are showing that we are going to need to grow in Q3 and Q4 to meet the midpoint of the processed volume guidance. The other dynamic going on there especially what the Williston is winter. So we have to \u2013 we learned from January, last January and February that we do have a little bit of winter weather factor built into that guidance as well. As we look from an NGL repeat \u2013 could you repeat the question on NGL side again.","Shneur Gershuni","On the NGL I was wondering if you can give just a little more color as to why the revisions there is it something that rolls into \u201818 or how should we think about that?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. The downward revision, small revision to our volumes in the EBITDA on the NGL segment was related to timing. We clearly, don\u2019t see that as a change in our point of view on the activity levels. It literally was just as that the specific timing the plants came online and how the volumes then are ramping. So yes, it would be, we don\u2019t necessarily see our exit rates changing, it was more a factor of when they came online and how that played into the full year average.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And then a final bigger picture question, when I sort of look at Oneok\u2019s earnings performance and CapEx spend over the last 2 years, relative to your peers your capital investment intensity has been fairly low, I do recognize that you haven\u2019t announced capital investments, but relatively speaking versus earnings growth which has been much higher than your CapEx expense, are there more opportunities to continue growing your business while keeping your capital intensity on the lower side. I suspect you have done some off-take agreements and asset optimizations, but is that largely done and future growth will kind of have a corresponding one-for-one investment in CapEx or are there more opportunities continue growing earnings without the same intensity on CapEx that we see in some peers?","Terry Spencer","Shneur, I will \u2013 let me make a couple of comments and then if the Kevin has got some of that he can follow-up. We do have some more opportunity in terms of \u2013 in terms of taking advantage of the headroom that we have in our businesses. That will kind of come and go and we will kind of work those opportunities dependent upon what\u2019s out there in terms of the G&P landscape. So that will be a bit of a moving target, but we think there is more opportunity to do that. But I think just fundamentally speaking we are going to see more capital spend going forward than we have seen from our traditional run rates over the last couple of years, just based upon the fundamentals that we are seeing the strong rig counts that we are seeing right underneath our noses. So I do expect that run rate to increase as we continue to develop those projects and those projects that hit the full menu of services that we provide NGLs, G&P, fractionation and what have you, so as those come together and materialize, we will adjust our backlog of unannounced growth projects appropriately and certainly we will provide you more color as we move forward. Okay, Kevin anything that you would add there.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate the color.","Terry Spencer","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Eric Genco with Citi.","Eric Genco","Hi, good morning. I guess this is going to touch on the last question a bit, but in terms of the extension with Canadian Valley, you are getting 200 a day for 145 million to 155 million. I am just thinking back to the \u2013 before the commodity price collapse of 2015, you had plans for the Knox plant 200 a day again for 365 to 470 million. So, from a cost per capacity standpoint, this is clearly better. My question is why not choose to expand Canadian Valley in the first place over Knox a few years ago? And then is there something that\u2019s changed perhaps in location of where Knox is going to go that makes it less necessary or is there potential to revive that plant. How should we think about all that?","Kevin Burdick","Hi, Eric. This is Kevin. Yes, three is a variety of things I think that are going on with that Delta. Sorry we had some weird feedback here. First I would say yes when we announced Knox it was a completely different business environment at that point. I mean it was the heyday of the growth and so that drove costs for materials and services were higher. The second thing is the rationale for the Knox location was at that point in time the SCOOP was really the hot play and that\u2019s where the majority of the activity was and Knox is geographically right in the heart of the SCOOP. And then \u2013 so as the drilling activity shifted a little bit to the north and the STACK became really a prolific play, we started taking a look and that\u2019s where our volumes were going to show up and therefore being able to leverage the facility \u2013 existing facilities at the Canadian Valley site became the appropriate place to put that next tranche of capacity we are bringing online.","That also had an indirect effect of the gas coming on in the STACK where we had a significant amount of infrastructure already in place, so that also drove down the field infrastructure necessary for the plant as well. So, a combination of all those factors we still have is the stack matures, we still have the ability we could put another train at that same facility. If the SCOOP continues to evolve that wouldn\u2019t preclude us from putting another plant down at the Knox site that we have referred to previously.","Eric Genco","Okay that\u2019s very helpful. And then just real quick on the NGL segment showed an 11% increase sequentially in operating costs versus 6% in volumes and you talked about your ability last quarter to run the Bakken NGL line above nameplate in this quarter EAA did. Did that cost you on the operating expense front or is there something else going on there and what is the status of the pipeline expansion there? As 3Q \u201818 is still a good target you come earlier would be good if it did 20 years Dawson capacity there and then possible expansions beyond the 160?","Terry Spencer","Yes. I will start from a cost standpoint, no, there was no relationship between the cost increase and in the capacity on the pipeline that was purely we had timing impact of some maintenance and expense projects that occurred in the second quarter. As we think about the Bakken capacity, we still have some headroom. We have said it will run nameplate. Clearly, we are having conversations with a variety of our customers both in the not just in the Bakken, but also the powder and that in the DJ about additional capacity. So, we were working through what that expansion might look like the timing of such.","Operator","Okay. We will now take our next question from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks and good morning everyone. In the G&P segment, NGL sales volumes average 186,000 barrels per day. I recall on the last quarter\u2019s call we talked about the delta year-over-year being driven by ethane recoveries. And since we are talking about ethane recoveries being essentially flat between the first and second quarters, I wanted to make sure that, that increase is just driven by propane plus?","Terry Spencer","Yes that volume was entirely driven by propane plus.","Danilo Juvane","Got it. And second question for me, I didn\u2019t see anything in the release, so I apologize if I missed it, but typically you disclosed your equity NGL data and customarily also report hedges that, that you often update. Did you firstly update the hedges and is there any equity NGL data available?","Terry Spencer","That will be part our two that we will file here today, so yes we didn\u2019t put it in the earnings release, but it will be in the 10-Q.","Danilo Juvane","Thank you. That\u2019s it for me.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Hi, good morning everyone. I am wondering can you give us an update on where things stand on the West Texas LPG line and the case there? Thanks.","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin. Yes, on West Texas, we are still in the process. From the rate case standpoint, the ALJ has the information and we are awaiting on that and we continue to expect we will have resolution on that by the end of the year and are confident in our case.","Michael Blum","Okay. And then little bit of a nitpicky question, but just wonder if you can provide a little background on, there is a footnote in these release related to contribution to the ONEOK foundation of 20,000 shares that had a value $20 million, which looks like was part of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. Can you just kind of talk about what\u2019s going on there?","Walt Hulse","Yes, sure. Michael, this is Walt. The ONEOK Foundation was a foundation that we created in 1997 to support the communities that we operate in. Over the course of the last several years, we haven\u2019t made any contributions to that given the business environment and with the closing of the transaction, we saw it as an opportune time to true up that foundation and made a contribution of $20 million in the form of a preferred stock.","Michael Blum","Okay. So, on a go forward historically I guess before the last 3 years, you would be systematically contributing and that would be running through the statements?","Walt Hulse","That\u2019s correct. And it was periodic. It was not necessarily annual event just from time-to-time.","Michael Blum","Okay, alright. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","Hi, everyone. I actually wanted to start on West Texas. One of your customers there announced plans to build their own NGL pipeline, which would imply that they are pulling volumes off your system once that comes online. Would you be able to give us an idea of how much you are expecting to come off and how we should think about the outlook for the pipeline and whether or not we should think that the expansion that you guys have previously talked about gets pushed out?","Sheridan Swords","Christine, this is Sheridan. Look, I can\u2019t take specifically how much any shipper on the pipeline moves, but what I can tell you is no shipper on our system moves more than 25% of the volume on that. So, everybody is below 25%. And if we would lose volume then we do know that pipeline coming in. We are highly confident that we will be able to re-contract that volume at definitely better rates than we are getting today, because we are getting the lower rates and also that would give us the opportunity to offer bundled services to also get practices in there. And actually we are working very diligently and close to have an expansion on the West Texas pipeline back by customers and we don\u2019t see this new pipeline having any impact at all on the timing of that expansion?","Christine Cho","Sheridan, you might clarify, when you said you can\u2019t provide that information you might clarify, why that\u2019s the case?","Sheridan Swords","The West Texas pipeline is a regulated pipeline and we can\u2019t \u2013 as an operator of that pipeline divulge shipper \u2013 specific shipper information. We can only give generalities about what it is. That\u2019s why I say nobody is greater than 25%. I can\u2019t tell you specifically what that one customer has.","Christine Cho","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then on the Canadian Valley expansion is that being driven by new acreage dedications or faster than expected ramp on production for from existing acreage dedications? Also, if you could talk about the ability to add more trains at this facility if there is need? And lastly how should we think about the need or potential for Arbuckle Sterling expansion beyond Sterling III with these additional volumes?","Kevin Burdick","Hey, Christine, it\u2019s Kevin. Yes, when we look at the STACK in general, obviously the production growth we have seen and you just back up away from our specific G&P presence and you look at what the producers are doing in the region, it\u2019s been pretty staggering with some of the results they have reported here over the last several months. So, most of the \u2013 the vast majority of the capacity needed is going to be to serve existing acreage dedications that we have and under long-term contracts. We have added a few small additional contracts here and there. But the primary expansion and the capacity is needed to serve those existing just more growth on those existing contracts. And yes we do as I mentioned earlier we have the ability to put at least one more train and potentially two at the Canadian Valley facility as the STACK continues to grow. And again when you are looking it over hundred rigs in the STACK and SCOOP combined, clearly as we are talking and in Sheridan\u2019s business and the NGL side talking to a variety of processors and producers an expansion of our \u2013 additional expansions needed to our book or are not out of the question.","Christine Cho","Okay, great. And then just going off the STACK\/SCOOP, several weeks prior to the announcement of the expansion on Canadian Valley you guys announced that you would be offloading 200 million cubic feet a day processing from that region to a third-party plants, could you explain why these volumes aren\u2019t being directed to the Canadian Valley plant, is it more of a timing thing, a geographical thing or anb economic decision?","Terry Spencer","Is was really all the above, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we just had an attractive opportunity presented and we work with our counterparty and the combination of timing and we were able to get this capacity in place sooner than we would have built. We would have been able to build an existing train and obviously economics factored in. We wouldn\u2019t have done it if it wasn\u2019t attractive to us and our customers.","Christine Cho","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers is next.","Craig Shere","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Good morning Craig.","Craig Shere","It looks like on Slide 4 of the deck that NGLs volume were up sequentially, pretty well and that was also highlighted in the prepared remarks, but on Slide 7 there is some commentary about consequential operating performance, down $9.9 million forward margin on seasonal product demand, is this more a product mix issue, is this something we should see annually does it have anything to do with the adjustments to volumes for the year unexpected third-party interconnects?","Kevin Burdick","No Craig, this is Kevin. No, it\u2019s nothing we \u2013 yes, it is seasonal. So from the standpoint of what we expect and in fact when we \u2013 if you look at last year as we were explaining our second quarter, we had similar seasonal impacts. This is volume shipped on our north system that are seasonal in nature and so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that aspect. The other \u2013 the cost side is what I referenced earlier it was just a timing. Typically as we come out of winner, we end up having a higher level of maintenance and expense project activity and that\u2019s what drove that increase sequential quarter-to-quarter from a cost perspective.","Craig Shere","But if the overall volumes on your system higher sequentially, it is a simply product mix can you explain that a little more?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. The volumes that we are talking about, the volume growth isn\u2019t necessarily on the distribution system. Some of the earnings is shown up in the exchange services side of the business. So the volume specifically in the margin on the transportation side is related to that seasonal North system.","Craig Shere","Okay. And then a follow-up on Shneur\u2019s question about unannounced growth projects, I think you all have already announced with two press releases about $300 million in aggregate growth CapEx, an opportunity set that was previously described that $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion as you think about our book goal and this expansion maybe over the Overland past JV needing some expanded capacity over time that additional GMP capacity requirements, do you see this $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion opportunities set reduced by about $300 million, do you see some additions on the ground expanding, contracting from that initial outlook?","Terry Spencer","Craig, now we don\u2019t see it reducing. We see it go in the other direction just given the fundamentals that we are seeing under our footprint today.","Craig Shere","And in terms of the timing for Terry, we didn\u2019t have huge dollar amounts relative to your historic spend announced, I mean we did have a couple of nice announcements, could you see more material announcements in the second half here?","Terry Spencer","We could see that, certainly in the second half we could see it in the early 2018.","Craig Shere","Great, I appreciate the help.","Terry Spencer","You bet.","Operator","Next is Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hey Terry, good morning.","Terry Spencer","Hi good morning Chris.","Chris Sighinolfi","Just want to \u2013 we are at the point in the call, a lot of the big new have been hit, so I wanted to hit on some of the maybe some of it set additional items, but on the optimization and marketing commentary and I know I have inquired with Sharon about this in the past, but it looks like if I were to follow sort of the Opus prices or the Bentek [ph] reported prices that regional spreads on prices and intra-product price perhaps present an opportunity for greater optimization in marketing year-on-year, do you highlighted in the release that there was actually a headwind, so I am just I know it\u2019s a complicated series of decisions around the optimization in marketing activities and so I didn\u2019t know if there was a simplistic way to plan maybe what happened in the market year-over-year net to what we are seeing on the quoted prices?","Sheridan Swords","Chris really this is Sheridan, year-on-year most of that or all of that delta that\u2019s down decrease was due to our marketing activity. And really it was due to timing on our inventory that we have sold out in fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter that we have seen prices drop in the second quarter that we will realize that back in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter when those sales come on. So it\u2019s all in marketing it was not in optimization.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And that\u2019s something just to clarify what you just said, is that something you saw last year in the fourth quarter are you saying, we would expect to see it in the back half of this year some of these gains in the back\u2026.?","Sheridan Swords","Actually last year we had the opposite effect, where we had inventory and prices rose last year and that\u2019s in the second quarter. So we kind of got a little bit of two different things going on with our inventory, but the cells are out there in the fourth \u2013 third and fourth quarter work what will realize higher third and fourth quarter on the marketing for the decrease in the second quarter.","Chris Sighinolfi","Got it, okay, perfect. And then I guess following-up on the change in the gathered volumes for NGL gathered volumes versus a static forecast on what you were expecting or what you are still expecting on the frac side, just looking at that if I think about $25 million of segment EBITDA decline on 25,000 barrels a day of full year movement on the guidance [Technical Difficulty] by somewhere around $0.065 a gallon, I know when you quote the regional areas some include frac, some don\u2019t and it would seem like that\u2019s more aligned with an area that includes fractionation services that\u2019s if an absent, so I am just wondering were you \u2013 was that gathering amount planned to be frac then you were just sort of previously at the high end of where you thought the frac items would be and backgrounds with metal or how do we interpret I guess the financial implications of the volume if you could help us with that would be helpful?","Sheridan Swords","Whether the volumes got spread out over the whole system, but I would say most of that we were planning on cracking.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay, perfect. I guess one follow-up question Michael Blum asked earlier with regard to the preferred equity placement that the contribution, is there an associated \u2013 it looks like there is an associated preferred distribution on that at least recorded small very small quarter, just wanted if you give us a sense what the run rate on that might be?","Derek Reiners","Sure it\u2019s a 5.5% preferred on the $20 million. So it\u2019s reasonably immaterial in the overall scheme of things.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. So just relatable well that comes out every quarter, it\u2019s not an audit \u2013 it\u2019s not twice a year, every quarter?","Derek Reiners","It\u2019s quarterly, yes.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And then I guess final question for me, we have seen a very nice up-tick, continued up-tick in the average be on your GMP activities, I am guessing based on your earlier commentary that that might I think talking about that maybe sliding back down a little bit given a composition of volumes, I am assuming since it continued to rise that the surprise, upside surprise on Williston Basin activity, I am just wondering how you think about that progressing now given what the activity has been, I think you have said $0.85 for the full year, I guess any help in how you are thinking about producer activity across the [indiscernible] has been moved into 2018 would be really helpful?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. Chris, this is Kevin. We clearly see growth in both our regions in the Williston and in the Mid-Continent of STACK and SCOOP primarily. As we move forward, so yes the fee rate will move around just literally quarter-to-quarter as that volume mix changes between a little bit higher fee rates in the Williston versus the Mid-Continent, so as the volume growth kind of shifts from one to the other that that fee rate will move around. We still feel good about $0.85-ish through the rest of this year or for the full year. How that moves around will just depend literally on the timing of individual well completions and how the volumes grow sequential quarter-to-quarter.","Chris Sighinolfi","So Kevin, it\u2019s fair to say that you should \u2013 we are probably not going to see any step function changes in that weighted average fee rate?","Kevin Burdick","No, part of the reason for the pretty significant step up from Q1 to Q2 was because we had the severe weather impact to the Williston volumes in Q1, so that as those volumes grew substantially relatively \u2013 comparatively that\u2019s what drove up the fee rate. But going forward no, we shouldn\u2019t see step change functions in that fee rate.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. So does the tone we are in right now is a pretty comfortable [indiscernible] found around sort of high to low pace on competition quarter-to-quarter, is that a fair understanding?","Kevin Burdick","Yes.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I really appreciate the time this morning.","Kevin Burdick","Thanks Chris.","Operator","We will go to Ethan Bellamy with Baird. Please go ahead.","Ethan Bellamy","Hi guys. Good morning. Hey, you have just \u2013 you guys have done a really great job in the past few years of a multi-year strategic shift in financial structure and with the [indiscernible] on you now have a really good cost of capital what\u2019s next, what\u2019s the next corporate strategy goal, is it more aggressive on M&A, I mean where do you go?","Terry Spencer","Well, Ethan as far as aggressiveness on them M&A nothing has really changed in terms of our view. From an M&A perspective we are always interested in strategic opportunities, certainly the challenge associated with those as actionability as you are well aware. But our strategy remains heavily organically focused and certainly where are we building off this big asset footprint that we have, the incremental returns or the incremental investments that we are making and the returns that we are seeing are very attractive. And we will stay focused on taking care of our customer needs, building off of this existing footprint. And then from time-to-time, acquisition opportunities if they present themselves and they fit with this with this NGL centric kind of strategy that we have certainly we will pursue those. But that\u2019s kind of help things\u2026","Ethan Bellamy","So the sea change in your cost of capital really haven\u2019t changed your strategy or the way you are thinking about growing things\u2026?","Kevin Burdick","It really hasn\u2019t, I mean we are certainly from a business perspective and as we think about our growth strategies, they are still spot on with where we have been in the past. I will tell you that we are all \u2013 we have always been in a prospecting mode in terms of M&A regardless of our structure. And we are still there, but they got to certainly make sense, got to make a lot of sense for us.","Ethan Bellamy","Okay. And then one really granular question, how much behind pipe gas in the block and is still low hanging fruit in terms of capturing things are being flared right now?","Terry Spencer","When you say behind pipe, are you talking about it from a geologic perspective?","Ethan Bellamy","Yes. I am?","Terry Spencer","Okay. So Three Forks, are you comfort Kevin\u2026.","Kevin Burdick","Well, I heard a couple of question. You just want to get at how much low hanging fruit from a flaring perspective?","Ethan Bellamy","Yes. Well, I am just thinking about maybe also something that\u2019s getting flared now, but you know that there is going to be some wells drilled. You don\u2019t have pipe in the area now that kind of I am just trying to get a sense for the opportunity there, because I know a lot of your volume catch-up has been intrinsic, going out and capturing that that for a gas?","Terry Spencer","Now, we have \u2013 in large part we have captured a good chunk of that low hanging fruit. I mean we still estimate we may have 60 million to 70 million cubic feet a day flaring behind our system. But again that\u2019s as our volumes have grown we have lowered, at the same time we have lowered that flared gas. So there is always going to be some level of flaring. We might estimate 30 million to 40 million a day that\u2019s just going to be ongoing. So there may be another 20 million that we are continuing to pursue that you would kind of call low hanging fruit. But for the most part our operations team has done a fantastic job and relative to the rest of the basin our flaring is well below the statewide averages.","Ethan Bellamy","And is the state left in your face about this now?","Terry Spencer","Well, yes from the standpoint of the industry in total is delivered and specifically yes. So yes, from the standpoint that industry stepped up and has met the flaring targets and is \u2013 and it takes it extremely seriously. And as we worked with our customers to drive the flaring down, yes it is it is limited and eased the pressure.","Ethan Bellamy","Good to hear. Thanks gentlemen.","Terry Spencer","Great. Thanks Ethan.","Operator","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Andrew Ziola for any additional or closing remarks.","Andrew Ziola","Okay.

John?","John Gibson","Thanks, Dan. Good morning and many thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me today are Rob Martinovich, our Chief Financial Officer who will review our quarterly financial performance and discuss our updated earnings guidance. Pierce Norton, our Chief Operating Officer who will review the operating performance of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and update you on the partnership\u2019s growth projects which I am pleased to say are on-time, on-budget and growing. And Terry Spencer, our President, who will update our NGL supply and demand outlook.","On this morning\u2019s call, we will review our second quarter results and discuss our rationale for our updates to 2012 earnings guidance, reaffirm our ability to continue to grow ONEOK\u2019s dividend and ONEOK Partners distribution over the next several years even in a lower commodity price environment, and update our progress with our growth projects, including our contracting status for the Bakken Crude Express pipeline and the $1 billion of additional projects we announced just last week.","Let\u2019s start with our second quarter performance. ONEOK Partners turned in an exceptionally strong performance, driven by strong volume growth in the Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing businesses. Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in slightly higher results performing as expected and our energy services segment reported a loss because of the continuing challenges it faces in a low natural gas price environment with low price volatility. ","Pierce will provide more detail on each segment\u2019s operating performance in just a few minutes.","We updated our 2012 earnings guidance ranges increasing the range for ONEOK Partners to reflect our expectation of a continued strength of the natural gas liquids business. We decreased slightly the ONEOK guidance range to reflect lower than expected earnings at energy services and to a lesser extent the Natural Gas Distribution segment, partially offset by the strong contribution from the ONEOK Partners segment.","As Rob will discuss in a few minutes, we remain confident in our ability to grow ONEOK\u2019s dividends and ONEOK Partners distributions over the next several years even with lower prices. The main driver of these increases will be the volume growth from ONEOK Partners capital investments. Since our last conference call, we have made a lot of progress contracting for our Bakken Crude Express pipeline, which Pierce will discuss in a few minutes. Demand for the capacity is strong and we may have opportunities to increase the pipeline\u2019s capacity.","Rob will now review ONEOK\u2019s financial highlights and then Pierce will review ONEOK\u2019s operating performance. Rob?","Robert Martinovich","Thanks John, and good morning everyone. ONEOK\u2019s second quarter net income was $61 million compared with $55.1 million for the same period last year, driven primarily by the solid performance of ONEOK Partners offset partially by continued challenges in the Energy Services segment. We completed a 2:1 split of the company\u2019s common stock on June 1, making our shares more accessible to a broader base of potential investors. Also in June, ONEOK executed $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement funded by cash-on-hand and short-term borrowings, part of a Board approved $750 million share repurchase program through 2013, of which $300 million remain. Based on the repurchase of shares, we expect the average amount of diluted shares outstanding for 2012 to be approximately 211 million.","ONEOK\u2019s year-to-date 2012 standalone cash flow report changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $82 million. In July, we declared a dividend of $0.33 per share on a split adjusted basis, an increase of 8% from the previous quarter. ","With the partnership\u2019s equity offering and private placement in March 2012, ONEOK as a general partner and significant limited partner owner is now expecting to receive $437 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners this year, a 31% increase over 2011. ","We also updated 2012 guidance for ONEOK. Net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $375 million compared with its previous range of $360 million to $410 million. The updated guidance reflects lower expected earnings in the Energy Services and Natural Gas Distribution segments, offset partially by higher expected earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment. Pierce will discuss the specific guidance updates in a moment.","Our updated standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by a range of $115 million to $145 million versus our previous guidance range of $155 million to $195 million. This change reflects our revised ONEOK earnings guidance. Today we are also affirming our expectation to increase the dividend by approximately 40% between 2012 and 2014 as incremental cash from the growth of ONEOK Partners flows to ONEOK. At our Investor Day in September, we will present our updated 3-year 2013 to 2015 projections that will include specific ranges for net income and dividend growth. We also expect to release 2013 financial guidance at that time.","ONEOK\u2019s liquidity position remains good. At the end of the second quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $571.9 million of commercial paper outstanding, $22.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, with $626.4 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility and our standalone total debt to capitalization ratio was 52%. ONEOK\u2019s cash flow and liquidity position continue to give us excellent financial flexibility. ONEOK remains committed to providing sustainable value to our shareholders and solidifying our position as an attractive investment, whether it is by increasing our dividend, repurchasing ONEOK stock, and\/or purchasing additional units of ONEOK Partners. We have used all of these options and don\u2019t view them as mutually exclusive, and are fortunate to have the financial capability to do one or more under favourable conditions.","Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK\u2019s operating performance.","Pierce Norton","Thanks Rob, and good morning. Starting with our Natural Gas Distribution segment, second quarter 2012 earnings was up slightly due to higher rates and surcharge recoveries driven by regulatory activity in Texas and Kansas. The distribution segment\u2019s operating income guidance for 2012 has been slightly decreased to $215 million, reflecting lower margins due to warmer than normal weather.","Now a brief regulatory update. Kansas Gas Service filed a requested with the Kansas Corporation Commission to increase its overall annual revenues by $32.7 million. The request includes a $50.7 million increase in base rates and an $18 million reduction in amounts currently recovered through surcharges. If approved, we expect to implement new rates in January 2013. ","In July 2012, Oklahoma Natural Gas received approval to increased base rates by $9.5 million annually. Our tariff was also modified, narrowing the range of allowed return on equity to between 10% and 11% compared with the previously approved range of 9.75% to 11.25%. So far in 2012, we have received approval for increasing totals of $10.1 million annually in various Texas jurisdictions under rate cases and capital recovery and cost of service mechanisms.","Now a brief overview of Energy Services. Second quarter 2012 earnings were reduced as a result of lower transportation margins impaired with 2011 and lower premium services\u2019 margins due to lower natural gas prices. As we have said on previous earnings calls, we are aligning, or right-sizing the transportation and storage capacity to serve our premium services customers, which means we are turning back or renegotiating transportation in storage leases. We now expect our year-end 2012 natural gas storage position to be approximately 72 Bcf compared with our previous estimate of 65 Bcf. ","We decreased guidance for the Energy Services segment to an operating loss of $60 million. This was primarily from the required $30 million non-cash reclassification of deferred losses to earnings on certain financial contracts related to our storage business, of which we have gains that will be recognized in earnings during 2012 and 2013 heating season, and the non-cash $10 million goodwill impairment charge. Both of these charges occurred in the first quarter 2012. This segment continues to be challenged by lower natural gas prices and volatility and narrow seasonal and location natural gas price differentials.","John that concludes my remarks for ONEOK.","John Gibson","Thanks Pierce. Now, Rob will review ONEOK Partners financial performance and then Pierce will come back and review the partnership\u2019s operating performance, as well as our growth projects.","Robert Martinovich","Thanks, John. In the second quarter, ONEOK Partners net income increased 21% compared with the second quarter of 2011, driven by higher natural gas liquids operating results. ONEOK Partners reported net income of $206.5 million, or $0.69 per unit compared with last year\u2019s second quarter net income of $171.1 million, or $0.67 per unit. There were 219.8 million units outstanding for the second quarter this year compared with 203.8 million units outstanding for the same period in 2011. The equity offering and private placement in March 2012 included the issuance of 16 million additional units. Quarterly distributable cash flow increased 16% compared with the second quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.29 times. At the same time, we are increasing distributions to our unit holders. We increased the distribution $0.025 per unit for the second quarter and subject to Board approval, expect to increase another $0.025 per unit per quarter for the remainder of 2012. ","The most common question we are asked relates to the potential impact of sustained low commodity prices, specifically NGL prices on our distribution growth rate. Based on a current forward-looking price tag developed by averaging Pyro and Wood MacKenzie prices for crude oil and natural gas and applying NGL price relationships to crude oil from CMAI, our average annual distribution growth rate would be at the low end of the 15% to 20% range for 2013 and 2014 with a coverage ratio of 1. Our long-term coverage ratio target remains at 1.05 to 1.15 times. However, if low commodity prices are sustained our coverage ratios could be slightly below that. We will provide more specific price assumption with you at our Investor Day in September.","We have increased the partnership\u2019s 2012 earnings guidance to a range of $860 million to $910 million compared with the previous range of $810 million to $870 million, reflecting higher earnings in the Natural Gas Liquids segment offset partially by lower expected earnings in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. We now estimate the partnership\u2019s 2012 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion, compared with its previous range of $925 million to $985 million. ","We will also present ONEOK Partners\u2019 updated three-year projections for 2013 to 2015 in September that will include specific ranges for EBITDA and distribution growth. We also expect to release 2013 financial guidance at that time.","We hedge the commodities received for our services to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. For the rest of 2012, 76% of our natural gas volumes are hedged, while 70% of our NGLs are hedged. Hedging information for 2013 is included in the news release.","At the end of the second quarter, the partnership had $92.9 million in cash, $24 million of commercial paper outstanding, a debt to capitalization ratio of 44%, and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times. We extended the maturity date of our $1.2 billion revolving credit agreement by one year to August 2017.","Now, Pierce will review the partnership\u2019s operating performance.","Pierce Norton","Thank you, Rob. As John said, the partnership had a strong second quarter. Operating income increased 13% driven primarily by higher margins in natural gas liquids segment from favourable NGL price differentials between Con-way and Mont Belvieu. Increased transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher NGL volumes gathered. ","Earnings also increased as a result of higher volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segments, specifically in the Williston Basin, from the startup of the new Garden Creek I plant that went into service in late December. The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment\u2019s second quarter financial results were relatively unchanged. Our natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin were offset by lower natural gas and NGL product prices on the unhedged equity portion of these commodities. The new Garden Creek I plant continues to operate near its capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. Operationally, the plant is exceeding our expectations and we continue on a record setting pace for new well connects in 2012. However, we have reduced the segment\u2019s operating income guidance for 2012 primarily reflecting our expectation of lower net realized and expected commodity prices. We have provided those specific price assumptions in our earnings release. We still expect process volumes to be up 24% over last year and gathered volumes to be up 12% compared with last year. Low NGL prices did result in periods of ethane rejection in the midcontinent but did not have a material impact of this segment\u2019s results. ","The natural gas pipeline segment\u2019s second quarter results were higher due primarily to increased natural gas storage and transportation margins. 2012 guidance for this segment remains unchanged. Equity earnings from Northern Border pipeline are relatively flat. Northern Border is substantially contracted through March 2013 and has been successful in capturing 3 year or longer extensions as current contracts expire. It is also has two-thirds contracted on its long-haul capacity through 2014.","Our natural gas liquids segment continued to benefit from favourable NGL price differentials and more transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher NGL volumes gathered. ","Our MB-1 fractionator was down for scheduled maintenance for 30 days in May and experienced some temporary mechanical issues preventing it from returning immediately to its 160,000 barrel per day capacity. As a result, our fractionation volumes were down 2% during the second quarter with the Mid-Continent fractionators making up some of the volumes that would have been fractionated in the Gulf Coast and increased volumes in the Mid-Continent. The partnership will realize margins from raw feed stored in the Gulf Coast as a result of the turnaround later in the year as we have forward sales in place. ","NGLs transported on our gathered lines were up 21%, averaging 523,000 barrels per day during the quarter. As a result of the increased NGL volumes gathered from the expansions Arbuckle pipeline and the Mid-Continent NGL gathering system in Texas and Western Oklahoma. ","We expect NGL gathering volumes to be up 22% over last year and fractionation volumes to be up 11% compared with the same period. We increased our operating income guidance for this segment to reflect higher than expected NGL optimization margins from increased NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities and higher isomerisation margins. For the last six months of 2012, we have assumed $0.28 per gallon Con-way to Mont Belvieu average ethane in the ethane propane mix price differential.","Now, an update on our projects. First, all of our previously announced internal growth projects are within the forecasted project cost and timeline ranges. Second, last week we announced more internal growth projects totalling approximately $1 billion that now bring our 2011 to 2015 internal growth program from $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion. Our contractual dedications in the Williston Basin have grown to 2.7 million acres which is supporting the building of a new 100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, the Garden Creek II plant and related infrastructure. Upon completion, our processing capability in the Williston Basin will be approximately 500 million cubic feet per day.","We will also be installing additional pump stations on the Bakken NGL pipeline to increase its capacity to 135,000 barrels per day from an initial 60,000 barrels per day to take away liquids generated by our plants. We will be expanding our Gulf Coast fractionation capacity by constructing a new 75,000 barrel per day natural gas liquids fractionators MB-3 and related infrastructure at Mont Belvieu, Texas, plus the installation of a 40,000 barrel per day ethane, propane splitter at our Mont Belvieu storage facility. These projects are backed by firm supply commitments and area dedications.","Third, an update of our plan to build the 1300 mile Bakken Crude Express Pipeline. Discussions with crude oil producers indicate they project crude oil production to increase to well over 1 million barrels per day within the next five years requiring additional crude oil takeaway capacity. At the moment, we are in advanced stages of negotiations with two large anchor shippers who represent a majority of the 200,000 barrel per day initial pipeline capacity. We are also negotiating with multiple other producers for additional capacity. We expect to have committed in the near-term well before construction all the pipeline\u2019s capacity that\u2019s available for commitments. Final negotiations with the anchor tenants, as well as the open season results could increase the current pipeline capacity beyond 200,000 barrels. For obvious competitive reasons we are not disclosing the proposed rates at this time. However, it will be advantageous to rail with producers able to lock in rates for longer term compared with a contract for typical rail capacity. ","We continue to develop and evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL related infrastructure projects, including investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation and storage facilities. Even with the recently announced projects totalling $1 billion, this backlog still totals more than $2 billion. ","As we have done in the past, we will announce the projects when we are sufficient producer and\/or customer commitments to make them economically viable.","John, that concludes my remarks.","John Gibson","Thank you, Pierce. Terry will now give you an update on our view of the current and the long-term NGL market dynamics.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Today I will provide a brief outlook of the NGL markets. Over the past several months there certainly has been some downward pressure on NGL prices, primarily as a result of the following: an overall softening in the crude oil markets, many of the petrochemical facilities were down for major scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, increased production growth in NGL rich sale areas and higher propane inventory levels due to a warmer than normal winter. ","With the major plant outages behind them the petchems have begun to consume the excess ethane inventory that has built-up and accordingly ethane inventories are expected to decline throughout the remainder of the year. The petchems expect to be operating at high utilization rates, well in excess of 90% with ethane as their primary feedstock. Ethane continues to be the preferred petrochemical feedstock versus oil-based feeds due to ethane\u2019s continued price advantage driven by the continued low ethane to crude oil price ratio which is now well below 20%.","With new record, ethane consumption of well over 1 million barrels per day, we expect US ethane inventories in terms of days of supply to be back to within normal ranges as early as year end. We expect the price of ethane, particularly at Mont Belvieu to continue to strengthen in the near and longer term as it has recently. ","In particular, US Gulf coast petchem demand for purity ethane feed continues to grow and supplies of the traditional ethane propane mix continued to grow as well. This in our view is creating across our system an imbalance of excess ethane propane mix and not enough purity ethane to serve the petchems\u2019 needs, accordingly the price relationship of ethane propane mix versus the premium price purity ethane has periodically widened to historical levels.","To meet the growing petrochemical demand for purity ethane, we have planned to construct a new facility in Mont Belvieu to slip purity ethane out of the traditional ethane propane mix. The new facility which is simply a specialized fractionator designed to fractionate an 80-20 ethane propane mix into purity will allow us to better serve our petrochemical customers, as well as compete more effectively for new markets and supplies.","A quick comment on propane. Due to the higher propane inventories, resulting primarily from the past mild winter and its reduced price relative to crude oil-based feeds, we have seen some petchems crack more propane compared with previous years. However with the petchems resuming normal operations following the major turnarounds, we are seeing some petrochemical facilities reduce their propane feed in favour of ethane. ","We do expect the propane surplus to decline as additional export capacity is developed over the next 12 months, with propane exports being maximized due to the continued pricing incentive for international propane buyers to purchase US Gulf Coast propane.","We also expect NGL fractionation capacity to remain in short supply but gradually increase as new fractionators including our own come online over the next few years. Fractionation capacity especially in the Gulf Coast is at a premium as growing unfractionated NGL supplies from the prolific shell developments, we continue to see the premium price to Gulf Coast NGL markets.","Accordingly, new pipeline capacity between Con-way and Mont Belvieu is being built to accommodate NGL growth from the shales. We continue to believe the NGL price differential between the market hubs will narrow to cost to build range of $0.08 to $0.10 per gallon over the next couple of years. ","In spite of the volatile and challenging commodity markets, we continue to focus on helping our supply and market connected customers get the products to where they need to be.","Our recently announced growth projects, the new MB-3 fractionator and EP splitter in Mont Belvieu and the expansion of the Bakken NGL pipeline are being built, so we can continue to provide reliable services to our customers through our integrated NGL asset base.","On the supply side, many rigs have moved away from dry gas regions and producers are focusing specifically on crude oil and liquids rich plays such as the Bakken, Cana-Woodford, Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Mississippian Lime and the Eagle Ford Shales. Fortunately, for us, our assets are well-positioned in all but one of these areas. While overall rig counts have decreased, rig counts in the Bakken and the Cana-Woodford especially in the core areas, where we operate are increasing.","As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we believe that over the next couple of years there will be some periodic oversupplies of ethane as new NGL production and infrastructure brings additional NGLs to market. ","As we approach and move through the 2015 through to 2017 timeframe, we do believe there will be sufficient demand for NGLs as new petrochemical expansions come on line and from growing Gulf Coast export activity.","John that concludes my remarks.","John Gibson","Thank you, Terry. Before we take your questions I would like to add to what Rob said about our confidence in our dividend and distribution growth projections. ","Prices, especially lower ones, will affect ONEOK Partners earnings through our Percent of Proceeds contracts, particularly in our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing business. This commodity price risk will always be present in the gathering and processing business, which is why we have historically pursued hedging opportunities. However, as we continue to grow ONEOK Partners, the volume growth in our natural gas liquids and crude oil pipeline business will generate additional income that is fee-based and contracted on a shipper pay or fracker pay basis, significantly reducing future earnings risk.","I would also at this time like to thank our more than 4800 employees whose dedication and commitment allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably, and environmentally responsibly every day and create exceptional value for our investors and customers. Our entire management team appreciates their efforts to make our company successful.","Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize David Roth, our Senior Vice President of Administrative Services who will retire September 30. In his role he is responsible for IT, HR and corporate services. During his 33 years he has made countless contributions and many positive changes to our employee benefits, enhanced our IT capability dramatically, and advanced our employee development efforts. Through his leadership he has made ONEOK a much better place to work. During my 12 years at ONEOK, David has been a trusted and faithful colleague, but more importantly to me, over those years, one of my closest friends. With Dan assuming David\u2019s responsibilities, I\u2019m confident the Company will stay the course, but we will miss David Roth. ","So, on behalf of all ONEOK employees, we thank David for his contributions and wish him the best in his retirement years.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","John Gibson","","All right, and we are on.","Operator","","We will go first to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley","You don\u2019t get off that easy. Good morning and thanks as always for all the details. My first question is on the NGL movements out of Kansas and Oklahoma, can you talk a little bit about, first, what is Arbuckle running at right now in terms of flows? And then Sterling III comes online late next year. How long do you think that will take to get up to the initial capacity that you talk about 193,000?","John Gibson ","","I will ask Pierce to provide you as much detail, as he is comfortable doing. But as you will recall in our many, many conversations where you asked very similar questions, we don't disclose a whole lot of information about that, but whatever you feel comfortable saying, Pierce.","Pierce Norton","","As far as Arbuckle goes, Steve, I guess the way I would say that it's near capacity.","Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay.","John Gibson ","","That\u2019s all you got say.","Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And then, how long does something typically with a new line like Sterling, like take, would you say to ramp to what a capacity that name plate that you are talking?","John Gibson ","","You know, one of the points of reference, I would give to you is that when we built Arbuckle, we anticipated that it would have a slow increase. I can't remember what we \u2013 Terry, do you remember what we anticipate maybe as much as a year to get --?","Terry Spencer","","Right, John. I think we were expecting \u2013 it would take roughly a year to get to about 160,000 barrels per day, and of course, we have moved through that pretty quickly. So, sort of, it depends upon the ability of the producer or the customer shipper to either complete the plans or have the supply available. Once the pipeline is built, it's just a matter of the supply being accessible.","Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then with our July announcements on the Garden Creek gas processing and the MB-3, can you discuss any agreements that you have surrounding those projects?","Pierce Norton","Steve, this is Pierce. The way I would answer that one is that if you remember in my script notes, we have 2.7 million acres under dedication there, and when you look at the projected volumes, it will more than fill up that plant. So, we actually have all of that contracted for under existing area dedications. ","And as far as MB-3 goes, there is a very high level, way more barrels available there than even the capacity. So, we believe that, that will fill up really quickly and be committed as well.","Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Final one on the Bakken Crude line, what are the permits or regulatory hurdles that are needed?","John Gibson ","It really is not \u2013 it's the same one it's pretty much that you go through in the NGL side. You will get core permits, if you cross any kind of state lands. You get the state land permits. You go through the standard negotiation process in the beginning, and then, you have an open season, and then basically you are ready to go and construct and build once you get the necessary regulatory permits. So, nothing out of the ordinary when you compare it to the NGL side.","Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks everybody.","John Gibson ","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","","We will go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital","Thanks, good morning everybody. Actually Pierce, just following up on that, and I am not sure if given this stage of negotiations it is possible to say, but you had made the reference of near-term, I believe. And so, is a binding open season something that you still expect to happen this year or was that something that could potentially be a 2013 event?","Pierce Norton","We still expect that to happen this year, Carl.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital","Okay. And then if I could and Rob, I know you are going to lay all this out at the Analyst Day, but just, you mentioned sort of the forward deck that you are using being an average of (inaudible) Wood Mack, etcetera. Do you actually happen to have those absolute numbers even if it's kind of a 30,000 high level oil and even composite NGL relationship just to dead reckon?","Robert Martinovich ","I mean, Carl, we do, and I guess one of the other reason that we want to cite that was that's been past practice, so you can get a feel as far as how those things are moving around, but really where those kind of end up from at least from a crude standpoint, you are kind of mid-90s, gas around 4, and then, on the composite barrels, kind of in that $0.80 to $0.90 range.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital","Okay. Fair enough. And then last question if I could. I just wanted to make sure I understood on energy marketing at OKE. This reclassification, was that basically something that was previously a low comp and is now sort of a mark-to-market loss, and maybe we will get some of that money back, whether it\u2019s the end of this year or 2013, or is that just more sort of an outright loss?","Robert Martinovich ","","Yes, Carl, when we talk about that first quarter, we said similar to an LCM that you may be familiar with on inventory, however, this related to losses on purchase head contracts. And as we indicated in the first quarter and as Pierce said, now, we expect to get some deferred gains back in this heating season. And so, we do expect to claw back a little bit of that this year and that\u2019s included in the guidance.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital","I see. Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Operator","","We will go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Just following up on the question on the new Garden Creek plant. So, you have got the acreage dedications, but the volumes have actually moved through, will those be percentage of proceeds type contracts?","John Gibson ","","Yes, they will.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then, talking about just sort of the Conway, Belvieu spread assumptions, when you talk about $0.08 to $0.10 long term, you are now in the high 20s for this year. I guess I am trying to bridge for 2013 kind of how you are thinking about \u201813. You are going to be ringing 60,000 barrels a day of Bakken NGLs into Conway. So, that will probably make that spread a little wider. I am just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about that.","Terry Spencer","","Ted, this is Terry. We provided you the $0.28 for ethane for the second half of 2012. As we look to 2013, if you recall, we have actually brought some capacity on between the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast, and then in particular our Sterling I 15,000 barrel a day expansion and our Arbuckle expansion of about 60,000 barrels per day here in 2012. ","So, we have bought some capacity on, and so, as a result, our view is that the spreads will tighten somewhat as we move into 2013. So, you are going to see spreads, in our view, somewhere in that $0.15 to $0.20 range for 2013. And then, you will move into the 2014 timeframe and get into that $0.08 to $0.10 realm, which is primarily the cost to build.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Sure. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks Terry. And then, last one is for me, just coming back to the Bakken Crude Pipeline. And you talked about the two anchor shippers. I guess if you got just those two contracts signed at where you are thinking, would you be hitting your sort of five to seven times EBITDA target, or do you need to get a few more people signed up to hit your target?","Terry Spencer","No. If we could get those two anchor shippers, then we will be within that range, but we do expect there to be even more interest than just those two anchor shippers.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. And that would cause you then to potentially upside of the pipe.","Terry Spencer","That\u2019s correct.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks guys.","John Gibson ","","Thanks Ted.","Operator","","We will go next to John Edwards with Credit Suisse.","John Edwards \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, good morning everybody.","John Gibson ","","Good morning, John.","John Edwards \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just curious, you are making some comments about your distribution growth outlook in relation to coverage. And so, I am just curious, would you be more inclined to slow that growth just a bit to keep your coverage within your 1.05 to 1.15 target, or would you be more inclined to maintain sort of the low end of the 15% to 20% range and take your coverage down a bit?","John Gibson ","","Well, there\u2019s no answer to give to you at this point in time. That's a board issue, but we have had that discussion with the board, and it\u2019s management's view that we probably would focus more on the coverage ratio than we would the accelerating the distribution. ","But again, it all depends on where the market is at that particular point in time. I think the more important thing is that we don't necessarily see ourselves in that position. Rob, is there anything you want to add to that?","Robert Martinovich","","Yes, I think just to imply John, much like when we had periods of time, John, where we knew we had unsustainable optimization levels and we had coverage ratios well exceeding that target rate. There are going to be periods of times we are down below. So, I think you have to look at there from a sustainability standpoint before you make the final decision.","","","John Edwards \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. And then, with regards to the ethane supply demand balance outlook, there were some comments made indicating there would be some periods of oversupply although 2015 to '17, the expectation was it would be in relative balance. And I was just wondering if you had any more thoughts regarding the 2013 to '15 timeframe with respect to what kind of or where you think the supply demand balance might be at that point in that timeframe?","John Gibson ","","John, really, I think probably the only thing I could add to the previous comments I made in my remarks is that the curve is going to be kind of lumpy. It is not going to be perfectly smooth and certainly, we will have these periods of time where we will have excess ethane. When many of the analysts analyze this ethane supply and demand balance, they would make the assumption that everyone of these fractionators that are coming on are going to be full day one, or at least get full at some point in time. ","That may not happen in every case. And as a result, it is going to make it kind of difficult to predict those supply and demand balances during that timeframe. And so, it really is going to look kind of lumpy, and we will have periods where the crackers will need everything we can give them, and they will consume everything we can give them, and other times, where they don't. So, we will have to weather that. It will be volatile. And we are well-positioned through that volatile timeframe and by the time, we make it to 2015, 2017, we will be in really good shape.","John Edwards \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","John Gibson ","","Thanks, John.","Operator","","We will go next to Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks. Couple of questions for me. One, on the E\/P splitter, will that produce international grade propane, and if so, would that potentially find an export market?","John Gibson ","","No, it will be primarily consumed domestically.","Michael Blum \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Then kind of a dumb question for me and I apologize, but why is MB-3, the cost to build this so much greater than MB-2?","John Gibson ","","I mean basically you have got some escalation of cost that occurs in the labor market and with the materials, so that's driving it more than anything, and frankly, when you start to build that many fractionators down in that area, you get a lot of demand for construction services, both construction management services and the materials and labor and this just drives the cost up.","Michael Blum \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. So, how does that impact the return you will get on MB-3 versus MB-2?","John Gibson ","","We still expect our returns to be solid and within those guidelines of multiples that we provided earlier.","Michael Blum \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","","We will go next to Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets.","Elvira Scotto \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi good morning. Just a point of clarification for me. For the increase in the guidance in the NGL segment where the press release states that part of that increase is due to higher optimization margin resulting from additional transportation capacity for optimization. Is that or can you elaborate a little bit more on that and how that trends the rest of the year? Is that just because you had some pipeline come on a little sooner and you are just waiting for some laterals to connect before third parties contract or has there been a change in how you are thinking about contracting?","Pierce Norton","","Elvira, this is \u2013 it's really all of the construction and the expansions that we have done so far, and then it's a matter of how volumes match up with new plants that are coming online. If for some reason they are a little bit slower, then that provides us the ability to take those that spare capacity and use it for optimization volume. So it's really, it's opportunistic, but there's really no change in the way that we are contracting. We are still moving toward more of the fee-based, and as Terry has indicated more of the cost to build in the outer years 2014.","Elvira Scotto \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then, just a follow-up on a previous question. On the Bakken NGL pipeline, the expansion; do you expect that to be full on day one?","Pierce Norton","","Actually, the way that you add the capacity to that pipe, which is through pumps, the way the engineering works is that the capacity actually elevates up to 135,000 per day. We do expect it to be substantially full, but we also run into a limitation when we get to Overland Pass pipeline. So, we won't be able to immediately go to the 135,000 without doing some things on the Overland Pass pipeline, but it will be substantially full early.","John Gibson ","","I am sorry, but was Elvira asking about the NGL pipeline or the crude oil pipeline?","Elvira Scotto \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","The NGL pipeline.","John Gibson ","","Sorry.","Elvira Scotto \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then, if you wanted to expand that pipeline further, could you or I guess as you said you would have to make some modifications to Overland Pass?","John Gibson ","","Right, that's probably going to be more of the driving factor than the NGL Bakken line. I mean, you can always expand them by looping lines and adding pumps. So, the simple answer is yes, you can expand it, but there's other things you have to expand as well.","Elvira Scotto \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And then, just my final question. So, if you have these additional NGLs coming into Conway, I am just trying to understand looking out into 2014, why we are thinking the Conway to Belvieu spread is going to be at $0.08 to $0.10 as opposed to higher, if you have more NGLs?","John Gibson ","Certainly, Elvira. I could see where you might think that. I think the reality though is that there's quite a bit of capacity that's going to be built not just by ONEOK, but by others. DCP has their project and Enterprise has their Texas Express projects. So, those will be coming online in 2013 and then 2014. So, those are going pressure the spreads. ","We are pretty confident they will come in because when you just do the math and you look at the increment capacity that's going to be added, you just add it up, it's significant. So, our view was that the floor, so to speak, on that margin will \u2013 on that margin between Conway and Belvieu will naturally gravitate towards this cost to build. So, it may be conservative, but we feel pretty confident that's where it's going to wind up.","Elvira Scotto \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Great. Thanks, that\u2019s all I have.","Operator","","We will go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Hi guys, thanks for the call and also for the mid-June Mid-Continent field trip. I thought those were very helpful.","John Gibson ","","Good. I am glad you enjoyed it Craig. It\u2019s a little hot, wasn\u2019t it?","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Yes. Especially in those overalls.","John Gibson ","","Yes, I am sure that\u2019s true. We got to keep safe.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","That must be why you only sent us home with the hard hats?","John Gibson ","","Those dang things are expensive. Hard hats little peak.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","So a couple of follow-ups here. Terry, do you have a firm idea of just how much exactly petrochem capacity has increased to handle lighter feedstock coming out of the most recent maintenance cycle? And do you have a better feel for whether the proportional amount of fuel switching capacity between propane and ethane has increased or decreased coming out of that cycle?","Terry Spencer","","What I can tell you is, is that the increased demand coming out of the petrochemical space is about 80,000 to 100,000 barrels a day just based upon the information we have been able to pick up, not just from the exports, but from those within the industry themselves. ","As it relates to propane, we have seen a significant amount of switching. Our marketing people are talking to the petchems everyday and we are seeing some switching as much as 100,000 barrels a day away from propane back to ethane. So, pretty significant and we expect that to continue throughout the year, and in particular, as propane prices strengthen with the pressure from the increased demand on the export side.","But you want to attribute that to a decreased flexibility in the system depending on how they tweak things when they are in the maintenance down cycle?","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","","Okay. But you want to attribute that to a decreased flexibility in the system depending on how they tweak things when they are in the maintenance down cycle? ","Terry Spencer","No.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","","Okay. And there has been some questions about distribution coverage given the prepared comments. One thing I would note and the comment was made well, we are going to \u2013 it\u2019s seasonal, right. Sometimes, we are going to be significantly over the target range for coverage and sometimes a little under, and it will be because of market events that were not. ","They are transitory that we are not reacting to, but it was nice before when you had a whole slew of growth CapEx projects that were highly accretive and you happen to have a lot of extra cash flow. Now, that you are thinking about maybe a one-times coverage, and you just announced a week ago another $1 billion of CapEx, could you kind of speak to thoughts about how that might be financed?","Terry Spencer","I'm not suggesting that your question is insinuating. We have changed our practice, because we haven't. I think what we were trying to do in our comments was to say that with sustained low pricing and keeping our distribution growth, we could see a one-times coverage. ","We are not saying that we are shifting from 1.05 to 1.15 and we are now going to set it at 1. So, I just want to be clear that, that was not the intention of our comments. Our comments were there is a lot of concern in low price environment, as to whether or not people are going to maintain their coverage ratio and grow their distribution. ","We believe in worst case that we may face if prices continue to remain low that we might be near that one. We might fall below that 1.05, but we are not rebasing the company to a one-times coverage ratio. ","So, I just want to be clear that we have not changed and we remain focused, and then there was a question earlier about which (inaudible) and our management team believes that what you would do is probably slow down your distribution growth in periods of extremely low price environment and maintain your coverage ratio. And then, of course, is your follow-on question about equity offering or additional financing. Even if we had those dates, we wouldn\u2019t share them with you. ","So, I think you look at the balance sheet, although there is a lot of great things to be said about it clearly, at OKS, we need to raise some additional capital, some debt and we have got a great general partner and a company that likes to invest in ONEOK Partners. So, we see the capital markets being receptive to any demands we might put out there.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Understood. Last question, and it may just be coincidence, I know you have had a lot of nice transitions with the management team, various people taking on new responsibilities lately, and some people taking a well-deserved rest. Does the changing of the guard at energy services, amid the very tough operational environment indicate any kind of reconsideration of the business plan over time there?","Terry Spencer","Not one bit.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","","We will go next to Helen Ryoo with Barclays.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays","","Good morning. First question on the optimization capacity. It seems like you will be using much less optimization capacity in second half versus first half, and just wondering if that capacity has already been contracted out to third-party, and if so, what is the term of the contract?","John Gibson ","","Helen, you are correct in the amount of optimization capacity available to us is going to go directionally downward toward the end of the year. That is a contractual basis, but as I mentioned before, part of that is dependent on whether or not they actually \u2013 what volume is under those contracts actually shows up. So, we have assumed that most of that volume will show up. It may or may not, and if it doesn't, then we will have a little more for capacity. We actually don't disclose what that amount is.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays","","Okay. Yes. I understand you don't disclose the amount, but just wondering the length of these contracts that you are signing with third-party, is it more of 5-year or 10-year, what?","John Gibson ","","They are long-term contracts.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays","","Okay. And then, is it your expectation to bring down your optimization capacity down even more in 2013 versus the second half of the year, or are you, will you be comfortable with maintaining the sort of the second half optimization capacity level going forward?","John Gibson ","I think if I said that and then the volumes, whatever those volumes materialize, kind of sending a message as to what that is. So, we are going to have, we will always have a certain amount of volume available for optimization, I guess is the best way I can answer that.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays","","Okay. And then just out of curiosity on your E\/P splitter project, I know it's a small project, but would that be a spread business for you or is that a fee-based business?","John Gibson ","It actually is a little bit of both. We have enough E\/P mix to put in that splitter and capture that upside purity ethane to the E\/P price. It also factors into competitive advantage point of view that we have of being able to offer our customers a purity ethane price, which rolls into long-term fee-based contracts out of the Mid-Continent.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays","","Okay. And then just lastly I think regarding the MB-3 project, I think the MB-2 fractionator was expandable from, like 75 to 125, if I am not mistaken. Just wondering your decision to build MB-3 instead of expanding the existing MB-2, what are sort of the factors that affected that?","Terry Spencer","","Helen, this is Terry. I do recall that's what we indicated. I think it's quite simply in terms of we will have built the 75,000 barrel a day fractionator, then we will have done that. It will be easier and more efficient, and we will get more bang for our buck building a twin basically to MB-2. So, it's simply that.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays","","Okay. And even if you expanded the MB-2 rather than MB-3, I mean sort of the cost side, it would not really have changed too much on the cost side?","Terry Spencer","","I didn\u2019t follow that.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays","So, just I mean there was an earlier discussion about MB-3 costs getting a bit much higher than MB-2 because of all those inflationary factors you mentioned, but just wondering if you expanded the existing frac rather than build a new one, would those factors still have contributed to higher cost?","Terry Spencer","","Helen, there is one other piece I think that I need to mention here is that there are also infrastructure costs that are in the MB-3 costs. So, there is some line loopings, some pumps and some other stuff out in the field that's actually also going to be attributing to that, not only the escalation in costs. So, I think that's probably one of the big points I want to make.","Helen Ryoo \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","","We will go next to Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.","Ross Payne \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you. My questions have been answered, thank you.","John Gibson ","","Thank you, Ross.","Operator","","We will go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital","","Thanks, my question, my follow-up was hit, too.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Ziola","Thank you, Avenee, and good morning everyone and welcome to ONEOK's fourth quarter 2017 and year-end earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me today's call are Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs, Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. And the Senior Vice President of our business segments, also are available for questions. On this call, we will focus on fourth quarter and year end 2017 financial results. And provide some additional cover on our strategic and accretive growth projects including our recently announced Arbuckle II Pipeline, MB-4 Fractionator and Demicks Lake projects.","We've previously provided 2018 guidance in January. 2017 was an important year for ONEOK. We completed the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction in June. And the benefits of that transaction are paying off to ONEOK and its shareholders, particularly as we invest more than $4 billion in strategic expansions over our existing integrated network of pipelines, plants, fractionation and storage facilities with more favorable access to the financial markets as a result of the merger and our continued focus on generating attractive returns. That was proven by extremely successful traditional equity offerings in early January that pre-funded that projects that we have recently announced.","From an operations perspective in 2017, I again want to thank our employees who personally endured Hurricane Harvey and countless others who worked tirelessly to keep our assets running safely in order to provide reliable services to our customers not only during the hurricane but every day. The dedication and commitment of all our employees to this company is remarkable and I very much appreciate their hard work in making our company successful.","Moving onto our 2017 performance, for the fourth quarter and for the full year of producer activity in production results drove the volume growth in all our business segments throughout our operating footprints which led to an adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow growth. The recent completion of two world scale petrochemical crackers will continue to increase demand for ethane in the Gulf Coast, as these facilities complete their startup activities.","In addition four more crackers with a total capacity of nearly 200,000 barrels per day of ethane are expected to be completed later this year. As outlined in our 2018 guidance, this additional demand for ethane is expected to drive approximately $100 million of additional EBITDA in our NGL segment compared with 2017. After staying for a few years now that new petrochemical facilities and ethane crackers are being built, it is now evident in the marketplace that the incremental demand for ethane is here. Our focus remains on executing our cracker growth projects to meet the need of our customers at Williston, Powder River, DJ STACKS SCOOPS and Permian basins.","Over the last decade, ONEOK experienced operations, constructions and commercial teams successfully executed $9 billion in capital investments, aggregating supply and delivering into the market safely, reliably in an environmentally responsible manner.","With that I will now turn the call over to Walt.","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's 2017 operating income totaled nearly $1.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $2 billion. 30% increases compared with 2016 and more than 25% increase compared with 2015. All driven primarily by strong volume growth and we expect to see that growth continuing with adjusted EBITDA increasing more than 15% for 2018 compared with 2017. Distributable cash flow was nearly $1.4 billion in 2017 and dividend coverage of more than 1.3x, was well above our guidance of 1.2x or greater for the year.","This month we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share or $3.08 per share on an annualized basis. The 25% increase compared with the same period in 2017. Management still expects to recommend dividend increases of 9% to 11% annually and maintain our target for annual dividend coverage of 1.2x or greater. As noted in our earnings release, fourth quarter net income included $141 million of one-time non-cash charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which impacted fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.36 and full year earnings per share by $0.47. We view the overall impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as positive to ONEOK due to the lower corporate tax rate and the immediate expansion of most of our capital spending.","As Terry mentioned, we have announced more than $4 billion of new capital growth projects since June. These interactive investments are expected to generate adjusted EBITDA on multiples of 4x to 6x and are backed by a combination of long-term fee-based contracts, volume commitments or acreage dedications. Based on these recent projects announcements ONEOK's 2018 capital growth expenditures are now expected to range from nearly $2 billion to $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $700 million compared with our initial 2018 guidance.","Maintenance capital guidance remains unchanged to $140 million to $180 million. We have talked quite a bit about the funding of this highly accretive growth projects and how we essentially pre-funded our equity needs. In the fourth quarter, we received net proceeds of $384 million through ATM equity program and completed a $1.2 billion public common stock offering in January, resulting in total combined net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion. With the expected significant cash generated from operations and excessive dividends, and ample borrowing capacity, we don't expect to issue any equity in 2018 or well into 2019. Following the equity offering in January ONEOK's pro forma debt to EBITDA on last 12 months basis improved to just under 4x and put us at our target a year earlier than we expected.","We expect our leverage to increase modestly during the later stages of construction but we continue to view four times or less, as an important target for ONEOK in long term. Our anticipated EBITDA growth in 2018 will enable us to fund our growth with excess cash flow from operations and short and long term debt, while maintaining strong credit metrics. As it relates to review of rates on West Texas LPG, the regulatory process continues and it will resolve itself in due course. Our 2018 NGL segment financial guidance encompasses a range of potential outcomes for the rig division.","The midpoint of NGL segment adjusted EBITDA guidance does not assume any uplift from potential rate increase. As we said previously, the outcomes of which will not impact our current or future negotiated rates of West Texas LPG nor will it hinder our ability to secure new NGL supply from producers and processors including the project which extends West Texas LPG into the core of Delaware basin. As we continue to actively negotiate with producers in the Permian for additional capacity.","Now I will turn the call over to Kevin for closer look at each of our business segments and to provide to some additional color on our growth projections.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt. Starting with the performance of our Natural Gas Liquid segment. 2017 was another year of strong volume growth setting us up well for even greater growth in 2018. Fourth quarter 2017 NGL volumes gathered averaged 867,000 barrels per day, a 7% increase compared with the third quarter 2017. And a 17% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher overall raw feed volumes on our Mid-Continent and West Texas LPG pipeline drove the sequential quarter increases with Mid-Continent volumes increasing more than 9% during that timeframe. Mid-Continent growth continues to be driven by strong producer results in STACK and SCOOP areas.","Our Bakken NGL pipeline is operating at full capacity as volumes averaged 136,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2017. Our recently announced Elk Creek pipeline project will alleviate NGL capacity constraints out of the Rocky Mountain region once complete. And we expect to use our rail transport capabilities as early as second quarter 2018 to provide the necessary takeaway for expected volume growth until Elk Creek is in service. NGL volumes fractionated in fourth quarter 2017 increased 13% compared with the third quarter 2017 driven by higher gathered volumes across our NGL systems, and lower volumes fractionated in the third quarter due to impacts from Hurricane Harvey.","Volume that could not be fractionated during the third quarter because of the hurricane were stored and fractionated in the fourth quarter. Our NGL volumes were in line with our guidance range even with petrochemical cracker completion delay and the impacts from Hurricane Harvey. Moving onto the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We exceeded our 2017 financial guidance expectations due to the strong producer results in Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas. The segment's fourth quarter 2017 average natural gas gathered and processed volumes increased 20% compared with the same period in 2016. Fourth quarter volumes processed increased 5% compared with the third quarter 2017 averaging nearly 1.7 billion cubic feet per day across our system.","Williston Basin volumes processed again established new highs with an average of more than 870 million cubic feet per day during the fourth quarter. Mid-Continent processed volumes average more than 790 million cubic feet per day, a 6% increase compared with the third quarter 2017. We exceeded our well connection expectations for 2017 in both the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent, connecting 430 and 113 wells respectively. And we expect to connect approximately 650 wells total in 2018, a nearly 20% increase from last year.","In the Williston Basin, continued producer activity, improving well performance and higher gas to oil ratios are driving volumes growth. Analysis of recent well results shows 25 to 30 rigs to date can produce as much natural gas volumes as 70 to 80 rigs three years ago. With now only 100 million cubic feet per day of available processing capacity on our systems, our recently announced Demicks Lake processing plant will provide producers in the region with much needed processing capacity to accommodate growth expectations. Volumes growth in the Mid-Continent in the fourth quarter 2017 was driven by strong producer results in the STACK and SCOOP areas which led to a 6% increase in natural gas volumes processed compared with the third quarter 2017.","Our third party offload is operational which provides us access to an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity for our growing volumes in the STACK, and we are on track to add an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity in the fourth quarter of this year with the expansion of our Canadian Valley plant. Once complete, we will have an approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in Oklahoma. In the natural gas pipeline segment, 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 9% compared with 2016. The segment continues to benefit from higher fee-based earnings and increased transportation capacity contracted. The segment continues discussions with producers in Permian basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas to accommodate additional natural gas takeaway capacity given the strong growth expectations in those splits.","Recent tax reform laws have spurred conversation around potential impacts for regulated pipelines. For ONEOK, since most of our natural gas pipeline contracts have been established through shipper specific negotiated rates and settlements, we don't anticipate adjustments to rates solely because of lower tax rates. Related to rate settlements on February 23, Northern Border Pipeline received a letter order from the FERC approving their uncontested rate case settlement without modifications. Now let's take a closer look at our recently announced capital growth projects and how these latest projects complement and enhance our previously announced investments.","This year we have announced two strategic NGL pipeline projects, Elk Creek and Arbuckle II. The 530 mile Arbuckle II pipeline will have an initial capacity of 400,000 barrels per day and has the capability to be expanded up to one million barrels per day with additional pump facilities which could more than double our current capacity between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast with minimal capital investment. We are also adding 125,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu with the announcement of our MB-4 fractionator. The Arbuckle II pipeline is already more than 50% contracted and will provide producers in all the basins where we operate with connectivity to growing demand in Mont Belvieu. The adjusted EBITDA are multiple forecasted for these projects are based only from these contracts and discussions with customers regarding additional supply continue to take place.","The MB-4 fractionator is already fully contracted and both projects are expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. Our Demicks Lake Plant will add an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in Williston Basin bringing ONEOK's total capacity in the region to more than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter 2019. Additionally, we are in the permitting process for an expansion of our Bear Creek processing facility that we expect could add 40 to 60 million cubic feet per day of capacity with minimal capital. NGLs from the Demicks Lake Plant will ultimately feed our Elk Creek pipeline which in turn will connect with ONEOK's extensive Mid-Continent NGL gathering system which provides connectivity from the Williston Basin to the Gulf Coast.","A quick update on our Elk Creek pipeline announced in early January. We continue to have discussions with producers and processors to secure additional supply out of the Rocky's region. And our outlook now exceeds our original volume expectations by 10% to 20%. We continue to proactively communicate with landowners, state and local agencies and other stakeholders along the pipeline route and expect to be given construction later this year. All of these strategic attractive return projects will work together to provide much needed solutions for producers and position ONEOK with considerable long-term operating leverage across our integrated network of assets. Terry that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thanks Kevin. Before we take questions, I have got a couple of items to point out. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks ONEOK's will like to focus on executing on our $4 billion announced growth projects over the next several year. So which will take us to 2020? As we look beyond 2020, I'll go ahead and answer questions, some of you maybe wanting to ask and that is what's next. As Kevin detailed, many of our projects are being designed with the ability to expand immediately with minimal capital investments. And we'll continue to develop opportunities and in our under our asset footprint to expand even further. Whether that is to pipelines, processing plants, fractionators or storage. All of which we proven, we don't have to manage, build operate and optimize. So with that operator we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS Financial. Please go ahead.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to start off with the new projects announcements, I guess two-part question, you know, first of all you'd mentioned, I believe in your prepared remarks you have contracts backing, the new pipeline builds. I was just wondering if you can clarify or the minimum buying commitments or the acreage dedications is there a way that we can sort of split that up. And then sort of a second part of that. And I think you kind of just answered it. Does this take care of all the large ticket project announcements that were kind of highlighted in the filings when you did the OKE-OKS merger?","Kevin Burdick","Sure. I'll start, this is Kevin. As it relates to Arbuckle II, and those volumes in the contracted capacity, there's not a lot of NVC's associated with that, they are in the form of plant dedications and acreage dedications. And so forth, on the big ticket items, yes, I think this handles the majority of - we sets up significant operating leverage or headroom like Terry mentioned in his remarks going forward. So we feel pretty good about the assets we have in place to be able to grow into the future.","Terry Spencer","Shneur, I'll let Walt handle the questions at the filing on merger.","Walt Hulse","Shneur at the time of the S4, we did not have any of these projects contemplated as we went through the course of 2017, we started to talk about our backlog. And with the announcement of these projects recently we've announced all of the projects that we have in that backlog. We started to look for future opportunities.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay great. And then just a follow-up, ethane recovery versus rejection has been a topic for some time. There's kind of an interesting developing market dynamic where you look at natural gas capacity being scarce in the Permian. And at times you've seen some sizeable differentials with Waha and, and Henry Hub, it could create a scenario where the economics of recovering ethane becomes greater in the Permian than any other basin in the country. And there's the possibility that Permian ethane recovery crowds out other basins. How is ONEOK positioned if this materializes? Is it offset by the full scale system that you have in place? Or is there some risk to the $100 million plus of ethane recovery that you're looking for this year.","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin, and I'll let chaired in and chime in as well, I mean as you look at Waha and what's going on with the basis market, so the interesting thing is mid-continent basis has been extremely wide too. And you are right there with Waha. So that's one dynamic when you think about our significant position in the Mid-Continent. The other thing that's going on is based on our analysis we don't think that there's, you're not going be able to recover enough ethane solely out of the Permian to satisfy the additional demand that's going be coming online in the Gulf Coast. So even if, even if Waha did have a wider basis you're still going need ethane coming out of the mid-continent.","Terry Spencer","Shneur that's right, that's exactly right.","Operator","And we'll move next to Eric Genco with Citi Bank. Please go ahead.","Eric Genco","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the last question to make sure I understand it. You've got the $4.2 billion of projects. And you know, I think the understanding was that some of the, I mean the S4 forecast is based on sort of ongoing CapEx in that range. So maybe you could say frac processing some of that was, was ongoing but the two major pipelines Elk Creek and Arbuckle II are strategic and were not included, correct?","Walt Hulse","Yes, Eric, this is Walt. I think it's actually to fair to say that at the time of the S4 what was basically in there with our routine growth which did, which included well connects, plants connects and the NGL side, just our base group without the processing or fractionation. As we talked about our developing projects on the course of 2017, those included both the fractionation and processing plant.","Eric Genco","Okay so looking out now at the - if I look out of the consensus for 2021 that is actually below what was in there. And I know you don't want to spend too much time making the S4 sort of a serial guidance but if 2021 consensus is below the S4. And just the $2.8 billion CapEx for the projects 6x at $460 million of EBITDA. And then I guess oil, I mean oil right now we see about the forecast for what it would have been. Is there anything that you can think of that would be in anyway worse than S4 forecast.","Walt Hulse","It's fair to say that the S4 was a snapshot at a point in time that's kind of reflected our view in November of 2016. And obviously commodity prices are better, producer activities better, across the board we see fundamental for the business in a better spot today than we did when we filed that S4.","Eric Genco","Okay and then maybe another quick one, did you say how long at this point in time under the new tax code, you expect to avoid cash taxes of the OKE level? Was there a bit on that?","Walt Hulse","We did not say but our view hasn't changed from what we previously said.","Eric Genco","Okay. And then maybe last one for me, just want to try to understand. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, what happens between now and Elk Creek in terms of the NGL takeaway, if we think if US be the only game in town from a pipeline perspective. I know you mentioned rail, how should we see that sort of playing out in between now and when Elk Creek comes on in terms of the bundled rates, there are different ways that we should be modeling that. And how that growth will like flow through the bottom line.","Sheridan Swords","Eric this is Sheridan. As we put the barrels on the rail, we probably won't have a whole lot of margin left in those barrels basically all we're trying to do with the rail is provide our customers a way out of that volume. So there will be minimal uptick and margin on that as we get there but once we bring Elk Creek on, we'll turn all that into more for the pipeline.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kristina Kazarian with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kristina Kazarian","Good afternoon, guys. You guys have announced a lot of projects this year end. I mean it's only February, still can you talk a little bit about the longer term magnitude and cadence, and I know Terry you kind of alluded to some of these comments in your - alluded in your opening comments but magnitude in cadence of new project that maybe you'd love to do but haven't announced yet, so not what they are but just how we think about the year, next year kind of evolving around that topic?","Terry Spencer","Well certainly we, we had to just stop because we announced all this - we brought to reality the backlog of projects that we've been talking about for about the last year. We haven't stopped developing new opportunity; we'll continue to work hard around our existing footprint. And certainly as we've always done, if those, if those projects, beyond it's 2019-2020 timeframe, if those projects continue to get more visibility, then we, we advise, we let you know, as we get more clarity, as we get close, and certainly our past record as we start contracting for those projects or unannounced projects. We come out publicly with them. And so we're going to continue to do that. And certainly we still are finding opportunity and some of it, it isn't just gathering, processing and shipping NGL's and other, some of our other projects we've talked about export opportunities, so we continue to work that front very hard, so we got a number of other opportunities in the Q but certainly not ready to announce anything yet.","Kristina Kazarian","Got it, so just framing up from my standpoint is there like potential some more announced this year or should I be thinking more potentially given into next year and forward?","Terry Spencer","There's always a potential for more projects but I'll tell you the projects that we've just announced certainly position us with plenty of capacity for running growth so there's not a whole lot of need for more infrastructure, but there could be, we continue to see the positive movement bonds that we're seeing. There could be a potential for some things later on in the year perhaps not of the magnitude that we just announced but you certainly always have that that opportunity or that potential rather.","Kristina Kazarian","Last one for me following up on that kind of you've got pretty significant amount of NGOs headed down towards your downstream assets. How are you guys thinking about the mark end markets for purity products coming out the other side of your fraction maybe alluding to your export comment there as well?","Sheridan Swords","Kristina, this is Sheridan here. Obviously, we think is more and more propane and butane come online they will have to be exported and in the short term, we think there's plenty of export dock capacity down there in the Gulf Coast to be able to handle this as it comes on but we definitely see two or three years out that there will probably need to be more LPG exports out of the Gulf Coast. We also talked about on the ethane side that the three big crackers that everybody's been waiting for have now are up and running or reached mechanical completion, and we're into the second portion of that later this year. So we'll see a lot more demand on the ethane side coming at this period of time. We still see a lot of opportunity for additional ethane exports out of the Gulf Coast as you start looking at more than that three to five times. That's really how we kind of think about what the purity markets going to look like or our NGL down Mont Belvieu.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Zarahn with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Brian Zarahn","Good morning, with your expectation of four to six time multiples on your new projects you know can you elaborate a bit on the timeframe. Is that a year one expectation or is that following a ramp up period?","Kevin Burdick","Brian, this is Kevin. Yes, that's not going to be a year one thing because obviously these assets come on they're going to ramp up with volume but we would expect to get there it kind of our current volume outlook. I'd say in two to three years as we move through that. Obviously, if we continue to have success contracting and bring more volume on that could accelerate.","Brian Zarahn","And then on Elk Creek, obviously it's a Bakken driven project but can you elaborate a little bit on the comments earlier on the opportunity in the DJ and Powder River?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. We're seeing strong, we continue to see - it's not just our equity GMP business in the Bakken that's seeing growth up there. So we're having success there in the Williston with third parties. You come down to the Powder River, there's been some announcements here recently as far as additional rigs and some acreage has changed hands and now it's getting drilled out a little more. So there's been more activity going on in the kind of the Niobrara \/ powder area and then you get down to the DJ, we're seeing growth there as well. And so with the combination of our assets with Bakken and Elk Creek we're in a great position to contract up that business.","Terry Spencer","The only thing I would add is when you see a lot of those rigs coming in especially in the Powder River we don't talk as much about that most of the rigs are coming on acreage that's already dedicated to us through existing contracts.","Brian Zarahn","Appreciate the color. I guess shifting gears to the Permian, any update on your discussions with potential customers on your West Texas LPG expansion project?","Terry Spencer","Yes. We still continue to talk to customers out there. We still in various levels of discussion with them and contract negotiations obviously that's a very competitive area out there, but we think we are advancing those discussions and when we get them, when we get ink on paper we'll let people know we have more capacity to be constructed out there. But we think everything's going as planned on that front, but it is competitive and we are working on multiple sides for new plants.","Brian Zarahn","And then last one for me on expansion CapEx this year, it's a little bit of wide range what are some of the moving parts permitting is the weather is it some other smaller projects and do you expect the CapEx to be back end loaded this year?","Walt Hulse","Yes. We will absolutely ramp up through the year with our CapEx spending as far as what's driving the range it's clearly timing I mean we have plans and we think and we'll be in the middle range there, but whether it's weather or some minor delays or accelerations that could move capital around when you've got the number of projects that we're going to be working on especially in the back half of the year.","Kevin Burdick","Yes .I think only thing I would add your comments that we got lot of experience to fill the pipeline's across this country, and so and we've had weather situations with just about every one of our projects, so we've got experience at factoring in those kinds of things that you don't always anticipate that affects the project. And we've certainly done that here in a capital estimates that we provided. So we used all that experience and data that we've accumulated and factored that into these estimates. So we should be in pretty good shape regardless of what happens.","Operator","We will move to our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho","Good morning, everyone. For the initial 50 plus percent of the Arbuckle II pipeline that's contracted, how many new plants are going to be connected to the line to get to the 200,000 barrels per day? Can you give us any more color on how much of it is third party plants versus your plants? How much of it are volumes from Elk Creek filling into line versus volumes you are picking up in Oklahoma or West Texas? Is that's also an option for supply connection?","Sheridan Swords","Christina, this is Sheridan. What I would tell you is typically at 200 million a day plants going to produce to 20 to 25,000 barrels a day. We do have obviously some of our plants are in there from the SCOOPS and STACKS but by far the majority of the plants that will be connected in the SCOOPS and STACKS will be third party processing plants. So most of the plants hearing being announced today are contracted to this system. The Arbuckle II pipeline is a pipeline that provides capacity to all systems. So we do have some transport only volume on this system. Some of that volume will come off at Elk Creek but that is Elk Creek economics or from the Bakken to Conway, and if it was volume that's going to end up in Mont Belvieu then the additional fee to get from Conway to Mont Belvieu will be applied to Arbuckle on that piece as well. So that's why you're saying that part of the 200,000 plus barrels will be transport only and majority of it will be fracking down in Mont Belvieu with the additional frac capacity.","Christine Cho","But are you assuming some of the Bakken in that 200,000 barrels per day or that would be excess?","Sheridan Swords","We are something some of the Bakken in 200,000 barrels a day.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then what's your utilization on the Sterling and Arbuckle pipelines currently? The spread between Belvieu and Conway has widened out, so curious to know if you think this is a short-term phenomenon or is this beginning of continued widening until more capacity comes on? And does it seem like customers want to sign up for long-term capacity well ahead of their needs more today than what you've seen the last two years?","Sheridan Swords","So Christine Arbuckle pipeline is fully, we are moving as much volume out of the Mid-Continent as we can on Arbuckle pipeline. So if you say for moving out of the Mid-Continent, Arbuckle are 100% utilized. On the Sterling system, we are about 60 little over 60% utilized if you put in that Sterling III will be expanding 250. So we already put that volume in we're about 60% utilized, 67% utilized on the Sterling system. We do things spread --they're not going to be where they are today. You're seeing and the unusual spread differential here at the end of February where you're seeing $0.30 some spread, if you look ahead into the next month, they get back more into the $0.07 to $0.10. We think there's a possibility that could stay in that range especially as we see more ethane come online and fill up a lot of that Sterling space which you will constrain some of the space, but you are right, we think that could stay there until we bring on more capacity and that more capacity will be Arbuckle II.","Christine Cho","Okay, great and then I think you kind of addressed this in your prepared remarks but we heard one of your GMP competitors talk about one of their future plants connecting to your Bakken line. Was that included in your a 100,000 barrels per day of commitments for Elk Creek or is that incremental?","Sheridan Swords","What I would say that included in our prepared remarks that we now say that we are in 10% or 20% higher than what we originally said was our - the volume we had contracted on the line.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Tonet","Good morning. Just want to start-off with operating in the NGL results there the optimization in marketing I think it was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but as you're talking about it is widen a bit here. I was just wondering if you could expand a bit on the commentary. It seems like it was offset by wider location depths and how you see that playing out and when you're looking at the NGL segment guidance over the course of 2018, what's up environment do you see for that versus kind of what we're seeing right?","Kevin Burdick","Well, are you referring to the sequential quarter-to-quarter optimization and marketing, Jeremy?","Jeremy Tonet","Yes.","Kevin Burdick","Yes. What's going on there is if you think back we've really had a very strong Q3 in optimization and marketing, and then it wasn't that fourth quarter was bad but just from some timing things we ended up you know it was lower. So it was really the strong third quarter that drove the sequential fourth quarter being down.","Jeremy Tonet","Great and then as you think about your 2018 guide, there's that embedded environment that's you know similar to what you're seeing now and those different factors or is it much different?","Kevin Burdick","I think Jeremy $0.03 to $0.04 I mean is what we put out there is kind of the spread that we use for ethane for our optimization., and yes we've seen some short-term things that are positives here in the first quarter, but does that continue through the rest of the year that we don't have that type of spreads we're seeing today built into our 2018 guidance.","Jeremy Tonet","Great, thanks for that. And thinking about your pipes going into Mexico there's just wondering you know given the state of Waha basis as you described you know where the volumes are now on that pipe? When does that - when could that hit full utilization in what do you see is the prospects are as far as maybe moving more that gas and further into Mexico over time given such rampant supply growth in the Permian?","Kevin Burdick","Well, I think the key with our West Texas and our Roadrunner pipeline is that regardless of the physical flow that's a long-term firm commitment demand charge we're getting paid regardless of the volume that are flowing. I mean as the downstream infrastructure continues to get built out in Mexico then we will see more physical volumes flow, timing of that's probably over the next one to two years. And Phil anything to add there?","Unidentified Company Representative","No, that's exactly right and we continue our conversations with markets in Mexico about expansion capabilities of Roadrunner 2 or they're obviously looking at the Waha pricing and seeing that that's pretty attractive to what they're trying to do so.","Terry Spencer","So, Terry. It's fair to say that as far as we concerned specifically as it relates to Roadrunner that they're still constructing or still in the construction side and some of their power plants and those have been slow and coming right, and so certainly as we move throughout the balance of the year the north some of the Norte Power Plants, some of those plants, they're making progress on certainly in those plants get further along will get operational will see increased loads on Roadrunner.","Unidentified Company Representative","Absolutely, yes, they continue their construction activities on their power plants and even in addition to that there's a pretty robust construction activity on the downstream pipeline side in Mexico right now. So it's a lot of those facilities will be coming online in next year or so and you'll see some increased supplies coming in from Waha and the States supporting those facilities. But as Kevin mentioned our facilities are already contracted their take or pay contracts and so we feel good about our position there.","Jeremy Tonet","Great, thanks for that and you guys noted I think 650 completion counts for next year. I was just wondering for 2018, I was wondering if you might build - expand a bit on some of the drivers or details to that and it seems like some of the producers this quarter we're talking about Mid-Continent growth or STACKS growth maybe a little bit slower than what they have message before and I am just wondering if this kind of match your expectations there?","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin. Yes, we've seen-- we haven't seen anything come out. In fact, we've been quite pleased with that the producers have gone through their calls and talk about their capital spend for 2018 in both the Williston and the STACKS and SCOOPs and it's all been absolutely in line with our guidance and our outlook on things. So the 650 we still feel very good about that given what we're seeing from the recent capital announcements.","Jeremy Tonet","That's helpful, thanks. Then John just one last one seems like where your leverage sits, liquidity sits surely you guys enjoy some financial flexibility that I think others in the space still don't have yet and just wondering if you had thoughts as far as industry consolidation or M&A in general if that's something that's on your radar at all or just given the deep - we're going to growth opportunity set a really great rates of return that's just kind of not as much of a high priority for you guys right now?","Kevin Burdick","Well certainly, the organic growth strategy that we talked about today is what we're focused on. Okay, so as far as the M&A front goes it's certainly difficult to predict and actionability is always a challenge and certainly our company is well positioned in any event a compelling opportunity presented itself, we'd be ready but candidly with the organic growth opportunities that we see upfront of us over the next three to five years, we're not in a position to have to do any M&A. And so I hope that puts that --we're kind of where it belongs in terms priority.","Operator","We'll move next to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Chris Sighinolfi","Good morning, guys. So you've been busy, nice starts for the year here. You closed your prepared remarks mentioning through what comes next and my first questions related to that but specifically in regards to that the fractionation portfolio. The four key results indicate headroom of about a 160,000 barrels a day on the current capacity, and then before will obviously add about 125 but you have significant committed volumes who spoken about on the on the new NGL pipes and ethane recovery might be gravy on top of that. So I'm just wondering if we could talk about how on the frac side everything takes shape. Is it sort of strongly hinting about additional frac capacity that you'll add over the same timeframe or do you have a legacy contract rolling off or do you contract for capacity you might need? Are you responsible to frac all the volumes on your line? Can you just walk us through that?","Terry Spencer","Let's first Sheridan answer that question.","Sheridan Swords","So I think the first thing you have to look at fourth-quarter fractionation volumes are really higher than they should be due to as we said the third quarter being less than they should be we had a lot of store volume coming in the fourth quarter. So you have some more room in there as well but we think with what we have we do have some volume on our system that is train port only. We have some fairly large projects that we did end of line for people that have fractionated capacity in the Gold Coast area that we have done this as well. So we don't have to frac all the line in our system. But as we said our current MB4 fractionator is fully contracted so as we continue to grow with contracts with our customers, there could be another fractionation we hope there's another fractionator that comes online in the near future.","Chris Sighinolfi","And Sheridan I guess related to that then is there should we expect any upward pressure over the next couple years on frac fees at Belvieu or as you see the cadence of new plants from you and from peer companies, is there enough capacity coming online that you don't think we'll be pinched?","Sheridan Swords","Well, I think a lot of, when you think about when you contract and build a fractionator you have to --you're going to build NB4, we're going to build 125,000 barrels a day fractionator and that capacity comes online day one, but we ramped into that capacity from our commitments, as it ramps over two to three years, so and that's everybody is in the same boat. So there's going to be some capacity in the front that in the industry will have as we ramp into these contracts. So I think that we won't at this time get pinched on capacity. Overall, I think rate will be somewhat where they are today because when you look at really a fractionation rate you can't just look at what's going on in Belvieu. Most people are competing for the bundled service out in the field - so were competing in the Bakken, in the STACKS and all that, that's what we're getting a bundled service, we look at what the market is in that area it's not necessary that what the market is in Belvieu.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And I guess final question on the frac front. There - would there be any rationale or opportunity to build additional frac in the mid-con or is it just logical to think that all new for a capacity is going to be Belvieu centric?","Sheridan Swords","We really think it's going to be Belvieu centric and one of the main reason is we think it's easier to ship raw feed and determine it into five products and backs it down a pipeline. And Belvieu is where we see the Belvieu or the Gold Coast is where we see incremental demand. We may put a little - the only thing we do for fractionation capacity in the Mid-Continent that we could do it at a relatively cheap small expansion rate which you saw a little bit what we're doing on Elk Creek pipeline. We spend a little bit of money to upgrade our cracks, but that's cheap capacity expansion. Any new Greenfield will all be built on Gulf Coast.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And then I have one unrelated question which just does tell us back on Jeremy's inquiry about the optimization and marketing. Kind of appreciated your answer just in the relationship it indicated narrower product price differentials were partial offset to the water locational differentials? Are you or you --is there and activity there was you're supplementing propane for butane or butane for propane. Can you just talk us through that?","Terry Spencer","Really what you're doing we talk about product price differences from the time that we buy and sell and timing of the market and so okay big volume in a third quarter, big but nice price in third quarter not as much in the fourth quarter, essentially what we were talking about.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ted Durbin","Thank. Just coming back to the return profile on the projects but what drives the difference between the low end and the high end of the range the 4x to 6x. Is it more on the total capital you spend or I would think more on the volumes that actually show up or operating cost maybe you can just give us a sense of what's --what drives leverage to the high end?","Kevin Burdick","It's going to be - it's primarily, it's Kevin. It's going to be primarily timing and just your volume ramp. I mean again the high end of that range you're going to be earlier on and with our current contracted capacity, if those volumes come on faster and\/or you get some more contracts, you're going to go - you're going to push that multiple lower.","Ted Durbin","Okay and so just coming back to the ramp then, is it fair to say that the first year is going to come in at 6x or that even may be higher than that I just a little more color on the timing of that two to three year ramp and where we start out at in the first year?","Kevin Burdick","I mean, yes, in the first year again if they're coming on at the beginning of the year by the end of that year you might be towards that high end. I mean but again that's going to be kind of splitting hairs a little bit as far as when exactly the volumes come on inside that first year.","Ted Durbin","Okay.","Kevin Burdick","But definitely, I would definitely think about it that way is that early on especially in the first year in years one and two you're going to be at that high end and then it's going to transition down as you fill it up.","Ted Durbin","Okay, no, that's helpful. Just on the guidance and the gathering and processing you're guiding to the $0.80 rate that's down from $0.86 from 2017. Is that just a mix shift between the Bakken and the mid-con as you think ahead into 2019? Should we expect that rate to be kind of a good run rate or how do we think about that I gas gathering rate?","Kevin Burdick","Chuck, do you want to take that?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes. Kevin, I will take that. Yes, essentially that's what that is it's the Mid-Continent volumes coming on and our fees are still lower in the Mid-Continent than they are in the Bakken, so that's kind of a blended rate between the two basins.","Ted Durbin","Okay, great and then last one for me just coming back to the financing. Walt, you mentioned that you're close to where you want to be but you think the leverage ticks up over time obviously with the higher CapEx. I guess what's the comfort of the rating agency to let you get into I don't know mid to high 4s let's say and still keep that BBB rating. Do you need to come for, I don't know preferred equity or turn on the drip or there are other things you can do? Just give us a sense of kind of where we should see leverage trending into 2018 and 2019?","Walt Hulse","Well, I'll let the ratings speak for themselves, but I will say that we have had constant dialogue and keep in touch with on a regular basis. So they are well aware of what we're doing. And yes as we get these construction projects towards the end of 2019 coming down, we'll see some pickup in our leverage to more than 4x. I think it will be at the high end of the range you just mentioned, but as these pipelines come on and this cash flow, our credit metrics improve dramatically and we'll be back through that 4x target pretty quickly. So just given the transparency of these contracted volumes and how we see that playing out, we think that for our discussions of the agencies that we are pretty comfortable with that. We have other projects come on and we need to think about still some equity out there in 2018. We are leaving that door open, but as we sit here today, there's a good chance we won't have to issue any other equity.","Ted Durbin","Okay, great and then last one for me is just on your just management incentives in your proxy statement as you develop the next one. Are you going to keep or return the invested capital metric in there at the okay level somewhere - what you have it Okay. What should we look for in terms as metric system?","Walt Hulse","Yes. We will.","Ted Durbin","Okay. We will stay tune for that. Thanks .That's it for me.","Operator","Our next question will come from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Craig Shere","Good morning. Kevin sorry to beat this into ground but that two to three year ramp at 4x to 6x EBITDA. I'm thinking specifically around Elk Creek. I thought that you had about 70,000 barrel a day of MVC, is that just about right away with maybe another 30 that rolled in over a year or two and so I just want to confirm that's about right and also see if this rail volume Sheridan's talking about having no margin is basically the same as the MVC's or do you see that as potentially incremental that could be day one margin soon as Elk Creek comes on?","Kevin Burdick","Okay. This is Kevin. There are couple questions in there. So on the one clarification on the 70,000 barrels a day minimum volume, we said we had commit - the volume commitments on out of the 100,000 that 70,000 barrels a day ramps also. So that all that doesn't hit day one so that's one dynamic that's going on. Yes, as we rail volumes and as the volumes we put on rail grows over the next couple years while Elk Creek gets built then absolutely day one those volumes would shift over to the pipe and drive that incremental EBITDA very quickly. So that's the way I guess to think about how the volumes will grow but then you will have an initial EBITDA pop when a tree comes on line as you move these rail volumes over to the pipe like shared dimension. Hope that answer your questions.","Craig Shere","It does. Can you clarify how much capacity you can handle via rail and do you all intend to advise us over time how that portion of the business is growing so we can kind of model the EBITDA uplift once Elk Creek hit?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. We have said we expect to be able to rail up to 30,000 barrels a day from our Riverview facility and you know up north and so you can then kind of back end okay what would that mean if you're railing 30,000 barrels and then you've got the rates we're giving .","Craig Shere","Sure. Would you anticipate that to be relatively full by the time Elk Creek is online?","Kevin Burdick","Yes.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ethan Bellamy with Baird. Please go ahead.","Ethan Bellamy","Hey, guys. Follow-up to Jeremy's question about your now excellent cost of capital but from a different angle. Do you have any desire to vertically or horizontally integrate for example maybe heading to the Northeast on the gas or NGL side? Or maybe moving downstream to LNG?","Terry Spencer","Not really. We thought about the Northeast from time to time and in particular the Marcellus region. We've got some NGL assets they're kind of in the region but not really suited to serve any Marcellus development and that are primarily our North system in our NGO segment. We pondered the Marcellus or sometimes but candidly it is its well-served by the midstream companies with really strong positions. So we don't see a spot there for us. And on the LNG front we you know we we're more interested in the infrastructure upstream and that's what we continue to work on pipeline, storage and those types of things that would serve LNG but not a particularly interest in being in LNG plants. So that's kind of how we think about those things in particular.","Ethan Bellamy","Okay. Thank you. And then just one sort of housekeeping question. Was there any - maybe what you described it abnormally high amount of freeze off or anything weather-related in the first quarter that would you be modeling?","Terry Spencer","No, I don't think we've seen anything kind of out of the ordinary. Like we have talked previously, we you know we build in a certain level of we know we're going to have some winter both at the tail end of Q4 and first couple months of the first quarter. So, yes we've seen some cold weather. We have seen some freeze-offs up north but nothing that I would consider out of the ordinary.","Operator","There are no further telephone questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for any additional or closing remarks.","Andrew Ziola","Okay. Thank you. Great questions today.

Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.","Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings results and updated our 2019 financial guidance expectations. The first nine months have set us up well for another year of companywide earnings growth in 2019 and have laid the foundation for continued growth next year. We also reiterated our outlook for greater than 20% earnings growth in 2020.","We provided updated timing on several of our capital growth projects including our Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant in North Dakota, which was completed earlier this month and our Demicks Lake II plant, which we expect to complete in January 2020. The northern section of our Elk Creek NGL pipeline is expected to begin line fill activities in November and will provide meaningful volume and earnings growth as we exit the year.","Between now and the end of the first quarter of 2020, we expect to fully complete five growth projects that will add more than 700,000 barrels per day of NGL transportation capacity, a 125,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity and an additional 400 million cubic feet of natural gas processing capacity, including Demicks Lake plants. This critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure including assets to help significantly reduce natural gas flaring in Williston Basin, will provide immediate earnings and volume up lift in 2020 and stable fee based growth for years to come.","With that, I will turn the call over to Walt's for comments on our third quarter results.","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter 2019 net income totaled $309 million or $0.74 per share and third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $650 million. Year-to-date, net income and adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and 5%, respectively, compared with the same period last year.","Distributable cash flow through the first nine months of the year was $1.5 billion, up 13% compared with 2018 with a healthy year-to-date dividend coverage of 1.42 times. We have also generated nearly $450 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid through the first nine months of this year.","During the first quarter, we paid the dividend of $0.89 per share and last week we announced the dividend increased to $0.915 or $3.66 per share on an annualized basis. Dividend is payable on November 14th to shareholders of record on November 4th. This latest increase results in a 9% increase in 2019 dividends paid compared with 2018 in line with our previously stated guidance.","In August, we completed a $2 billion senior note offering providing increased liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. In addition to the funding capital expenditures, proceeds from the offering also were used to proactively manage upcoming debt maturities including repaying $250 million of our $1.5 million term loan to 2021 and redeeming $300 million of senior notes that were due March 2020.","On September 30th, net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.5 times. We continue to expect to be at four times debt to EBITDA run rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 for the first quarter of 2021 with the deleveraging continuing in the quarters to follow that.","We ended the third quarter with the full $2.5 billion available on our credit facility and more than $670 million of cash. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we narrowed our 2019 financial guidance ranges. The midpoint of our net income guidance increased to $1.28 billion and our adjusted EBITDA midpoint remain unchanged at $2.6 billion.","The natural gas gathering and processing, and natural gas pipeline segments are trending toward the high-end of the previously announced financial guidance ranges, each with the ability to exceed the high-end of their range.","Our performance in these segments reflect stronger-than-expected volume growth in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas and gathering in the gathering processing segment and higher firm transportation capacity contracted on expansion projects in the natural gas pipeline segment.","Our natural gas liquids segment is trending towards the low end of its previously announced financial guidance range, primarily due to lower optimization and marketing earnings from narrower than expected pricing spread between Conway and Mont Belvieu and due to the impact of increased ethane rejection on our system.","Despite a vastly different commodity price environment and spreads that were one third as large as the year ago, our base business grew compared with a strong quarter last year. As we mentioned in prior quarters, we expect earnings for this segment to be heavily weighted towards the back half of the year.","The Williston Basin continues to be a primary contributor to one-offs growth underscored by the fact that volume growth in the region is at higher margins relative to our other regions. We've also updated our 2019 growth capital guidance range to $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, consistent with my remarks last quarter, reflecting the accelerated timing on several of our capital growth projects.","The early in service on these projects also accelerates their associated EBITDA contributions and further underscores our confidence in our earnings growth and deleveraging next year. As Terry mentioned, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth of greater than 20% in 2020, compared with our 2019 guidance midpoint and the emphasis remains on greater than 20%.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt. We continue to see strong producer activity across our operations with NGL and natural gas volumes through the first nine months of the year already surpassing full year 2018 volumes. Overall, our projects remain on time and on budget positioning us well for continued growth as volumes on these projects ramp up over the next several months. Let's take a closer look at our operating regions starting with the Rockies.","Producer activity remained strong in both Williston and Powder River basin. North Dakota saw a record natural gas production again in August of more than 3 billion cubic feet per day and the basin wide rig count remains at approximately 60. As Terry mentioned, our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant is now in service and we expect it to ramp quickly to full capacity once the entire Elk Creek pipeline s in service.","With natural gas flaring of more than 550 million cubic feet per day in the basin and more than 300 million of that one dedicated anchorage, the volume growth is immediately available to capture. We also expect to complete our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake II plant in January of 2020, which will help further alleviate flaring in the basin.","Third quarter natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mount region were nearly 1.1 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of 7% year-over-year and 2% compared with the second quarter 2019. This puts us on track in 2019 for the higher end of our volume guidance range. We now expect to connect between 525 and 550 wells in the Rocky Mount region this year compared with prior well connect guidance of 620 wells.","Better-than-expected well performance and higher gas to oil ratios have contributed to the growth even with producers temporarily delay in completion to avoid additional flaring due to lack of processing capacity and NGL takeaway. This has translated into a rising drill but uncompleted well count, which is reached approximately 1,000 basin-wide with more than 400 on our acreage.","We expect producers to begin working this inventory off once Elk Creek and additional processing capacity come online providing further support for our expected growth in 2020. NGL raw feed throughput volumes in the Rocky Mountain region increased approximately 7% compared with the second quarter 2019 due primarily to the Southern section of Elk Creek pipeline coming online in July.","In addition to our Demicks Lake I plant, more than 300 million cubic feet per day of third-party processing capacity which recently completed with an additional 750 million cubic feet per day of capacity expected to be completed in the Rockies region by the first quarter of 2020. At full capacity, these plants are capable of producing a total of approximately 160,000 barrels per day of propane plus when full.","We are already seeing additional NGL volumes from the region in October with throughput averaging more than 190,000 barrels per day, which includes the already full 140,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline. Line fill activities on the Northern Section of Elk Creek are expected to begin in November and volumes will continue to ramp through the remainder of the year including approximately 25,000 barrels per day currently being railed that will transition to the pipeline and reduce our rail cost.","We expect exit 2019 with more than 215,000 barrels a day of raw feed throughput for the region and reach more than 240,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020. As a reminder, each 25,000 barrels per day of incremental volumes results in nearly $100 million of adjusted EBITDA. We also continue to see increased producer activity in the Powder River Basin as production results remain strong and some rigs have relocated there from other basins, benefitting both our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments.","Moving onto the Mid-Continent, natural gas volumes processed increased 8% year-over-year and are tracking above the midpoint of our guidance expectations. Total NGL raw feed throughput in the Mid-Continent region decreased compared with last quarter due to higher Mid-Continent ethane rejection, specifically during July and August. We had approximately 50,000 fewer barrels per day of ethane on our system in the third quarter of 2019 than the second quarter of 2019, but saw an increase of approximately 30,000 barrels per day of propane plus volumes in the region, which demonstrates strong core supply growth.","We since seen ethane on our system increase in the fourth quarter, but continue to expect fluctuation through the remainder of the year as we near the start of the new petrochemical facilities on the Gulf coast. Through the first nine months of the year, we've connected 98 wells to our natural gas gathering and processing system and connected five new third-party processing plants to our natural gas liquid system in the Mid-Continent.","Two previously connected third-party plants on our system have also been expanded in the region. NGL volumes from these new connections and expansions in addition to growing Rockies volumes will drive the volume growth on our Arbuckle II pipeline, which remains on schedule for completion in the first quarter of 2020. We continue to stay in contact with our customers in the region about their plans and forecasts, and this information has been incorporated into our growth outlook for 2020.","Now taking a closer look at our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast operations, NGL raw feed throughput volumes in this region increased 26% year-over-year and the average fee rate increased by approximately $0.05 compared with the second quarter 2019. This was driven primarily by a ramp in volumes on completed West Texas LPG expansion projects and the replacement of lower rates legacy volumes on the system with market-based transportation and fractionation rights.","We expect average rates to continue to increase as our 80,000 barrels per day expansion and 40,000 barrels per day expansion are completed in the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 respectively. System wide NGL fractionation capacity remains highly utilized. Phase 1 of our MB-4 fractionator which will provide approximately 75,000 barrels per day of capacity is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Phase 2 of the project which will add the remaining 50,000 barrels per day of capacity remains on schedule for completion in the first quarter of 2020. MB-5 remains on track for completion in the first quarter of 2021.","Terry that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Kevin. Our operating performance, system-wide volumes strength and execution of our capital growth program with a very strong balance sheet had clearly exceeded many expectations. But while the operational and earnings growth is important the way in which we operate conduct ourselves in business and construct our project is equally important and it is important that we place on sustainable and responsible operations that is the foundation for all of the successes we discussed today.","You can find more detailed information related to our environmental, social and government focus priorities and programs in our most recent corporate sustainability report which can be found on our website. The report is our 11th Annual ESG Report, and with each version of this report, we prioritize increasing disclosures, content and relevance for one of many stakeholders. I encourage you to review the report on our website. We continue to focus on improvements in these areas, and welcome your feedback to help us do so because our goal is to build and grow business that is profitable, safe and environmentally responsible for the long-term.","Thank you to all our dedicated employees for your hard work and contributions this quarter. We're only a couple of months away from closing out another year of companywide growth and were about to enter an exciting year of new asset operations and additional project completions.","With that operator were now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jeremy Tonet, JP Morgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Just want to start off with the project ramp, you have a lot of moving pieces here, a lot of project coming online over the next couple of quarters and you've talked in your remarks, but just Demicks Lake I and II, how should we think about those plant ramping up especially as you need Elk Creek online to kind of perform the way you want to perform there. Just how should we expect EBITDA to ramp over the next few quarters with all these different projects coming online?","Kevin Burdick","Jeremy, this is Kevin and then I'll let others jump in. But clearly, Elk Creek is kind of the key project that we need to get done. The basin is short NGL takeaway capacity. Right now, but as Elk Creek comes in service, then all the processing plants up there not just Demicks Lake I, but you've got some third-party processing plants that are up now and you've got another one that's going to come online in the fourth quarter, all those plants will be able to ramp.","And clearly there is substantial flaring behind not just our system but other company systems as well. So, you would expect it's going to ramp very quickly from the flared gas inventory. Then as you move through 2020 early 2020, and the flares get put out, you still see the strength in rigs, we're seeing up there, and you've also got growth coming out of the Powder as well. So you'll see an immediate step up as we put out the flares and you'll continue to see a ramp given the rig counts in the activity levels we're seeing.","Jeremy Tonet","That's very helpful, thanks. Just turning to CapEx, you guys have a very deep portfolio projects and it seems like it's kind of peaking right about now. Just wondering, what -- how you guys think about the balance of capital with great opportunities versus capital discipline that the market seems to be focused on? How do you see capital trending next year? Any color or thoughts you could provide there?","Walt Hulse","Jeremy, this is Walt. We've got several projects that we've already announced that include Demicks Lake II, MB-5, Arbuckle II [Later changed by the Company] and West Texas expansion. All of those will be completed throughout the course of 2020. So you can kind of do the math on what we've already got ticked off. So we'll see a meaningful step down in our CapEx next year from what we have in 2019.","Going forward, we think the vast majority of everything that we see on horizon has been announced. There will other growth opportunities that will come, but remember we've built the backbone of the system here with these two pipes. So, we have significant operating leveraging going forward.","So if we had another processing plant or something along those lines, order of magnitude is significantly less as we go forward and then also I would point out that anything that we would announce in the coming quarters would really get spend over the couple of years. So our 2020 CapEx at this point is something that you can get a pretty good look just based on what we've announced today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni, UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Wondering if we can sort of talk about a couple of things here. Just you've sort of mentioned in your prepared remarks about the reduction in expectation for Bakken 12 expects for this year, but what's interesting in your commentary indicates that it's the function of the infrastructure delay, which in theory would imply a higher inventory for next year, but at the same time you also noted that the liquid component is higher so your volume expectations are unchanged. So what I think about next year, does it now mean that you to have potential for even higher inventory connection? And with the higher cut that you're seeing coming from the liquid side as you would think that 2020 could be even better than what you are originally vision for 2020? Or might not be thinking about that correct?","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin. I mean yes. I think that conceptually you're on the right path. We were able to --producers were clearly they were button up against unflattering constraints right because the basin with short processing capacity and NGL take away was full. So rather than going ahead and completing those wells knowing they're going flare they backed off and that's been going on for several months.","So yes, that increase was the result of that. And yes, that gives us some tailwinds as we move into 2020. And then on the other side of that there just producers continue to deliver strong results which even though we connected fewer wells than we had anticipated we were still able to get more towards the higher end of our volume guidance.","Terry Spencer","Yes, Kevin, it's fair to say that producers have consistently exceeded our expectations particularly in Williston. I think there we benefited from their own capital discipline and certainly finding ways to enhance the productivity of their well. The gas all ratios have been a big deal for us up there, which in turn has increased in our liquids and be available to our plant. So, I think just all in all, the backdrop is that producers have really done a superb job, not only delivering on what we expect them to deliver, but exceeding those expectations.","Shneur Gershuni","And then just two quickly follow-up, one just the clarification you talked about more ethane recovery 4Q 19. Is that a function of the fact that there is a challenge to take away gas out of the basin right now and you just need to make more room on the gas line, so it make more sense to recovery of the ethane. Is that kind of the reason or is there something different?","Sheridan Swords","Yes, this is Sheridan. So, I think you're right. You really need to look at the gas issue especially in the Permian and in the Mid-Continent. And when the Permian gas goes really, you see a lot more ethane come out of the Permian basin versus the Mid-Continent, we saw that in the third quarter. But now the gas prices during the fourth quarter have moved up in the Permian, a little bit and gas prices in the continent moves down, which allows more ethane to come out of Mid-Continent. So you really need to look at the gas price because the TNF out of the Mid-Continent and the TNF out of the Permian are fairly close together. So, it's not on that side of it.","Shneur Gershuni","And one final question. In your conversation with Jeremy about CapEx and you've talked about it's being materially lower in 2020 versus 2019. So, there should be some sort of free cash in fruition. And I would expect there'll be an improvement in leverage, but when is the right time for us to start discussing return of capital options with free cash flow where you look at options like buy backs? Do you change dividend policy? And I\u2019m just kind of curious kind of what your thoughts on when the free cash flow starts to material next year?","Walt Hulse","We said that we were get to four times debt to EBITDA by Q4 of 2020 or Q1 of 2021. We expect to continue to delever after that and we'll proceed down through into that 3 to 5 range, which is kind of aspirationally where we like to be. So, we still have some time, we're going to -- that's going to take through 2021, maybe into 2022. So, we're going to continue that delevering as our primary focus. And then going forward, we always are on the hunt for good growth opportunities. And to the extent that the commercial team finds those growth opportunities, we're going to pursue those, but keeping that leverage in that on a going forward basis, in and around that 3.5 times.","Terry Spencer","The only thing I would add to Walt's comments are that the priority continues to be fund those, these attractive growth projects and we continue to have a runway of growth in front of us, albeit we don't have any of those great big infrastructure projects or backbone projects like Walt mentioned earlier, but the priority will continue to be around these great return organic projects.","And certainly, we think about it as we have if and as we have cash available, certainly, retire debt, and then share backs could come into the equation, but I don't see it, but it's certainly something that we think about. If we get to a point where we're running out of growth projects and we're forced to look at other ways to invest our capital certainly share buybacks are something that we would consider.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Cho, Barclays.","Christine Cho","Hi everyone. If I'm to back out the Rockies volumes that are feeding into the Arbuckle II contracted capacity. I still estimate that over 100,000 barrels per day is supposed to come from Mid-Continent and I know the outlook for 2020 and be at least more than 20% over 2019 is driven primarily by Bakken. But how should we risk the need Mid-Con volumes to show up to hit numbers? Do you need it to be flat at a minimum? Or can it sustain a decline and we can still have those numbers?","Kevin Burdick","I mean, Christine, this is Kevin. Just looking kind of holistically at the Mid-Con, clearly, there has been some pullback recently by producers. We've factored all that in. We're probably thinking of the Mid-Continent in a flat to slightly declining type of environment as we factor in that to our 2020 growth outlook. So, we don't need significant or really any growth coming out of the STAKE and SCOOP to meet the growth outlook we provided for 2020.","Christine Cho","And then, moving over to CapEx, you guys are very transparent in providing CapEx for each of the individual projects. But how should we think about the range of annual spending you guys do on ancillary CapEx that isn't included in the project CapEx you've disclosed or maintenance CapEx so like well connects, I don't know, maybe adding a compression -- compressor pump somewhere here?","Kevin Burdick","Just looking at kind of what we would consider kind of that routine, growth routine CapEx that we're going to see on a year-in and year-out basis, that's probably in the $400 million to $500 million range. You throw some processing plants like Walt alluded to earlier on top of, it raises up a little bit, but that's kind of ranges just for that normal blocking and tackling type growth that we'd see.","Walt Hulse","Christine, hang on a second. The only thing I would add to that is well connect, makes up the bulk of that routine growth, right.","Kevin Burdick","Absolutely, yes, just connecting wells.","Walt Hulse","And then probably plant connections and then other miscellaneous gathering infrastructure both on gatherings processing side as well as liquid side.","Operator","The next question comes from Tristan Richardson, SunTrust.","Tristan Richardson","Good morning, guys. Appreciate the commentary on direction of 2020 capital deployment, but just thinking about the flexibility you have for some longer dated projects that 2021 timeframe, that MB-5 Arbuckle expansion et cetera. Just talking about just your ability to flex of the timing of those either based on volume trajectory or producer plans, et cetera?","Kevin Burdick","As we -- I guess, as we think about the big one there would be MB-5. With the volumes, we have coming and have line of sight to for MB-4 you're going to fill it up extremely quickly, so any growth at all, MB-5 is going to continue on. So I mean, could you do something if something went south in a hurry, potentially so, but again we don't see that again just with the line of sight, we've got to volumes that are going to hit us in the next few months here.","Walt Hulse","Yes. Obviously, from the well connect and that sort of routine, if we saw a significant downturn in producer activity. We have some flexibility on our -- but we don't see it as it relates to MB-5 and Arbuckle II will be done in the first quarter of 2020.","Tristan Richardson","And then just one small follow-up, just can you talk about the performance of the joint ventures, and why you saw the cash distributions from joint ventures expected to be much higher this year than you previously thought. Is that one-time event or is there just general outperformance on Northern Border or OPPL's old direction there?","Terry Spencer","Yes, we've pretty robust discussion about this on our Q2 call. We had a one-time, kind of, catch-up $50 million distribution at our Northern Border and expect it to go back to its normal course in the quarters going forward that's in line with where it's been. So that was the only one, other than that the joint ventures are all performing very well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Blum, Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Can you just give us an update on where the -- where things stand in terms of the potential expansion of Northern Border? And then, kind of, related to that, what's the timing for when you would need to see a new gas pipeline of capacity out of the Bakken before you would need to start effectively, I would call it force recovering ethane, because a BTU limits?","Chuck Kelley","Michael, this is Chuck. As far as Northern Border expansion or any other residue takeaway out of the basin, we're actively working with parties on these residue projects frankly we're under non-disclosure agreements. But suffice it to say that there will be expansion opportunities out of there, and we realize that those takeaways needed to take care of our customers. So, we will definitely be part of that solution. As far as your second question on BTUs, BTU changes, could you please repeat your second question for me?","Michael Blum","Yes, just one question about timing like when do you have to have new gas pipeline capacity to avoid basically reaching the limit and having to extract ethane?","Chuck Kelley","Okay, those are really kind of two questions; one, is on the BTU limits on Northern Border. Northern Border is currently in discussion with customers and point operators about a potential BTU change in their tariff. And that would be forthcoming, we would believe in 2020 and anything beyond that will defer to our TransCanada operator on the asset.","However, as far as more ethane recovery being necessary, it really comes down to how quickly the Bakken continues to grow and we have line of sight in 2020, it's kind of real quickly with these gas plants coming on. So as we continue to displace Canadian volumes that BTU will rise and obviously, the way to mitigate that is to recover more ethane.","So I think 2020, you will see more ethane recovery. I can't give you a number on that. Longer term, we will need some residue takeaway relief. And I think that's more in the '22 timeframe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis, Credit Suisse.","Spiro Dounis","First question on the Mid-Con, just wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your ability to connect more third-party plants. It looks like you guys connected a few more this quarter and maybe seems to be a bit of a step-up. So, just curious, if there is an enhanced push to do more of that maybe as a way to kind of bridge you through next year, and alleviate some of that pressure, we're expecting to come from some of the rig count reduction?","Sheridan Swords","Yes, this is Sheridan. We don't really have that many more plants in the Mid-Continent to connect. We've kind of connect all the ones that are out there, we saw a big push in 2019. A lot of those plants, we've seen some increase in production from those plants and we expect to kind of stay at that level through next year, the level we're at today on a C3 plus basis. So, and I think right now there is plenty of capacity out there what's to process the gas that's there.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. And second question, just with respect to the narrow bands for 2019 guidance and imagine you have considerable visibility at this point. So just curious what could maybe flex full-year EBITDA results from here towards the high or low end of that range?","Sheridan Swords","It's primarily going to be really just the specific timing of these projects and we look at the biggest levers we have, that would be number one. We've talked about spreads it can fluctuate up and down that could be a little bit of a driver, but we've got pretty good line of sight at this point to where we're going to end the year.","Spiro Dounis","Understood. Thanks, it really helped. I'm sorry.","Sheridan Swords","No just to -- Walt jumped in, weather is always, it could be a factor, if you get earlier or know whether that could be an impact as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury, Bernstein.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Hi, good morning. As you referenced a lot of Bakken processing capacity starting up in theory enough to eliminate flaring. Can you share what your estimates for flaring levels once there is enough processing in Elk Creek or like down to the 12%, say target something much lower or possibly something a little higher?","Terry Spencer","Jean Ann, the way I would answer that is, if you go back to few years or actually just with probably 12 to 18 months ago. The basin was down into for several months down into single-digit. So easily, I think with this processing capacity, once everybody, once we get Elk Creek up and once everybody gets, kind of, everything debottlenecked, I think you're going to see flaring get back down below the state targets or above the state targets for capture. I think that's going to -- that will happen.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay, that's helpful. And then can you just -- around your connects flexibility, you have to move volumes between the existing Bakken NGL pipeline and Elk Creek once it starts up?","Sheridan Swords","This is Sheridan. We'll operate those systems, kind of, in tandem to make sure that we optimize, variable costs, optimized going into OPPL and going on Elk Creek Pipeline. So we have a lot of flexibility to move product back and forth between the two pipelines to maximize capacity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I won't even get into the upcoming LSU game here. But real quickly figured and one you all would like that. Real quick good items; one, I assume there is -- should we think about, and I know 2021 is a long way off in the world can change seven times between now and then. But I assume there's still a pretty decent step up in '21 off of 2020. You've talked about 2020 EBITDA being up 20% plus, but is there still another pretty decent size step up coming in 2021, that's first question.","Second question, you guys have talked about a desire to -- want to have export capacity. Just given all that's going on in the world, ethane prices down a lot more, China trade war still going on. How are you thinking about that opportunity and where that fits in the landscape of things you're targeting that do over the next year or two?","Terry Spencer","So Michael, first of all, I'll take LSU and 14 points. And then the next question is yes, as we think about 2021 double-digit growth is certainly in the cards and how this business is continuing to be set up and we still got obviously organic growth projects that will be coming on through '20 and critical projects in 2021. So we're still set up nicely there. I think as far as the export dock project goes still a project we're very interested in doing.","We continue to work it pretty hard. If the economics make sense, we'll certainly do a project, but if they don't make sense, I think we're in good shape with our business in terms of clearing barrels, we have arrangements in place that gives us some certainty that -- of course over the next handful of years we can clear barrels. So we're not really concerned there, I think, the export dock is a great complement to our fee-based activities. So we're going to continue to work it and when we get to a point where we can announce it certainly we'll let you all know.","Operator","The next question comes from Elvira Scotto, RBC Capital Markets.","Elvira Scotto","Hey, good morning everyone, thanks for the commentary around the 2020 EBITDA growth, and it sounds like the confidence level and hitting that greater than 20% growth is pretty high, especially given the comments that you made about your view on the Mid-Con, but if I can ask the question another way, what would have to happen for you to walk back that outlook?","Kevin Burdick","Elvira, this is Kevin. And I'll start again we -- the thing we have stressed for the last several months. We continue to focus on this is with the flared gas in the Bakken, we've got incredible line of sight to these volumes, a similar situation occurred back in the '16, '15 or '16 timeframe where we saw the flared gas, we had projects and we immediately captured it and turned it into EBITDA.","So with the flaring that's occurring in the basin, with the dock count that's out there, with the productivity and the returns, the producers are seeing we've just got a lot of confidence if that's going to be the substantial driver to that growth in 2020. And that's not even getting into the growth we're seeing out of the Permian, the Powder and other places. So we just have a confidence because we have that line of sight, we can reach out and touch these volumes.","Terry Spencer","Kevin, probably the only thing else I'd add to that is we don't have a whole lot in here baked in for ethane recovery. So with the ore spreads, so we're at seasonally low spreads with -- you're typically low this time of the year. Ethane economics are marginal for recovery, if those things turn, there is actually more upside probably did this number than downside.","Elvira Scotto","Great. And just very quickly though, how does commodity or crude oil price factor into this view. I mean, are you looking at anything as long as we're about $50 or do you think even you get to somewhere below $50 you're still fine with this outlook?","Kevin Burdick","Well, we go back to when rigs really came back to the Bakken, they really start coming back in earnest it at around $45 per barrel from the conversations we have with our customers most are planning for a $50 environment more from a cash flow perspective, but the improvements they've seen in the productivity of the wells.","Again, the returns on the well aren't be challenged, it's solely just living within their cash flow, which has been the consistent theme we've gotten from our customers. So I think easily, if you stay north of $50 probably even if you go down to the $45 range, you're still -- this things good to go.","Elvira Scotto","Great. That's perfect. Thanks on that. And then just one quick follow-up on the capital allocation discussion, where does M&A fit in all of this, I mean, are you guys are you open to looking at various assets or are you kind of set on just your organic growth and M&A just has to be super compelling?","Terry Spencer","You just answered it, we're focused on the organic growth and M&A has to uber compelling and most likely, it would be smaller bolt-on types of acquisitions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derek Walker, Bank of America Securities.","Derek Walker","Just had a quick clarification, I think you said in your formal remarks, but I just want to make sure I heard it right. I think believe in the Rockies the NGL volumes were expected to be 240 in 1Q '20. Is that assuming 140 for Bakken NGL and then 100 on Elk Creek that seems no rail, is that correct for the 25, that rail that you're seeing today that should you just transfer over to the pipe that I'm hearing it?","Sheridan Swords","This is Sheridan. Yes, you are correct, and we're starting to transition to -- away from specifically talking about what's on Elk Creek to what's coming out of both the Rockies region, which is Williston and Powder River Basin. Because of the flexibility we have between moving between pipes. So that 240 is basically over 100,000 barrels a day increase from where we were when we just had the Bakken pipeline coming in. So that's the new plants that we talked about coming online, rail coming off and then ramp up on to those volumes and actually we said we think will be above 240 coming out of the first quarter.","Derek Walker","And then, maybe I'll just get one in on ESG, I mean, you guys announced in September that you got added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Can you just talk a little bit about some of your ESG Initiatives and have you any conversation specifically with investors around that, and they focused on any particular metrics?","Terry Spencer","Well, there are always focused on getting more information and certainly probably what we've done, where we've made incredible progress is certainly in the disclosure of our emissions and various environmental impact data, that has -- we had a lot of discussion, obviously from a governance perspective, I think, we've been lauded for the -- for our efficiency from a governance standpoint. When you really think about our broad thoughts around reducing our impact to the environment, that's certainly an area where I think it's resonated with investors.","I think the fact that we've done this now for 11 years in a row and at this -- and this work product continues to improve each and every year. I think certainly that has resonated with investors as well. So disclosure, disclosure, disclosure and as we continue to move forward, we will continue to disclose more information and certainly around emissions targets and that type of outlook will certainly something that's top of mind and that will hopefully be in a position where we can do and provide those types of disclosures in the not too distant future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Terry when you highlighted ethane was only further upside as a catalyst over and above the 20% year-over-year 2020 EBITDA growth guidance. But then you all comment of that 2021 is prime for another year of double-digit growth. When we're looking out two years like that. Are we kind of taking it some of the ethane eventually? Or does that kind of remain an opportunity?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. No we're really, over the course of the next handful of years not expecting or at least we've not got in our base forecast internally much ethane baked into it at least for the next two or three years.","Craig Shere","And what kind of market dynamics do you expect would be necessary to kind of, it start to realize -- I mean, would be ethane exports or what do we really need to start to get more value there?","Kevin Burdick","Well, obviously we've got more petrochemical facilities coming on domestically. And then you've got additional petrochemical facilities coming on internationally. So I think the continued development of international exports, whether that's at the Gulf Coast or in the Northeast, I think continues to be key drivers.","And obviously ethane economics and dependent upon net gas to -- where net gases and if net gas and we continue to have some sort of a conservative view on that gas going forward. I think if you see net gas remain relatively weak. The likelihood if you're recovering significantly more ethane certainly improves.","But as we think ethane economics are so volatile that we've really -- we felt it appropriate not to bake a whole lot in -- into our internal forecasts. Sheridan you've got anything add to that?","Sheridan Swords","Well, that continue to say what's going to drive ethane. Also, as we talked earlier about the relative gas price in the Mid-Continent versus the Permian to see which one moves ahead of the other one to pull the ethane out for the demand that is there.","Craig Shere","Sure. Are you still considering ethane when you're looking at these export project opportunities?","Terry Spencer","Absolutely.","Craig Shere","And I presume that if you did that, it would be something kind of semi long-term contracted and take out some of that volatile in and out of economics. So you'd have somewhat certainty about pulling through the system?","Terry Spencer","That's correct. I mean, the way we're thinking about it is the contracts that you would enter into with respect to ethane on the sales standpoint, which certainly underwrite the dock a fee-based type arrangement, if you will, or perhaps the sale with a fee-based component built into it.","Craig Shere","Great, thank you.","Terry Spencer","The macro ethane economics are going to be what they're going to be, broadly speaking. But as we think about the dock, if the dock and as it relates to ethane fee-based, it's a fee-based business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kania, Wolfe Research.","Alex Kania","Hey, good morning. Just thinking a little bit more about the prospects for ethane recovery in the Bakken just next year either for price reasons or I guess physical constraint reasons, just with respect to Northern Border. How do we really think about those ethane volumes getting handle. Does that -- do you think of that is like incremental to what is it being contracted on Elk Creek and further south already? Or does it -- could it cover like existing contracted volume levels that you've kind of our established right now, just again, kind of, it sounds like you've suggested it was incremental, but I just wanted to confirm?","Sheridan Swords","This is Sheridan, when we look at and is quoted volumes coming out of the Rockies. We do not consider ethane in any of those volumes. It's all C3 plus, so any ethane that we would get, due to be enforced out because of constraints or the very unlikely that it becomes economical will be upside to our volume numbers that we've given.","Operator","Okay. Our final question comes from Sunil Sibal, Seaport Global Securities.","Sunil Sibal","Hi, good morning, guys and thanks for all the color on the call. I just wanted to understand a little bit about the balance sheet management. So it seems like you will hit the ForEx, kind of, leverage metrics in early 2021. I was kind of curious how should we think about that on a more kind of longer-term basis. Do you want to be closer to ForEx or should we be thinking more like between 3 or 3.5 excess longer-term target?","Terry Spencer","Well, we expect to continue to the left to delever past to 4 times and aspirationally we like to be around that 3.5 that gives us a lot of borrowing flexibility going forward for these smaller type of CapEx that would come out in the future. So we use 3.5 is an aspirational target and just think about going forward.","Sunil Sibal","Okay, got it. And then just one clarity on the CapEx side, so obviously you guys have given a pretty good kind of breakdown of CapEx for various projects. When I bake all that into my numbers etc, it seems like you will be in a pretty good spot to get 35% to 40% reduction in CapEx in 2020 versus where you've end up in 2019. I was just curious, is that number seems reasonable or if I may be off somewhere?","Terry Spencer","No we're not going to guide to our 2020 CapEx But I think you can just take the projects we put in service and kind of subtract out what we still have to do and build up to a pretty good number. So the base will come up with your expectation is readily available, we'll leave that to you.","Operator","Okay. At this time, I would like to turn call back over to Andrew Ziola.","Andrew Ziola","All right. Thank you, Charles -- excuse me, our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until we release earnings in late February. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date.","Thank you for joining us this morning and the IR team will be available throughout the day.

After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions.","A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.

Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. ","Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. ","It's an exciting time for ONEOK as we begin placing some of the largest capital growth projects in our history into service. Our projects remain on or ahead of schedule and on budget. ","The southern section of Elk Creek pipeline began employing NGLs on July 15 from the Rockies region into the Mid-Continent, with the northern section still on target to be completed in the fourth quarter. ","Last week, we announced additional low cost expansion projects across our system, which continue to demonstrate ONEOK's ability to incrementally grow with our customers. These projects will help address NGL transportation and fractionation needs of producers and will further address flaring in North Dakota with added natural gas processing capacity. ","All our projects, including these recent expansions, are built to meet the needs of our customers and are backed by long-term contracts. We continue to see strong producer activity levels across the basins where we operate with NGL and natural gas volume growth that is in-line with our expectations so far this year. ","Now, more than halfway through the year, our confidence in our 2019 financial expectations and 2020 earnings outlook has strengthened significantly. With our projects remaining on or ahead of schedule, we expect accelerated earnings growth leading into 2020 and beyond and additional cash flow to reinvest in our business, reduce leverage and continue to return value to shareholders. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for comments on our second quarter results. ","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry. Our second quarter 2019 net income totaled $312 million, or $0.75 per share, an 11% increase year-over-year. And second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $632 million a 5% increase year-over-year. ","Distributable cash flow in the second quarter 2019 was $540 million up 19% from the second quarter 2018, with a healthy dividend coverage of 1.51 times. We also generated more than $180 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in the second quarter 2019. ","During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.865 per share. And last week, we announced a dividend increase to $0.89 per share, or $3.56 per share on an annualized basis. This increase further underscores our confidence in the increasing cash flow we expect to generate from projects we have recently completed or will complete in the coming months. The dividend is payable on August 14 to shareholders of record on August 6. ","Our June 30 net debt to EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis was 4.2 times. With the earnings expected from these projects we expect to be at 4 times debt to EBITDA run rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 or first quarter of 2021, with deleveraging continuing in the quarters to follow. Our liquidity remains strong as we ended the second quarter with the full $2.5 billion available on our credit facility and more than $270 million of cash on hand.","We announced additional natural gas an NGL expansion projects last week that we expect to provide attractive returns for minimal capital invested. We do not expect these projects to impact our 2019 growth capital guidance range of $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion, as most of the spending will happen in 2020 and 2021. Because of the accelerated timing on some of our projects, we anticipate ending the year towards the higher end of our capital guidance range. As spending on our large pipeline projects winds down early next year, we expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be lower than 2019. ","Producer activity, project timing and additional committed volumes on our system, all add up to an impressive backdrop for ONEOK's growth. As we sit today, we are even more confident in our outlook that our 2020 adjusted EBITDA will increase greater than 20% with an emphasis on the greater than when compared with our 2019 guidance midpoint. ","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operating performance. ","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt. We continue to see strong producer activity across our operations driving increases in both NGL and natural gas volumes in the second quarter. Total NGL raw feed throughput volume increased nearly 110,000 barrels per day or 11% year-over-year, and increased 80,000 barrels per day or 8%, compared with the first quarter of 2019. Natural Gas volumes processed, increased more than 150 million cubic feet per day or 9% year-over-year, and increased more than 80 million cubic feet per day or 4% compared with the first quarter 2019.","Let's take a closer look at our volume growth and project timing in each of the basins where we operate. Starting with the Rockies region, producer results remain strong in the Williston and Powder River basins. North Dakota natural gas production is more than 2.8 billion cubic feet per day and there continues to be around 60 rigs operating more than 500 million cubic feet per day of natural gas being flared, and nearly 1000 drilled and uncompleted wells in inventory. All of these factors provide an inventory of growth for our natural gas liquids and natural gas segments. ","As Terry mentioned, we completed the southern section of Elk Creek pipeline from the Powder River Basin to the Mid-Continent, and it is currently flowing more than 30,000 barrels per day of NGLs. With the southern section in service we have moved volumes previously railed on to our pipelines, eliminating higher rail transportation costs. This has also freed up rail capacity, which can be used to address continued NGL growth in the Williston basin until Elk Creek is fully in service in the fourth quarter.","As further growth is expected, we will add pumps on Elk Creek as needed to increase capacity. These projects are low cost and can be completed incrementally to address additional volume growth, including the need for potential ethane recovery.","Approximately 815 million cubic feet per day of new natural gas processing capacity is coming online basin wide between now and the end of the first quarter 2020, which translates to approximately 110,000 barrels per day of propane plus NGL production when these plants are full. With all of the NGLs from those plants dedicated to ONEOK and more than 30,000 barrels per day already flowing on the pipeline. We remain confident that throughput on Elk Creek will reach approximately 100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020.","ONEOK has now announced a total of 600 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas processing capacity in the Williston basin, expected to come online between now and early 2021. Our latest announcement was the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of our Bear Creek plant in Dunn County, an area that has recently experienced some of the highest production increases in North Dakota, and has a decades-long runway of well inventory yet to be drilled. ","We expect volumes on the Bear Creek expansion to ramp up over a 12 to 24 month period once in service. This expansion also increases our NGL volumes contracted for natural gas processing plants in the Rocky Mountain region from 200,000 barrels per day to 225,000 barrels per day.","Our Demicks Lake I plant remains on schedule to open full in the fourth quarter 2019 in conjunction with the completion of the northern section of Elk Creek. Demicks Lake II is expected to be complete early in the first quarter 2020.","Moving on to the Mid-Continent, producer activity in the region remains in line with our expectations for the year. In the second quarter we saw increases in both NGL raw feed throughput volumes and natural gas volumes processed in the Mid-Continent compared with the first quarter 2019. ","Large well pad completions early in the quarter drove the increase in natural gas volumes processed and two new third party plant connections contributed to the increase in NGL volumes. Arbuckle II is on schedule for completion in the first quarter of 2020, and its contracted capacity now totals 375,000 barrels per day compared with 350,000 previously.","Last week, we announced NGL fractionation facility expansions, totaling 65,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. These projects will increase our propane plus fractionation capacity to help address the heavier NGL barrels from the Williston basin. 15,000 barrels per day of capacity is expected to be completed in the third quarter 2020 with the remaining 50,000 barrels per day completed in the first quarter 2021.","These types of projects can be efficiently completed at cost substantially lower than new construction. Recently completed expansion projects in our natural gas pipeline segment continue to drive higher firm capacity contracted in the second quarter compared with both the second quarter 2018 and the first quarter 2019. These projects increase the capacities of our Mid-Continent and Permian basin pipeline systems and will continue to provide increased firm transportation earnings going forward. ","Now let's take a look at our Permian basin and Gulf Coast operations. NGL raw feed throughput volumes in this region increased 20% compared with the first quarter 2019, primarily driven by volume growth on our West Texas LPG pipeline, we continued to expect our average fee rate in this region to trend higher in future quarters as legacy volumes roll off West Texas LPG and are replaced with market-based transportation and fractionation volumes and as expansion of the system come online, which are contracted at market rates. The 80,000 barrel per day expansion of West Texas LPG remains on track to be completed in the first quarter 2020 with volumes ramping up quickly after it is placed in service. ","And last week we announced a third expansion which will add 40,000 barrels per day of capacity to the system. The expansion is supported by long-term dedicated NGL production from processing plants in the Permian basin and is expected to be completed in the first quarter 2021. ","Our NGL fractionation capacity given current product composition is approximately 820,000 barrels per day and was approximately 90% utilized in the second quarter, we now expect to complete our 125,000 barrel per day MB-4 fractionator in phases. Phase 1 will provide approximately 75,000 barrels per day of capacity and is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of this year earlier than originally planned. ","Phase 2 will consist of the remaining 50,000 barrels per day and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 as originally announced. MB-5 remains on track for completion in the first quarter 2021. ","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Kevin. The progress on our capital growth projects this year is setting us up well for a significant volume in earnings uplift in 2020. As Walt emphasized, we're even more confident in our 2020 adjusted EBITDA growth outlook of greater than 20% compared with our 2019 guidance midpoint. ","The impressive production results across our operations highlight the widespread quality of our operating basins and well-capitalized and experienced producers operating there. The volume growth we discussed today have high visibility both NGL and natural gas volumes are ready and waiting for processing and transportation now. ","Producers are looking to ONEOK to provide the critical infrastructure they need to connect their products with demand markets and we are well equipped and ready to grow our operations efficiently in order to do so. I'd like to recognize our large project teams and operations personnel located both at our headquarters and at our various field locations for their hard work to keep our growth projects on time and on budget and specifically to those working on our Elk Creek pipeline who are able to place the southern section in service early benefiting many of our customers. ","Thank you to all our employees for your dedication to our customers and dedication to ONEOK. Your continued focus on safe and responsible operations has led to our continued reliability and operational success. ","With that operator, we are now ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Danilo Juvane, BMO Capital.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks and good morning. You mentioned in the press release having significant upside in the second half of the year from the early start of Elk Creek and other projects as well. Where do you see 2019 EBITDA number was added relative to the midpoint? And to the extent it was that high to the midpoint do you still see a 20% growth rate between 2020 and 2019?","Walt Hulse","No, we haven't changed any of our guidance and don't expect to do that today on this call. Obviously, as we get through the year we will continue to evaluate whether we're going to adjust that. But right now we're giving that outlook on 2020 off of the midpoint to let people have a basis on which to think about it.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks for that Walt. DCF was pretty strong during the quarter. And it looked like it potentially came from Northern Border, anything going on there?","Walt Hulse","Nothing really out of the ordinary Northern Border made an off cycle distribution, in addition to our normal quarterly distribution in the second quarter, but nothing, nothing out of the ordinary course of business.","Danilo Juvane","We shouldn't expect that to continue going forward?","Walt Hulse","I'm sorry, can you say that again?","Danilo Juvane","We should expect any more off-cycle distributions for the balance of the year?","Walt Hulse","Now, it's a distribution in excess of earnings for the quarter, and that catches us up. So distributions going forward will track with earnings as they have in the past.","Danilo Juvane","Got you. Last question for me, to the extent that you continue to see strong production out of the Bakken for liquids, any thoughts on a potential residue gas takeaway solution?","Kevin Burdick","I think I mean, clearly there, you know, it's something we're looking at, we're paying attention to, when you look at the capacity that's getting ready to come online across the basin. And, you know, we do believe we can continue to, in the basin we will continue to displace gas coming from Canada. But absolutely, there are conversations going on, you know, a variety of different outlooks and we're participating and all those conversations.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks, Kevin. Those are my questions.","Kevin Burdick","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Chris Sighinolfi, Jeffries.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hey, guys, good morning. Nice to see you in execution. Thanks for taking my questions. Well, I just want to circle back on that question Danilo had asked about Northern Border. Just for my own edification to understand is, I guess, what's the mechanism for that? This cash build at the JV and then you and your partner make the decision to pay that out on a periodic basis? ","Terry Spencer","Yes, to the extent that, overtime, we make a regular quarterly distribution, and to the extent the Management Committee believes that there's a capacity to do more than that. They have the ability to do it in one time basis. And that's what happened here. ","Chris Sighinolfi","And as it pertains to, DCF guidance and things of that nature, this was anticipated to fall this year. Is that also correct?","Terry Spencer","Well, I think that it's fair to say that, you know, as we -- the plans to do this kind of develops throughout the course of the year. So, you know, I think on a going forward basis, we would expect distributions more in line with where they have been on a quarter-by-quarter basis. ","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. All right, great. And then if I could switch and just, Kevin I wanted to touch base, you guys have done a really nice job continuing to contract up Arbuckle to seemingly every quarter we get another 20,000 or 25,000 barrels a day of commitments there. And I just wanted to better understand or just I guess, review and remind myself as to where the volume slate now for that pipeline will be sourced I guess between what said to it from Elk Creek what comes from the Mid-Con plants and then what comes from third parties, is there a rough rule of thumb at this point given all the incremental contracts that you have had?","Kevin Burdick","Well, I mean, it varies as we contract new plants. Obviously if you're getting a plant in the Mid-Continent and new contracted plant that's going to be tied, you know directly to Arbuckle II as we get a new Bakken plant if those barrels are going to all go all the way to Belvieu then that will be included in both Elk Creek and Arbuckle II. So that's how we break it down. I mean, you share any other thoughts on just in general how... ","Terry Spencer","I think that's right so definitely you can see that on a very macro sense of the difference between what we've contracted for Arbuckle II and what we've contracted for Elk Creek. That difference is definitely coming out and they call it. ","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And is it fair then if I look at just the table that you guys have long provided that looks at the bundled rates on your NGL rock feed service. If I -- like I guess what I want to be careful of doing is making sure I'm giving you enough credit and appropriate credit for each of these two assets, but not double counting volume that's moving on Elk Creek that subsequently moves down Arbuckle II. ","And so is it fair to just credit the Elk Creek volume with the bundled rate on the Bakken portion and then the incremental volume that I would see above that give that Mid-Continent rate. Is that fair way rule of thumb to think about it or would you advise me to do something different?","Terry Spencer","No, I think that's a fair way to think about it.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. Alright. Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Chris. Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Tristan Richardson, SunTrust.","Tristan Richardson","Good morning, guys. Just on the expansion project for Mid-Con frac capacity. You talked about that in prepared comments just about the heavier barrel. Is this purely really just optionality for you guys in the customer or just kind of curious could you talk about sort of the need for new capacity there relative to what the projects you have going on at Belvieu?","Terry Spencer","I think it just came down, a lot of it just came down to we had the ability as our teams looked at how we provide more fractionation capacity, but that was a low cost option for Williston and would drive the best return. With our other pipes, clearly we'll have the ability to move those purity products down to Belvieu once Arbuckle II is up. So we do get that optionality. But it really came down to where we look at where we could provide the lowest cost, most efficient frac capacity.","Tristan Richardson","Great. And then just to follow up on your -- appreciate your commentary on directionally where 2020 CapEx might stack up relative to 2019 range. Should we think about that as just sort of on the projects you have sanctioned today or does that contemplate other projects that you might be looking at that haven't necessarily been greenlit yet?","Terry Spencer","No, I think that our expectation given, everything that we see going forward, both what we've been able to announce. And we're thinking we have lower CapEx in 2020, then it will be in 2019.","Tristan Richardson","Appreciate it. Thank you guys very much.","Terry Spencer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Christine Cho, Barclays.","Christine Cho","Hi, everyone. Great quarter. What is the financial benefit going to be when rail and third party frac costs roll off? I'm assuming it's all off by first quarter next year when all your assets are online. But could you provide the cadence of the roll off between now and then as well?","Terry Spencer","Well, I guess what we talked about previously, the way to think about that is the barrels that have already rolled off rail, I think we said we save about $0.20 per gallon of transportation costs. So as we put more barrels on rail through the rest of this year, then the next step will be when the full pipeline is in place and all those rail barrels move to the pipe then you'll see another uplift at that point, along with other volumes coming from processing plants when the flare start getting put out when the processing capacity comes online. Did that answer your question, Christie? ","Christine Cho","Yeah, I guess. Okay, but you've moved 30,000 barrels per day off right now with the southern portion coming on. But you're still continuing to rail. So I guess and I'm guessing the rail is still going to increase throughout the end of this year. So at what point does that peak, like how much are you railing today and how much do you expect to rail at the peak between now and year-end?","Terry Spencer","Well the rail volume when we brought on the southern section, the rail volume at that point in time went to nearly zero. So we pulled pretty much everything down. And then that rail volume -- you have plants coming online between now and when Elk Creek comes and gets in service. So we will use rail, it will start building back up as volumes from those plants start coming online. So it will build back up and then once the full pipeline is in place, all of it will obviously move back over to the pipe. ","Christine Cho","Okay, got it. Christine. ","Sheridan Swords","Christine this is Sheridan. We think by the time we bring Elk Creek back off when we get the Northern section of Elk Creek completed, we will be railing upwards of 30,000 barrels a day again. ","Christine Cho","Okay. Super helpful. And then your contracted bubbles on Elk Creek is approaching capacity. Can you remind us, how long it would take to expand the pipeline, if you decide to do so. And also discuss at what point you would do that just given it's probably low cost and your numbers is too minimal ethane extraction, and I'm not sure at what point that might change?","Terry Spencer","We look at it continually. Clearly those projects aren't two-year projects like building the pipe. They're measured in terms of months, not years. And we also have the ability to do things like ordering Thompson [ph] and a lot of the long lead -- time of long lead equipment and other engineering things we can go ahead and do to prepare for that. So that it drives the time required to get that done again just a matter of months.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then last one for me there was an increase in Bakken processing volume, but your NGL pipeline volumes remained flat. What was the reason for that?","Terry Spencer","We just drove our ethane rejection just continued to drive deeper and deeper. So to get more throughput through the plants and remain the pipe, the NGL takeaway was at capacity. So we were able to, through our plants drive deeper rejection and run more inlet but not produce as much liquids.","Christine Cho","So, you are doing max rails to the quarter to then?","Terry Spencer","I mean towards the year, yes, but that we were pretty much at max rail.","Christine Cho","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Blum, Wells Fargo.","Michael Blum","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm curious, if you can just comment a little bit, obviously NGL prices have been pretty volatile. I was curious for your latest views on how you see things trending for the rest of the year and into 2020. And then kind of related to that, if you have any different or updated views on how the Conway to Belvieu spread is going to trend here for the rest of the year?","Sheridan Swords","Michael, this is Sheridan. I think as we look at the overall price, if you keep crude at the level it is today, you'll see a little uptick in prices. Obviously we're seeing more export capacity for propane come online, which should create more demand and you're seeing more crackers come online. That you should see some uptick in absolute price here through the end of the year and into 2020. Not a huge spike but I think you'll see some strength.","On the Conway to Belvieu spread right now, we think that where it is today is where it's going to be or in this range through the third quarter and start into the fourth quarter. Then you'll get into some seasonality issues that probably will bring that spread in a little tighter than it is today. Then of course, as we've said before, once we bring Arbuckle II online, that spread will go back to more what we have seen historically, which is much narrower than we have today. ","Michael Blum ","Okay, great. I appreciate that. And then just this recent slate of projects that you just announced. So we just think of their returns on those projects. Would you consider those to be kind of within the normal course of your typical return profile or those would be better, because some of them are kind of bolt-on in nature? How do we think about that? Thanks. ","Kevin Burdick","Yeah, I think -- Michael it is Kevin. I think the plant projects are going to be in our kind of our standard 4 to 6 times, but some of the other just expansions and frac expansions that we've talked about can be done at lower costs and new constructions are going to be better than that.","Michael Blum ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet, JP Morgan.","Q - Jeremy Tonet","Hi, good morning. I appreciate that you guys are not updating guidance at this point. But just curious within the G&P and the gas pipeline segments. It seems like you guys are trending quite strong versus the ranges that you put out there. Is there anything in the back half of the year that could kind of temper this trajectory or is kind of like the high-end or above the high-end, seems like it could be possible for those?","Chuck Kelley","Jeremy, this is Chuck. We can talk first about G&P. I think we could trend higher. It's going to come down through one our pipeline infrastructure, some of our field facilities come on. So it's a matter of timing, as we do towards the end of the year. And as you think about our gas pipe business, we've seen very good demand for our -- not only our interoperable volumes, but our balancing services and short-term storage services, which are kind of driving some incremental earnings that we hadn't necessarily planned on. So both of the segments are doing very well right now, demands up and we're just taking care of customers at this point.","Jeremy Tonet ","Great. That's helpful. And then, thinking about the balance sheet here, it seems like I think before the leverage is going to peak, I think at the beginning of 2020 with all the projects coming online. You've added some more to the backlog there and or you did more broad into what you're going to do? And just wondering how you see leverage, I guess, moving across 2020? Is that still the same peak or any color that you could provide on how that all comes together?","Terry Spencer","Well, Jeremy, our heaviest spending is definitely in the third and fourth quarter of '19. So when you enter in that first quarter, we've said that, with Elk Creek coming on in the fourth quarter and the volumetric disclosed, the guidance that we've put out there as it relates to our expectations of how quickly Elk Creek is going to build its volume around that 100,000 barrels, we're going to see a significant uplift in our EBITDA in the first quarter of 2020. And throughout 2020 and that's going to deliver us right from the get go in 2020. ","So, as we cross over the year, that'll be our peak. The projects that we've announced to date will be towards the back end of 2020 and into 2021 from a CapEx spend and will already be well down our road to delivering and in my prepared remarks, I gave you some thoughts on where we might end the year. So we're going to see in the same trajectory and still looking for some significant delivering going forward.","Jeremy Tonet ","That's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Dennis Coleman, Bank of America.","Dennis Coleman","Hi. Good morning, everyone. One for me with regard to the fracs, just I'm little interested in sort of this phasing of bringing on fracs or if I understand it, right. Can you just talk -- I don't really sort of have a concept of how you bring on a frac in stages. So maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how that's happening?","Kevin Burdick","Yeah, Dennis it's Kevin. Well, in this case with our complex down there, we had some spare capacity for somewhat I'd call it kind of utilities, some refrigeration, some heaters that are typically long lead equipment, long lead time type equipment items. And so we're able to leverage some existing spare capacity, we have to bring up the frac and kind of a partial mode. And then as we've installed the rest of that equipment, that's what we'll get it up to full capacity in '20. ","Dennis Coleman","Okay, so the vessel itself is there, and then just the -- so, I guess the follow on question is, if you're using up that capacity, would -- should we expect that to be a model for frac 5 as well?","Terry Spencer","We'll evaluate it. We may not have the same type of spare utilities, if you will for frac 5. But that's something obviously we'll take a look at a variety of different things to do but I wouldn't expect that to happen for the MB-5.","Dennis Coleman","Okay, okay. Thanks for that. And then -- I'm sorry about this, but just to go back to this Northern Border distribution, Danilo and Chris both hit on it, but this onetime payment, we should not -- that wasn't included in the guidance, correct? And so we should just use the guidance and sort of use this onetime payment and think of it that way. So if we add that in, we should think about the guidance is, you're going to be above the guidance?","Terry Spencer","It's fair to say that that was not included in the original guidance. ","Dennis Coleman","Perfect. That's what I need. Okay, that's it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Spiro Dounis, Credit Suisse.","Spiro Dounis","Hey. Good morning everyone. Just maybe going back to the 20% growth expectation for next year. I'm not sure we've seen you guys highlight that in a while here. Maybe not since the original guidance was provided. So getting the sense of that means you're getting pretty confident of that figure. So curious, how you are thinking about some of the underlying assumptions to get there maybe just around commodity differentials and some of the base business growth. You made some comments earlier just around the differential outlook. But if you just expand there in the context of that 20% growth next year?","Kevin Burdick","Yeah, this is Kevin. I mean, I think the obviously the huge driver, there is the backlog of flared gas and the inventory we talked about up in the Bakken. And when you think about to just kind of put the math to the 100,000 barrels a day that we expect on Elk Creek by the first quarter.","And you put that out over the course of the year, and then you've got a full Demicks Lake II plant running full for the entire year, you got Demicks II ramping up and then you've got growth on the Permian and Mid-Continent as well. But when you just go back to the 500 million cubic feet a day that's flaring in the Bakken across the basin, and the processing capacity that's coming online between now and the first quarter that just generates a significant amount of NGLs, which is the primary driver for the '20 number.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. And so if I'm hearing that, right, it sounds like there's no real major call being made here on [indiscernible] outside of that or any sort of commodity or differential move. Is that fair?","Terry Spencer","That's fair. In fact, we've been talking very openly as shared and mentioned, with Arbuckle-II we expect spreads to come back in much narrower than they are today. And that is included in that, that assumption is included in that 20% greater than 20%.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. Got it. Okay, appreciate that. And then maybe just more broadly, and how you're thinking about your Mid-Con footprint longer term? And, clearly the most of your growth is really focused outside that area. And I guess lately, producer commentary, there has been somewhat lukewarm. So just curious, what sort of optionality do you have around that footprint, maybe offset some potential volume headwinds, sort of pass-2019 or if you think that's even fair to be cautious on the Mid-Con at this point?","Terry Spencer","I think, just in general the Mid-Continent, like we remarked in our prepared remarks, the volumes have been in line with our expectations. Yeah, there may have been a couple producers that you've seen some things written that were off a little bit, but then you've been -- we've had some that have outperformed our expectations. And I think one of the things we continue to remind people is we have our own expectations, given the footprint and the size of our system, both in the G&P and the NGL side. So as we set our forecasts out there, we're factoring in all that information. So we feel good about it, and we do expect growth out of the Mid-Continent as we move forward. I mean, guys?","Chuck Kelley","We're still planning on hooking up another, two more plants in the Mid-Continent second half of this year. So we're still seeing some need for capacity. ","Sheridan Swords","And what I would add from model G&P standpoint would be, I think our well connect guidance that we gave, were trending as though we're going to exceed that, and I think we probably well this year.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. I appreciate that. Just one last quick one if I could and sorry if you guys touched on it, just around LPG exports, obviously has been considerable amount of new capacity announcements made recently. I imagine that factors into your market outlook. So just how you thinking about that now?","Kevin Burdick","I think when we think about LPG exports, we're going to continue to engage the market to understand what the market is and what's going on there. But what we're not going to do is go out there and do uneconomic project or just build something to say we have an export terminal. So we're continuing to use our capital disciplined, as we evaluate that, but we will always be involved in engaging the market on exports. And when we get to the time that we see that we have an economic project that we want to go forward and then we will we will go forward with that time.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. Appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from JR Weston, Raymond James.","JR Weston","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask real quick on Bakken G&P volumes. So far this year kind of relative to the guidance looks like you're tracking pretty well but it looks like you've got almost 60% of the well connects still expected second half of the year. So just kind of curious if there are other moving pieces in that guidance or if it seems like maybe you're tracking above expectations there. ","Terry Spencer","Well, I think we did lag early in the Q1 due to weather and there was let's face it, not only cold but there's a lot of snow. So it was difficult to get out there and connect wells. Second quarter we obviously strengthened and connected quite a few. I think the remainder the year we'll hit our guidance on our well connects some of that is just waiting on some capacity that certain compressor stations. So, I think we're in good shape to hit our guidance numbers for the year on our well connects and volume guidance.","JR Weston","That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Shneur Gershuni, UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good morning, guys. Maybe a couple quick follow ups here, just with respect to the guidance, I mean you sort of maintaining the 20%. But in your prepared remarks, you kind of emphasized greater than 20%, was the comment. Until a few days ago ethane has been under severe pressure. And if I remember correctly, you had a big ethane rejection reversal tailwind in the last two years. ","Your guidance when you originally set it out and saying the plus 20%, did that includes some reversal of the ethane rejection. And is that being offset by some better Elk Creek expectations, just kind of wondering what the moving parts have been positive and negative from the time you said it versus what you sit today. ","Terry Spencer","What I would say in when we look at the NGL volume growth in 2019 that has exceeded our expectations. For that is we probably have not seen quite as much ethane come out of rejection as we thought but we're seeing more ethane on our system than we thought from the growth in other areas. So we are seeing that offset a little bit. But dividing the big thing is we are seeing more volume growth than we thought we would see at this time. ","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And then secondly, with respect to announcing a third plant in the Williston, I was just wondering what your flexibility was around the spend in the in-service date, when I sort of look at the flaring numbers that you have out there on your slides for 300 MMCF a day on your acreage, sort of look at two plants, it sort of looks like it would take care of their flaring plus some growth. We've recently seen a big dip in Williston rig count, if that's just not moving around and that trend continues, do you have some flexibility around the spend to sort of push out the in-service date of this third plant? ","Kevin Burdick","Shneur, this is Kevin. I mean, yeah, technically, you would have that flexibility. But we see nothing right now that would cause us to do that. In fact, it's just the opposite, our customers are -- they need more capacity in this Dunn County area. The results they've seen and these are some large, well-capitalized producers with large acreage blocks, they want to drill this area out and the plants full. And the only reason they're not deploying more capital down there right now is because of capacity.","So we clearly see, this is a growth area for us. And we started off looking at a smaller expansion and the more color we got from producers, about their immediate plans, we continue to push it up and decided to put a 200 million a day expansion in.","Shneur Gershuni"," All right, that sounds great. Thank you very much. Appreciate the color guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jean Salisbury, Bernstein. ","Jean Salisbury","Good morning. Could you give us an estimate of how much ethane is being projected into Northern Border today, and what the maximum you think it can handle it?","Chuck Kelley","Yes, this is Chuck. Today there's roughly about 150,000 barrels a day of ethane going into Northern Border. We actually looked at this just the other day and the North Dakota pipeline authority has some information out at their website about it. With forecasts over time depending on the mix between Bakken gas and Canadian gas filling that pipe, you could see it as much as 180,000 to 200,000 barrels of ethane.","Jean Salisbury","Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then obviously, there's a lot of create pipelines that are running open seasons out of the Bakken. Just as a general question, do you usually find the [indiscernible] when they sign up for crude takeaway tend to parent with other takeaway like for example, if they signed a new 10 year contract for crude, would you expect them to be looking for NGL takeaway to match with that?","Chuck Kelley","Typically, we don't see that, where we see people come up need NGL takeaway capacity is when you're looking at building a new plant. So when they build the new plants when they'll secure the NGL takeaway capacity for that complete new plant, and then they'll grow into it as they -- on the crude on that side of it. So just because they signed up for a long crude term deal doesn't necessarily mean they're going to sign up for NGLs and vice versa. ","But you really got to look at when you start seeing more plants being announced they have either are going to sign up for NGLs or have already signed up for the NGL takeaway.","Jean Salisbury","Really helpful, thank you. That\u2019s all for me. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ethan Bellamy, Baird. ","Ethan Bellamy","Hey, good morning, all. There is some concern by investors that the Bakken may decline in the next three to five years what's your expectation for North Dakota volumes on your acreage longer-term?","Kevin Burdick","Again Ethan, this is Kevin. We continue to see growth, when you just look at the track record with rigs in that for 55 to 60 range for the basin. We have seen significant gas production growth and just remember that gas production is growing at a faster clip than crude production because of the GLR and the increases there. So there is a lot of positives about gas production, you look at some of the forecast out there. We believe there is definitely growth beyond that horizon you mentioned.","Ethan Bellamy","Okay. That\u2019s a good thing. My next\u2026","Kevin Burdick","Well beyond that. ","Ethan Bellamy","Sorry, go ahead. ","Kevin Burdick","No, I just said well beyond that.","Ethan Bellamy","Okay. Thank you. I was just going to ask it looks like we might need a new gas export pipe to handle that volume do you agree with that and is that a project you're getting?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. I think we definitely agree with that. And again, as we discussed earlier, there are a variety of projects being discussed in different avenues to get more residue out, but clearly if we stay on a growth trend, you were -- the basin is going to need some additional takeaway capacity over the next two, three, four years. ","Ethan Bellamy","Okay. Moving down the south. How has the decline in NGL prices impacted, if at all the rates and negotiations with customers for frac capacity?","Terry Spencer","It has not impacted them at all. We are going to reprice our services off of alternatives, also what the marketplace is. And remember that NGLs are byproduct, it needs to be taken away in areas people can't get the capacity, they are flaring with what they say. So the absolute price of the NGL does not have an impact on what we can charge for our services.","Ethan Bellamy","And market's still fairly tight?","Terry Spencer","Market's fractionation capacity is still pretty tight, there is a lot coming on. And pipeline capacity obviously tight because we're building new ones as we come on, as well. So yeah the market is still fairly tight in all areas. ","Ethan Bellamy","Okay. And then last question. There are a lot of assets on the market and a few whole partnership, what's your appetite for M&A here?","Terry Spencer","Ethan, this is Terry. Not very high, candidly, when you look at the gross laid of opportunities that we have going forward. When you think about it from an accretion standpoint, we are talking dollars a share and additional earnings to come to the Company over the next several years. We can really get that from strategic M&A. Now there may be some assets from time to time that we could buy with cash that could make some sense. But right now, we really don't see anything out there that's that compelling or valuations, in particular that makes sense particularly when you think about the alternative we have to invest organically. ","Ethan Bellamy","Okay. Thanks you all. Much appreciated. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers. ","Craig Shere","Good morning. Congratulations on another great quarter.","Terry Spencer","Thanks.","Kevin Burdick","Thanks Craig.","Craig Shere","On the G&P unit fee based margins, that look to be a record in the second quarter.","Is that sustainable and what's driving that? ","Chuck Kelley","Craig, this is Chuck. We guided to $0.90 to $0.95, we are at $0.93 today. Obviously, with more Bakken gas coming out, it's higher margin relative to our Mid-Con business so that\u2019s part of the driver. In addition to that you get in the contract mix, different producers we have different fees. And so is it sustainable? I think we are solid in there range.","Craig Shere","Okay, great. And I just want to understand all the system integration gives and takes as it relates to Arbuckle II and possible modularity of your system, if I could describe it that way, currently you are coming out of 400,000 and then you have an increase of 5,000 a day. You contracted 375 [ph], but if you switched Sterling III purity product, any excess wide grade that hasn't been fractionated would have to go to Arbuckle II, and then you may wind up putting all the growth this thing in West Texas LPG into the Southern Leg of Arbuckle II. So I'm just trying to think through how quickly the entire system can fill up?","Terry Spencer","Well, that is a good question. We continue to look at how fast can you fill up and we're, as we said, we can add pumps fairly quickly as we go forward. But you're right, we -- if I go back to the original start of your question, the modularity and the optionality we have through our system gives us a lot of flexibility. And the first one is, is actually Sterling III is on royalty today, we will take all Sterling III's raw feed, put it on Arbuckle and open that up for purities and that's why we believe the spreads we can come when they'll be will come together.","And then we will take -- we think hopefully very quickly will take Arbuckle up to 1 million barrels if all the capacity comes online as we think it's going to come online we see into the future. But we still think above that will -- we will put the pumps and go to 1 million barrels. We still have some headroom to breach that million barrels that we have not contracted for today. But we should be in the upper end of Arbuckle II and full pipelines are a good thing. And if we need to build another pipeline because we see that kind of volume come out, we'll build another pipeline.","Craig Shere","So shared in a couple questions the northern section of Arbuckle II isn't the same capacity as the southern section right? So if you do take West Texas volumes and go to 1 million barrels the Canton [ph] the Northern section, right?","Terry Spencer","The Northern section can do 600,000 barrels and the Southern section can do 1 million barrels. So that leads -- and West Texas pipeline is going to come in right where Arbuckle II transitions from a 24 inch or 600,000 barrels to a 30 inch or 1 million barrels. ","So that leads 400,000 barrels a day that's open for West Texas to sale that does not impact the volume coming down from the north. And that's how the system was designed. That was our plan in the beginning. So you can -- we are anticipating we could see upwards of 400,000 barrels come off West Texas and go on to Arbuckle II. ","Craig Shere","And then if I understand it that would free the southern section of West Texas for potential crude service?","Terry Spencer","That's correct. Or as we continue to get to 400,000 barrels a day on West Texas, we're going to have to have a complete new line out of the Permian to Arbuckle II which would free up West Texas from the Permian -- the legacy West Texas system from the Permian to the Gulf Coast to us for some other service, which would include crude. ","Craig Shere","I see. And moving the wide range from Sterling III to West Texas, I'm sorry, to Arbuckle II that's got nothing to do with a 375 [ph] a day of contract it up. The 375 is all incremental to what you have today, right? And then moving capacity over to take advantage of the purity product is just extra.","Terry Spencer","That is correct. The 375 is -- does not include the volume that's moving on Sterling III today.","Craig Shere","Right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Sunil Sibal, Seaport Global Securities.","Sunil Sibal","Yes, hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for all the clarity on the call. Just one quick question on the G&P segment. Obviously, the results were fairly strong and I noticed that your OpEx in that segment actually fell sequentially as well, as much as last year despite a decent pick up in volumes. I'm just curious is there anything going on there or -- I know sometimes commodity prices, especially the gas prices kind of impact that OpEx. So I just find a little bit clarity on that.","Chuck Kelley","Yes, this is, Chuck. No, the -- sequentially we are about $6 million lower and pretty much just due to timing between the quarters. So if you average those two quarters together, run rate might be a little bit higher as we as we progress towards Demicks I and II, bringing on more employees and more field cost, but that's pretty much -- those are good numbers for the year.","Sunil Sibal ","Okay. And gas is more like a pass through costs that natural gas prices don't really impact that number, correct?","Chuck Kelley","No, it does not impact that number.","Sunil Sibal ","Okay, thanks for that. And then just trying to understand a little bit better on the LPG export side of things. From what I've been hearing, obviously, there've been a number of dock expansions coming online, which seems like maybe some constraints in moving those LPG volumes to the end customers, ultimately. I was curious if you have a view on that? And also, is there some way that -- and you're talking to customers on the LPG side, so in some way for you guys who taken get an opportunity out of that. ","Terry Spencer","I mean, again, as Sheridan kind of alluded to on the dock question. Yeah, there have been announcements out there, there's more capacity that's going to be announced. We do see some of the short term rates or spot rates have been pushed down. But like Sheridan mentioned, I think the key is, as we talk to customers, we're looking longer term, we're looking for rates are going to the economically justify a project. And that's the way we'll approach it.","Sunil Sibal","Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. ","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. How you guys thinking about what a 2021 step up looks like versus 2020? I mean you've got a lot of projects that come online in \u201820. And trying to think about how much that 20% plus captures that for 2020 versus what drives a \u201821 step up? ","Terry Spencer","Michael, I think that we're definitely not going to give you 2021 guidance, and we're stepping out a little further than we usually do and give you to an outlook on 2020. So you're going to have to do your own work here. But if you just take the capital that we're investing and recognize that we're in the same multiple in some of these incremental projects or even at better multiples, 2021 is looking pretty good too.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Do you still assume a 4 to 6 times multiple on most of these projects, or do you think some can even be better than that once you get a full run rate?","Terry Spencer","Well, I think the frac is a perfect example of putting -- adding capacity at about half the price of build is definitely better than a 4 to 6 multiple.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay, guys, thank you. Much appreciated.","Terry Spencer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you very much. Speakers, at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. ","Terry Spencer","All right. Well, thank you, everyone. Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in early October, and extends until we release earnings in late October. We will provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and the IR team will be available throughout the day for your questions. Have a good week. ","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen at this time, this now concludes our conference. You may disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of week. Thank you.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to your host to Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir.","T.D. Eureste","Thank you and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934.","Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.","Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thank you, T.D. Good morning and thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phil May, Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines.","As a reminder, key financial and operational information has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 websites. Please refer to this presentation and to the earnings releases for various explanation and key metrics.","Before we discuss our third quarter and operational updates I would like to reiterate our continued confidence in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ending the year within our 2015 guidance ranges. Additionally, we expect ONEOK partners to maintain 2016 distribution coverage of greater than 1.0 times and to significantly reduce our commodity exposure in the Gathering and Processing segment, as we remain confident in completing substantially all of our renegotiations on Williston Basin contracts in 2015, which we expect will increase our fee-based margin in the segment to more than 70% in 2016, up from approximately 50% in 2015.","As we outlined our 2015 financial and volume growth expectations earlier in the year, we emphasize that the partnership\u2019s volumes and earnings will be weighted towards the second-half of the year. We saw this growth in the third quarter as we continue to see earnings growth sequentially and we reached record volumes in the Gathering and Processing segment, and Natural Gas Liquids segment in September.","Even in these challenging market conditions our well-positioned 36,000 mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids pipeline network is providing growth opportunities in basins where we operate. We\u2019re executing on these opportunities by continuing to focus primarily on organic growth projects and initiatives that reduce or commodity exposure and make long-term economic and strategic sense for our business.","Before I can give an update on our three segments, I would now turn the call over to Derek for a brief discussion of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners financials. Derek?","Derek Reiners","Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, our 2015 EBITDA contribution continues to increase sequentially as anticipated. We expect EBITDA to once again be higher in the fourth quarter 2015 and to be within our 2015 financial guidance EBITDA range for the year.","The partnerships\u2019 third quarter EBITDA of just over $400 million increased 4% compared with the same period in 2014, in spite of a nearly 67% drop in NGL prices. For the third quarter, coverage ratio improved to 0.91 times coverage, a substantial improvement when you consider the increased number of units outstanding following our large equity offering in August.","We did accelerate the timing of the issuance from our original plans. Additionally, the partnership\u2019s third quarter EBITDA and coverage ratio were impacted negatively by approximately $16 million in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, and Natural Gas Liquids segments combined, due to unplanned operational outages at the partnership\u2019s natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the Williston Basin.","Terry will provide more detail on this in his remarks.","The partnership has a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our current capital program, including access to our commercial paper program and credit facility. Leverage is also reduced with higher EBITDA and the recent equity issuance. As of September 30, ONEOK partners had an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.3.","The partnership remains committed to its investment-grade credit rating and will continue to make prudent financial decisions to protect the balance sheet. In August, the partnership raised $750 million of equity from ONEOK and funds managed by Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, one of the partnership\u2019s largest institutional unitholders.","This equity issuance fulfilled the partnership\u2019s 2015 equity needs and is expected to satisfy equity needs well into 2016. Before we move on to ONEOK, I\u2019d like to point out our reduced commodity price sensitivity resulting from the contract restructuring efforts in our gathering and processing segment. As we restructure contracts to more fee-based arrangements our exposure to commodity prices will be reduced.","As a result of the restructuring, we have realigned the partnership\u2019s natural gas volumes hedged to reflect the revised natural gas equity volumes expected in 2016, and have provided updated hedging tables and sensitivities in the news release.","At ONEOK our liquidity remains strong with all of our $300 million credit facility available and a very strong third quarter dividend coverage ratio of 1.34 times. ONEOK increased its investment in the partnership by using proceeds from a $500 million notes offering and cash on hand to purchase $650 million of ONEOK Partners\u2019 units.","ONEOK also contributed approximately $15 million to maintain its 2% general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. With the increased ownership percentage in ONEOK Partners and at the current distribution levels, annual distributions received from the partnership are expected to increase by more than $100 million.","In October, ONEOK increased its dividend by $0.01 per share or 2% to $0.615 cents per share, resulting in an annualized dividend of $2.46 per share. ONEOK\u2019s decision to increase the dividend reflects the partnership\u2019s expected natural gas liquids and natural gas volume growth, the success in re-contracting efforts, and the recent investment in ONEOK Partners.","We continue to have confidence in the partnership\u2019s ability to execute its growth strategies, allowing ONEOK to enhance its dividend. This concludes my remarks. Terry will now take a closer look at each of our business segments. Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thank you, Derek. Starting with our natural gas liquids segment, the segment continued its earnings growth over the second quarter 2015 as natural gas liquids volumes increased in our highest margin areas. We continue to see strong natural gas liquids volume growth in the Williston Basin and in the Mid-Continent\u2019s Cana-Woodford Shale, Stack and SCOOP areas.","In the Williston Basin, we are reaching record natural gas liquids, gathered volumes quicker than we had originally expected, and increased the amount Bakken NGL pipeline volumes we expect to reach in the fourth quarter by 10,000 barrels per day from our previous target. In the Mid-Continent we\u2019ve increased the fourth quarter NGL gathered volume we expect to reach by 40,000 barrels per day from our previous target. This increase represents spot volumes we anticipate in order to meet customer needs in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to our fractionated volumes, we continue to see increased ethane fractionated due to decreased ethane rejection in the Williston Basin in the third quarter. And we expect decreased levels of ethane rejection to continue. We also saw more than 23,000 barrels per day of incremental spot volumes on our system in the third quarter as we were able to utilize our fractionation assets to meet customer demand.","We expect to see increased levels of incremental spot volume on our system throughout the remainder of the year and expect to reach approximately 645,000 barrels per day fractionated in the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 65,000 barrels per day from our previous target, of which approximately 40,000 barrels per day are spot volumes.","And finally, in recent weeks we have seen Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials range from $0.02 to $0.03 per gallon and we expect this range to continue for the remainder of this year.","Our Natural Gas Pipelines business continues to provide the partnership with primarily fee-based earnings in long-term firm demand contracts. As of the third quarter, this segment was approximately 97% fee-based, with additional move primarily fee-based projects underway.","One of these new projects is the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project, which reached an important milestone this quarter when it received approval for a presidential permit and authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The permit allows for the construction and operation of the border-crossing pipeline, which will export natural gas from the Permian Basin in west Texas to Mexico. Construction is underway and we still expect the first phase to be complete during the first quarter 2016.","The natural gas gathering and processing segments third quarter results increased sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter 2015 and we expect a very strong fourth quarter. We already hit record volumes in September in the Williston Basin and our largest producer in the Mid-Continent is making progress completing wells drilled in the first half of the year.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the Williston Basin. Starting off with well connects, we connected more than 720 wells through the third quarter, exceeding our original 2015 target of 700 wells. We are increasing our 2015 well connect target to 825 wells by year-end, which will bring additional volumes to our system in the remainder of 2015 and into 2016.","We are reaching record natural gas gathered volumes quicker than we had originally expected. These volumes are the result of multiple factors, including increased well connects, the completion of three of our six compression projects, continued improvements in well performance, and the inventory of flared gas available to capture on our acreage dedication.","We saw natural gas gathered volumes reached 685 million cubic feet per day in September, which we previously expected to reach in the fourth quarter. We now expect to reach 710 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter in advance of our 200 million cubic foot per day Lonesome Creek plant coming online.","In North Dakota, we continue to actively participate on the flaring task force, which provides policy and flaring target recommendations to the North Dakota Industrial Commission, or the NDIC. The NDIC recently passed updated gas capture percentages and timing, as well as providing a 90-day bank concept for producers who exceed the gas capture targets. These changes are not expected to have a material impact on our volume growth into 2016. While we continue to estimate 145 million cubic feet per day of flared gas on our acreage dedications, we expect that the additional capacity from our Lonesome Creek and Bear Creek plants and associated pipelines and compression projects will deliver the necessary infrastructure to assist our customers in staying well above the NDIC gas capture targets.","In the Mid-Continent, our largest producer in the Cana-Woodford did experience minor timing delays in well completion. However, we continue to be on track to reach 910 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. With another quarter complete, we have continued confidence in the success of our contract restructuring efforts. We have renegotiated many contracts to significantly increase the fee-based components and continue to actively work with our producers to similarly restructure additional contracts.","We are starting to see the average fee rate increase in our financial results. For the third quarter, the segment reported a $0.43 average fee rate, which is nearly a 20% increase compared with a year ago. We expect this rate to significantly increase as we complete substantially all of our Williston Basin contract renegotiations in 2015 and receive the full benefit of the increased fee-based margins in 2016.","Operationally, we expect our Lonesome Creek plant to be completed by the end of this month, and as we complete the startup process, we expect the facility to start ramping up in mid-December. We also expect to complete the remaining three compressor stations in the fourth quarter, which will provide the infrastructure for Lonesome Creek to be approximately half-full by the second quarter 2016.","As I already pointed out, our natural gas volumes are at record highs earlier than anticipated. This is the result of both new and existing wells performing better than anyone anticipated in the Williston Basin and our seasoned operators working diligently to maximize our assets not only in the Williston, but across our 36,000-mile integrated system. Our company has a history of operating safely and reliably. However, the occasional mechanical-related outage will occur, resulting in downtime.","As mentioned previously, we did experience some unplanned operational outages this quarter at several of our natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the Williston Basin, which were resolved. This downtime allowed us to complete work that will help us further improve our mechanical reliability and runtime.","The Partnership\u2019s volume growth through the first nine months of the year has provided us the ability to increase the target natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes we expect to reach in the fourth quarter. And as we have seen our volume expectations met and in some cases exceeded, we have been able to confidently reaffirm our financial guidance ranges for 2015. Our volume growth through the end of 2015, combined with the success we have had converting portions of our commodity-exposed margin to fee-based earnings, is positively positioning our business through these challenging times.","Before I finish with our opening remarks, I would like to comment on another topic relating to the notion of a C-Corp general partner acquiring the master limited partnership it controls, also commonly referred to as a rollup transaction. We have seen a number of these rollups either announced or completed over the past year and we continue to field questions regarding our interest level in pursuing such a transaction.","As I\u2019ve stated a number of times in the past, we remain focused on executing our key strategies to enhance shareholder and unitholder value by, among other things, reducing commodity price exposure, improving margins, enhancing our cost of capital, and growing earnings while providing quality services to our customers. Additionally, we continue to evaluate structural alternatives and strategic acquisition opportunities that may or may not make sense for us.","The idea of a rollup of ONEOK Partners into ONEOK is one such alternative that we continue to evaluate, while monitoring the various announced rollup transactions for relevant market data and commentary. As I have said before, our current structure continues to serve us well and remain committed to investors at both ONEOK and at the Partnership to create value and reduce risk. In December, we plan to provide ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 preliminary financial and volume guidance expectations for 2016.","As always, thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and thank you to our dedicated employees for your hard work and continued commitment to our company. Your innovative ideas and reliable operations continue to strengthen our business and allow us to better serve our customers while navigating these uncertain times.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll take our first question from Eric Genco with Citigroup.","Eric Genco","Hi. Congrats on the progress on the POP to fee negotiations. It is good to see some of those benefits trickling in ahead of 2016.","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Eric.","Eric Genco","That said, I just want to focus a little bit on the outage and the volume outlook you provided kind of over the last two quarters in the earnings presentation, and I mostly just want to make sure that I\u2019m not misinterpreting some of these numbers so I don\u2019t accidentally set a bar a little too high on some of them. If you look at the 3Q NGL gathered volume numbers through-786 [ph], versus the ones on Page 4 of the PowerPoint, I assume that the delta there has to do with the outage. And I just want to see, as we look into some of the 4Q numbers that you\u2019re talking about in terms of being reached, how you think that should compare with sort of an average number, particularly as you\u2019re kind of including some spot volumes in there?","Sheridan Swords","Obviously, the reach number is actually what we anticipate we will max at, the max volume we will get on our system, not an average. So the average will be less than that over the quarter and the spot volumes are not for the whole quarter. They\u2019re only for a certain period of the quarter. So, you will see it down on average.","Eric Genco","Okay. I mean, is it of order of magnitude similar to what we saw in the third quarter or is there some way that you can provide that or - because I just feel like sometimes if that is sitting there, then people may sort of interpret that and just want to try to get a sense for how to triangulate that.","Sheridan Swords","I would say it\u2019s probably - our gathered volume is probably maybe around 5%. The average is 5% down from the peak.","Eric Genco","Okay, all right, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, I guess, next so I was interested in, I guess, maintenance CapEx is tracking below the full-year guidance of 142. Should we expect a major catch-up in 4Q? Or is 142 is still the right number, that would kind of imply 4Q maintenance CapEx at double the rate of the first nine months. Is that reasonable or how should we be thinking about that?","Derek Reiners","This is Derek. We are expecting maintenance capital to be a little bit lower than the $142 million that we previously guided. I think we\u2019re looking about $130 million. That\u2019s lower mostly just due to timing as well as being able to get the projects done a bit less costly than we had previously indicated just based on cost compression primarily.","Eric Genco","Okay. All right, well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Congrats.","Terry Spencer","Yes. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","We\u2019ll next hear from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","Hi, everyone. Congrats on a good quarter. You are - I wanted to talk about your well connects first. You guys are connecting 125 more wells than originally anticipated earlier this year. It looks like the DUCs are also continuing to grow, yet rig count has fallen substantially. We all hear about oil services guys doing more with less. Do you have any productivity metrics you can share with us, maybe, how many days it takes to drill and complete a well back now versus January?","Terry Spencer","Yes Christine. Yes, we do. I mean, maybe not specific to January but most definitely we see efficiencies really at all levels when you think about the producers and what they\u2019re able to accomplish especially in the Williston. From a rig efficiency perspective if you think historically over maybe couple years ago they were drilling, each rig would be able to drill 12 to 14 wells per year now they\u2019re up on average maybe in the 18 to 20 wells per year range.","Cost reductions have been consistent across producers in the 20% to 30% range as they\u2019re able to lower the cost to drilling complete wells and then just the performance the completion technologies that are used now we\u2019re seeing 30% to 40% improvements in IP rates over the last six to 12 months. So, the combination of all those factors really absolutely, they\u2019re able to do more or less.","Christine Cho","Okay great. And then on the west Texas LPG pipeline volumes it look like those were revised lower for the fourth quarter versus what you guided us towards last quarter. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on there is the production behind your system is slowing or is there something else? I\u2019m just a little surprised, it\u2019s come down given I thought you guys have the cheapest rate in the region and also what do you do for the timing of the expansions for the pipeline?","Terry Spencer","Kristine, what I would say is that the main reason we dropped that down is we\u2019re not seeing the short-haul volume out in west Texas we had anticipated it would come on. Now, that\u2019s our lowest margin volume out there so it is just going from certain spot in west Texas to other spot in west Texas. And here, we did see a slight reduction in long-haul volumes when we increased our rates and on the subject of lowest rates in the region in July, we increased our rates up there and brought them more in line with markets. And so, that\u2019s why we saw little bit of this movement on the short-haul volume.","Christine Cho","Does that change the - you\u2019re thinking about the expansions on the pipe?","Terry Spencer","The expansions will be driven by now, the expansions are driven by new plants being put on out there and we\u2019re still in active negotiations with processors out there to back that expansion and they\u2019re still going well. So, I don\u2019t think that has any impact on our expansions. Mainly, our expansion would be a long-haul expansion not have anything to do with the short-haul volume.","Christine Cho","Okay. When do you expect the pipeline to be expanded, just on your current conversations?","Terry Spencer","As when we get the ink on paper, but we\u2019re probably looking into 2017.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then, I just wanted to go to your comments on the spot volumes. It looks like you guys are seeing some on the NGL system, the gathering, and also fractionation volumes. What is driving this exactly and why would this go away in 2016?","Terry Spencer","Well, the spot volumes are being driven by some frac outages in Mont Belvieu and also volume that is anticipating some new fracs being come on that will come on in the later 4Q. So, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t think it will be into 2016, this specific one. Now, we do see some opportunities from some spot volume in first quarter that it would be different spot volume, but it\u2019s really just volume that has a home, but unfortunately the frac feeder had some issues or the frac is not up yet.","Christine Cho","Okay, and then lastly, at the parent level when I think about the dividend, you guys are going to see increased cash flow from higher LP unit count and NGP, but how should we think about the increases for the parent? You guys talk about navigating through uncertain times. How should we think about how much you want to keep on the balance sheet just in case you guys do have to help out OKS again next year if things don\u2019t materially improve?","Derek Reiners","Yes Christine, this is Derek. Really, no change in our stance here as we did earlier in the year we still expect to retain additional cash at ONEOK as we go through this on certain times, there is value to that and having optionality down the road. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect a big change at this point in our approach.","Terry Spencer","And Christine this is Terry. We\u2019ll discontinue to look at it quarter-to-quarter as we said in the past the environment continues to be very uncertain. And so, really in that respect nothing changed. So, I guess we continue to look at it quarter-to-quarter and assist the market environment.","Christine Cho","Okay. Thank you for all the color.","Terry Spencer","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move on to Craig Schere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Schere","Good morning. Congratulations on\u2026","Terry Spencer","Hey, Craig.","Craig Schere","Good volume guidance here. So on Christine\u2019s question about drivers for increased well connects, do you see some of this better two-half performance working down the flaring versus what you originally anticipated by year-end?","Kevin Burdick","Well, as I think about well connect this is Kevin. We think about well connects lot of the increase the increase is really driven. We had really higher than expectations early in the year with the well connects. As we move forward and we think about the well connects for the rest of this year yes, those will connect wells that will be coming on line some point the near future and it\u2019s the combination of those, but then also when we get the infrastructure in place we will have the, that\u2019s really what will pull the flaring numbers down if that is getting at your question.","Craig Schere","Okay. So when those plants come online, that\u2019s still available there. My concern was that we aren\u2019t missing out on that buffer there. We are not counting what might be hitting in 2016 and the second half 2015 is what I\u2019m getting at.","Terry Spencer","I guess on we struggle a little bit. We think about the, it\u2019s the combination of the well connects in the flared gas, we don\u2019t necessarily bucket the well connects is going to put up the flares as we put more infrastructure in place with our three more compressor stations in fourth quarter and the Lonesome Creek plant as we connect new wells as the drill completed backlog comes down that infrastructure will be there to capture the volumes. So, we absolutely expect our flaring, our gas capture to go up and our flare percentage to go down, does that answer your question Craig?","Craig Schere","Yes, I think that does. And can you provide some more details about the ethane recovery? Is that increasing off the 20,000 a day that started in June?","Terry Spencer","The ethane recovery out of the Bakken is running about 22,000 barrels a day.","Craig Schere","Okay. And we\u2019re making a lot of great headway on the contractor structuring in the Bakken obviously, you had a lot of leverage there, because the wet gas is very small portion of wells and you needed to get those wells in compliance. How do you see prospects from a continent contractor structures?","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin here. The Williston the Bakken gets a lot of focus as we talk about contracting efforts, but we\u2019re making great progress in Oklahoma as well it is obviously a much different competitive landscape. As we think about the producers there and we\u2019ve got a different customer mix when we think about dealing there is a lot more contracts with smaller volumes and so, but we\u2019re actively pursuing opportunities to convert more of our margin to fee based in the Mid-Continent, just like we are in the Williston.","Terry Spencer","Craig, the only thing I want to add to that is that the thing you have to understand is the Williston basin there is only about 10 contracts they represented 75% of our line. So, we\u2019re not talking about hundreds of contracts when you go to the Mid-Continent though you are talking about hundreds and hundreds of contracts. And so, from a pragmatic standpoint or practical standpoint as you look forward we\u2019re trying to restructure contracts in the Mid-Continent as we\u2019re doing in the Williston you got some, you just got a lot more contracts lot more producers and the volumes under those contracts are much smaller. So, it create some practical challenges in terms of trying to get that done obviously, and that\u2019s in addition to the competitive landscape is the point that Kevin brought up.","Craig Schere","Understood. And last question, given the increasing prospects out of the Bakken and the volume guidance rising, what are the prospects for bringing back onto the table some of the deferred projects up there? Particularly given the needs that are only extended, I think, a few months versus originally I was thinking maybe a couple years in terms of that flaring compliance, it seems the producers don\u2019t have forever to wait on these decisions.","Terry Spencer","Yes Craig. As we said in the past on these suspended projects if we could see sustained prices crude oil prices in that $65, $70 range there is a good likelihood that drilling will stimulate and the demand for that capacity will come back. And so, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it right now. We\u2019re not there obviously in this current environment we\u2019re not there yet, but certainly we\u2019re hopeful that we can\u2019t get there and clearly our view is that prices will improve the trick, obviously is how much and when. But yes, if we can see that $65 to $70 barrel range. I think it\u2019s very likely we could kick those projects back on.","Craig Schere","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move on to Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank.","Kristina Kazarian","Hi guys. Nice job on the increase in operating income number from contract mix.","Terry Spencer","Thanks.","Kristina Kazarian","Quick question, though, Terry, I know you mentioned expecting substantially all of these to be renegotiated. Can you just help me think about the uplift relative to where we are in the process? So, say we\u2019re at 10, have two changed or is it more like we\u2019re at the point of eight now?","Terry Spencer","Well actually, I will let Kevin handle that question Kristina.","Kevin Burdick","Well, with that getting into specifics we have made a lot of progress I think you are seeing some of that already reflected in our financials, I would expect to see continued improvements in the fourth quarter and then the full effect will get in 2016, but we are at or ahead of really where we expected to be in that process as we move towards the end of the year.","Terry Spencer","The only thing I would add to that Kristina is the negotiations have gone well the producers absolutely they need the services, they need other features that they currently don\u2019t have in their contracts discussions their negotiations who have been very constructive and we\u2019re well down the road to getting this all wrapped up by the end of the year. So, progress is good and discussions have been very positive.","Kristina Kazarian","Great. And then, can you guys help me - walk me through the one-time coverage for calendar-year 2016 guidance? How do you guys get there? What should I be thinking about in terms of - I know you haven\u2019t given formal 2016 guidance yet, but like commodity growth assumptions that go into that? Is it like, for the entire year one times coverage or is it hit this at some point in calendar-year 2016? Anything there would be great.","Terry Spencer","Yes, Kristina. Yes, we have every intention of providing in early to mid-December our 2016 outlook, so we will have a lot of that information for you in terms of volumes. Now we have already provided some volume transparency for 2016, but we will have - in December of this year, we will have all that put together and for guidance purposes and we will have - we will release that mid-December or so.","Kristina Kazarian","Thank you there, and then lastly for me, can you just give an update on the balance sheet and how conversations are going with the rating agencies, especially at the OKS level?","Derek Reiners","Yes, Kristina, this is Derek. Certainly, we have conversations with the agencies. They\u2019re aware of our strategies and particular contract renegotiations that we\u2019ve talked about, and they certainly see our progress there. I think my view is the agencies, like the rest of us, are concerned about commodity prices longer term, so they\u2019re looking to see us continue to progress as we reduce our commodity exposure. So I think all that is going well, they understand where we are. Of course, we placed the equity this quarter, so our leverage is coming down, which is good. So I think all those things are positives for us.","Kristina Kazarian","Okay, thanks, guys. Nice job today.","Derek Reiners","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll move onto Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Jeremy.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. This is actually Chris on for Jeremy. Congrats on the strong quarter.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Chris.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. So my question was - my first question is on contract restructuring. So you guys already had G&P volumes or G&P average fee rates increased about 20% in 3Q. And so, I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding of how that run rate is going to change going into the fourth quarter and how much potential upside there is looking into 2016?","Kevin Burdick","Jeremy, this is Kevin. As we - like I just mentioned, as we move into the fourth quarter, yes, you would expect to continue to see that fee rate to improve and go up, and even further as we move into 2016. We\u2019ve given the margin mix, what we expect of a 70% \u2013more than 70% fee in 2016, but beyond that, getting into specific margins, we will see more as we issue our guidance coming up.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And so you guys noted that the Williston\u2019s contract restructurings should be done by year-end, so could we think of 3Q as maybe more than 50% baked in or?","Kevin Burdick","I will just go back to my previous remarks that as we move forward through this, we\u2019re where we are at or where we expected we would be at this point, and we still feel very confident that we are going to get those substantially all complete by the end of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess on Bakken flaring, I guess you have seen some regulations pushed back, and so do you see any additional risks to potential regulatory changes there?","Kevin Burdick","No, we don\u2019t, I mean as we think about the gas capture targets as we bring on our Lonesome Creek facility, that is going to - there will be a step change as we think about our gas capture behind our system, and then with Bear Creek coming online in the third quarter of 2016, we will see another step change down, and that kind of lines up with the gas capture target increases, so we feel very good about being able to provide the services so that our customers will stay well above that.","Unidentified Analyst","And then on your natural gas liquids pipeline operating margins per barrel, those slightly declined over the quarter. And so, Bakken actually was increased as a percentage of the volume pie and so I was just trying to get an understanding of the drivers there.","Derek Reiners","The decrease in the margin.","Unidentified Analyst","Correct.","Derek Reiners","We\u2019ve had more volume come out of the Powder River. We have had some increased volume come out of the Powder River. We\u2019ve had some increase of volume out of the Powder River portion which has a lower fee on those barrels. And then, we have had some other volumes come on that have some Conway pricing. So they don\u2019t have some highest margin as well, so it\u2019s - that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s driving that down just slightly.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That makes sense. I think that\u2019s it for me. Thanks guys. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move on to Becca Followill with US Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","Hey, guys.","Terry Spencer","Hey, Becca.","Derek Reiners","Hey, Becca.","Becca Followill","On back on the Bakken and Williston re-contracting, I know that you value your customer relationships dearly, but can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s impacted by effectively raising the rates and how the new rates compare with some competitors in the region? Are you still competitive or does it hurt long-term relationships?","Terry Spencer","Well, let me just make a general comment, Becca. No, we don\u2019t believe that will. As an industry, we have been through this cycle many times and we have been through these - we went through this cycle in the early 2000 timeframe, renegotiating keep-whole contracts actually the POPs, in many cases. And so, now, here we are today. So, those relationships, yes, anytime you go through the contract renegotiation effort it can create some stress on a relationship. But the fact of the matter is that the producers value quality service.","And as long as we continue to provide quality service, our relationships are going to be good. And that\u2019s what we have done up there. There is nobody else up in the basin that really can provide that broad range of service that we provide, which includes the natural gas liquids in addition to the gathering and processing services we provide. So we\u2019re differentiated in that respect. And not only from the quality of services but obviously our sheer size.","So, really no, we have worked - we could have taken an approach that was much more abrupt, but we have chosen to take a very positive and proactive approach, giving the producers the opportunity to talk with us and tell us what their specific needs are. And so it\u2019s - so it\u2019s been a fairly long process throughout this year, and I think our producers appreciate that positive dialogue. So no, we don\u2019t believe that our producer relationships have been damaged or set back in any way.","Becca Followill","Thank you. And then, great volume guidance for the fourth quarter and then going into 2016, but, of course, we always want more. So much of 2015 and 2016 was driven by the flaring capture and new plants coming online and compression. But, do you have any preliminary outlook for 2017 if we are in a sustained $45 to $50 oil price environment?","Terry Spencer","Yes. Actually, Becca, no, we have not provided that publicly. We continue to - our belief is that the environment is going to get much better. And as we see production turnover start to happen, I think it\u2019s going to be very abrupt as we move into, when I say production I\u2019m talking about crude oil from macro perspective. So really, we don\u2019t see that $40 environment sustaining out into that period of time. That\u2019s probably as aggressive this will get on an outlook that far out. But we really not have provided any sort of public guidance in 2017 yet.","The outlook for 2016 still looks very solid and so we don\u2019t see - we don\u2019t expect any sort of significant downturn as we move to the latter part of the year, which would set you up for a lower 2017. We really don\u2019t see that.","Becca Followill","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Terry Spencer","You bet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mr. Eureste, we have no further questions at this time.

John?","John W. Gibson","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, and many thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me today are Derek Reiners, our newly named Chief Financial Officer, who will review our quarterly results and revised 2013 and year -- 3-year earnings guidance; Terry Spencer, our President, who will review our operating performance, update you on the partnership's growth projects, which are on time and on budget; and also discuss current market conditions, including NGL supply and demand and the implication of lower NGL prices. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Pierce Norton, Executive Vice President of Commercial; and Rob Martinovich, Executive Vice President of Operations. I'd like, at this time, to thank Rob and Pierce for their contributions in their previous roles, and congratulate them and others on their new assignments that we announced in December.","On this morning's call, we will review our fourth quarter and 2012 financial results, discuss our revised 2013 earnings guidance and our revised 3-year financial forecast that have been updated to reflect lower expected results in the partnership, primarily in our NGL segment, due to the impact of anticipated prolonged ethane rejection. We will review our progress on our growth projects, including the projects we are about to complete, and close with some comments about our future growth prospect.","So let's start with our fourth quarter and year-end performance. ONEOK Partners turned in a solid performance for the year, reflecting continued volume growth in both the natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing businesses, primarily as a result of our past capital investments. However, our 2012 fourth quarter results were lower compared with the same period in 2011, when we experienced historically wide NGL location price differentials.","Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned in higher results for both the fourth quarter and the year, reflecting primarily higher rates and lower share-based compensation and other employee-related costs. And our energy services segment reported a loss due to the continued challenges it faces in a low natural gas price and oversupplied environment. Terry will provide you more detail on each segment's operating performance in just a few minutes.","We have revised our 2013 earnings guidance and our 3-year financial forecasts, which include a reduction in our ONEOK dividend and ONEOK Partners distribution growth forecast for 2013 and for the 3-year period through 2015. Half of the reduction in our revised 2013 operating income in -- is in our NGL segment and is a result of lower expected NGL volumes due to anticipated widespread and prolonged ethane rejection and, to a lesser extent, tighter NGL location price differentials and lower commodity prices. Of course, if industry conditions improve, we will reevaluate our 2013 guidance, including our current dividend and distribution projections.","These reductions in our distribution and dividend growth forecasts are based on our commitment to not sacrifice our investment-grade credit ratings at ONEOK or at ONEOK Partners, or our distribution coverage ratio at the partnership for the sake of 3-year dividend and distribution growth rates. Our projected 2013 distribution increase allows us to maintain a coverage ratio of 1.0:1.05x at ONEOK Partners. Although lower, our projected distribution and dividend growth rates still rank high among our peers, and we remain confident in our ability to grow both ONEOK's dividend and ONEOK Partners' distribution over the next several years, delivering both value and wealth to our shareholders and unitholders even in a challenging industry environment.","At this time, Derek will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, followed by Terry who will review ONEOK's operating performance. Derek?","Derek S. Reiners","Thanks, John. And good morning.","ONEOK's fourth quarter net income was $112 million or $0.53 per diluted share, compared with $115 million or $0.55 per diluted share for the same period last year. Results in the partnership were lower in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2011 due to narrower NGL price differentials compared with historically wide differentials in 2011. Natural gas and NGL volume growth at the partnership was solid as a result of several growth projects completed in 2012. Results from the Natural Gas Distribution segment were higher due to increased rates in all 3 states and lower operating expenses. Challenges in the energy services segment continue, with lower storage and marketing margins and lower premium services margins.","ONEOK's full year net income was approximately $361 million, unchanged from 2011. And its 2012 stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, of $709 million exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $141 million. In 2012, ONEOK received $437 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, a 31% increase over 2011.","As John mentioned, our 2013 net income guidance is now expected to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million due to lower anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment. Terry will discuss the specific segment guidance revisions in a moment. As stated in our news release, ONEOK now expects its net income to increase by an average of 15% to 20% annually over the 3-year period ending in 2015.","In January, we increased our dividend $0.03 to $0.36 per share, an 18% increase since January of 2012. The expected dividend increase in July of 2013 has been revised to $0.02 per share, subject to board approval. This increase will result in a total dividend increase of 17% for 2013 compared with 2012. And as John indicated, if market conditions improve, we will reevaluate our dividend.","We also revised ONEOK's expectations to increase dividends by approximately 55% to 65% between 2012 and 2015, subject to board approval. And we have affirmed ONEOK's long-term dividend target payout of 60% to 70% of recurring earnings but expect to exceed that target in the near term.","We increased our 2013 guidance for stand-alone cash flow after dividend and -- after dividends and capital expenditures to a range of $195 million to $235 million. This increase is primarily driven by lower anticipated current taxes from the impact of bonus depreciation legislation extended by Congress in January. ONEOK's liquidity position remains strong, and we continue to take the necessary steps to maintain our investment-grade credit rating, as John mentioned a moment ago.","At the end of the fourth quarter, on a stand-alone basis, we had $817 million of commercial paper outstanding, $47 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $282 million of natural gas in storage, with $381 million available under our $1.2 billion credit facility. And our stand-alone long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio was at 45%.","ONEOK's cash flow and liquidity position continues to give us financial flexibility to further increase our dividend, purchase additional units of ONEOK Partners and\/or repurchase ONEOK stock under our approved share repurchase program. We have used all 3 of these options and do not view them as mutually exclusive.","Now Terry will update you on ONEOK's operating performance.","Terry K. Spencer","Thanks, Derek. And good morning. Let me begin my comments with our Natural Gas Distribution segment.","Fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings were higher compared with the same periods last year, reflecting higher rates in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and lower share-based compensation costs as a result of fewer shares of the company's common stock being awarded to employees in 2012 as part of our stock award program. The Natural Gas Distribution segment's operating income guidance for 2013 remains at $227 million.","On the regulatory front, the Kansas Corporation Commission, in December 2012, approved an increase in Kansas Gas Services' annual rate by a net amount of $10 million, which became effective in January.","Energy services continues to experience a very challenging market, and for 2012, the segment realized an operating loss of $78 million due to low natural gas prices and low natural gas price volatility and narrower location and seasonal natural gas price differential.","Energy services segment 2013 guidance remains at an operating loss of $20 million as it continues to face tough market conditions. But we are making progress in our efforts to realign our leased storage and our transport capacity with the needs of our premium services customers.","John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK.","John W. Gibson","Thank you, Terry. Now Derek will review ONEOK Partners' financial performance. And then Terry will come back and review the partnership's operating performance, its growth projects, and give you an update on our view of the current and long-term NGL market dynamics.","Derek S. Reiners","Thanks, John.","ONEOK Partners full year 2012 net income was $888 million, a 7% increase compared with 2011's record performance. ONEOK Partners' fourth quarter net income was $210 million compared with 209 -- $299 million for the same period last year. The fourth quarter results reflect natural gas and NGL volume growth as a result of several growth projects completed in 2012, but results were offset by narrower NGL location price differentials.","For 2012, distributable cash flow increased 7% compared with 2011, resulting in an annual coverage ratio of 1.34x. Quarterly distributable cash flow decreased compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.04x. Our long-term annual coverage ratio target remains at 1.05:1.15x. However, in 2013, given ethane rejection and projected low commodity prices, our coverage ratio could be slightly below that, but we still expect to maintain a greater than 1.0x coverage for 2013. Again, we will not sacrifice our credit metrics or investment-grade credit ratings for the sake of holding to specific distribution growth rates.","We've reduced the partnership's 2013 net income guidance range to $790 million to $870 million, and distributable cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $910 million to $1.0 billion. Both are slightly lower than 2012 actual results.","As mentioned in the new release, ONEOK Partners now expects EBITDA to increase by an average of 15% to 20% annually over a 3-year period. We increased the distribution 2.5 cents per unit in the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase of 16% over the fourth quarter 2011 distribution. Our 2013 revised guidance now includes a projected $0.005 per-unit, per-quarter increase in unitholder distribution, subject to board approval, which would result in a total distribution increase of 7% for 2013 compared with 2012.","The partnership now estimates an average annual distribution growth rate of 8% to 12% for the period between 2012 and 2015, subject to board approval. The revision to the 3-year forecast are driven by expected 2013 results and also lower expected NGL exchange margins in the Rockies and lower expected commodity prices in 2014 and 2015.","In our updated hedging tables, we've increased our NGL hedges to 45%, while 79% of our natural gas is hedged for 2013. Complete hedging information for 2013 and 2014 is included in the news release.","We updated our 2013 capital expenditure guidance to $2.6 billion to reflect our latest forecast that incorporates the cancellation of the Bakken Crude Express project, the additional growth projects we announced last month and some planned 2012 capital spending that carried into 2013.","One item to quickly point out in 2013 earnings guidance is a below-the-line reduction of approximately $20 million in the allowance for equity funds used during construction, or AFUDC, as a result of the cancellation of the Bakken Crude Express project and the 2012 capital spending carryover I just mentioned.","At the end of the fourth quarter, the partnership had $537 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial outstanding or borrowings on our $1.2 billion commercial -- $1.2 billion credit facility, a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 52% and a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.0x. And finally, from a financing perspective, we have multiple sources of liquidity available to us, and we are confident in our ability to raise the necessary capital to fund the growth at ONEOK Partners.","A few key items to point out. We currently have cash on the balance sheet. We have full access to our $1.2 billion credit facility and the option to request an increase to $1.7 billion, if necessary. And we now have in place an at-the-market, or ATM, program that allows the partnership to offer common units up to $300 million. These items enable us to be opportunistic from a timing perspective as we look to access the public equity and debt markets.","This concludes my remarks. And now Terry will update you on the partnership's offering performance.","Terry K. Spencer","Thank you, Derek.","As John said, the partnership performed well in 2012. The natural gas gathering and processing segment's fourth quarter financial results were higher due primarily to volume growth driven by increased well connections within our Williston Basin footprint. This volume growth was offset partially by higher compression costs and lower margins realized from new contracts, as we compete for new and existing volumes in the Williston, and lower realized natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. For 2012, natural gas volumes gathered increased more than 8% and natural gas volumes processed increased more than 20%, driven by the new processing plants and related infrastructure projects completed last year.","The Garden Creek natural gas processing plant continues to operate near its 100 million cubic feet per day capacity. Our Stateline I plant in Williston Basin went into service in September 2012 and is also operating near capacity.","Our Stateline II plant is expected to be in service this quarter, with volumes steadily ramping up over the next several months, particularly after the completion of the Divide County natural gas gathering system in the third quarter of this year.","In 2013, we expect on prospects -- processed volumes to be up 30% and gathered volumes to be up 22%. We also had a record year for new well connections, 940 wells in 2012 compared with 600 wells in 2011. This year, we expect to connect over 1,000 wells.","Crude oil production in the Williston Basin continues to grow, along with the associated NGL-rich natural gas, and we are working hard to quickly connect new wells and build the infrastructure required to reduce the continued flaring of natural gas.","We reduced the segment's 2013 operating income guidance to $238 million compared with $253 million, reflecting our expectation of lower commodity prices. We have provided our 2013 price assumptions in our earnings release. We will provide more detail on our NGL price assumptions in a few moments.","The natural gas pipeline segment's fourth quarter financial results were higher due primarily to lower employee-related costs and a $5.7 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a nonstrategic natural gas pipeline lateral.","Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were slightly lower in 2012, driven by increased maintenance expenses. In January, the FERC approved Northern Border Pipeline's settlement with its shippers, and the lower rates became effective in January.","2013 operating income guidance has been increased to $153 million compared with its previous guidance of $144 million, reflecting anticipated incremental demand from shippers for services to transport their natural gas to market and increased services to electric-generation customers.","Our natural gas liquids segment fourth quarter results were significantly lower due primarily to narrower Conway-to-Mont Belvieu NGL location price differentials, which negatively impacted our optimization activity. The fourth quarter 2012 Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differential was $0.07 compared with $0.49 in the fourth quarter 2011. This decrease was partially offset by higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated in our fee-based exchange-services activity.","For 2012, NGLs transported on our gathering lines increased almost 20% from last year. NGLs fractionated were up 7% year-over-year and included a scheduled maintenance turnaround last summer at the MB-1 fractionator.","We decreased our 2013 operating income guidance for the NGL segment to $545 million compared with the previous guidance of $630 million to reflect the impact of widespread and prolonged ethane rejection and, to a lesser extent, narrower expected NGL location price differential. Given the persistent excess inventories for ethane in the Gulf Coast, we expect our volume throughput in the natural gas liquids business to be impacted by ethane rejection throughout much of 2013, with a return to a normal days of ethane supply inventory level in 2013 and consistent ethane recovery in 2014 and 2015. More on ethane and propane fundamentals in a moment.","We updated our 2013 Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differential to $0.05 per gallon compared with $0.19 previously as high Gulf Coast ethane inventories and Mid-Continent and Rockies ethane rejection persist. As a reminder, the ethane price differential is only one component of the optimization picture. Our integrated NGL assets and marketing strategies provide us with opportunities to generate optimization margins on NGL products other than ethane.","We expect 2013 NGL gathering volumes to be up 13% over last year and fractionation volumes to be up 8% as more projects are completed, including the Bakken NGL pipeline and our new MB-2 fractionator.","Now an update on our projects. All of our previously announced internal growth projects are on budget and on schedule. As I previously mentioned, the Stateline II natural gas processing plant and the 60,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline are expected to be in service this quarter.","While our processing plants in the Williston are fully capable of deep ethane recovery, the economic justification of our processing plant and our Bakken NGL pipeline were based primarily upon the recovery of propane and heavier NGLs with little or no ethane. When ethane pricing improves to the point of recovery in the Williston Basin, our Bakken NGL pipeline throughput will increase. We continue to develop and evaluate our backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects that still total more than $2 billion-plus. It includes investments in processing plants, natural gas pipelines, and NGL fractionation and storage facilities.","Now an update on the NGL market. Production growth from shale drilling continues in crude oil- and NGL-rich supply areas, driven by relatively strong and stable crude oil prices and the uplift from the economic value of NGLs. This increased production has resulted in excessive inventory levels for propane and ethane, and this oversupply has become a key factor in how ethane and propane are currently being valued.","Propane inventories are still well above the 5-year average, with almost all of the surplus on the Gulf Coast, primarily from the lack of winter demand last year and increased production, while propane inventories in the Midwest and Mid-Continent are decreasing and are much lower than last year.","The propane oversupply on the Gulf Coast and softer prices has made it more economical for many petchems to crack propane instead of ethane. According to many industry reports, the amount of propane being cracked today is at record levels. The attractive economics for propane as a petrochemical feedstock has kept ethane prices low especially at Mont Belvieu, leading to historically high and prolonged ethane rejection levels in the regions we serve. Several industry experts have estimated that ethane rejection volumes are between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day. We believe the ethane rejection number is higher based upon what we've seen from Mid-Continent and Rockies plants connected to our NGL systems. We are currently experiencing over 90,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection across our NGL systems and expect it to remain at those levels for much of this year.","Ethane inventories are above historical levels due to increasing production, coupled with the large number of petchem plant turnaround during the first half of 2012. However, the growth rate of ethane inventories at Conway and Mont Belvieu has been steadily decreasing due to ethane rejection and high petchem utilization rate, and we expect that trend to continue. In recent weeks, we have seen Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials narrow to break-even levels due to the continued Gulf Coast ethane inventory overhang and Mid-Continent buying interest due to -- due primarily to ethane rejection in the Rockies and Mid-Continent. As we have stated many times, we expect the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu differentials to stay relatively narrow as new transportation capacity between these market hubs comes online this year, including our new Sterling III Pipeline.","Now let's take a look at our NGL pricing assumption. We updated our 2013 equity NGL composite price assumption for the natural gas gathering and processing segment to $0.66 per gallon. And in our case, it is weighted more to a Conway basis due to contractual commitments. To be clear, this price is at the market hubs before transportation and fractionation fee deductions. For comparative reasons, the $0.66 is calculated on a full ethane recovery basis. Assuming reduced ethane recovery in 2013, our realized NGL composite price is expected to be closer to $0.85 per gallon. The updated price assumptions for 2013 ethane at Conway are in the low $0.20-per-gallon range, and for propane, about $0.90 per gallon.","During 2014 and 2015, our equity NGL composite price will be primarily on a Mont Belvieu basis and will range from the upper $0.80s to low $0.90s per gallon. The change to Mont Belvieu pricing reflects the expected completion of our Sterling III Pipeline in late 2013, providing more access to Mont Belvieu markets. In 2014 and 2015, Mont Belvieu ethane prices are assumed in the mid- to upper-$0.40 per-gallon range, and propane prices are assumed in the $1.10 to $1.20 per-gallon range.","Additionally, we assume crude oil prices for WTI to average $88, $100 and $102 per barrel for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Natural gas on the NYMEX is assumed to be $3.75, $3.80 and $4.20 per MMBtu for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.","Because of NGL supply and demand, a number of market responses have been in play to take advantage of the attractive ethane and propane value. For propane, in the near term, demand is being created by new export terminals coming online: one in a few weeks and another this summer. This should create price strength for propane and allow ethane prices to strengthen as well. Propane heating demand has been stronger compared with last winter since this winter has been somewhat more normal than last year. And more importantly, with the abundant supply of NGLs expected for many years to come at very competitive prices, North American petrochemical companies are in an extremely favorable competitive position around the globe for their product. This abundant NGL supply and its price advantage over oil-based feedstocks is driving a significant increase in long-term petchem demand for NGLs. With the announced expansions and new builds of ethane crackers, ethane demand is expected to increase by more than 700,000 barrels per day by 2016 to 2017.","As NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, we expect the ethane market to be oversupplied through 2013, with widespread and prolonged ethane rejection. We expect natural gas processors to resume full ethane recoveries during most of 2014 and 2015, with intermittent periods of ethane rejection. As we move through 2016 into 2017, we anticipate an undersupplied position as ethane demand will increase when these cracker expansions and new world-class petrochemical facilities are completed.","While growing NGL production has moved ahead of end-use demand in the near term, our strategically unique fee-based and fully integrated midstream assets remain well-positioned in basins with abundant and growing supplies of natural gas and NGLs. Over the long term, our opportunities for growth remain strong as our customers demand more of our essential services. Our NGL business remains in an attractive position even in a prolonged low-ethane recovery environment as our systems are readily able to accommodate the expected NGL volume growth should the markets desire more of a lower-ethane, higher-propane plus blend.","Although we revised our 2013 earnings guidance and 3-year outlook, we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our shareholders and unitholders with our current assets in operation, the assets we are building and our backlog of viable projects.","John, that concludes my remarks.","John W. Gibson","Thank you, Terry. Before we take your questions, I'd like to provide, at this time, some additional comments regarding our future growth.","The assets that we built and are building increase our ability to add volumes to our system. And it's our volumes, our natural gas and natural gas liquids, that enable us to collect a fee when we gather, process, fractionate, store and transport these volumes for our producers, our processors and our customers. While there's been a lot of attention on the contraction of NGL differentials between the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast market centers and short-term ethane price softness, our business model is based on collecting a fee for the service we provide on the volumes we touch. So while in the past our assets have enabled us to benefit from the wider differentials experienced early in 2012 and in late 2011, our long-term strategy remains to convert optimization capacity to fee-for-service business. A significant portion of the volumes we are adding to our systems deliver fee-based earnings. And even in an environment of lower commodity price and narrow NGL differentials, we can continue to generate stable and sustainable earnings by providing nondiscretionary services to our customers. These services will provide us and our customers, producers and investors with sustainable earnings over the long term regardless of short-term moves in differentials and prices. The incremental earnings from our projects, both past and present, will continue to give us the opportunity to grow our earnings at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners over the next 3 years, increase distributions to ONEOK Partners unitholders this year and beyond and increase the ONEOK dividend by 55% to 65% between now and 2015.","While internal growth may not be as exciting or as headline-grabbing as an acquisition, our internal growth opportunities provide investors with far better returns today than if we were to buy earnings at today's prices, and we're not done. As you've heard, our internal growth backlog is in excess of $2 billion, providing us with more earnings growth potential in the future.","Of course, before we take our questions, most importantly, I would like to express my thanks to more than -- our more than 4,800 employees whose dedication and commitment allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day and create exceptional value for our investors and our customers. Our entire management team appreciates their efforts to make our company successful.","At this time, we are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Sighinolfi with UBS.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","John, just curious, following on your last comments around moving towards fee-for-service business. It was stated in last night's release that you're experiencing less favorable contact -- contract terms associated with the Williston Basin volume growth. Just wondering what you meant by that. Is it worse than what you were expecting? Or as it sort of interfaces with the rest of your business, is it just lower than what was there to begin with? Can you just give more color on that?","John W. Gibson","It's a term that we've used consistently in our Qs, our Ks and previous press releases. It draw -- drew a bit more attention than it probably deserves in this point in time because we are reducing 2013 and everyone's trying to understand why. But the basic is, as we renegotiate expiring contracts and contract for new, we're having to revise those terms to meet current market conditions, and those are less favorable than perhaps either we thought they would be or they have been in the past.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And so tied to the incremental growth that you have planned in that basin, it doesn't change your forecast for what you plan to spend versus what the returns on those projects are.","John W. Gibson","That is correct.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Switching quickly. I was just curious, from Terry, with a $0.19 spread, I think the optimization was estimated to comprise about 15% of the margin for the NGL segment in 2013. I'm just curious, at $0.05, what the rough figure, if you have one, is on your expectation.","Terry K. Spencer","It's going to be much less than 10%.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, all right. And I guess, finally, John, as -- you've been able to grow the dividend very strongly within the framework of a targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%, but a lot of peers are sort of increasingly looking towards cash flow coverage as sort of a guiding post for dividend policy. And I'm curious, given that, if there's been any internal discussion with you and the board as to maybe longer term how to approach dividend growth.","John W. Gibson","There has been discussion at the board about that. We will continue, as we have indicated here, along our current practice. But yes, there has been discussion.","Operator","We'll move over to our next question from Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, what -- if you could talk, John or others, on your latest thoughts on oil project opportunities. How aggressive do you plan on being in that area in light of the Bakken cancellation? Can you go back to the drawing board with a different project in that region? Leave it at that.","John W. Gibson","All right. Well, I'll take that one. Of course, we were disappointed to postpone, but we all know the reasons why. Since that time, if you look, in particular, you have written a lot about the fact that producers are putting more and more of their crude on rail, as opposed to a long-haul pipeline. There also has been a recent announcement of utilizing the existing pipeline to move crude from the producing region to the consuming region, and that always is a smart use of capital dollars. So when you look at those, it doesn't appear that the market is screaming quite as loudly for the Bakken NGL pipeline as it once was. But to your other point or question, we are able to quickly knock off the dust, so to speak, and get engaged if the market needs that pipeline or one similar to it.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If you were to focus on oil, would it be in that region? Or are there other areas that you would look at oil opportunities?","John W. Gibson","We'd look at other areas, but obviously where we have -- feel we have a competitive advantage and it's clear that we have a competitive advantage in the Bakken and the Williston, in that area, as opposed to, say, in the Eagle Ford, but we have an effort within our organization focused on looking for crude oil opportunities.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And my one follow-up, on a different topic. And I don't want to beat this horse because you have a lot of projected dividend growth. But you have a lot of extra cash flow per share at OKE and you actually raised the cash flow guidance in 2013 a little bit. And I know it was due to bonus depreciation. But is there any particular reason you don't feel comfortable keeping that OKE dividend growth given that, what I think is a substantial cushion you have there to support it? And are you worried at all about that being a drag on share price, meaning lowering that dividend growth to shareholders?","John W. Gibson","Well, I am concerned. I think there are other things that we, in the past, have chosen to do with our cash. For example, we have used our cash at ONEOK to buy more equity in ONEOK Partners. That's been an awfully good investment for us. We've purchased shares. We will continue. We want the flexibility to continue to do as we have in the past. I think, as we look, and Derek made mention of this, forward, we do lose some benefit from -- associated with bonus depreciation. And as I read, we're prescribed to be or thought to be very conservative. I look at it as much more long-term focused than I do momentarily conservative. But we just want to make sure we have the flexibility to do the things that we see opportunities to execute. Did that answer -- I'm more than happy to keep going if I haven't answered your question.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, I think you have. We can touch base offline.","John W. Gibson","You probably got -- there's probably many others that have the same question.","Operator","And we'll move on to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Sorry, John, I'm laughing because it was my same question. And maybe just to paraphrase or perhaps just to make clear: We may say conservative, you say long-term focused, but it's not a -- it's from a prudency standpoint, it's not from a perhaps skewing of the bias down to fundamentals perhaps deteriorating from here rather than improving. We don't want to misread this into essentially thinking that maybe you guys have a more negative outlook on the industry than we otherwise should.","John W. Gibson","Yes, that is -- no. Let me -- I said yes and no. Let me be clear. We do not have that view. We're very optimistic. We look at the continuing at the $0.03 level going forward. We made a judgment of that relative to what we see in 2013 through 2015 and felt like it was prudent for us to come back to 2012 particularly given the fact that the -- we reduced our distribution at ONEOK Partners so we'll have a little bit less cash coming over from ONEOK Partners to ONEOK. So all of those things, although maybe perhaps not everyone agrees with them, they do tie together and, I think, make good economic sense.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Fair enough. And then if I could just ask a clarification on -- Terry, you made a mention of -- and appreciate the better framework for the $0.66 NGL assumption for 2013, about ethane prices being in the low 20s. And I'm sorry, did you say propane at Conway at $0.90?","Terry K. Spencer","That's correct.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, so it was essentially not too far away from what we've seen sort of year-to-date?","Terry K. Spencer","That's correct. You're in the range.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, fair enough. And then lastly, if I could, just on ONEOK Partners gathering and processing. Just noting that the gathering volume, the fee-based gathering volumes, were a little bit lighter in the fourth quarter than we were expecting, by the same token, it looks that like you bumped up the growth rate in 2013 to kind of account for a little bit lighter. And I didn't know, was there something that happened in November and December that caused the growth rate not to be quite as robust? Or is it just kind of a generic activity of well hook-ups? And is it possible to actually give us what the current run rate is?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, I -- the -- as far as the volumes go, we're in the midst of a pretty significant weather trend that started in about November and December last year. So we were impacted pretty significantly by that, so what you're seeing there is -- in the fourth quarter certainly an impact -- is an impact from that. And your last question was about...","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I didn't know if you could give us a run rate for where those gathering and processing volumes stood today, if possible.","Terry K. Spencer","Well, we're running about -- in the range of about 250 million a day in our 3 -- in the 3 processing plants that are currently operating there, so -- but certainly as we bring on a new plant, the Stateline II plant, we'll start -- we'll be ramping up those volumes, as I've mentioned in the -- in my comments.","John W. Gibson","One of the things we have to remember is those assets up North are up North. It's like running an operation in Canada. And of course, for those of you that are watching The Weather Channel, we are experiencing some severe and heavy snow in Western Oklahoma, which undoubtedly will impact our processing plants and pipelines. But we'll report on that when we talk to you about first quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move on to our next question, to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just ask about your commodity mix. I think you had previously said your margin composition at OK has to be about 65% fee-based. With the new guidance here, what -- sort of what component of your margin do you see as fee-based now?","Terry K. Spencer","Ted, you're going to be in about the 80% range, roughly.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as you think -- yes, sir?","Terry K. Spencer","Ted, about 70% is where you're going to be, sorry.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","70%, got it. It's okay. And then as we think about sort of on a 3 or 4 basis, you've taken the Bakken pipeline, the oil pipeline out. You've added some gathering and processing. Do you see that mix staying in that 70% range? Or maybe it gets a little bit more commodity heavy as you have this growth in NGL prices. Kind of how are you seeing that over the 3-year view?","Terry K. Spencer","What -- yes, as we bring on the NGL projects -- I mean, those are all fee-based projects, so they'll be pushing up -- it'll be pushing up our percentage of fee-based margin as we go forward.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Terry, the -- just on the macro, you talked about how much ethane rejection. You think it might be more than 175,000 a day. I guess I'm just curious, if there's that much ethane that's still waiting to come in, what gives you confidence that we'll turn around in 2014 and not still be in sort of ethane rejection mode, or at least still have pressure on prices?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Ted, I mean, I think the key driver in all this is strong ethane demand. I mean, the petrochemicals, I mean, their consumption is pushing 1 million barrels a day, and we're expecting it to go even higher. Once we get this ethane inventory overhang worked off, which we expect to happen in 2013, then we should be in the clear as we move into 2014 and 2015. And of course, we'll have some periods of ethane rejection. But we're really confident just from what we're seeing, I mean. And as I indicated in my comments, we think the ethane rejection is happening at a significantly greater level, just as evidenced by the ethane rejection we're experiencing on our own systems. So -- but we really think this thing will get worked off this year. Many of the experts and those in the industry believe the same thing. And by 2014, we should be in pretty good shape, and as well as we move into 2015. And hopefully, we'll get to 2016 and '17 and be in really good shape.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right, great. And then the last one for me is just -- you mentioned the credit metrics as being in sort of descending investment grade, as being the reason for the lower dividends and distribution growth. I guess I'm wondering if you're -- you can quantify those metrics that you're targeting, whether it's at OKS or OKE. How you think about that mix of maybe getting it a little more fee-based and the ability to run a little bit more leverage.","John W. Gibson","Well, we're talking about both equity, both credit rating. And we stay in contact with the rating agencies. We listen to what they say, and others, to guide our decisions. I mean there's -- as you know, there's no specific formula for what we're trying to accomplish, other than maintain that 50% level. Is there anything you'd like to add?","Derek S. Reiners","John, the only thing I would add to that is a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we've said before, keeping that around 4x or less.","Operator","Next question will come from Citigroup, from Timm Schneider.","Timm Schneider - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Most of my questions have actually been answered. Just one quick one: What's driving the lower CapEx number in the NGL segment if I look at old guidance versus new?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, we -- the Bakken crude pipeline was in those numbers and is now out. So that's the bulk of it.","Timm Schneider - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then, if you can, what are you guys assuming for some of the heavier end of the barrel, the butanes and the net gasolines, in 2013?","Terry K. Spencer","Oh, you're going to be somewhere in that $1.40, $1.50 range on [indiscernible] on C5s you could be pushing $2.","Operator","Your next question will come from Helen Ryoo with Barclays.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, the -- I'll just start with a clarification question on your NGL price assumption for this year. Did you say that, that was before T&F and that was mostly based on Conway exposure?","Terry K. Spencer","That's correct, Helen.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then what is your NGL barrel, equity barrel mix, assuming full recovery of ethane? Is that -- is ethane much higher than 50% level?","Terry K. Spencer","No, you're going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 45% to 50%. I mean, it's going to be pretty typical for the industry. That's 45% to 50% range. It's going to be -- it's going to get you there. And in propane, Helen, you'll probably be in that 30%, 35% range.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So the assumption of $0.66 before T&F, are you assuming price to get lower from the current level? How should I compare that number to what your -- what the current Conway price is?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, you're -- we're actually, on ethane -- in our assumption, ethane prices are probably a bit lower than what we're actually seeing today. Propane prices, in our assumption, are just -- are a bit higher, just slightly higher. I mean, you're in the range so, I mean, it makes sense if you compare it to today's stock postings or -- and look at the forward curve. It makes sense.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just one quick follow-up, on different topic. Your interest expense guidance, does that assume some of your high-cost bonds being called or tendered this year?","John W. Gibson","No, it does not.","Operator","Next we'll move on to John Edwards with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Thanks for all the helpful comments on the NGL market. I just had a follow-up to Ted's questions there. Just looking out, I think you said about a 700,000 barrel a day increase in ethane. And I didn't catch through what time frame, was that 2015, '16? I didn't catch.","Terry K. Spencer","2016 to 2017.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then I think you made the comment that you're expecting, I guess, things to swing and to possibly short supply then -- what I guess I'm having trouble figuring out is, if that's the case, how some of the petchems would invest in steam crackers -- if -- without secure supply? So I'm trying to figure out, is -- are you really thinking that the market is relatively balanced? Or are you really thinking it will be short?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, I think that's a great question. I think that the petrochemical companies recognize that as we map this thing out and look over this time frame, that we could very well be in short supply. I don't think they truly believe that. They wouldn't be making these investments. They have a lot of confidence in the development, the midstream development that's happening upstream, they got a lot of confidence in the shale plays. They're actively engaged with midstream companies talking about the drilling and the development that's going on. So I think they really do, though, they have a lot of confidence. But if you look at the curves today, they could -- we could very well be in short supply. But I don't -- strongly do not believe that's what they think.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess the last question along those lines is, what kind of increase? You're speaking about increase in consumption, I guess, this year being up 15% to 20% in consumption. What are you thinking, I guess, '14, '15, '16 time frame?","Terry K. Spencer","I guess you're talking about consumption of ethane.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Of ethane, consumption of ethane.","Terry K. Spencer","Yes. I mean, when you look at the 2014 to 2015 time frame, we're going to be in about that 1.3 million to 1.4 million barrels per day range. There's actually a chart that we produced that will show that to you. So we'll see it ramping up in 1 million barrels a day pretty quickly over that -- over the 2013. As we move into 2014, 2015, we'll be in that, I could say, 1.3 million barrels a day range or so.","Operator","Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers has our next question.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I want to come back to the distribution question but kind of think about it more longer term. If I'm looking at this correct, shaving, I think it was something like, a 1.5 points off the CAGR on EBITDA growth through 2015 results in a much lower -- or a modest EBITDA reduction, maybe 60 million or so. But the distribution guidance seems much greater relative to the EBITDA adjustment. And it seems like that's driving a potential extremely conservative distribution coverage ratio into 2014, 2015. Am I thinking about that wrong? And as you have these fee-based projects coming online, is there any reason you'd want to be going above your targeted cap of 1.15x coverage in outer years?","John W. Gibson","Well, as -- clearly, as we move -- are more heavily weighted towards these fee-based arrangements, we'll be more comfortable to move towards the 1.15x, stay within that 1.05:1.15. But clearly, we've been above that in the past. I believe, in the '14 and '15, we're above that as well. So I guess you are thinking about it correctly.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, so it sounds like, without even any change in guidance, if your comfort level is that your expectations will not be worse than what you've laid out, that just on current guidance, you could probably look at juicing the distribution growth rate as far as 2015.","John W. Gibson","Well, I mean, we -- as we typically do, we'll look at that the quarter before but not now for 2015. I mean, the message is clear that, in particular our exposure to NGL barrels, ethane rejection is taking volume off of our system. And that volume, as I mentioned earlier, has dollars associated with it. So we know we're not going to have as many dollars as we thought we would in 2013 primarily because of this prolonged expected ethane rejection, which is far longer than any of us with any industry experience would anticipate or did anticipate. How -- our view is that we spend most of the year at this level. Do we have perfect knowledge? Of course, not. And if those volumes come back onto our system, ethane rejection, in other words, is not as long as we anticipated, then you may rest assured that we will look at our distribution at ONEOK Partners, as well as our dividend at ONEOK Inc. But we will also be looking at that while at the same time we look at our credit rating and those other metrics that we discussed earlier.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. That's good color. And in addition, if I could revisit the cash at OKE level. You mentioned that you've obviously historically used a kind of onetime annual free cash flow to buy back shares and for other things, besides committing to long-term dividend growth that may not be there in outer years, so trying to be a little more conservative. If my math is correct, you're now guiding $215 million of free cash flow for 2013, up about $50 million because of the tax benefits, and you've still got $300 million on your share repurchase program that expires this year. Is it fair to say that, that dovetails very well and -- with the weakness today in the shares that, that's an active consideration?","John W. Gibson","Well, as I mentioned earlier about what we've done historically with our cash in the past and increasing the dividend is certainly one of the things we've done and we obviously are going to continue to do. Investment in ONEOK Partners, we bought back shares. We still have, as you point out, the ability to buy back more. So yes, we have all of those available to us. And as indicated earlier, we want to retain the flexibility to do those things that we think are -- make good economic sense for the company and its shareholders and unitholders.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Fair enough. Last question. It's probably for Terry. The re-contracting that you were talking about, did that relate to the condensate keep-whole volumes being down so much from third quarter and year-over-year?","Terry K. Spencer","No, it did not.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","What was driving that, if I could ask?","Terry K. Spencer","It's just that -- Greg, it's just the growth in the POP business and it's a -- we ended up with keep-wholes around 3%, it's down from, like, 6%. So it's just growth in the other contracts is what's driving those numbers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","But it's not -- the keep-whole volumes aren't stable against your growing pie because the total volumes were down.","John W. Gibson","Well, I think it's just fair to say that keep-wholes are just not material. It's probably the best way to look at it, for gathering and processing in our company.","Terry K. Spencer","Less than 5%.","John W. Gibson","So you may not want to spend a lot of time on that one.","Operator","And we do have time for one last question. That'll come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question, just, what -- as you have all this new processing capacity coming online over the next couple of years, once that's all built out, what does your contract mix look like? Does it change much in terms of POP versus keep-whole versus fee?","Terry K. Spencer","It will actually increase. If you're looking at just the G&P segment, as we bring on these new plants in the Bakken, yes, I mean, we will become more commodity price sensitive and -- so I can't remember what the percentage maxes out, at least in the 2015 time frame. But it's not a huge increase, but it will go up slightly if you -- as you look at just the G&P segment. But you've got to remember, much of that, at the partnership level, gets offset because, in our NGL segment, all of our growth projects are fee-based. You got it?","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it, okay. Yes. And then in terms of the -- your new forecast or assumptions for the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu spread, have you changed your fundamental view of what that spread will look like? I think, historically, your view was, and correct me if I'm wrong, that it would move ultimately to effectively the transport costs. But it seems like you're, at least for 2013, expecting that to be even tighter than that. So I'm just trying to reconcile those.","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Mike, you just got to -- you got to understand there are more products than just ethane. And we're giving you this $0.05 to $0.06 ethane forward view, but there are other products that'll be optimized that could be above that. So when you look at the overall average barrel, which we don't advertise that number, for competitive reasons, you could be more than that cost of build range. So I mean, our view really hasn't changed. I mean, we expect these spreads to come -- to narrow. We've got an unusual situation with very high ethane inventories, and this heavy rejection that's happening has really brought these spreads in. But our long-term view is that the spreads would narrow because of the capacity that others and ourselves are bringing online over the course of the next couple of years. Does that help you?","Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, no, it does. It does. And then last quick question for me. The -- in the release, you have a table that shows the percent of NGLs you've hedged for 2013 at 45%. I'm assuming, based on the price that you show there, that there's no ethane that's hedged today in that. I was wondering if there's also any propane in that number or if it's all heavier than that?","Terry K. Spencer","That's correct. There's little to no ethane in that number, and there is some propane, and then heaviers.","Andrew J. Ziola","All right.

The ONEOK, ONEOK Partners and ONE Gas Investor Day is scheduled for Tuesday, December 3, in New York. A Save the Date notice was sent last week, and we'll be following up with webcast information in a couple of weeks.","With that, our first speaker is John Gibson, Chairman and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. John?","John W. Gibson","Thanks, Andrew. Thank you. Good morning. And many thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me on the call today are Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; and Terry Spencer, our President. Also on the call and available to answer your questions are Pierce Norton, our Executive Vice President of Commercial; and Rob Martinovich, our Executive Vice President of Operations.","On this morning's call, we will review our third quarter 2013 financial results, review our updated 2013 guidance ranges, discuss the acquisition of the Sage Creek assets, and discuss the current status and key milestones of the ONE Gas separation.","So let's get started with our third quarter performance. ONEOK's third quarter performance was driven by continued volume growth in ONEOK Partners with volume increases in natural gas gathered and processed and natural gas liquids gathered as a result of the growth projects that we've completed.","At ONEOK Partners, our NGL exchange-services margins increased compared with the same period in 2012 as we continued to execute our strategy to convert capacity held for optimization activities to fee-based contracts. As a result and as expected, our optimization margins declined as a result of this reduced capacity and the expected tighter NGL price differentials experienced between Mont Belvieu and Conway. Also, as anticipated, ethane rejection had some impact on our third quarter results. However it was less than $11 million and does not include the positive impact of minimum volume obligation.","Our Natural Gas Distribution segment performed well during the quarter benefiting from new rates in all 3 of the states it serves. Energy Services' results were a bit higher than expected due to release and\/or the assignment of certain transportation and storage contracts at higher rates than we initially assumed.","As we typically do this time of the year, we have updated our net income guidance range for ONEOK and net income and distributable cash flow range for ONEOK Partners. As Andrew mentioned, at our Investor Day in New York on December 3, we intend to provide 2014 guidance and updated 3-year financial forecasts for ONEOK, ONEOK Partners and ONE Gas.","At this time, Derek will now review ONEOK's financial highlights, followed by Terry, who will review ONEOK's operating performance. Derek?","Derek S. Reiners","Thanks, John, and good morning. ONEOK's third quarter net income was approximately $62 million or $0.30 per diluted share, including a noncash charge, as expected, from the release of transportation capacity related to the accelerated wind-down of the Energy Services segment. ONEOK's net income in the third quarter 2013 would have been approximately $73 million or $0.35 per diluted share excluding the impact of the noncash charge compared with $65 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2012.","In the third quarter of 2013, Energy Services recorded a $16 million pretax noncash charge, which, for the 9-month 2013 period, totaled $130 million related to the capacity releases executed in 2013 for certain transportation and storage contracts. These charges were lower than we initially estimated as we received higher rates on some contracts compared with our original estimates. During the third quarter 2013, the segment paid approximately $6 million in cash related to these obligations. We expect future cash payments associated with the released transportation and storage capacity from the wind-down to total approximately $89 million on an after-tax basis with approximately $8 million to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2013, $33 million in 2014, $24 million in 2015 and $24 million over the period 2016 through 2023.","In the first 9 months of 2013, ONEOK received approximately $397 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, a 27% increase from the same period last year.","ONEOK's year-to-date 2013 standalone cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded standalone capital expenditures and dividend payments by $117 million. In October, we declared a dividend of $0.38 per share, unchanged from the previous quarter.","As John mentioned, we did update ONEOK's 2013 net income guidance range, now expected to be in the range of $245 million to $275 million compared with $235 million to $285 million. The midpoint remains the same, reflecting the lower than anticipated noncash charges in the Energy Services business, offset by lower than anticipated earnings in the partnership's Natural Gas Liquids segment.","ONEOK's balance sheet and liquidity position remains solid. At the end of the third quarter on a standalone basis, we had $515 million of commercial paper outstanding, $57 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $683 million available under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. Our standalone long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio was 44%.","At ONEOK's Investor Day, we will provide new dividend growth rate expectations at ONEOK. And as previously discussed, we expect the growth in ONEOK's dividend to be competitive with its pure-play general partner peers. The new dividend, which is subject to Board approval, is expected to be declared in the quarter after the ONE Gas transaction is completed. So if the separation occurs in the fourth -- in the first quarter of 2014, as we anticipate, we would expect to declare the new dividend in April.","Additionally ONE Gas will provide its expected initial dividend growth rate expectations and payout ratio range. We also expect to share our thoughts on how to think about the dividend and liquidity needs at ONEOK post-separation.","Now Terry will update you on ONEOK's operating performance.","Terry K. Spencer","Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our Natural Gas Distribution segment. Third quarter 2013 earnings were higher, primarily reflecting higher rates in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Operating costs were slightly higher compared with the third quarter 2012 primarily because of higher pension expenses, which were partially offset by lower share-based compensation expenses.","As Derek discussed, the Energy Services segment incurred a lower-than-expected noncash charge related to the released capacity in the third quarter. Excluding that charge, net margin increased by approximately $11 million in the segment compared with the same period last year primarily due to lower demand charge costs in the third quarter of 2013 resulting from reduced contracted transportation and storage capacity.","John, that concludes my remarks for ONEOK.","John W. Gibson","Thank you, Terry. Now Derek will review ONEOK Partners' financial performance, then Terry will come back and review the partnership's operating performance, growth projects and discuss the Sage Creek acquisition.","Derek S. Reiners","Thanks, John. In the third quarter, ONEOK Partners' net income was approximately $216 million or $0.64 per unit compared with $232 million or $0.78 per unit in the third quarter of 2012. Distributable cash flow was $259 million in the quarter compared with $261 million in the third quarter of 2012, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.14x for the third quarter of 2013. Distributable cash flow was $704 million for the first 9 months of 2013, providing a 1.04x coverage compared with $781 million for the same period last year. Our long-term annual coverage ratio target remains at 1.05x to 1.15x. However as discussed in previous conference calls, we expect our full year 2013 to be slightly above 1x coverage.","In August, we completed a public offering of 11.5 million common units, which generated proceeds of $553 million. In September, we completed a $1.25 billion public offering of senior notes, generating net proceeds of approximately $1.24 billion. Proceeds from these 2 offerings provide significant capacity for our capital expenditures program.","We now expect ONEOK Partners' 2013 net income to be in the range of $790 million to $830 million compared with the previous range of $790 million to $870 million. The new range reflects lower anticipated earnings in our NGL segment due to narrower NGL location price differentials.","The partnership's DCF is now expected in the range of $930 million to $980 million compared with its previous range of $910 million to $1 billion. The midpoint remains at $955 million.","An update on our 2013 growth capital forecast to $2 billion from approximately $2.2 billion and reduced our maintenance capital to $100 million from $120 million for 2013 primarily due to timing. This does not impact our $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion growth program.","We increased the distribution declared by $0.005 per unit to $0.725 in the third quarter of 2013, an increase of 6% from the third quarter of 2012.","In the earnings release, you'll note some updates on our hedging information as we continue to hedge commodity risk when appropriate.","At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $723 million of cash and cash equivalents, $47 million in commercial paper and approximately $1.2 billion of credit available to us on our revolving credit facility.","Our long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio was 55%, and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. We have ample liquidity to support the partnership's ongoing capital program.","In regards to our at-the-market equity program, we took a conservative approach by not selling units while ONEOK was evaluating the ONE Gas separation, and we were blacked out for most of the third quarter due to our August equity issuance. We do expect to utilize this program in the future when conditions warrant as a way to manage our equity issuances over time.","Now Terry will update you on the partnership's operating performance.","Terry K. Spencer","Thank you, Derek. Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment's third quarter operating income was higher due primarily to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed, offset partially by lower realized NGL prices and higher operating costs and depreciation expense due to the growth projects we've placed in service over the last year.","Natural gas volumes gathered and processed continue to grow, driven by increased well connections in the Williston Basin and Western Oklahoma. For the third quarter, natural gas volumes gathered increased 21%, natural gas volumes processed increased 25% and NGLs sold increased 34% compared with the same period last year, driven by the Williston Basin's new Garden Creek and Stateline I and II natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure projects completed in 2012 and in 2013.","We connected 340 wells in the third quarter, our highest ever, and 950 September year-to-date compared with 710 wells last year through September. We now expect to connect approximately 1,200 wells to our Williston Basin and the Mid-Continent gathering systems in 2013. Accordingly we remain confident on our volume expectations we provided on our last earnings call.","Our Natural Gas Liquids segment's third quarter results were lower due to significantly narrower Conway-to-Mont Belvieu NGL price differentials and the impact of ethane rejection. As expected, NGL exchange service's margins and NGLs gathered continued to grow, while NGL optimization margins decreased compared with the same period last year as a result of ONEOK Partner's strategy to convert NGL optimization capacity to fee-based exchange services capacity that partially offset the impact of narrower Conway-to-Mont Belvieu differentials. Our integrated NGL system also enabled us to capture higher margins from wider NGL product price differentials.","From a volume perspective, NGLs transported on gathering lines were 574,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2013, up 8% compared with the same period last year and up 4% compared with the second quarter 2013. As in the G&P segment, we remain confident in the NGL segment's volume expectations we provided on our last earnings call. Ethane rejection did result in NGL pipeline capacity typically utilized for exchange services business becoming available for optimization activity, allowing us to benefit somewhat from NGL price differentials that are still relatively narrow compared to the 5-year average between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast NGL market centers.","The Natural Gas Pipeline segment's third quarter financial results were slightly higher compared with the same period in 2012. Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline were lower in the third quarter of 2013 due to reduced transportation rates on Northern Border Pipeline. Substantially all of Northern Border Pipeline's long-haul transportation capacity has now been contracted through March 2015.","Now an update on our projects. We have several projects expected to be completed in the coming months. The MB-2 NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu is expected to be in service this month, and the Sterling III Pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of this year with the flexibility to transport either unfractionated NGLs or NGL purity products from the Mid-Continent region to the Texas Gulf Coast.","By the end of this year, we will have spent approximately $130 million for the Divide County natural gas gathering system project in North Dakota. The remaining $20 million of additional expansion for this project will be spent throughout 2014 to complete the remaining infrastructure.","Last month, we completed the acquisition of the Sage Creek assets, which include a 50 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing plant and NGL pipeline systems in the NGL-rich area of the Powder River Basin. We also plan to invest additional capital to upgrade and construct natural gas gathering and processing-related infrastructure and well connections and NGL gathering pipelines, which will connect to Sage Creek and third-party processing plants, including a lateral to our NGL pipeline in -- the Bakken NGL pipeline. This acquisition provides significant long-term growth potential in the basin and the opportunity to provide area producers and processors with a full menu of midstream natural gas and NGL-related services.","Now a brief look at the NGL markets. We have not changed our outlook for ethane rejection for 2014 and 2015. We still believe that ethane rejection by natural gas processing plants connected to our NGL system will continue at current levels of approximately 90,000 barrels per day throughout much of 2014 and through 2015 but primarily in the Rockies. Gulf Coast and Conway NGL inventory levels, especially for ethane and propane, are decreasing as ethane rejection continues and due to strong export demand for propane.","From a demand perspective, with major plant outages behind them, the petchems are consuming the excess ethane inventory, and we expect a significant drawdown throughout the remainder of this year and into 2014. The petchems are operating at high utilization rates with ethane as their primary feedstock, and we see no signs of that slowing down. Additionally some petchems who have been using propane as a feedstock have, over the past few months, switched back to ethane, which we estimate to be 50,000 to 75,000 barrels per day. From a pricing perspective, this should lead to some upside momentum to ethane prices. But we expect it will be slow and moderated by the ability of processors to recover ethane fairly quickly and rebalance the market.","Propane inventories are decreasing in both Conway and Mont Belvieu from extensive seasonal demand from crop drying in the Upper Midwest and from strong export demand. In recent weeks, we have seen Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials range from $0.03 to $0.06 per gallon, and we expect this range to continue for the rest of this year. While we recognize the continued near-term challenges regarding excess ethane supply, the partnership remains well positioned through its integrated network of assets and NGL-rich basins to provide essential services to its customers for the long term. John, that concludes my remarks.","John W. Gibson","Thank you, Terry. Now let me provide you with an update on the status and the timeline of the ONE Gas separation. All of those involved have made remarkable progress to complete the necessary filings required for the separation, which include, of course, the Form 10, the New York stock exchange listing materials, the IRS and the FERC filings, and completing and updating the filings with the Kansas Corporation Commission and related parties.","Our discussions with the KCC have been very productive and collaborative. Last week, the KCC released a procedural schedule for the order-setting process. There are 2 possible tracks for approval. The first proposes a settlement agreement with all parties designed to be sent to the KCC for approval by the end of 2013. And the second, if the parties are unable to reach a settlement, would result in KCC approval in late February. We are confident that our discussions with the KCC and other parties will continue to be productive, and we still expect to complete the separation in the first quarter of 2014. Upon the KCC approval, we estimate the transaction will close within 4 to 5 weeks thereafter.","In closing, I'd like to again thank our 5,000 employees whose commitment, dedication, skills and experience allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day and to create exceptional value for our investors and our customers. Our entire management team appreciates all of our employees' efforts to make our company successful.","So at this time, we are now ready to take your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to check on the Sage Creek acquisition. Maybe I missed this, but what's the run rate EBITDA on the existing assets? And then what are the volume assumptions that you're making to get to the, I think it's $40 million to $60 million of incremental EBITDA?","Terry K. Spencer","Well, Ted, we actually don't provide that specificity publicly, okay, as far as what our volume forecasts are. But what I can tell you is that the EBITDA estimate that we've provided when we announced the project is really just the -- a kind of a Phase I, if you will, okay, but there's going to be additional projects, which we kind of refer to as the Phase II. So we'll see some significant increase in EBITDA there. Much of that is driven not only by increased gathering and processing revenues but, in particular, NGL-related revenues associated with the natural gas liquids that will connect into the Bakken Pipeline.","John W. Gibson","So Ted, I think it's safe to say that the opportunity in buying those assets was for future development. We didn't look at that as an opportunity to buy earnings as much as it was to buy future earnings.","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, that's great. The only thing I would add to that is that 1 of the key components in the acquisition were the substantial acreage dedications that went with it.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then if we can talk about the Bakken maybe again, how you're seeing that shape up with where production seems like it's kind of reaccelerated, the need for additional processing plants, gathering infrastructure, kind of where your acreage dedications are, if you see the need for that. And then if you could talk about your contracting strategy up there. I think you're -- you've mostly gone POP, but would you maybe try to go fee-based on anything, any future development?","Terry K. Spencer","Ted, development continues to be very strong, particularly with the multi-pad drilling that's going on, so the producers are really able to complete a lot of wells quickly. So the production, as you've probably seen publicly, the public -- people who follow the Bakken, production's going off the charts. So we expect to continue to make investments as it relates to gathering and processing infrastructure. Now I forgotten the last part of your question.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just the contracting strategy. Would you book more -- just stay more POP? I think your acreage dedication will lead you there, but would you try to make that more fee based? Or how are you thinking about that?","Terry K. Spencer","We already have fee-based components in our contract. They're a mix of POP and fee based. Don't anticipate changing it because that strategy has worked real well for us.","John W. Gibson","I might add one of the reasons that strategy has worked so well is that's what the producer wants. So that's kind of a natural.","Terry K. Spencer","And that mutual alignment up here has worked extremely well when both parties make more money. When prices are up, both parties make more money at the same time. But really, don't anticipate changing the contracting strategy, Ted.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then last 1one for me just on the maintenance CapEx. I did see it came down for this year. How should we think about sort of more of a run rate for maintenance CapEx as we're thinking about end of 2014 and 2015?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, Ted, we've been in that $100 million to -- over our history last couple of years been in that $100 million to $120 million run rate range. Going forward, it will increase somewhat slightly, certainly, as we increase the assets that we have on our books. I think the same, we -- you've got to think about, as it relates to this maintenance capital because there's -- about 20% to 25% of that maintenance capital are discretionary type of items. So we can -- they're noncritical types of maintenance capital like clearing rights-of-way, painting parking lots, things like that. So they're noncritical items, and so we have the ability to defer those depending upon what our work priorities are. So you can see that number fluctuate from year-to-year. And most of the time, it is attributable to these discretionary items I just mentioned. Does that help you?","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. That's very helpful.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on price realizations in the G&P segment. It seems like there's been some weakness this year relative to NYMEX realizations and also the hedge prices. So I'm just curious, what's going on there, Terry, in the Mid-Con and specifically with your G&P operations? What's driving that, and if those conditions are likely to change in coming periods?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, it's a great question, Chris. We had -- in the third quarter, we had a bit of an anomaly where the prices we realized with unhedged volumes were very low due to basis disconnect in the Bakken that AECO prices had really gotten beaten pretty hard, and the trickle back affects the Bakken. We saw some dollar discounts between the Bakken and the market area. So that affected us and affected that pricing in the third quarter, and that's the primary reason for that spread, that disconnect, if you will.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And how do you see that sort of progressing as we move forward in time, Terry? Obviously ted was asking about growth from that basin, but -- from the gas side, then how do you think about pricing disconnects on a go-forward?","Terry K. Spencer","I think it's resolving. That issue is resolving itself. It's not really a problem today, but it's there. As Canadian volumes continue to grow, as Marcellus gas backs up into the Midwest, that's going to impact us somewhat. So you're going to still see some pricing disconnects.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. I think switching gears a little bit, I appreciate your NGL market color, update on your views. I'm just curious, what you anticipating for your Pads 2 and 3 processing, your frac assets, given the pending in-service of Apex? And then I guess related to that, Terry, we have a couple of light-grade lines proposed down to the Gulf Coast region, one of which seems to require some downstream fractionation. We've seen some of the other Belvieu peers announce plans to pursue permits on some incremental fractionation capacity there. Just interested to know, post MB-2, what else sort of remains in the backlog that you might be working on to accommodate that pipe, should it come?","Terry K. Spencer","Well certainly, with the pipelines that are being built into the region, some of them are not being built with companion fractionation capacity. So the opportunity exists for us to potentially provide more fractionation services, to provide storage services and infrastructure services for those parties that do construct or build those pipelines or ship through those pipelines. So I think there's going to be opportunity for us without necessarily having to own and operate a pipeline all the way back to the -- to these basins. As far as the impact from those projects you talked about, one in particular, Texas Express coming out of the Panhandle area down to the Gulf Coast, we've -- that pipeline has started up, and we've already seen some impact from that in the Conway prices, okay. As they started that pipeline up and accumulated line fill, we did see some pressure. So those pipelines are going to impact the market somewhat.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Got it. I think final question for me, Terry. Given Ted's question about growth from the Bakken, obviously you've got a lot of shadow growth projects still out there, and you've had an appetite in the past to pursue some crude oil infrastructure projects. I'm just wondering what sort of the conversation has been like recently with potential counterparties on some of that shadow inventory given where pricing spreads have gone. Has there been a change in that dynamic and in those conversations?","Terry K. Spencer","Well certainly, they don't disregard the market. They look and see what's going on. The bottom line is, they still -- many of our customers want to get to Belvieu. It's where the most liquid market is. And they understand there's a cost. Regardless of the basis spread between Conway and Belvieu, there is a cost associated with getting -- us building and operating this infrastructure. So they're willing to pay the freight and are stepping up and paying the freight. And so we're continuing to execute on and develop opportunity for new supplies and, in particular, crude oil, as it relates to crude oil. We're -- we've seen that basis spread, that East Coast basis spread compress. Now it's widened back out, okay? So it's very volatile. And we've seen producers want to continue to discuss the possibility of a pipeline asset, in particular out of the Bakken all the way down to Cushing. But, as you might not be surprised, those producers still remain hesitant to make the types of commitments that's necessary at least for our capital to make a project like that work.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Edwards with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just could you -- I don't know if I saw it, but the in-service date for the expansion that you're doing around your Sage Creek acquisition.","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, 2015 was the timeframe. Just the -- you're talking about the lateral that we...","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, the $135 million one you just -- you announced with this release.","Terry K. Spencer","Yes, exactly. That consists of 2 things, or actually 3 things, primarily: The $50 million expansion of processing facility, or it's a modification of the processing facility to allow us to handle extremely rich gas that's being produced out of this play. The rest is a pipeline to interconnect these assets to the Bakken, plus another pipeline lateral to connect it to third-party processing plants, okay?","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's -- you're looking first half or second half of '15?","Terry K. Spencer","Actually, you're look -- right around the end of 2014, perhaps early 2015.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. All right. And then I just want to make sure I heard you right. Your expectations on the Conway-Belvieu spread in NGLs, you're looking at $0.03 to $0.06 a gallon. Is that the thought process?","Terry K. Spencer","That's the range that we expect.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of going further out, are you still looking for that range, say, for '14 and '15?","Terry K. Spencer","We're looking at probably something a little higher, maybe $0.06 to $0.07 going forward for EP. We think that the ethane inventory overhang is one of those key things that has affected this spread. And certainly, we've seen it affect it here in the fourth quarter. But as we move through this fourth quarter and into the second quarter, we and many of the experts expect this ethane inventory overhang to be substantially resolved.","Operator","And we'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I know the answer for this maybe that it's contract specific, but at a high level, can you give us some color around the older plans that may not be that efficient in extracting out ethane? Does the customer have a daily, weekly or monthly option to reject ethane?","Terry K. Spencer","No, they do not. They don't -- they really cannot drive our operations.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Meaning, you guys pick?","Terry K. Spencer","That's correct.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. Okay. And then have you contracted capacity on the Bakken NGL line or any of your other NGL distribution or gathering lines on a ship-or-pay basis for your equity barrels? Or is it more based on actual volume shipped? How do we think about that?","Terry K. Spencer","Well most of the capacity on these new projects, and the Bakken Pipeline included, most of these are on a ship-or-pay basis, okay?","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well even for your equity barrels?","Terry K. Spencer","Yes.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then when you contracted it, I mean, it was over a year ago, did you only take enough capacity for propane plus volumes? Or did you include ethane in it, too?","Terry K. Spencer","Well some ethane's been included in that.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then in the NGL segment, you mentioned operational measurment gains. can you remind us what that exactly is? And then also, when you say higher revenues from customers with minimum volume obligation, does this mean they have to pay some penalties for not meeting minimum volume?","Terry K. Spencer","Okay, let's take this -- that's a bunch of questions, so -- and I guarantee you I won't remember them all. But let me take the first one, telling you what operational measurement gains are. It relates to measurements. Inherent in NGL or natural gas measurement, you have some inaccuracy, okay, plus or minus, less than 1% in most cases. That's what that is. And from time to time, we'll have periods where we have gains in the system or losses, okay? So that's what that's referring to, okay? And your next question was?","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You guys point out that you had higher revenues from customers with minimum volume obligations. I was just curious if that meant that they have to pay some penalty for not meeting minimum volumes.","Terry K. Spencer","That's right. In the MVA contracts that we have, there is a penalty payment that they have to make if they're deficient. Or it's -- sometimes, we call it deficiency payments that they have to make.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then at distribution, are you guys tracking better than expected? Or is there something -- some timing-related differences in 4Q that would cause full year operating income numbers to come in around the $227 million number that you previously guided towards?","Pierce H. Norton","Christine, this is Pierce. We're tracking on plan. If you'll notice, kind of the year-over-year is more some pension-related costs, but we're tracking where we expect to be.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to our speakers for any further remarks.","Andrew J. Ziola","Well thank you for joining us, everybody.

Terry?","Terry Spencer","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK.","Joining me on today\u2019s call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.","On this call, we will focus on our first quarter financial results and operating performance and provide our perspective about the recent FERC announcements related to natural gas and NGL pipelines. But before we dive in, I\u2019d like to start where we left off on our fourth quarter call, which is our $4 billion plus of announced organic growth projects. As you may recall, I was clear that the next couple of years will be about executing on these growth projects, and we\u2019re making good progress so far.","On the natural gas liquids side, we continue to work with landowners, state and local agencies and other stakeholders along the pipeline routes for Elk Creek and Arbuckle II, and we expect to begin construction later this year on both projects.","Within the last couple of weeks, pipe for Elk Creek started being delivered, a big step closer to actual construction. We plan to start construction with the southern part of Elk Creek first in the third quarter as this action would allow barrels from the Powder River Basin to flow on Elk Creek before the entire line is complete, which could free up capacity on the Bakken NGL Pipeline for additional barrels from the Williston Basin. The southern section would be in service as early as the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, our MB-4 fractionator is permitted and we expect construction to begin this month.","On the natural gas gathering and processing side, expansions of our Canadian Valley and Bear Creek plants and construction of the Demicks Lake plant are progressing on schedule. Kevin will discuss these projects in more detail shortly.","Increased ethane recovery and Mid-Continent volume growth remained key drivers of our 2018 guidance. And so far this year, we\u2019ve seen both. STACK and SCOOP of volumes on our system continue to meet or exceed our expectations, and demand for ethane continues to ramp up with additional ethane crackers coming on line this quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Walt.","Walt Hulse","Thank you, Terry.","ONEOK\u2019s first quarter operating income totaled nearly $420 million, a 30% increase year-over-year and a 6% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2017. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $570 million, a 24% increase year-over-year and a 4% increase compared with fourth quarter 2017.","During the first quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.77 per share and in April announced another 3% increase to $0.795 per share or $3.18 per share on an annualized basis, which is payable on May 15th. We generated more than $115 million of distributable cash flow in excess of our dividends paid in the first quarter. Total distributable cash flow in the quarter was more than $430 million, with healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4 times.","In January, we successfully completed a $1.2 billion equity offering, pre-funding a significant portion of our more than $4 billion capital growth program. At March 31, our debt-to-EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was 3.8 times. On an annualized run-rate basis, we are 3.5 times. As we said previously, we expect our leverage to increase modestly as we move through the construction cycle on the larger capital growth projects we\u2019ve announced this year. But we continue to view leverage of 4 times or less as an important target for ONEOK over the long term.","We expect to fund our capital growth projects through excess cash flow from operations and ample borrowing capacity while maintaining our strong credit metrics. We ended the quarter with no outstanding commercial paper and nearly the full $2.5 billion available on our credit facility. Since December 31, we\u2019ve decreased total debt outstanding by $1 billion. ONEOK\u2019s strong liquidity offers us financial flexibility and the ability to repay current debt maturities with cash from operations and short-term debt or to opportunistically access the long-term debt markets.","We are maintaining our financial guidance expectations for 2018 and continue to expect no need to issue equity in 2018 and well into 2019, if at all.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update, let\u2019s briefly discuss the March FERC announcements and potential impact to ONEOK. First, related to interstate natural gas transportation pipelines, which represent only slightly more than 5% of our total 2018 adjusted EBITDA. A couple of key points. Most of ONEOK\u2019s natural gas pipeline demand charge contracts have been established through shipper-specific negotiated rates and settlements and are not based on cost of service calculations. Additionally, as a corporation, ONEOK is a taxable entity. So, any taxable allowance adjustments on cost of service rates would reflect an adjustment to the newer lower corporate tax rate, not an elimination of the tax allowance.","From a regulatory timeline perspective, we do have a couple of interstate pipelines with upcoming rate cases, including Viking, which is required as part of its previously negotiated rate settlement to put in place new rates by January of 2020. Midwestern, which is currently undergoing a routine FERC-initiated Section 5 rate review, with any changes in rates being prospective only. Guardian has negotiated rates for virtually all of its firm capacity through 2022. And Northern Border Pipeline recently implemented new FERC approved settlement rates. We do not expect the ultimate outcome of any of these matters to materially impact our financial results.","Moving on to FERC regulated natural gas liquids pipelines. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty as to how changes related to tax policy may be applied or what adjustments may be made related to indexing during FERC\u2019s next five-year review. We\u2019ve taken a close look at our NGL pipelines that could potentially see some impact from indexing adjustments. A key item to understand about ONEOK is that the vast majority of volumes transported on our NGL pipelines are at negotiated rates, which we expect would see very little impact from a change in indexing. We expect that a 100 basis-point change to the FERC index rate would have an annualized impact to ONEOK\u2019s revenue of less than $2.5 million. We feel this hypothetical provides a good look at what could happen in a downside scenario. And we expect the impact will be immaterial.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments.","Kevin Burdick","Thank you, Walt. Starting with the performance of our natural gas liquids segment. First quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year and 11% compared with the fourth quarter 2017. NGL volumes gathered in the first quarter averaged 855,000 barrels per day, a 12% increase compared with the first quarter 2017 volumes and relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter 2017. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by increased volumes in the STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent, a trend that we expect to continue throughout 2018.","Winter weather impacted first quarter volumes relative to the fourth quarter, but we\u2019ve since seen volumes pick up in April. Volumes on our West Texas LPG system reached more than 200,000 barrels per day on several occasions in April, and system-wide NGL gathered volumes reached more than 900,000 barrels per day on multiple days during the month.","NGL volumes in the Mid-Continent are materializing at or above our expectations at this point in the year, driven by strong producer results in the STACK and the SCOOP. In the Williston Basin, our Bakken NGL Pipeline remains full, and we continue to expect to begin transporting additional NGL volumes by rail in the second quarter 2018 to provide interim takeaway capacity until Elk Creek is in service.","NGL volumes fractionated averaged more than 690,000 barrels per day during the first quarter, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year and a 2% increase compared with last quarter. Ethane volumes on our system have increased approximately 50,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2018 compared with the same period in 2017. Our reported ethane rejection levels may look relatively unchanged year-over-year. However, this comparison is affected by our 12% increase in NGL volumes gathered since the first quarter 2017. A portion of this increased volume is attributable to ethane recovery.","We are seeing increased demand from newly operational petrochemical facilities and exports, and we expect demand to continue to ramp up through the remainder of the year as recently completed crackers operate at full rates and additional facilities are completed later in the year.","Higher optimization and marketing activities in the first quarter also contributed to the segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA increases, resulting in approximately $25 million increases, both year-over-year and sequential quarter-over-quarter. Wider NGL location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu and the sale of NGL inventory previously held contributed to the increases. We expect wider spreads between Conway and Mont Belvieu to continue until our Arbuckle II goes into service as growing volumes from new production consume available transportation capacity between the two market centers.","Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased 26% year-over-year, driven by volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas. Adjusted EBITDA decreased approximately 9% compared with the fourth quarter 2017 due primarily to higher third-party processing costs, weather impacts in both of our regions, and temporary system constraints in Oklahoma due to the volume growth. These higher weather-related costs were isolated and are not expected to continue.","A key metric for the quarter was our volume growth. Average natural gas volumes processed in the first quarter 2018 were more than 1.7 billion cubic feet per day, a 24% increase compared with the first quarter 2017 and a 3% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2017. Volume growth compared with the fourth quarter was primarily driven by increased STACK and SCOOP volumes, where processed volume averaged 845 million cubic feet per day during the quarter, a more than 6% increase from the fourth quarter and our highest volumes processed to-date in the Mid-Continent. We connected 112 wells in the Williston Basin and 35 wells in the Mid-Continent during the first quarter. We continue to expect approximately 650 total well connections in 2018.","We have approximately 75 million cubic feet per day of available processing capacity in Oklahoma, including the 200 million cubic feet per day offload that is fully in service. And we will add an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity in the fourth quarter 2018 with the completion of our Canadian Valley plant expansion.","Available processing capacity in the Williston Basin is approximately 125 million cubic feet per day currently, but this will be reduced with the return of warmer weather and additional well connections. We\u2019re in the process of expanding our Bear Creek plant and related infrastructure, and expect the initial expansion to 130 million cubic feet per day from 80 million cubic feet per day to be complete in the third quarter of 2018. This expansion will require no additional capital at the plant and minimal capital for additional field compression. Additionally, our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake plant is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2019.","In the natural gas pipelines segment, first quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 13% year-over-year and 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2017, primarily benefiting from higher interruptible transportation volumes and increased storage services. The segment this month completed its 100 million cubic feet per day westbound expansion of our ONEOK Gas Transportation system, and we continue to have discussions with producers in the Permian Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas to accommodate additional natural gas takeaway capacity, given the strong growth expectations in those plays.","As for the general market conditions, producer activity across our operating footprint remains strong. In the Williston Basin, our customers continue to experience production increases resulting from drilling and completion improvements, which is causing more of the play to have strong economics, specifically further south and west in McKenzie County and further north in Williams County. ONEOK has substantial acreage dedications in both of these counties.","In the STACK and SCOOP areas, it\u2019s a similar story. Producers continue to test various drilling and completion techniques and different formations to determine what provides the best results. The volumes we\u2019re seeing on our system so far this year from the STACK and SCOOP areas are extremely positive and have met or exceeded our expectations at this point. This continued activity gives us confidence in our volume growth outlook across our operations.","Terry already touched on our growth projects and construction progress. But in addition, we continue active discussions with producers and processors for additional commitments on our announced projects. We\u2019ve contracted an additional 40,000 barrels per day on our Arbuckle II, a 20% increase in contracted volumes since the project was announced in February. We\u2019ve also seen a 20% increase of committed volumes on Elk Creek since it was announced, with more than 120,000 barrels per day now contracted.","Terry, that concludes my remarks.","Terry Spencer","Thanks Kevin for that really good and thorough update.","Before we take your questions, I think it\u2019s important to mention the Western Oklahoma wildfires. Although the fires had a minimal impact to our facilities, the fires did affect and caused hardship for several of our employees. Some employees experienced significant damage to their homes, buildings or to their farm and ranch lands. Fortunately, last week, rainfall soaked the region and helped firefighters contain the wildfires, which have charred almost 550 square miles. I want them to know that we\u2019re thinking about them as they recover and rebuild. Much work lies ahead for those impacted by the fires. And ONEOK is here to help by making resources available to those employees in need of assistance.","To our investors, thank you for your continued support of ONEOK. And as always, thank you to our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to operating our assets safely and environmentally responsibly.","So, with that, operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Eric Genco with Citi. ","Eric Genco","Good morning, guys. You\u2019ve talked in the past about Mid-Con processing each 200, and that plant produces roughly 20,000 to 25,000 barrels a day of NGLs. Can you just remind me what\u2019s a decent rule of thumb for the Bakken, even if we were to assume full ethane rejection.","Kevin Burdick","Eric, it\u2019s Kevin. If you assume full ethane rejection, you\u2019re probably talking in that same range.","Eric Genco","Okay. So, I\u2019m just think about this now. I was looking back, a year ago, I mean, the Bakken pipeline was basically full a year ago. And if you look at the statewide data February to February, year-over-year, it\u2019s almost a 400 a day increase -- Mcf a day increase. So, basically, the simple math of that would suggest that there is another 50,000 barrels a day. So, I\u2019m just trying to put this in the context. If you need to get to 100,000 a day on Elk Creek, are you basically with what must be being railed out of the basin now? Are you basically half way there with your targeted returns?","Kevin Burdick","First, we\u2019re not railing today. So, the pipeline\u2019s been able to run a little above nameplate. So, that\u2019s out there. The numbers last year did have some additional -- if you remember, had some additional ethane included in those barrels for our spec due to specification issues downstream. So, we\u2019ve since been able to back some of that ethane out and replace it with C3 Plus as we\u2019ve had other additional ethane come on from other parts that are flowing in to the Mid-Continent frac assets. But, where you\u2019re going with, as we continue to rail and you look at the available capacity we\u2019ve got and you look at the Demicks Lake plant that we\u2019ll be adding, the Bear Creek expansion, yes, if you start doing the math on that, we are a long ways down the road as those assets fill up to meet the commitments and to meet the numbers we\u2019ve provided for Elk Creek.","Eric Genco","I guess, maybe switching a bit. I just want to ask, I know you have the question fairly regular but around ethane and NGL exports more broadly. If you look at your asset portfolio, you are probably the largest player without an export terminal in-house. And recognizing that your molecules can still get the docks today, still potential margin opportunity. How aggressively would you be pursuing in other export terminal? We saw another player announced a JV, someone came in on an ethane terminal? Is that something you are after or could be there what would be a structure for that that might be interesting?","Terry Spencer","Yes. Eric, this is Terry. So, we\u2019ve been thinking about exports for many years. And so, we\u2019ve been very actively engaged in developing opportunities. We came real close a few years ago with an opportunity that would have involved the third-party JV partner. It didn\u2019t materialize as the economics eroded significantly. We continue to work the exports side. Most likely if we did put an export project together, it probably would involve a potential JV. It could involve existing facilities that are already in place that need to be modified, and it could consist of just a completely grassroots new facility. But we do and continue to remain very interested in having exports -- export capability. It\u2019s not absolutely essential that we have it because we have international relationships in markets and market access today. But to your point, it\u2019s a good solid, fee-based business that would be a nice bolt-on added to our service capabilities. So, yes, we continue to remain highly interested and continue to be very active in that regard.","Operator","We will go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Just maybe to stick on the whole ethane thesis for a bit. There is sort of a broader thesis out there about the Permian tightness for capacity to evacuate natural gas out of the basin, could incentivize more recovery of ethane in the Permian at the expense of other basins. Is that incorporated into your ethane recoveries? You had a bigger number this quarter, but you still got into a lower number. I\u2019m just trying to square the circle here.","Kevin Burdick","Shneur, this is Kevin. As we look at ethane recovery, our premisses haven\u2019t changed. And when we still are confident in the numbers we see coming out, yes, you are seeing some downward pressure on basis, on gas basis in the Permian. But, by and large, we believe the vast majority of ethane is already -- is already being recovered out of the Permian. So, how much incremental ethane can continue to come out? I don\u2019t know that -- I don\u2019t think that changes our point of view that we are still going to see ethane come out in the Mid-Continent, given the demand we are seeing, we\u2019ve seen come on line, and the demand we expect to come on line the remainder of the year. Sheridan?","Sheridan Swords","One thing I\u2019ll add is we\u2019re also seeing some pressure on Mid-Con and gas prices as well, which is making ethane to be extracted and Mid-Con very competitive with Permian.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, fair enough. And then, sort of continuing on the Permian gas theme. Roadrunner, is that an option that you guys can flip or do something with is kind of a response to what\u2019s going on in the Permian? ","Terry Spencer","Yes. We\u2019re in active discussions with several companies out there to utilize our WesTex system and also the Roadrunner system to potentially move gas bidirectionally. So, connections to potentially move gas to the west to the El Paso and Mexico markets or back to the East, back to the Waha market on Roadrunner. Similarly, with the WesTex intrastate system, lot of conversations of potentially some services around the Waha hub and also looking at bidirectional capabilities to take gas out of Waha back to the north, up to other interstate markets in the Texas Panhandle and Western Oklahoma. So, a lot of activity going on with our commercial team on the gas pipeline side. And obviously as we get some of those inked up and we may make some announcements.","Shneur Gershuni","Let\u2019s say you, FID a decision given the various options you\u2019re looking at, how long would that actually take to execute?","Terry Spencer","I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t catch the first part.","Kevin Burdick","How long. These projects are very low capital, very quick timeframes. We\u2019re talking weeks or months, not years. This is install some compression, maybe you have to install little piping and we\u2019re done.","Operator","Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","Last time the Belvieu-Conway spread was wide, [ph] you guys had a decent amount of capacity for your proprietary use. Last quarter, you said Sterling was about 60% to 70% utilized. So, I think that leaves 130, 140,000 barrels a day open. I\u2019m guessing some of that is expected for the ethane extraction that you\u2019re expecting and some of that\u2019s for just general growth in Oklahoma production. If ethane rejection doesn\u2019t fall from 140,000 to 70,000 barrels per day by year-end, does that mean you essentially have 70,000 barrels per day that you could use for optimization? Just trying to figure out how we should think about the impact of wider spread for you.","Sheridan Swords","I think, you\u2019re looking at it right. To the extent that ethane does not come out, that does leave us more opportunity for optimization. We\u2019re seeing volume growth today that\u2019s probably pushing our Sterling system to the 80 to 90% range. And then, also, one thing we are seeing today is also we\u2019re moving more wide grade onto the bigger line the Sterling III line if we can\u2019t utilize all the capacity. So, we get a little bit of a degradation there. So, there is no doubt. If the ethane doesn\u2019t come out, these spreads are staying wide, optimization will more than cover that shortfall.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then, one of your competitors who is currently building a pipeline in Taxes, announced that it\u2019s also going to be building a line to connect to their plants in the Mid-Con. Should we think that there is a potential for volumes to come off your line in the future, or is this more of an opportunity cost and that volume from their future plants will likely be going down that line?","Terry Spencer","Yes. That pipeline is connected into -- will connect into a plant that\u2019s currently on our system. So, we will probably see about 20,000 barrels a day come off our system later this year. But, I think that will be the extent of it. As Kevin mentioned in his statements earlier that we\u2019ve already contracted more volumes in the Mid-Continent and part of that is in the Arkoma. [ph] So, we did not see that we -- will prevent us from continuing to secure plant commitments in that area.","Christine Cho","And then, do you expect the change in flaring rules in the Bakken to impact you guys at all, on the G&P front?","Kevin Burdick","Christine, it\u2019s Kevin. No, we don\u2019t. Historically, our flaring has been well below the -- has been at or below the state flaring capture targets and we\u2019ve been below the statewide averages. So, we get to the wells in a timely manner with the capacity we have available right now and the expansions and the new plant we are talking about. We still feel good that we will be able to stay ahead of those targets. And we don\u2019t necessarily think the new regulations will have any impact on us. Chuck?","Chuck Kelley","I think, the only thing I\u2019d add to that is with flaring rules going from 14 to 60 days for the producer, as Kevin said, we connected these pads and these wells very quickly that extra 46 days, it\u2019s not even an impact to us because we typically out there tied it already.","Christine Cho","And then, lastly, I basically remember you guys awarding one share to all of your employees every time the stock hits an all-time high. You guys aren\u2019t that far off from high. The next time this happens, what\u2019s the impact on G&A?","Walt Hulse","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve actually provided that estimate in the past. So, I\u2019m not going to provide it now. But I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s a problem.","Operator","We will go next to Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo.","Praneeth Satish","I\u2019m sure you are aware that ethylene margins have declined. Just curious on your thoughts on this. And whether you see this as just a temporary risk or a longer-term issue?","Terry Spencer","Praneeth, I think broadly, it\u2019s a temporary issue. And Sheridan can give you some more color.","Sheridan Swords","I think, the big thing you need to look at is -- and you heard other companies say the same thing is if you look at the ethane to polyethylene spreads, they are significantly wider now than they were a year ago. And that\u2019s really what these correctors are looking at what the fundamentals are. So, we are still seeing great -- it looks like there is great demand for polyethylene out there. So, I think you are really talking about is temporary phenomenon at this time.","Praneeth Satish","And you have some excess ethylene inventory?","Sheridan Swords","We came in and at the last we heard we came in, the crackers came in with little excess inventory, they just need to get to derivative units ramped up to hit this point out. So, I think you are seeing it\u2019s going to be cleaned up the next couple of months, the next couple of months to quarters.","Praneeth Satish","And then, can you just talk about where you stand on gas takeaway in the Bakken with respect to BTU limits, so I guess the Northern Border? And then, tied to that question, if we are hitting limits, could we start to see meaningful ethane recovery out of the Bakken on Elk Creek?","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin. We still feel good about where we\u2019re at right now with the residue going into Northern Border. We are not seeing any downstream impacts. Now, as we have talked about that, yes, if you continue to push higher BTU content into Northern Border and it\u2019s displacing dryer Canadian or lower BTU Canadian gas, then you could get to the point where you would see some downstream impacts. But, we don\u2019t see that happening in the next couple years. But, that\u2019s going to be driven more from the volume growth in the Bakken and what happens there. So, it\u2019s not an immediate problem and\/or opportunity for us, but it is something that we\u2019re clearly keeping our eye on.","Operator","We will go next to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Sterling [ph] for Jeremy. On the G&P segment, it appears your average were pretty high this quarter. I understand it\u2019s a larger than mix shift impact. But curious if you can expand $0.80 is still the right way to look at it.","Chuck Kelley","Going into the quarter, obviously we expected the $0.80 average fee rate to in fact be there. As we went through the quarter and ultimately exited the quarter, yes, our Mid-Continent volumes were up. So, you would expect that fee rate would have declined or bit in the $0.80 range. However, our Bakken fee rate increased due to volume from certain large 100% fee-based contracts. If you recall, we have really several kinds contracts, some 100%, some 100% with a little bit of pop. But, these were large 100% fee-based contracts that ultimately caused the segment\u2019s overall fee rate to increase to the $0.88 level.","Kevin Burdick","The only thing I\u2019d add\u2026","Chuck Kelley","I was just going to say, a lot of that is driven by the weather when you think about what\u2019s going on in both the Williston and Oklahoma. You have certain areas where you have more wells off-line and did impact different contracts. So, it\u2019s not uncommon for us to see a little bit of noise related to that fee rate due to the weather impacts.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And on your optimization and marketing results, just kind of curious what NGL products you\u2019re optimizing during the quarter.","Chuck Kelley","Right now, we\u2019re seeing EP spreads in the $0.16 range; propane in the $0.15 and normal butane in the $0.18. So, we\u2019re pumping as much as all that that we can.","Unidentified Analyst","And then, last one for me. G&P segment, I apologize if I missed it. But can you discuss the higher third-party promptings cost and system constraints.","Kevin Burdick","This is Kevin. That was really kind of an isolated phenomenon in the first quarter. As we talked about the 200 million a day third-party, long-term third-party offload we have, as we were transitioning volumes from other third-party offload that we were kind of using the bridge into that, as we worked through the startup process on the long-term offload, we incurred some additional costs as we worked through that transition. That\u2019s really what that was. And similarly, just from other constraints that were going on as we saw the volume growth and as we were trying to move volumes around to ensure that we got it to a processing plant, we had some of that. But we do not expect those costs to continue as we have transitioned to our longer term third-party offload. It\u2019s fully in service and is at much more attractive rates.","Unidentified Analyst","So, shouldn\u2019t see anything show up in 2Q then?","Kevin Burdick","No.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Zarahn with Mizuho.","Brian Zarahn","You discussed Permian gas takeaway projects that you\u2019re evaluating. Any update on potential expansion of your NGL system in the Permian?","Sheridan Swords","This is Sheridan. We continue, we\u2019re in advanced discussions with a couple other producers and processors in there. And so, we are expecting to -- hopefully in the short-term we will have something more to talk about on the West Texas system. But, as we have done in the past, we usually don\u2019t announce expansions until we have secured the contracts behind.","Brian Zarahn","In the Permian, I guess, on your projects overall, any impact on higher steel costs?","Kevin Burdick","No. As we have talked before, we had procured and locked in the steel prices for the pipe several months ago actually. So, we are in great shape from a steel perspective.","Brian Zarahn","And then, on financing, if you could elaborate a bit on your expectation, no equity potential in 2019. Is a key driver more, so you have additions to your project backlog or is it more the cash flow ramp and marketing contributions?","Walt Hulse","I think that if we were in a position where we saw an attractive project that we needed to add but then we would have to think a little bit harder about whether some equity was appropriate. But, the reason we put the qualifier at all, as we see the business moving today and the fact that we are starting today 3 and hey, if you annualize the first quarter at 3.5 debt to EBITDA ratio, we\u2019ve got some pretty good room there for debt capacity going forward as EBITDA expands.","Operator","We will go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin","Just the 140,000 barrels a day of ethane rejection across the system, can you give us the split between the Williston and the Mid-Continent?","Kevin Burdick","Yes, it\u2019s about 50,000 to 70,000 barrels a day in the Williston and about 70,000 to 100,000 barrels a day in Mid-Continent.","Ted Durbin","Okay, got it. I realized that changes based on the process and economic. So, if we think about the Elk Creek, the early Elk Creek expansion you\u2019re doing, how much volume can you get out that Bakken pipeline with that early construction you are doing?","Kevin Burdick","I think we can get another 10,000 to 15,000 barrels a day down the pipeline, but also that will release more of the rail volume; it had to go on rail, probably another 15,000 to 20,000 barrels a day that we could increase coming out of Bakken to go out of our rail terminal. So, I think overall that will give us about 25,000 barrels a day, could give us 25,000 barrel a day.","Ted Durbin","And that would be at the same sort of $0.30 economics that you talked about before?","Kevin Burdick","Probably a little bit. We said that when we contracted Elk Creek it was a little bit less than that $0.30 that we have seen before but it\u2019s going to be in high 20s.","Ted Durbin","And then, just this additional contracting that you\u2019ve done, both on the Elk Creek and Arbuckle with the additional commitments, is that pushing us closer to the midpoint of the 4 to 6 times build multiple range, close to low-end, how do we think about the returns now with the new commitments?","Kevin Burdick","So, how I think is the turns on the new -- with these new commitments is we will get to the 4 to 6 faster because we will have more of the ramp-up coming quicker. And we will push more towards the lower end if not even lower than the 4 times.","Ted Durbin","Can you quantify the impact of weather this quarter on your volumes and revenues, and I guess by segment if you have it? And then, the impact of the NGL inventory fell, how much did that impact the result?","Kevin Burdick","From a weather standpoint, no we\u2019re not. We haven\u2019t necessarily quantified that from -- we\u2019ve kind of given you where we\u2019re at in April. And from a G&P perspective, process, volumes. It was normal again. It\u2019s not uncommon for our volumes to be slightly off relative to Q4. So, the fact that we were up was a very positive signal from a weather standpoint. And then, on the -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go down the path of splitting out our optimization or the details of the optimization and marketing from an NGLs held in inventory. ","Operator","Next is Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Good morning and congratulations on continued great execution here. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just picking up on Ted\u2019s question about the NGL inventory with marketing. To the degree that you aren\u2019t quantifying it, can we -- do you then need to rebuild, is that a headwind in the future periods, how should we think about that?","Kevin Burdick","I don\u2019t view it as a headwind at all. Again, Sheridan talked about the spreads we\u2019re seeing right now. And a previous question also talked about the capacity we have for optimization. And if ethane shows up, great, but even if it doesn\u2019t, with the spreads there\u2019s the opportunity we will see an offset there. So that\u2019s how I think about it going forward is we do believe the spreads will remain strong. And so you would expect to see that optimization bucket stay strong.","Craig Shere","And you addressed the higher G&P OpEx for the quarter that a lot of that is temporary. I think there was some lower expense in the NGL segment. How should we think about that?","Kevin Burdick","You kind of had a little bit of both in those. If you think about -- I think we\u2019re trying to get as run rate. In the GMP segment, run rate might be a little lower than what we saw in the first quarter because of some of these costs. But you\u2019ve also got volume growth. So, as you go through the year, you\u2019ll see a little step up in op cost just for -- to deal with that volume growth. On the NGL side, we saw a higher op cost in the fourth quarter. We had several maintenance projects and expense projects and work that we did in the fourth quarter that it was probably a little artificially high. And then, you saw a step down. So, run rate there might be probably closer towards Q1, maybe a little above that. Again, as you see volume growth through the rest of the year, you\u2019re going to see a little uptick there as well.","Operator","We will go next to Rebecca Followill with U.S Capital Advisors. ","Rebecca Followill","Good morning. Just following up on the fee rate at $0.88 versus the guidance of $0.80. Are you saying that $0.80 is probably the good go to number for the rest of the year?","Kevin Burdick","Yes. That\u2019s what I would use at this point. Again, we\u2019ve got -- that will depend on how the volumes come on, on which contracts. But we do believe -- we saw some anomalies in the first quarter that drove it up a little bit and it will -- you\u2019ll see it come back down as the weather gets out and our customers get back to some of the drilling programs, and you see the volume growth. We do think that will tick down a little bit.","Rebecca Followill","And then back to Texas intrastate market and what you can do there, can you quantify how much additional capacity you can add to evacuate gas north?","Kevin Burdick","It\u2019s not -- we are not talking Bcf a day type projects. You probably got two or three different projects in the 100 million, 300 million a day type range. So, these are a little more tactical projects that we are talking about. Again, low capital, low multiple, building off our existing asset footprint, but that\u2019s how I\u2019d think about those types of projects.","Operator","We will go next to Ethan Bellamy with Baird.","Ethan Bellamy","Just a follow-up on Brian\u2019s question on the steel prices, a couple questions in that area. First, can you confirm you are not exposed on Elk Creek? Separately, other projects in your backlog, either announced or unannounced, has that meaningful moved or changed the economics there, the viability? And then, finally, will we see any movement in maintenance CapEx cost going forward if steel prices maintain current levels?","Kevin Burdick","I\u2019ll take the first one. Elk Creek, no, we are not exposed there. Again, we bought that pipe; it\u2019s already showing up. And we are locked in from a price perspective. So, nothing there. As we look at -- as we think about our backlog and other things, we have not seen any other ancillary cost escalation at this point and feel good about those projects that we\u2019ve already announced. As we think about our backlog, I mean obviously, the tariffs stuff continues to evolve. So, we will get -- as we move through it, we\u2019ll include anything there in our economics as we evaluate the economics.","Terry Spencer","Kevin, you might mention Arbuckle in terms of the steel\u2026","Kevin Burdick","Yes. That\u2019s right. We\u2019re focused on Elk Creek but Arbuckle II is also locked in as well from the steel price standpoint. So, we have got the vendors locked in, prices locked in, schedules locked in, and we are good to go there.","Ethan Bellamy","And in terms of anything you might be negotiating with customers, does it delay potential negotiated agreements on new plants if you don\u2019t know what the cost of project is going to be?","Kevin Burdick","No.","Ethan Bellamy","And then, just kind of a housekeeping item, but we\u2019ve seen a few small North Dakota flood warnings, anything to be concerned about for Q2?","Kevin Burdick","No. I mean, we -- what\u2019s that?","Terry Spencer","Not outside the ordinary.","Kevin Burdick","Again, normal to me; as we moved through April, May, we\u2019ve seen what we would consider a normal spring.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mr. Ziola for any additional or closing remarks.","Andrew Ziola","Our quiet period for the second quarter of 2018 starts when we close our books in early July and we will extend until we release earnings in late July. We will provide details on the conference call at a later date. Thank you all again for joining us and have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
