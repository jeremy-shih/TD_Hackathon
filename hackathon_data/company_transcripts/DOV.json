We would also direct your attention to our website where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Overall, I was pleased with our fourth quarter business activity and results. Among the highlights in the quarter were a continuing recovery in our shorter cycle drilling and artificial lift markets, along with strong results in our printing and identification platform. We also saw solid activity in bearings and compression, as well as our Petrochemical & Polymer markets.","From a geographic perspective, organic growth was mixed. Our U.S. activity excluding energy was flat year-over-year. Our European and China activity improved year-over-year and sequentially. Energy performed very well in the quarter, and modestly exceeded expectations.","Revenue was up 7% sequentially, largely driven by early cycle upstream applications. Our brands and compression businesses also had a very good quarter driven by a positive customer mix. Segment margin was 10.5% and EBITDA margin returned to over 20%.","Engineered Systems organic growth of 1% was driven by another strong quarter in printing and identification which had 5% growth. In the Industrial platform, organic revenue declined slightly, as activity slowed in the second half of the year at Environmental Solutions.","Fluids posted 36% revenue growth, driven by acquisitions, organically, fluids was flat. Within this result, strong activity in our Petrochemical & Polymer, as well as our hygienic and pharma markets was offset by continued softness in our longer cycle oil & gas markets.","Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue declined 1% organically, principally driven by tough comps in canned shaping equipment. Core margin performance was below expectations at Hillphoenix, due to product mix and production challenges in case manufacturing.","I am confident of the changes we are implementing will result in improvements in this business. During the quarter, we closed Rav and Wayne, and both are off to a great start. We also closed on the sale of a business not considered core to our growth strategies.","Now, looking forward. Within energy, we are encouraged by the recovery in the North American rig count and oil prices during the second half of 2016. We see strong growth in 2017 and have developed our guidance based on an average US rig count of 680 to 700 and an average WTI price of $55. Current market sentiment is a bit more bullish than our assumptions, thus our guidance may turn out to be conservative.","In Engineered Systems we expect our Printing & Id platform to continue its strong record of performance, driven by increased equipment sales and very consistent consumable revenue in our marking and coding business. Also a strong contribution from RAV will complement modest but mixed organic growth in our industrial platform.","Fluids strong growth will be driven by acquisitions, primarily Wayne, from which we expect a significant contribution to EPS. We also expect to see solid petrochemical and polymer, as well as hygienic and pharma markets. Our longer cycle oil and gas markets are expected to remain soft for the bulk of the year, especially within transport markets.","Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect solid activity in food equipment, glass doors, and specialty refrigeration cases. At this time, we expect our standard case business to be modestly down on reduced activity at a few big-box retailers. We are very focused on margin and expect it to be better as customer and product mix and manufacturing all see improvements. Order activity is showing strength early in 2017.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","That thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide three of our presentation deck. Today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 5%. Within this result, growth from acquisitions of 11%, more than offset an organic revenue decline of 2% and a 4% impact from dispositions and FX.","EPS was $1.03, which included a disposition gain of $0.36, a product recall charge of $0.09, and discrete tax benefits of $0.05. For the full year, EPS was $3.25. The earnings bridge can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck.","Segment margin for the quarter was 15.8%, adjusting for the previously mentions special items and restructuring margin was 12.8%. This result was below last year largely driven by lower organic revenue and the impact of acquisitions.","Bookings increased 7% from the prior year to $1.7 billion. On an organic basis bookings declined 1%, acquisition growth of 12%, more than offset the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX.","Organic bookings in Engineered Systems grew 2%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 2%, while Fluids and Energy were down 3% and 4%, respectively. Total company book-to-bill finished at 0.98.","Our overall backlog increased 8% to $1.1 billion, and on organic basis backlog declined 1%. Free cash flow was $240 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year we generated nearly $700 million of free cash flow or 10.3% of revenue.","Now let's turn to slide four. Engineered Systems organic revenue increased 1%, reflecting solid growth in Printing & Identification, partially offset by soft industrial markets.","Fluids organic revenue was essentially flat; Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 1%, driven by tough comps in canned shaping equipment. Energy organic revenue was down 8%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids and Engineered Systems at 37% and 8%, respectively.","Now on slide five. Energy revenue of $293 million decrease 9%, on a sequential basis, revenue increased 7%. Earnings were $31 million and segment margin was 10.5% including restructuring costs of 1 million. These results exceeded our expectations and reflected very strong incremental margin.","Bookings of $300 million were down 5% year-over-year, but more importantly showed 11% sequential improvement. These booking trends, along with continued rig count additions set us up for a strong start to the year. Book-to-bill finished at 1.02, of note December book-to-bill was 1.09.","Turning to slide six, Engineered Systems revenue of $626 million was up 5% overall, included in this result is organic growth of 1% and net acquisition growth of 5%. Slightly offset by FX.","Earnings of $97 million increased 8% principally reflecting a strong performance in Printing & Identification and the benefits of productivity. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $268 million increased 4%. Organic revenue was up 5% reflecting solid global marketing coating markets and strong digital printing equipment activity.","In the industrial platform, revenue increased 5% to $374 million. This result included net acquisition growth of 7%, and an organic decline of 1%. The organic decline reflected slower activity at Environmental Solutions.","Margin was 15.5%, a 60 basis point improvement, primarily reflecting the benefits of productivity programs. Excluding acquisitions, margin was 17.3%, up 220 basis points on a comparative basis.","Bookings of $643 million were up 6% overall, including organic bookings growth of 2% and growth from net acquisitions of 5%. Organically, Printing & Identification grew 8%, while Industrials declined 2%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01, industrial book-to-bill was 1.04. Overall our book-to-bill was 1.03.","Now let's move to slide seven. Fluids revenue increased 36% to $483 million. Revenue performance reflects 37% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% FX impact. Organic growth was essentially flat.","This result primarily reflects strong shipments to Petrochemical & Polymer customers, and continued strong results in pharma and hygienic markets, offset by weak longer cycle oil & gas markets, especially in transport.","Earnings decreased 44% to $35 million, excluding the product recall charge and restructuring, earnings improved modestly. Margin in the quarter was 7.2%, excluding the product recall charge and restructuring, margin was 13.6%.","Of note, core margin remained very solid at over 18%, which further adjust for the impact of acquisitions and related deal costs. Bookings were 457 million, an increase of 42%. This result principally reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 3%. Book-to-bill was 0.95.","Now let's turn to slide eight. Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s revenue of $376 million included an organic revenue decline of 1%. The revenue decline was largely driven by project timing in our can shaping business.","Earnings of $118 million included a disposition gain of $85 million. Adjusting for this gain and restructuring, earnings were $34 million down 30% from the prior year, and adjusted margin was 9%.","Production and efficiencies of about $7 million at Hillphoenix accounted for the majority of this decline. Bookings of $337 million decreased 2% organically, principally reflecting soft order activity by a few big-box retailers. Book-to-bill was 0.89.","Let's move on to the overview on slide nine. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $32 million, higher than our forecast and includes a settlement of approximately $3 million.","Net interest expense was $33 million, largely in line with expectations. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25.4%, CapEx was $49 million in the quarter.","Moving on to slide 10, which shows are 2017 guidance. To start, let me say our revenue guidance is unchanged from the forecast we shared at our investor meeting just two weeks ago. We expect total revenue to increase 10% to 12% including organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. We also expect acquisitions will add approximately 10% growth, partially offset by completed dispositions and FX.","From a segment perspective, energy is expected to grow 13% to 16% organically, driven by improving upstream and North American oil and gas fundamentals. Engineered Systems organic growth is anticipated to be 1% to 3% driven by very solid printing and identification markets. We expect both fluids and refrigeration of Food Equipment to post flat to 2% organic growth.","Corporate expense is anticipated to be around $125 million, up about $12 million over last year, reflecting a comp reset and planned investments as we further implement Dover business services across the company.","Net interest expense is up modestly over 2016 on the funding of the Wayne deal. We forecast the full-year normalized tax rate to be about 28%, CapEx should be around 2.4% of revenue and we expect to generate free cash flow at 11% of revenue. Lastly, we expect segment margin to be around 13.7% at the midpoint of our guidance. ","Turning to the 2017 bridge, on slide 11. Let's start with 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.85. We expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2017 to be $0.08 to $0.10. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity pricing and restructuring benefits will add $0.81 to $0.95 to earnings. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.15 to $0.13. Growth investments comprise about two-thirds of this total.","Lastly, the combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate will be a $0.19 to $0.17 headwind. In total, we expected 2017 EPS to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents a 23% increase over the adjusted prior year.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Brad. I am very optimistic about 2017, and believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us.","Within Energy, we see improving US oil and gas markets driving growth in our drilling, artificial lift, and automation businesses, which represent about two-thirds of this segment revenue.","For this segment, we are expecting strong organic growth in 2017. Within Engineered Systems we see adoption rates of digital printing continuing to grow, and our marketing and coding business, marketing conditions remained favorable and we expect continued strong execution.","Additionally, our recent RAV acquisition will be a significant contributor to growth and we are excited to become an even stronger partner with our customers in the global vehicle service markets. We also expect our core industrial businesses to post modest organic growth.","In Fluids, 2017 strong growth will be driven by recent acquisitions, most notably Wayne, we have a great management team in place who are fully focused on the EMB opportunity, and capturing significant synergies. Modest organic growth will largely be driven by strong hygienic and pharma markets and improved customer activity in our petrochemical and polymer and industrial markets.","Lastly, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, recent strong bookings and can shaping equipment has set Food Equipment up for an improved 2017. We also expect another solid year for glass doors and specialty refrigeration cases, also encouraging is the fact that we are well booked in refrigeration cases for the first quarter.","And, I fully expect margin to expand in the second half of the year, as our improvement initiatives take hold. As we begin the year, our markets are largely constructive, and I am confident we will execute well and deliver on our 2017 plans.","In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers.","Now, Paul, we will take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks. Before we open up the line to questions, I just again like to remind you as a courtesy if you can ask one question with a follow-up, will be able to get more questions and we have over 20 people in queue. So with that, Kristine, let's take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Jeff.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","I've got two unrelated questions, if you can take them. First, just on Wayne itself, Bob, now that you've got it closed. Can you just share a little bit kind of \u2013 it's performance here the last three to six months, the trends in the business into the close, so to speak, and is there any kind of overhang or anything to be thinking about in the first half as you digested?","Bob Livingston","So there \u2013 Jeff, I'll give you a comment on the second half of '16 because that's really when we started tracking their performance on a fairly close basis. As we have communicated and as we expected, the retail fuel and market does build quarter-to-quarter sequentially through the year. We saw that happen at Wayne.","I would say for the second half of the year, revenue plan they were perhaps \u2013 they perhaps lately exceeded it, they actually had a strong \u2013 a pretty solid and strong December, our first month of ownership with them. So we were quite pleased with the performance of the business in the second half of the year.","I'll actually share this with you for those who may be interested if you are trying to fill out your models. I think the revenue we booked under what the 3 or 3.5 weeks of ownership in December, Jeff, I think it was approaching $50 million.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. Great.","Bob Livingston","Very strong margin, but you know, dilutive to the results of Dover because of \u2013 to your question on overhang, we had some expenses and cost in the fourth quarter. But, Jeff, as we go forward, we are going to continue to see charges through the P&L related to Wayne and capturing the synergy benefits.","I would say, those amount to about $9 million to $10 million or so in 2017 and not having all the date in front of me, I'd say they're pretty evenly spread. I don't see any big impacts sort of the first quarter on Wayne related to synergy costs.","Jeffrey Sprague","We, obviously, don't have any idea of like how - what Wayne's plan look like versus history or anything. But would you characterize the performance as up versus 2015? Do you have visibility\u2026","Bob Livingston","No. We actually do have, I don't have the exact data. But I do know that it was up in '16 over '15, Jeff. ","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. Thanks. Could you just quickly and I'll get off on price for Energy, I think you said you weren't planning it and Baker out there this morning saying that people are begging for prices to be held flat so to speak.","Do think there will be upward pressure on price for you, price realization? Is that starting to happen in your business yet?","Bob Livingston","Upward pressure on price, you are asking if the customers are going to encourage us to raise our prices? I don't think that's going to happen.","Jeffrey Sprague","No, are you going despite the discouragement raised it anyhow?","Bob Livingston","I - you could actually see that very, let\u2019s say, very judiciously in the second half of the year. I would not expect to see anything of note to occur in the first half of the year, Jeff\u2026","Brad Cerepak","And we are not planning\u2026","Bob Livingston","And we're not planning on any price increases at all for 2017. I will point out that we did end 2016 on a price down number of - I think it ended up right at 2% of revenue for the segment, Brad, am I correct? ","Brad Cerepak","Correct.","Bob Livingston","For Energy, which is what we had been guiding all year in. So I feel comfortable with, I call it, the pricing part of the Energy plan for 2017 and maybe we see a little bit of lift in the second half, Jeff. ","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Thank you very much.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Shannon.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Bob, maybe put a little more context on the comment that the energy markets are little more optimistic than what you've baked in. I mean you talked about the 1.09 book-to-bill in December. Maybe just a little context on where that stands versus what you would normally see it end of December.","And also the bearings and compression business in there actually turned this quarter too, I mean, is that going to continue or is that kind of a one-off?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So let me give answer to the questions, it\u2019s probably a shorter response on bearings and compression. The folks there had an outstanding fourth quarter. But I would also tell you it was just about as expected. We had some project shipment scheduled for the fourth quarter.","The team did a great job of executing. They delivered good margins on that, but it was some project activity, Shannon. We looked into 2017 for bearings and compression. We've got modest organic growth in bearings and compression. It is a bit lumpy.","We're not going to see sequential growth in B&C from the fourth quarter to the first quarter simply because of the strong project shipments in the fourth quarter, but we will see growth in 2017.","Comment on the \u2013 let's call it the upstream activity. Look, the headline number we all watch, right, actually I would say two headline numbers that we watch and we one of them we can see weekly is rig count deployment, and so we all know what the trend line has been. The \u2013 we were \u2013 nobody was more pleased to see the rig count increase that was posted last week. I think it was 35 or 37 units, Brad, 35?","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","So, as we start here in January, maybe our rig count assumption is a bit conservative. That said, Shannon, don't look at rig count as being the leading indicator for the entire segment. It is a very, very good indicator for our drilling activity and, in fact, I would tell you that in 2016.","Our drilling activity increased perhaps even a little bit stronger than we saw in the rate of change with respect to rig count in the second half of the year. I think some of that was a little bit of restocking. But in 2017, I would expect our drilling activity to pretty highly correlate with the rig count that's not quite true with automation and artificial lift.","The significant increase in CapEx spending that we've seen with customers in the second half of 2016, and I suspect the lion's share of some of the increase CapEx spending that we'll see in the first \u2013 at least in the first quarter of 2017 is highly weighted to drilling.","We are seeing increases in well completions. But it is not nearly at the rate that we\u2019re seeing with rig count increases. We do expect well completion activity to pick up during the year but the rate of change in the first half \u2013 second half of last year was nowhere near the rate of change we saw in rig count. I hope that gives you some color.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Yeah. That's great Bob, thanks. And just one quick follow-up on the sequential margin there it was very strong leverage sequentially even adjusting for restructuring 3Q to 4Q. Anything in particular, I mean other than was that mainly the fact that the drilling business had a strong quarter or were there any other positive mix factors to consider in for Q4 for Energy?","Bob Livingston","Well, you're right about the drilling \u2013 our drilling business having a very strong fourth quarter, but again I'll give a shot out to the guys at bearings and compression. The revenue increased sequentially from the third quarter to fourth quarter and delivered pretty good margins on that business.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, of course the board in Energy they were sequentially up as you know, and the margin conversion was quite good. In fact, going into 2017, sequentially, we would expect very strong margin conversion and year-over-year margin conversion in Energy in excess of 40%.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Andrew Caddell [ph] for Deane. Once that you give some more color on the declines you've been seeing in Environmental Solutions and I think how long you expect this to persist and what might be in guidance?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So the second half \u2013 I'm not sure I can separate the fourth quarter from the second half on that. The second half activity was probably down \u2013 gosh it could have been as much as 5% or 6% versus the first half of 2016 just within Environmental Solutions and we actually weren\u2019t expecting that.","We were expecting a little bit of a falloff in the fourth quarter, but as we came into the second half of year we weren't expecting that falloff in the third quarter. We see the softness continuing in Environmental Solutions through the first quarter.","We think by the time we get to mid part of the second quarter that the customer buying activity returns and we'll see a much stronger revenue and earnings progression in that business and our guide reflects that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And is there a specific vertical that\u2019s causing this ongoing kind of weakness?","Bob Livingston","No. This is a fairly defined vertical. It\u2019s [indiscernible]\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you update us I think on Energy there's a pretty steep margin kind of improvement as the year progressed and just want to see if that's on track as you kind of round out January?","Bob Livingston","Well, I don't have January closed yet, but the order rates not just in Energy, I would say this for all that's on the call. The order rates here in January, in general, largely across Dover are coming in a little bit stronger than we had anticipated for January.","And specific \u2013 your specific question about conversion in Energy, I think Brad answered that a few minutes ago. We\u2019re expecting fairly healthy incremental margins in energy, a little bit better than 40% and we feel pretty confident with that. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just I'll ask question energy, I apologize. Can you comment on exit margins in December? ","Bob Livingston","Okay.","Andrew Obin","Relative to what you've\u2026","Bob Livingston","I'm going to take a guess, I know Brad is going to correct me. But I think our operating margins and this would've been no adjustments, whatever restructuring charges we had in December would've been included in this. But I think our operating margins in December were like 11.1%. They were little bit better than 11%. ","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Bob Livingston","Okay.","Andrew Obin","And that's with adjustments?","Bob Livingston","I'm sorry. Repeat that.","Andrew Obin","That was with the adjustments.","Bob Livingston","If there were any.","Andrew Obin","Okay.","Bob Livingston","If there were any restructuring charges, the margin I'm giving you includes those restructuring charges. I just don't recall what the restructuring charges were in the month.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. In the month.","Andrew Obin","Appreciate it.","Bob Livingston","We had a $1 million for the quarter.","Andrew Obin","Got you. And just to follow up on Wayne, could you just talk what it is you are seeing in the channel in terms of larger customers putting full retrofits versus readers? What are you hearing, because we are sort of hearing conflicting messages from the channel?","On one hand you have sort of big brands encouraging their retailers to do a full upgrade at the same time you do have the allegation of the cycle. ","Bob Livingston","Well, I'm not sure that we are hearing much different from that. It does vary from customer to customer and I'm referring to you said specifically to larger accounts. It's going to be a bit different.","But as a general statement, I think what we are generally hearing is that, if the dispenser is eight years or older. The dispenser on, if it's been in the field eight years or longer, I think the operators are being given strong encouragement by the brand owner to replace the dispenser in its entirety. If it's less than eight years, then we're seeing - we are simply seeing the retro - the up fit or the upgrade being sold.","Andrew Obin","And what\u2026","Bob Livingston","I'm not so sure, I don't think that's much different than what we've been hearing over the last three or four months either.","Andrew Obin","Got you. And what share of the install base is eight years or older?","Bob Livingston","Pardon?","Andrew Obin","What share of the install basis eight year\u2026","Bob Livingston","I don't have that data.","Andrew Obin","I\u2019ll take it offline. Thank you so much.","Bob Livingston","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning, all.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker","Hey, just like to start some of the peer companies have talked about customer pull-through and budget flushes at the end of \u2013 through December. Maybe outside of Energy, which you covered pretty well in your other businesses. Did you see any signs, evidence, discussion where that that might be happening?","Bob Livingston","No. I mean, we had strong order rates in December, but I wouldn't \u2013 I don't think we \u2013 that's just not part of our portfolio make a. That's \u2013 we don't think we see that.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And then on margins, both in Fluids and Refrigeration, and Hillphoenix, outside of the one timers, obviously, still \u2013 obviously we have productivity issues and refrigeration. But maybe talk about just some of the activities there from an operational basis, from a supply chain planned basis to what extent do you think you'll start to see better leverage incremental\u2019s performance?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So I think we may have shared this, maybe on our October call. I think I shared with you that our \u2013 I told that our production variances within Hillphoenix that we sort of took it on the chin was in the third quarter were about $7 million. Okay. And I think, in the fourth quarter it was a little less but it wasn't, I mean, it was still, I would still say it was too high. It was enough $5 million to $6 million range.","One of the key metrics and there are several, but one of the key metrics, one of the key KPI's that we managed to within this business is the production hours per case and we've been making slow and steady progress on that KPI for the last four or five months.","I'd like to think the trend we're seeing here in the early part of the year here so far in January is one that we continue with, but we have seen a rather significant improvement in our KPI here in January on production hours per case. ","Steven Winoker","Okay. And on the\u2026","Bob Livingston","We're not \u2013 I've told you, our guide is that the second half of the year is when we're going to start to see some improvements in margins within the segment, driven by the improvement in margins within Hillphoenix, and don't expect it any sooner than that.","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And how about\u2026","Bob Livingston","We'll try to deliver it sooner but don't expect it any sooner.","Brad Cerepak","And maybe I can add to that a little bit. And maybe just pick up where Bob left off on our margin profile. And what I would add to that is, as we progress through the year, we see the first quarter margin really setting up lower year-over-year, given the Refrigeration and some other things including Tokheim becoming what I call core now.","So I'm talking core margins, first quarter being below the prior year but then progressively improving throughout the year where we see our core margin expanding for the year, by roughly 20 basis points year-over-year, being impacted again by what we said already, by investment levels that we are making.","So the progression for the year really coming off of last year is what I would say modestly down margins in the first quarter, expanding margins throughout the rest of the year. Important that's our profile\u2026.","Bob Livingston","Its not just profile, so if I were to add to that, if you were \u2013 if you follow \u2013 if you look at the top end of our guide and look at the revenue number, the second half of the year is up about 250 million am I right on that?","Brad Cerepak","That\u2019s right.","Bob Livingston","Up about 250 million over the first half. The two Brad\u2019s comment on this, the two drivers of this is the sequential build through the year within our Energy segment and the \u2013 I call it the market profile within retail fueling, both of which we believe will be normal and ordinary in 2017.","And the pressure we're going to feel in the first quarter as Brad related on margins on a year-over-year comp, it's real and we have it in our guide that way. But we will see a significant change in business results in the second quarter and a slight improvement going into the third quarter. And we'll again, because of Refrigeration we'll see what was a seasonal roll off in the fourth quarter.","But I think you really need to look at our profile again, because the Energy model for this year of sequential improvements through the year and the impact at retail fueling is having on the Dover profile, I call it the quarterly waterfall, it does create a little bit different profile for Dover in 2017.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. And coupled with by the way let's not forget that we had gains on dispositions in first quarter and in the\u2026","Bob Livingston","In '16.","Brad Cerepak","In '16 and in the fourth quarter now. So the way I think about it first quarter 2016 was $0.52 and with margin that we're talking about we're not giving guidance for the first quarter. But I would tell you we see modest improvement off of that $0.52, and then\u2026","Bob Livingston","Not significant improvement.","Brad Cerepak","Not significant, but more significant than as we progressed through the year. So hopefully that gives you an insight on our margin expectations and what's driving the top-line into more of a back half versus first half growth rate.","Steven Winoker","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","So focus color there on margins. I'm little bit slow this morning, so just want to clarify maybe Brad or Bob, so you look at 1Q EPS of somewhere between 55 and 60 is that the right thing?","Bob Livingston","We're not going to give guidance.","Brad Cerepak","We're not going to argue with you Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Nothing to argue? Okay.","Bob Livingston","Okay. Well, he's not arguing by the way.","Nigel Coe","So switching back to Energy, just wanted to dig into some of the two smaller segments there. Automation still down significantly and I think we all view that as a bit more of a structural grow longer-term.","I'm just wondering what kind of perspective are you hearing from customers on the need or the want to automate their wealth. And typically how long into recovery is it before we see Automation spending picking up?","Bob Livingston","I think we're starting to see it now, Nigel. I actually was pretty pleased with the activity we saw in the fourth quarter within automation. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, automation growth in the fourth quarter actually may have been slightly better than we saw in artificial lift. So I was really pleased with the activity in the fourth quarter.","But more importantly, the question you ask is, what are the customers, how are we engaging with customers and what are they saying and we see this as being a significant opportunity for further growth, not only in 2017, but into 2018.","And I like the margin profile of this business. I like the level of customer engagement we have in the business and I think you'll see us post some good growth here in 2017. ","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's helpful. And then, digging into bearings and compressions, a lot stronger than we'd expected, but obviously not this in your plan. Just continue to remind us, what is driving that business? Is it more of the OE turbines or specific aftermarket? And\u2026.","Bob Livingston","Nigel, I would tell you in the fourth quarter, we did within - within bearings and compression, we did see one of our major OEMs return with some fairly strong demand that we were able to respond to rather quickly in the fourth quarter. We also had some other project type of business in our bearings business, in the bearings portfolio, but the significant part of that was with OE activity.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","The \u2013 we don't have all the details here from the cash flow statement, but it looks like there was you know, in the fourth quarter the net change in assets and liabilities was a pretty big number, it was like $140 million or something like that, backing out the first nine months.","And anything going on there, is that just \u2013 what part of the business was that in, working capital wise or was it something else like a tax dynamic?","Bob Livingston","Well, look, I think my reaction to it not having the date in front of me is that we did complete several acquisitions in the fourth quarter. You're seeing that impact on the balance sheet for sure. And so, not able to give you the date net of that or the core working capital.","You have to follow up with Paul on it in a little bit more detail, but nothing fundamentally different. With respect to the core, I'd say, if anything, we saw based on the trends to the back half of the fourth quarter that our working capital grew a little bit, Steve. So we did \u2013 we were a little bit lower on our guide on free cash flow and I would say that that's on the balance sheet but it's not a big number.","Brad Cerepak","The other color I'd give you, Steve, on that is December inventory build, we actually had December increase in inventory and that's pretty unusual for us. But the \u2013 it was in response to stronger order activity we saw in November and December.","Our order rates built through the quarter excluding refrigeration, our order rates pretty much across the board within Dover built through the quarter, we typically don't see an inventory build in December. We experienced a little bit of that this year.","Steve Tusa","Right. And I guess just another follow-up cash question on CapEx. You guys were at a relatively low level versus D&A you guys have, obviously, done a couple of big deal so there you may have enough capacity and historically your CapEx has kind of moved up with sales, it feel like it\u2019s kind of at the low end of the range right now.","Would you expected that to continue to kind of inch up as a percentage of revenues over the next couple of years as we get into recovery mode or you have plenty of capacity to kind of observe any growth you see out there?","Brad Cerepak","Look, I think the guide we're giving for '17 of 2.4% is that the number, Brad? 2.4% of revenue, Steve, that's a good number.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","I'd almost say it's a good top end number for the next couple of years. You have to appreciate, we still have even with all the cost takeouts and Energy over the last couple of years, Steve we didn't impair assets.","Steve Tusa","Right, right.","Brad Cerepak","So with respect to production tooling and autoclaves and everything else, we're \u2013 we actually won't see the standard level of CapEx within the Energy business that we perhaps saw in '11, '12, '13 and '14.","Steve Tusa","Okay, one last quick one on first quarter. Just kind of clarifying what the range of Nigel put out there, you had said up modestly, up modestly from the 52? I mean, 55 to 60 I'm not a math guy but that's you know\u2026","Brad Cerepak","I'm not either.","Steve Tusa","That's a 10% growth rate there. So that would even seem to be a little bit more punchy than what you're talking about just to make sure everybody's level set, did you say up modestly or did you say up double-digits from that year?","Brad Cerepak","I said to Nigel, I'm not going to argue with you.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Okay. I guess that's the answer. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Brad Cerepak","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Just on the fluids business\u2026","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Pumps, I know we're short of time. So pumps had flung to a slight growth rate in Q4, you know, having been down very significantly in the preceding six months. How do you see pumps revenues playing out in 2017? Was that some sort of lumpiness in Q4 that now reverses or\u2026","Bob Livingston","So it is interesting. Good pick up on that and good question. It has been something that we have all been watching pretty closely here in the second half of the year and I will tell you, we actually started to see a turn, albeit extremely small in the third quarter.","We actually had a sequentially a little bit of pick up in revenue third quarter over second quarter, and I think fourth quarter versus third quarter it was 3% or 4% improvement in our pumps revenue, so we were very pleased to see that.","We're actually forecasting a little bit of growth in organic growth in our pumps business in 2017. We're not going to see it in the first quarter. We've got some \u2013 I would call it some unfavorable comps just with respect to activity against the first quarter of last year.","There is a little bit of project activity that flows through this part of our portfolio. But we - for our standard pumps and we're seeing the pick up in general industrial activity, not in oil and gas, but for our standard pumps, we are continuing to see and expect some substantial improvement in standard pumps.","When you put it all together, look at some of the project activity, the first quarter is going to not have a strong of a showing as we saw in the fourth quarter or that we'll see in the remaining part of 2017.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then, my follow-up would just be on the extent of your ambitions on sort of further portfolio moves. Obviously, 2016 was extremely active, you spent about $1.6 billion on M&A, $200 million coming in from divestments. How are you thinking about 2017 in that context?","Bob Livingston","A bit more modestly. We've got an active pipeline, but I will - to be quite frank, it's near-term over the next three, five, six months. There's nothing upsizing our pipeline. You may see us close on a couple or maybe even three. I would label them as smaller activities and Brad it can't even be at $100 million - all three of them are much less than $100 million. So they are small bolt-ons and add-ons. But I would also tell you, don't be surprised if you see another divestitures announcement here in the next few months. ","Julian Mitchell","And buybacks just sort of\u2026","Bob Livingston","The activity will be light compared to '16.","Julian Mitchell","Got it. And buybacks?","Bob Livingston","I think we will do our best to offset dilution this year. But beyond that, I\u2019d like to keep the capital available for growth initiatives and M&A. ","Julian Mitchell","Very clear. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Bob or Brad can you talk a little bit more about the increase investment at the company and specifically within Engineered Systems? You mentioned at the Investor Day that you want to develop your products and your technology faster.","Can you give some color on what specific end markets within Engineered Systems you are targeting? Are you targeting that revenue struck market and whether the focus of these end markets is going to be market share gain or maybe to offset the more difficult markets you've seen lately?","Bob Livingston","So let's see, I think in our guide, Brad, we have $0.10, had $0.10 impact on EPS guide for '17 with respect to our growth investments. So let's say rough number that's about $25 million.","I would say half of that is within Engineered Systems. And when I \u2013 and actually to be more specific, half of that $25 million is actually within our Printing & ID platform, and it's pretty evenly split between our marking and coding business and our digital textile business.","And marking and coding, it's both, I call it some advanced and a little bit faster - I had the way I want to describe some \u2013 not so much rental product launch, let's call it some technology development that we'd like to bring on a little bit quicker than we had in our three years stat plan that we've looked at a year ago or six months ago, and some channel development.","We've got a little bit more we want to do at \u2013 in our marking and coating business around channel development and so we have green lighted these investments. They'll be phased-in during the year but we have green lighted these investments.","Within digital textile, two main areas for the increased incremental investment, number one is around channel mostly related to service capability development, especially in some of the emerging markets that we\u2019re now starting to sell equipment into.","But the one item that's different that we're going to fund this year is a technology center or even a center, let's call it a center of excellence that's focused on more than just working with our print customers.","But it's going to be set up in a way that it actually encourages and helps facilitate the owners of the label, the fashion houses, to actually allow us to get a little bit more engaged with them at an earlier point of the design cycle to also promote and push the use of our equipment. So it's about half and half but the bulk of it is in Printing & ID.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, Bob. That's helpful, and then just unrelated, can you give us a little more color on the 20 million in restructuring approximately that you're going to spend here in '17, you know, what's interesting is, if you look at '16, the $40 million you really didn't spend much at all on refrigeration.","The segment margins that you said underperformed your expectations. We know you've been working hard on sort of changes to the manufacturing process that you talked about. But do you not need to spend a little more restructuring on refrigeration what are the goals in '17?","Bob Livingston","Well, what you're asking about restructuring and as part of that within refrigeration. Within our retail refrigeration business, the answer is no. We may have a little bit of carryover within the segment, but it's actually not related to retail refrigeration. Do you want to provide some color? ","Brad Cerepak","Kind of going back to what I said before in the 20 million, the lion share of the way we think about that right now is for synergy benefits related to Tokheim and Wayne integration, I would say half of that,\u2013 I think I use the number before $9 million or $9 million to $10 million.","We\u2019ll see how that develops. But that\u2019s the current thinking of half of that going into fluids. Some of the spend is also going to be in DES as we continue to do some restructuring and some of the industrial business that we have there.","Like Bob said, very little, very little in terms of DRFE and then very little in terms of DE as well. So that's kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks, guys.","Brad Cerepak","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Good morning, guys, just wanted to ask about the Tipper Tie gains. They are $0.03 higher than what you said on January 12. Why would that be the case?","Bob Livingston","Just the simple true up to the final accounting that's the simplest way to say it.","John Inch","Okay. And then, Brad was there an offset to the $0.05 tax benefit. I know you don't \u2013 these things move around a lot. I just wanted to \u2013 it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts this quarter. I just wanted to make sure if there was an offset for that?","Bob Livingston","To the $0.05?","John Inch","Yes. But that\u2019s\u2026","Bob Livingston","That's our discrete tax and this is no real offset to that, no. So you could think about within the guide, the previous guide range of $3 to $3.05, the discrete put us \u2013 if you include them we\u2019re at the upper end of the range, if you exclude them we\u2019re at the lower end of the range versus where we were previously.","John Inch","Okay.","Bob Livingston","As you know we don't forecast discrete tax benefits. They are very lumpy. They come when they come so to speak. There was an international piece associated with this $0.05 and some state related reserves.","So very much tail end related. In fact, we had to wait to see the year completed itself before we knew for sure whether we met the goal to release them and that's why it was very late in the game.","John Inch","That's fine. What were the fluid margins X Wayne and Tokheim? I was just looking at my notes and I think there were 19.3% a year ago if you X out deal cost and purchase accounting that may not be wholly accurate. I just think I remember that. So I'm just curious.","Brad Cerepak","Well, we have the number at, I'd say excluding restructuring, deal costs and the like, last year I have 18.3.","John Inch","Okay. What were they this quarter X Tokheim, I guess Tokheim is not in there, what were the X Wayne?","Brad Cerepak","X Wayne and Tokheim, Tokheim still acquisition, this it crush over into\u2026","Brad Cerepak","In '17.","Brad Cerepak","In '17. I'm sorry. Let's make sure we got our years right here. In '16 it was 18.3%. Are you asking for what '15 was?","John Inch","Yes. I was trying to compare the apples-to-apples, Brad. I'm sorry.","Brad Cerepak","Okay.","John Inch","So the fourth quarter of 2015.","Brad Cerepak","19\u2026","Brad Cerepak","That was the full year Bob.","Bob Livingston","Yeah, 19.7.","John Inch","That was 19.7 and then what was it in the fourth quarter of '16 if you axe out the Wayne?","Bob Livingston","18.3.","John Inch","Right. Got it. Okay. That was all I had. Thanks much.","Bob Livingston","Very good. Thanks.","Operator","We have time for one final question this morning. Our final question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Maybe going back to Steve's question earlier on cash flow, so the quarter was about or the year was about $50 million lighter than we expected. Is that predominately because of big inventory build because orders were better is that - did I hear that right earlier? ","Bob Livingston","Well, no actually, I don't know if I can say predominant. I know that was one of the characteristics that was different in the fourth quarter, especially in December. I would also tell you that we actually didn't have the rollover in Hillphoenix revenue in December like we normally see.","And Hillphoenix is a pretty big generator of cash for us in the fourth quarter historically, so it is a little bit of inventory and a little bit of DSO. But I'm telling you there's nothing unusual in it, Joe.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, 50-50 maybe on that 50 million split between receivables and inventory.","Bob Livingston","What is unusual from an operating perspective is to actually see as build inventory through the quarter.","Joe Ritchie","Well, so that kind of brings me to my follow-on question, right? Because as we're progressing through 2017 it looks like you are basically forecasting high teens cash flow growth year-over-year at a time when your orders are improving, I would expect some type of inventory build. And so how are you guys thinking about inventory and just more generally net working capital for 2017?","Bob Livingston","Okay. I don't have an exact numbers here. I know we've got working capital \u2013 our working capital target for '17. I don't have the absolute number. I know we're - our internal targets are to reduce our working capital metric. I think its 60 or 80 bps in '17 with most of the emphasis, most of that improvement coming out of inventory.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. So all right, so the plan is to reduce inventory while orders are going to get better. Okay. And then maybe the last question, you guys mentioned in the Fluids business that there's improved activity in petrochem in 2017.","Is that a function of some of these petrochemical crackers that are getting completed in North America? Or what's really, kind of\u2026","Bob Livingston","No. It\u2019s \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t label North America is a big driver of that for us this year. We have participated in this. We continue to participate in that, but the upside in '17 we're actually starting to see some of the emerging economies especially in China.","In fact, our \u2013 we have had some pleasantly to note we've had even here early in January we've had a very strong start on order activity in China with respect to this vertical.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. That's good to hear. Thanks, guys.","Bob Livingston","Thanks.","Operator","That concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for any closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Kristine. Yeah. This concludes our conference call.

Goldberg","","Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Dover\u2019s third quarter earnings call. Today\u2019s call will begin with some comments from Bob and Brad on Dover\u2019s third quarter operating and financial performance and follow with an update of our 2014 outlook. We will then open the call up for questions. And as a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up.","Please note that our current earnings release, Form 10-Q and investor supplement and associated presentation, can be found on our website, www.dovercorporation.com.

We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement.

We would also direct your attention to our website, where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Livingston","","Thanks Paul. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. I was pleased with our strong finish to the third quarter.","As we shared with you a few weeks ago, we did have some pockets of unexpected softness in July and August. However, September business activity was quite strong and exceeded expectations. The overall result was revenue and bookings growth at each segment. Most notably, Fluids delivered 17% growth, while Energy and Engineered Systems each grew 8%. In all, we generated 8% revenue growth and grew EPS 8%. Our 10% bookings growth, coupled with a strong September, sets us up well for the fourth quarter. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., Europe and Asia all had solid organic growth, whereas Canada and Brazil declined year-over-year.","Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, we continue to benefit from strong U.S. well activity and an increased rig count, especially in our core production and drilling markets namely the Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken basins. This activity along with double-digit Middle East growth, more than offset weakness in bearings and winches. ","In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid growth across both platforms. Within Printing and Identification we saw growth in both our fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets, especially in the U.S. Also, our recent MS acquisition, which specializes in digital printing for textiles is off to a great start with Dover and contributed 9% growth to the platform. The industrial platform also achieved strong growth, led by outstanding results in our auto-related businesses. ","Our Fluids segment performed well, where robust market conditions for fluid transfer products, complemented by recent acquisitions, resulted in strong revenue growth. This growth is primarily tied to positive global retail fuming activity, along with tailwinds from emerging fluid transfer safety regulations.","Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue was generally solid in the third quarter, but overall results were below our expectations. Refrigeration revenue, while positive, was impacted by the timing of shipments to a major retailer, specifically in Mexico and small store formats in the U.S. We expect to deliver the bulk of these push-outs in the fourth quarter.","We have made great strides in strengthening our company in 2014. We have completed a number of productivity initiatives across the organization and have enhanced several of our businesses via acquisition, including our recently completed Accelerated transaction. Accelerated brings ESP technology, one of the fastest growing product categories in North America Artificial Lift.","In total, we have invested roughly $800 million on acquisitions year to date. As a result, we\u2019ve expanded our global footprint in Fluid Transfer, opened new markets for our Printing and Identification business and we have significantly broadened our product offerings in Artificial Lift. Our acquisition pipeline is rebuilding and our near-term focus is on smaller, bolt-on targets.","Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect solid organic growth in Energy driven by North American well activity, especially in Texas and the Rockies and improved conditions in compression, continued organic growth in Engineered Systems driven by strong dynamics in our Industrial platform and global growth in our Printing and Identification, strong results in our Fluids markets primarily driven by regulatory tailwinds in Fluid Transfer, a positive retail fueling environment and continuing solid global markets for our pump businesses and a slightly stronger seasonal pattern in Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, reflecting shipments of a very strong Q3 ending backlog.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad M. Cerepak","Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported third quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 8%. Organic revenue grew 4% and growth from acquisitions was also 4%.","Adjusted EPS was $1.35, an increase of 8%. Segment margin for the quarter was 18.5%, 110 basis points below last year. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, our overall margin was 19%. This acquisition impact was most prevalent in our Energy and Fluid segments. ","Bookings increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion. This result represents growth across all segments led by 14% growth in Fluids and 11% growth in Engineered Systems. Energy grew 9% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment posted bookings growth of 6%. Overall, book-to-bill finished at a seasonally normal 0.96. Our backlog increased significantly in the quarter, up 14% to $1.4 billion. Free cash flow was $259 million for the quarter or 12% of revenue. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 11% of revenue.","Now turning to Slide 4. All segments showed organic growth in the quarter. Fluids grew 6% benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer and Pump markets. Energy driven by strong core U.S. drilling and production markets grew 5%. Engineered Systems grew 4% with broad-based growth across both platforms. Refrigeration & Food Equipment was up 1%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 4% comprised of 11% Fluids, 4% in Engineered Systems and 3% in Energy.","Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter. Results were led by 5% growth in Energy and 4% in Fluids. Refrigeration & Food Equipment grew 1% sequentially, while Engineered Systems was essentially flat. ","Sequential bookings decreased 4%, representing normal seasonality. Energy driven by phase 2 of Queensland Gas Project grew 10%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 15% as shipments in Refrigeration normally slowed down in Q4. Fluids was down 6% as several large projects were booked in the previous quarter. Engineered Systems declined 4% on normal seasonality.","Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $507 million increased 8% and earnings of $123 million were up 3% over last year. Energy produced a solid quarter with strong revenue growth in our Drilling & Production and compression markets. This strong performance more than offset continued softness in our bearings end markets and construction related winch markets.","Within Drilling & Production growth was driven by strong U.S. well activity. The continued impressive performance of our drilling businesses and our sharply growing U.S. artificial lift business more than offset expected tough comps in Australia and a decline in Canada. The improved compression markets also helped drive solid growth. Overall, this segment continues perform at a high level and the addition of Accelerated will only serve to broaden our market opportunities in key North American basins.","Operating margin was 24.2% and included 100 basis point impact related to recent acquisitions, primarily those completed in Q2 and Q3. Bookings were $526 million, a 9% increase over the prior year reflecting broad-based growth across the segment. Book-to-bill was 1.04. Adjusting for Queensland gas, book-to-bill was at 1.0, up 3% over an adjusted prior year.","Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter were revenue of $695 million was up 8% and earnings of a $119 million increased 7%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue increased 13% to $291 million, driven by organic growth of 4% and recent acquisitions, primarily MS Printing. Of note, U.S. results for Markem-Imaje were extremely strong, up double-digits. In the industrial platform, revenue grew 5% to $405 million, all of which was organic. Our auto related businesses were particularly strong in this platform.","Margin was solid at 17.2% as the benefits of productivity mostly offset the effective business mix. Bookings were $667 million, an increase of 11%, our Printing & Identification bookings increased 10% to $281 million boosted by recent acquisition and continued solid activity in our core fast moving consumer goods markets, especially in the U.S. Industrial bookings increased 12% to $386 million reflecting broad-based growth. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.97, while industrial was 0.95. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.96.","Now, moving to Slide 8. Fluids posted a strong quarter were revenue increased 17% to $362 million and earnings of $68 million were up 7%. Revenue was driven by organic growth of 6% and acquisition growth of 11%. Our Fluid Transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in the global retail fueling markets, increasing safety regulations in Fluid Transfer and share gains. Pumps was driven by strong North American growth and new product introductions. Segment margin was 18.7%, a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Bookings were $351 million, an increase of 14% driven by Fluid Transfer; book-to-bill was 0.97.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated revenue of $529 million, up 1% over the prior year. Earnings of $78 million decreased 10%. Solid growth in refrigeration was partially offset by declines in food equipment; particularly at Belvac where project shipments can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Refrigeration growth of 3% was dampened by push outs from a major customer.","Overall, refrigeration is well-positioned to finish the year strong. backlog is up $52 million, or 16% over the prior year, and September was the largest revenue month ever for Hill Phoenix.","Operating margin was 14.8%, a 180 basis point decline from last year. this result largely reflects unanticipated supply chain costs, inefficiencies connected with customer push outs and customer mix. Bookings were solid at $459 million, an increase of 6% principally reflecting solid demand for refrigeration products. Book-to-bill was at a seasonally strong 0.87.","Going to the overview on the Slide 10. third quarter net interest expense was $31 million, up $1 million from last year and in line with our forecasts. Corporate expense was $28 million, a decrease of $5 million and generally consistent with expectations. Our third quarter tax rate was 30.8%, excluding $0.03 of discrete benefits.","Capital expenditures were $35 million in the quarter. we expect Q4 to be higher as we continue to execute on several projects. Lastly, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $100 million since the end of the second quarter. 856,000 of these were settled in Q3. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.1 million shares for $418 million.","Moving to Slide 11, which shows our full-year guidance. We expect organic revenue growth to be approximately 4%. our forecast for energy is 4% to 5% growth; likewise, we also expect Engineered Systems revenue to grow 4% to 5%. Fluids organic revenue growth is forecast at 5% to 6%, while refrigeration and food equipment is expected to have approximately 1% organic growth.","Completed acquisitions will now add 4%, up one point from our prior expectations, reflecting recent acquisitions, including Accelerated. In total, we expect full-year revenue growth to be approximately 8%. Segment margin is expected to be between 17.5% and 18%, including roughly a 70 basis point impact from completed acquisitions.","Corporate expense will now be approximately $120 million, $5 million below our prior forecast representing cost management activities. Interest expense should be about $130 million, $3 million below our prior expectations. Our full year tax rate is estimated to be near 31%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue, slightly below our prior forecast, and free cash flow is expected to be approximately 11% of revenue.","Turning to the bridge on Slide 12. We now see volume, price, and mix contributing $0.26 to $0.29. Productivity will have $0.16 to $0.18, while investment and compensation will have $0.16 to $0.18 impact. Acquisitions in aggregate will now be essentially neutral for the year. This includes the current year dilutive impact of deals already closed in the third and fourth quarters. Corporate provides a $0.04 benefit at the high-end of our prior forecast, while interest shares and taxes contribute $0.13 to $0.14, $0.04 above our prior expectations. In total, we now expect 2014 EPS to be $4.75 to $4.80, reflecting a $0.05 reduction to the high-end of our prior guidance largely driven by the impact of recent acquisitions. This represents 10% growth at the mid-point.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks Brad. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our performance especially our strong September. We delivered solid revenue and earnings growth and also saw strong quarter activity. Looking forward, I believe we\u2019re well positioned for continued success based on our products, technologies, and competitive positions. Within energy, we expect our U.S. activity to remain solid given the basins we participate in and expect our global growth initiatives to continue to yield opportunities. We are enthusiastic about our recent accelerated deal. The technology accelerated brings to our portfolio, combined with our existing rod lift products allows us to offer customers artificial lift solutions earlier and for the complete life of their wells. All of these factors positioned us very well with our customers.","In Engineered Systems, growing global applications for our Printing & Identification technology including the emerging digital textile market and the increasing awareness around food safety provides ample opportunities for expansion.","Within our industrial markets, our customers\u2019 desire for productivity solutions along with a strong market or our auto-related businesses offer significant growth prospects. Within Fluids, increasing regulations regarding vapor recovery and the safe transport of chemicals and fuels provides a strong business climate for our Fluid Transfer businesses. Additionally, our Pumps business is benefiting from generally solid markets, particularly in North America and the Middle East, as well as the introduction of new products.","And finally, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment we continue to focus on the ongoing needs of our customers for productivity and sustainable solutions. In addition, the regulatory environment is providing tailwinds with regard to energy efficiency standards, which plays to the strength of our product portfolio.","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. ","With that, Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul E. Goldberg","Thanks Bob. At this point, I\u2019d just like to remind everyone if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we would greatly appreciate it. And with that, Paula, if we can have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. ","Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Robert A. Livingston","Hi, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Hi. How are you doing?","Robert A. Livingston","Great.","Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Just on Energy, Bob. There is a little bit of commentary in the queue about margin pressure around cost. It was not clear to me if that was really just kind of some cost plus inflation or there\u2019s a negative comment embedded around price as part of that? Could you just kind of give us a little color on what\u2019s going on with price and cost in Energy? ","Robert A. Livingston","","Yes. I would say it\u2019s a little of both, Jeff, and within Energy, it would be specific to Artificial Lift. Our steel costs were up. I think the incremental cost in the third quarter versus a year ago, steel costs were up about $5 million. That\u2019s it, but it was still up.","With respect to pricing, I think we\u2019ve commented on this a couple of times this year. The Canadian market has been soft and we have seen price pressure especially on rods. In fact, I would probably say exclusive to rods, both in Canada and maybe a little bit even in the Bakken basin, but it is restricted to that.","Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","","And then, just thinking about the pre-announcement, Bob. You guided an $0.08 miss, right. That\u2019s very precise, it wasn\u2019t $0.05 to $0.10, it was \u2013 that was $0.08. What really happened at the end of the quarter? And maybe a little color at how September ended and what you\u2019re seeing here on the early part of October, if you have any other color?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So Brad, the $0.08 miss I think was split between I would call it three buckets. We anticipated a $0.03 miss in refrigeration. We were anticipating a $0.03 short fall in energy, and the balance of the $0.02 was really around increased deal cost in the third quarter that had not been anticipated as we open the quarter. Jeff, we had the $0.02 deal cost for sure and the $0.03 anticipated miss at refrigeration, my friend, we delivered that miss. The $0.03 anticipated miss on energy. I will stand up and give kudos to all of the units in the leadership teams within energy that gap was closed and I did it remarkably so in the final three weeks of the quarter. And I think based upon what we were looking at in mid-month. I think energy performed a bit better like $0.02 in September than we had anticipated. Any other color left Brad?","Brad M. Cerepak","I guess the other $0.01 which is missing in that reconciliation is a little bit better corporate based on our cost controls Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And then just a quick one and I will move on. Brad, can you give us the organic bookings in general and energy specifically?","Brad M. Cerepak","Oh, boy, I don\u2019t think I had that data in hand right now. I will ask Paul to follow-up with you on that.","Paul E. Goldberg","Yes, give it to the entire group ","Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thanks and good morning all.","Robert A. Livingston","Good morning.","Brad M. Cerepak","Good morning.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","I would be help to continue get a little more color on the energy business but just in light of the overall macro concerns that are out there and your particular exposure at the basin level, what you\u2019re hearing from customers, I mean are typically allow these customers or folks who spend what they make. And just how you\u2019re looking at that business over the short to medium-term?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, my comments Steve would be restricted to what we\u2019re seeing right now and our anticipation for the fourth quarter. There is enough noise that I am certainly right now and that I think I would reserve any comments to the beginning of the year of 2015 to perhaps our Dover Day Conference. If you want to know where are the \u2013 where our primary activity is in the basins, Permian by far is the largest basin for us, the second largest basin would be Eagle Ford, and the third would be the Bakken. And I would say that in a relationship comparison, Permian may be five times the activity versus what we see in the Bakken. With respect to what we\u2019re hearing for customers, the guys are talking to them weekly, the last \u2013 over the last couple of weeks, I would tell you they\u2019re talking to them almost every day.","Their customers are really engaged in looking at their capital budgeting and planning for 2015, we\u2019re not hearing any input from them right now, other than they are looking at it. With respect to the fourth quarter here in 2014, we have been watching our order rates everyday for the past, I would say, three weeks, if not four weeks. If we were to see a bit of a pullback, or an early sign, it would be in our drilling businesses. we haven\u2019t seen it all.","In fact the order rates, the average daily order rates in the first couple of weeks in October were at or absolutely above the third quarter average daily rate. We see no cancellations, no deferrals and we feel pretty confident sitting here today about our expectations for the fourth quarter in energy. ","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","And in that team, the energy team that was able to close the gap in the last few weeks that you commended. Was that gap closing just on it, was it on operating expense, I mean, how do they actually do it?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I would say it was primarily driven by revenue and volume, and it was one business that was across the board. We had a little bit better volume as order rates picked up in the last couple of weeks of the month. We had a little bit better volume in our drilling business, and we continued to see strong activity in the U.S. market for artificial lift. artificial lift in the U.S. finished stronger in September than we had anticipated even at the middle of the month.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay. thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on. appreciate it. ","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks. ","Brad M. Cerepak","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. ","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. good morning, guys.","Robert A. Livingston","Good morning, Nigel. ","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Bob, I just wanted to see your perspective, you call our July-August as soft enough to pre-announcement in the quarter despite the fact that you don\u2019t actually give quarterly guidance. So as the energy and refrigeration was too premature, but I was just wondering what do you think, we know we have still that usual pattern, because honestly, the macro data was just it be the other way around that maybe July, August would have been okay, September was a little bit weaker, so any perspective on that?","","Robert A. Livingston","There are two different responses. In refrigeration, Nigel, to be quite direct about it, the problem in refrigeration, number one, I will tell you the number was about $8 million in refrigeration and I would label it primarily \u2013 well, I\u2019ll take the blame for this, it was primarily self-inflicted, it was around some unanticipated hiccups and cost we have with some supply chain changes we were making as we exited the second quarter. Within energy, there was as we were looking at booking rates and especially in August, there was a growing concern that that month of September would not have the growth and the U.S. artificial lift activity that we ended up same. Let me tell you what the growth was for the third quarter. I mean, we had a fairly healthy expectation for artificial lift in the third quarter, but I think artificial lift in the third quarter year-over-year I think we were up 16%. We came into September and felt that that growth rate was probably going to fall a couple of points shy of that, as it turns out, the gap was closed pretty quickly.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then the pace of buybacks has picked up in the early 4Q and I am just wondering Bob and Brad how you know the kind of the dynamic and math between buybacks that $72 as opposed to $90 compared to M&A right now?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay, well, I would rather buyback at $72 than $93. I\u2019m not sure that \u2013 okay, Nigel we completed the $1 billion share buyback program as we exited and completed the first quarter. I think in the second quarter and the third quarter, it was a total of about $100 million of share repurchase activity with a bulk of that in the quarter three. We had as we sat and discussed, looked at share repurchase activity in July for the second half of the year. We knew we had some M&A activity that we were very hopeful on closing on in the second half and we did. I would also tell you we walked away from a couple of deals here recently were the pricing sort of gap beyond our comfort range.","I sit here today at $72. It sure deserves another topic, round of discussion with Brad and myself. I would also tell you that the balance of the fourth quarter and I would even say our visibility into the first quarter of 2015 \u2013 M&A activity is going to be very, very light. If we do anything there\u2019s going to be rather small deals. And the cash flow that we\u2019ll generate here in the fourth quarter coupled with our existing share price, this is going to get some serious discussion with Brad and myself over the next couple of weeks.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay. So it sounds like you\u2019ve pretty much done on the M&A for the rest this year?","Robert A. Livingston","I would say if we do anything it will be too small to even announce.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay. Well, thanks, Bob.","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch at Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Good morning, everyone.","","Robert A. Livingston","Hi, John.","Brad M. Cerepak","Good morning, John.","","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Bob, you\u2019ve been through these energy downturns or swings before and I think your performances really, I mean, it really stands out. What I\u2019m trying to understand is sort of connecting the dots between low price of oil, well appears to be pretty meaningful rising competition in North America, perhaps for some of your own businesses. What\u2019s the playbook here in terms of the steps you would take in anticipating and then reacting to perhaps a meaningful scale back from your customers who, I understand are already sort of planning CapEx for next year now. So they\u2019re sort of doing that against the backdrop of pretty low oil prices. And just any color you could have based on your experience would be helpful and how you\u2019re thinking about those.","Robert A. Livingston","Well, we\u2019ll refer back. As you mentioned, we\u2019ve been through this before. It seems like a long time ago, but it was in the first half of 2009 and the business leaders, the segment leadership team has the ability to take cost out just about as quickly as we did in the first part of 2009, especially in our Artificial Lift business as well as in our drilling businesses.","I would enable it, from a cost takeout point, we an attractive relationship between variable cost and fixed cost and we can pull the trigger pretty quickly in that area.","John, for you and for the others, let me sort of put this in perspective for you. So the Energy segment, rough number. It\u2019s a $2 billion revenue segment. We\u2019ve got about $500 million in revenue and what I would label as our bearings and compression part of the business, not directly connected to rig count, or the drilling activity per se. Within drilling, or which is, and we\u2019ve recognized this. Our drilling activity is highly correlated to rig count. I would say, it\u2019s $450 million to $500 million in revenue. And then that would leave our artificial lift business activity, which is roughly $1 billion. And of that $1 billion, about 20% of it is non-North American activity, but 20% of it is \u2013 we will label it as automation. And it has much less to do with drilling activity and much more around offering productivity solutions and tool sets for our customers to optimize the cash flow and the profitability of individual wells and fields.","So that needs about 60%, or about $600 million, of this $1 billion artificial lift business, around what I\u2019d call pure artificial lift tools equipment. In that 60%, rough number, rough split about 50% of it is after-market. More so on pumps than it is on rides, but about a 50% split to after-market and about 50% to new installations.","So if we were to continue to see a precipitous decline in the price of oil, I think what we\u2019re going to see it first, we\u2019re going to be watching rig counts. And we see a decline in rig counts. We\u2019re going to see it very quickly in our drilling business. And I\u2019m talking global numbers here. We\u2019re going to watch it pretty closely. We have not seen that yet, John.","With respect to new installation and artificial lift, yes, a decrease in deployed rig counts will eventually show up in artificial lift numbers. We are still depending and we\u2019ve seen this in the past, in 2009 that, that decline would start to be measured and felt, five, six, eight months after you see the beginning decline in rig counts. And I hope that gives you a little bit of detail and how we\u2019re looking at it.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","That\u2019s actually really helpful, and Bob, you mentioned that 20% automation, maybe given the constructive declining oil price is clearly one of the ways you keep these wells flowing is to make them more productive. Does this perhaps advance your own...","Robert A. Livingston","Yes, John that has been the clear strategic decision we\u2019ve made over the last five years, since the last downturn is to recognize that the automation capability that we could offer and we have grown that offering both organically as well as M&A over the last three or four years that that automation as well as our decision to expand and grow outside of North America, we think mitigates against the short decline that we saw in 2009 in this segment.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, now I just wondering if maybe you could even make a bigger splash through software control automation M&A other than in the U.S., Canada or overseas and just in responding to the environment perhaps?","Robert A. Livingston","","Okay, and I would tell you that there is nothing upsize that we have in our near-term pipeline, but the two or three that we have some interest in that we would look at and hope to close maybe in the next few months or in that area, John.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Hi, good morning guys.","Robert A. Livingston","","Hi, Scott.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","This accelerated deal, I mean, it\u2019s just a great asset people would know in the industry speak very highly of it. But is there any risk that you guys top tick this thing I mean that if indeed we do see a major breakdown in oil prices and artificial lift comes out of favor for a bit. Is there any sort of MAC clause in this that would allow you guys to adjust price down or at least protect yourselves if things do get ugly out there?","Robert A. Livingston","","Even if things get ugly I don\u2019t think it would qualify as a MAC clause, Scott. But the real answer is we now own it and there is no price adjustment.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, okay fair enough. And then I was a little bit surprised\u2026","Brad M. Cerepak","And by the way Scott, I was actually happy and pleased with the price we were able to deliver to Dover and to our shareholders\u2026","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","No, it\u2019s not expensive. I\u2019m just \u2013 it\u2019s expensive if EBITDA gets cut in half, but it\u2019s not expensive on current numbers. So my follow on is that it\u2019s a little bit surprised to hear you say Bob that you\u2019re more focused on smaller deals. And I only really raise that just because when you do see I think many companies like yours have been waiting for a pullback like this to shake assets free and get sellers of the sidelines and such. I mean is in this the exact type of opportunity where companies like Dover really can step in and provide liquidity into a market that starts to need it?","Robert A. Livingston","No, you\u2019re exactly right, but don\u2019t overlook the comment I shared earlier, I said near-term.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay.","Robert A. Livingston","when you look at what\u2019s in our pipeline that we could conceivably close on here in the fourth quarter, or in the first quarter of next year on labeling those deals that we have touched points on today is being small bolt-ons. The comment you make Scott is very, very appropriate and it\u2019s something that we talk about a lot even here in, especially here in the last two or three weeks is we see a correction like this that we believe this does give us an opportunity, but Scott for privately-owned businesses, I would tell you that there probably is at least a six-month lag on valuation set points and expectations of privately-owned businesses relative to a turning point in the public market.","Brad M. Cerepak","I think that it gets back to the Bob\u2019s point that we walked away from; in the third quarter, two what I would characterize is mid-sized deals.","","Robert A. Livingston","Similar to the size of accelerated do specifically to valuations.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Right. and were those assets of Bob or somebody else or were they \u2013 they tabled?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I think one specifically that was the size of, or if not a bit larger than accelerated. we believe that there was an agreement signed, but we don\u2019t know.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay.","Robert A. Livingston","We don\u2019t have any other detail.","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes. I would just imagine there is\u2026","Robert A. Livingston","It truly hasn\u2019t closed yet.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes. as we said, there might be some private buyers, they thought that they could get financing three weeks ago may have a little bit of a tougher time now, so\u2026","Robert A. Livingston","Yes.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Well that\u2019s great color. thanks, guys. good luck.","Robert A.

Livingston","Okay. it\u2019s interesting, first off, I would \u2013 with specific response to your question on bookings, we have not seen a slowdown in order rates, and what I would label the core business, which we look at every \u2013 sort of look at weekly and track it pretty tightly. For us, the noise and I\u2019d call it in our up and down activity around order rates, as well as revenue has been more around the project business that we have seen here with the mag acquisition we made a couple of years ago and the Fender acquisition that we closed on about this time last year. but if you look at our core business, what I\u2019d call the core pumps, the Pump Solutions Group business, it\u2019s actually been pretty steady, and even if you back out fender and mag for this year, the growth has been much more consistent than we would have shown on the top line for our Pumps Solutions Group business in total.","The North America business has continued to be quite solid, in fact our \u2013 I think our sales through distributors and North America has been up double digits this year. we have seen that continuing in the second half. We think we\u2019re in a very good product and competitive position here.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Thanks. and then within refrigeration & food equipment, you\u2019re going to split out the three different factors behind the 180 basis point margin decline in Q3. how do you see those three factors kind of changing into Q4, and how quickly should we think that margin can come back?","Robert A. Livingston","","Well, if I had the same revenue level in Q4 as we had in Q3, you\u2019d see the margin come back. the biggest, I would call it almost an embarrassment that we dealt with in refrigeration in the third quarter were the issues around supply chain and logistics, and as I commented earlier actually, I sort of do a mea culpa here and that was sort of self-inflected, I would also tell you that issue was behind us, it was, as we went through the month of September, we feel like that problem was corrected. and by the way, it was corrected well enough that we had a record revenue month at Hill Phoenix in the month of September.","A part of the issue, as I commented earlier was some push outs, I would just call it noise around scheduling that was itself inflected that we were having to deal with and that created quite a bit of labor inefficiency and scheduling inefficiencies in July and August particularly July and August. We\u2019ve got a very strong, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a record backlog or not, it very well may be, but we\u2019ve had a very strong backlog at Hill Phoenix as we exit quarter three and the bulk of \u2013 a significant amount of our activity for Hill Phoenix for the fourth quarter is actually being delivered and earned in October. And as we sit here a little past mid month, the push outs from October to the early part of November have been minimal.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Good, great.","Robert A. Livingston","Let me just add a thought here as you\u2019re asking about margins and bringing into Q4. One thing I do want to point out as we mentioned before is that our energy, I know we\u2019re talking refrigeration right now, but our energy margins in Q4 will be impacted quite significantly by the accelerated deal. And so while you see very solid margins in Q3 that core margin expectation remains, what we will see as an impact of almost let\u2019s say 450 basis points to 500 basis points impact to energy in the fourth quarter due to purchase accounting and the rollover in essence of the inventory through the P&L.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusav of J.P. Morgan","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey good morning.","Robert A. Livingston","Hi, Steve.","Brad M. Cerepak","Good morning.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Can you maybe just talk about the price cost dynamics that you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years in energy, I mean, what\u2019s kind of the annual pricing that you\u2019re getting in that business or that you\u2019ve gotten historically in that business in the last several years?","Robert A. Livingston","Brad, help me on this one\u2026","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I mean the material or is it \u2013 I mean is it\u2026","Robert A. Livingston","I would say it was more material in 2010 and in 2011 Steve than it was in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Now, we\u2019ve had a little bit. We see this not just an energy we see this across the board and over. We do always look for opportunities to be a little bit more smart or strategic in our pricing. I would say that the pricing contribution for Dover in total has been close to but perhaps a bit less in 2014 than it was in 2012 and 2013, but it has still been positive.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","So kind of like below like \u2013 around flat but up a little bit 10, 20 bps something like that?","Brad M. Cerepak","I would say 20 bps\u2026","Robert A. Livingston","I would use 10 bps to 20 bps, but you started off by asking about energy and I\u2019m going to repeat myself if you don\u2019t mind. We have been dealing with this now for almost a year. It has been something I think I\u2019ve pointed out in the April call. I know I did in the July call and I did again today that in Canada and to a lesser degree in the Bakken basin, we have dealt with price pressure, especially around rods.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And what kind is that double-digit or is it not much that?","Robert A. Livingston","No. I would say low-to-mid single digit. ","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. And then just on refrigeration, the fourth quarter is pretty self-explanatory I guess Wal-Mart was out at their Investor Day talking about shifting their priorities to spend more on e-commerce and kind of limit the spending on their stores. I mean is there \u2013 how does the business look beyond kind of this catch up in the fourth quarter? How are you guys feeling about just the trends in refrigeration spend into 2015?","Robert A. Livingston","We saw the announcement, in fact I would tell you that it was news to us. We\u2019ve seen that in some of the discussions we\u2019ve had with Wal-Mart in the last 30 to 60 days. I think their comments that they shared, Steve, with respect to store activity, number one, was new store construction, and number two, it was new store construction in the U.S. ","We fully expect Wal-Mart to continue with a pretty healthy remodel program in 2015 and based upon everything we are seeing and hearing, seeing we\u2019ve actually got some orders on the books and we\u2019ve been told there are more coming that their new store construction and remodel activity outside of the U.S. continues to be pretty healthy next year.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, yes, good morning. ","Robert A. Livingston","Good morning, Andrew.","Brad M. Cerepak","Good morning.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just couple of questions. Can you clarify the weakness in bearings, because given your comments on the strength of the Energy cycle so far, it\u2019s just a little bit surprising to reconcile it? ","Robert A. Livingston","Yes. It\u2019s all around compression activity. And I would \u2013 I have to start with a little bit of a revisit perhaps even into the some data we shared and some announcements we saw from some of our customers, as well as some CapEx announcements that were made earlier in the year by some of the larger E&P operators that with and I guess we started to see this late in the first quarter and going into the second quarter, where there was much more of a focus by the big guys in the oil patch to improve their cash flow. And there was some deferment and perhaps even some cancellation of projects. Not that we saw the cancellation. We actually saw some customer cancelling projects in areas outside of North America. And for us, it\u2019s around \u2013 that bearing activity is around the gas turbine for pipeline and transmission activity.","We do believe that we\u2019ve passed the bottom on that. We\u2019ll see how this one unfolds over the next quarter or two. But we saw in all three, maybe even four of the OEMs that we support with our bearing business, especially GE and Siemens.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And can you also comment on Printing & ID, because one of your competitors has also made positive comments about it. I\u2019m just surprised by the organic growth given all the headlines. ","","Robert A. Livingston","","Organic growth where? ","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Printing & ID, Markem-Imaje, specifically North America. Particularly you\u2019ve highlighted consumer strength in the U.S. Could you just comment where that is coming from? ","Robert A. Livingston","","Well, you\u2019re right. We did have pretty strong growth in the U.S. in the third quarter, but I would also point out that it probably stood alone in the third quarter with respect to regional growth rates at MI. But the growth \u2013 we\u2019ve actually been experiencing good growth in the U.S. market for \u2013 gosh, Brad, 18 months now?","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes. ","Robert A. Livingston","At least 18 months. We commented on that here in our script because it sort of stood alone. Europe was fairly solid, but not like we saw here in the U.S. China, I sort of labeled as okay, but again, not like we saw here in the U.S. It was fairly broad-based in the U.S., both consumables as well as equipment. And I would also say we were pleased with capturing a couple of new customers in the third quarter.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Would you attribute most of the strong performance to Dover specific events or do you think it\u2019s just broader markets? They\u2019re just chugging along quite nicely?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, I think the market is performing quite nicely. But I\u2019d like to think we over performed the market. ","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you very much. ","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","","Good morning, Bob, Brad, Paul","Robert A. Livingston","Good morning.","Paul E. Goldberg","Good morning.","Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Just want to follow up on a couple things Julian was asking about earlier on. You talked about within the pump business some noise, I think, you called it, on project activity at Mag and Fender. Can you may be give some more color on that, what you\u2019re seeing out there in the market at the moment and what demand trends look like for you?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay well, I think, two different businesses in two different applications and I call it verticals. Mag is mostly, most of their play is in the chemical and plastics vertical and Fender is mostly in the oil and gas vertical, and even there, I would tell you that most of \u2013 almost all of the Fender\u2019s activity is outside of the U.S. market. That still remains an opportunity for us. I don\u2019t have the detail by quarter on how each of those two businesses have shown on their booking trajectory. Just because of the nature of the business and it\u2019s probably little bit more lumpy at Fender than it is at Maag. But nature of their business does include a fair amount of project activity and a project award.","And second quarter may result in organic bookings growth, or bookings growth of 20% over booked over the previous year. And the lack of that project award in the third quarter may result in negative bookings growth when you compare it year-over-year. When you look at it over longer periods of time, the growth at Fender, my goodness, has been \u2013 is the business up 50% since we acquired the business two years ago. I mean that may be the magnitude of the growth we\u2019ve seen at Maag. What I call the two and half years that we\u2019ve owned the business. And Fender, we\u2019ve owned for a little less than a year and this year has been a year of consolidation and on-boarding of Fender. I think you\u2019ll some growth in Fender next year.","Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","But in term of\u2026","Robert A. Livingston","It is a ramped project activity.","Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Yes, in terms of maybe RFPs or something like that, you haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change in activity.","Robert A. Livingston","Well I\u2019m not sure I can even answer that with respect to Fender, it is one of the smaller businesses within PSG. And quite frankly I probably don\u2019t pay as much attention to those order rates as I should. I do pay much more attention to Maag just because of its size. And the RFP activity, like I was just speaking last week to the gentleman who runs the business and that customer activity, the RFP activity, is quite strong.","Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Great. Thanks. And you also mentioned that Brazil was pretty weak in the quarter, any color you can give on that?","Robert A. Livingston","Yeah, Brazil was ugly.","Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Any outlook for when that might change?","Robert A. Livingston","No, it\u2019s ugly and\u2026","Brad M. Cerepak","It\u2019s very smaller for us.","Robert A. Livingston","It\u2019s small.","Brad M. Cerepak","I am not even sure what our revenue base.","Robert A. Livingston","It\u2019s less than $100 million for Dover, but I know sitting here today it\u2019s going to be difficult for us to anticipate or project any growth in Brazil for next year or at least I don\u2019t want to, but in the third quarter our decline in revenue in the third quarter I think was well over 14% in Brazil.","Brad M. Cerepak","And again, I will use the word ugly and I think Paul is about right to chock me and tell me we are out of time.","Paul E. Goldberg","All right. Thanks a lot for your time.","Brad M. Cerepak","Thank you.","Robert A. Livingston","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul E. Goldberg","Thank you, Paula. This concludes our conference call.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg, please go ahead sir.","Paul Goldberg","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Dover's fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Bob Livingston and Brad Cerepak. Today's call will begin with some comments from Bob and Brad on Dover's fourth quarter operating and financial performance, and follow with a discussion of our 2018 guidance. We will then open up the call for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up.","Beginning with our 2018 guidance, Dover will provide adjusted EPS guidance and results, that will exclude after-tax acquisition related amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis better reflects our core operating results, offers more transparency and facilitates easy comparability with peer companies. A full reconciliation between forecasted GAAP and forecasted adjusted measures, reflecting adjustments for aforementioned acquisition related amortization, as well as carryover rightsizing costs, is included in our investor supplement.

We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement. Also, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. We would also direct your attention to our web site, where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Paul. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I am pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which reflects strong global markets, resulting in broad based revenue growth and solid margin improvement at each segment. In particular, we had strong organic growth in Pumps, Waste Handling, Food Equipment and at our well site business. A number of other businesses also turned in solid performances, including marking and coding, vehicle service equipment and bearings and compression, resulting in organic growth of 8% in the quarter. Our organic growth in the quarter and for the full year, I believe, illustrates the strength of our portfolio.","In all, our team's focus and execution resulted in a solid quarter, while also making significant progress on the Wellsite spin-off, right-sizing and several other commercial and investment initiatives.","Our right-sizing initiatives in the quarter were important, to align Dover's cost structure with its size post spin. These right sizing actions are expected to deliver $55 million of benefits in 2018.","I am also happy with the progress we have made towards transitioning to a more focused portfolio, with strong platforms and attractive markets. We are firmly on track to achieve our three year revenue and margin targets, which we outlined at our investor meeting last June. We delivered strong organic growth, and increased adjusted margin over 150 basis points in 2017, and are positioned to deliver further growth in margin expansion in 2018.","In conjunction with our portfolio shaping activities, we have continued to build our platforms with two highly synergistic deals which were recently closed. These deals, while not large in scale, are margin accretive and enable us to expand the scope of our offerings and become a more important supplier to our customers.","As we enter 2018, I am excited with our position. The global macro environment is expected to be constructive, leveraged by tailwinds from our productivity and cost initiatives and from U.S. tax reform. In 2018, we were expecting solid revenue growth, strong EPS growth, and another year of strong free cash flow. Our outlook is supported by continued commitment to our strategy, with a strong focus on margin expansion.","I am very proud of the entire Dover team and want to thank them for their hard work and effort, as they continue to focus on serving our customers.","Brad will now take you through the specifics of our fourth quarter performance and 2018 guidance, and I will come back at the end for some closing thoughts.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, we had a solid fourth quarter. We achieved organic growth in all segments and had bookings growth in three out of the four segments. Leverage on this organic growth, combined with benefits of our productivity and cost initiatives, led to strong year-over-year adjusted margin improvement.","There were several highlights in the quarter; including broad based revenue and bookings growth in Engineered Systems, strong performance in Fluids, including broad based bookings growth; continued organic growth and significant year-over-year margin improvement, in refrigeration and Food Equipment, and lastly, strong revenue and bookings growth in Energy. Also from a geographic perspective, the U.S. and China markets had strong organic growth year-over-year.","Let's start on slide 3 of the presentation deck; today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 13%. Organic growth of 8% was complemented by acquisition growth of 6%. Partially offsetting these results, was a 3% impact from dispositions. FX provided a 2% benefit in the quarter.","Adjusted EPS increased 49% to $1.13. This result [ph] exclusive costs associated with our previously announced right-sizing initiatives, as well as Wellsite separation related costs, which were both as expected. It also excludes net benefits from dispositions, benefits from the Tax Cuts Jobs act, and benefit from a reduction to a previously recorded product recall reserve. A full reconciliation of adjusted EPS can be found in our investor supplement.","Adjusted segment margin was 14.4% in the quarter, a 210 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by incremental margin on increased volume. Bookings increased 13% to $2 billion. This increase is comprised of 8% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, partially offset by a 3% impact from dispositions and reflect strong growth in Engineered Systems, Fluids and Energy. Book-to-bill finished at 0.98.","Overall, our backlog increased 15% to $1.2 billion. On an organic basis, backlog increased 10%. Adjusted free cash flow was strong, at $303 million in the quarter, up 26% over last year. For the full year, we generated $703 million of adjusted free cash flow, representing 9% of revenue. While our fourth quarter was strong, we fell short of our full year plan, primarily a result of robust December shipments, which increased receivables in the month.","Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made on working capital this year. Working capital as a percent of revenue was 16.4%, down 280 basis points from last year.","Now turning to slide 4; organic growth was broad-based. Engineered Systems grew 8%, driven by solid activity across both platforms. Fluids Organic revenue increased 4%, principally driven by strong activity in our industrial Pumps and pharma and hygienic businesses. Refrigeration and Food Equipment increased 1% and Energy grew 23% organically. As seen on the chart, total acquisition growth was primarily driven by 20% growth in Fluids.","Now on slide 5; Engineered Systems revenue of $667 million was up 8% organically, reflecting broad-based growth. Adjusted earnings increased 9% over the prior year and adjusted margin was 15.7%, representing a 20 basis point improvement. These results primarily reflect volume leverage, partially offset by some material cost inflation.","Our Printing and Identification platform revenue increased 3% organically, driven by continued solid activity in our marking and coding business.","In the Industrial platform, revenue increased 12% organically, reflecting strong shipments in Waste Handling and robust activity in our vehicle service equipment businesses.","Bookings increased 6% overall, including organic bookings growth of 9%. Organic growth reflects solid activity across the segment. Book-to-bill was 1.04 for printing and identification, only 1.0 for industrials due to very strong shipments, and 1.02 overall.","Now on slide 6; Fluids revenue increased 26% to $610 million, including acquisition growth of 20% and 4% organic growth. Organic growth was primarily driven by strong performances in our industrial pump and hygienic and pharma platforms. Adjusted earnings increased 61%, largely driven by volume growth, including acquisitions and productivity gains, especially at retail fueling.","Volume leverage and ongoing retail fueling integration drove an adjusted margin improvement of 320 basis points, up to 15.2%. Of note, we have recently begun setting up pre-production runs in advance of consolidating retail fueling production facilities in Europe. This consolidation and others in retail fueling, will greatly improve margin of this business going forward.","Bookings grew 34%, including 9% organic growth. Organic bookings growth was most prevalent in our Pumps and hygienic and pharma platforms. Book-to-bill was 1.01.","Now let's turn to slide 7; Refrigeration and Food Equipment's revenue of $377 million included organic growth of 1%. The organic increase was largely driven by the expected strong activity in our can-shaping business within Food Equipment. Refrigeration results reflected the anticipated fourth quarter softness in our retail refrigeration markets, as well as some customer rationalization.","Adjusted earnings increased 34% from the prior year and adjusted margin expanded 300 basis points. These results primarily reflect the favorable business mix and significant productivity improvements. Bookings decreased 3% organically, largely due to reflecting tough comps in our retail refrigeration business. Certain customers had ordered ahead of regulatory changes that went into effect in early 2017, which had the effect of softening back half in Q4 trends. Book-to-bill was 0.85.","Now moving to slide 8; Energy revenue increased 24% to $364 million, reflecting growth in the U.S. rig count and increased well completion activity, include continued solid results in bearing and compression, which grew 3%.","Adjusted earnings were $49 million and adjusted segment margin was 13.4%, both significantly improved over last year. These results were largely driven by strong volume growth. Bookings were up 18% year-over-year. Book-to-bill finished at 0.98.","As Bob mentioned, our Wellsite businesses had a strong quarter, with 31% organic growth and grew 34% organically for the full year. Further, we had made significant progress on the spend and fully expect to complete the transaction in May. We expect our end markets to continue to improve, and are excited about our prospects as an independent company.","Now going to the overview slide; number 9; our fourth quarter corporate expense included $16 million of right-sizing and other costs and $14 million of Wellsite related separation costs. Excluding these costs, corporate expense was $35 million, a little higher than expected. Interest expense was $35 million.","Our fourth quarter tax rate, included a benefit of $51 million from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs act. The benefit was primarily derived from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, offset in part, by a U.S. tax charge for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.","Excluding the impact of the tax act and other discrete benefits of $10 million, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 24.1%. This rate reflects a favorable mix of geographic earnings. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 27.1%.","For the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $105 million, as part of our previously announced $1 billion repurchase plan. We expect to complete the plan later in 2018, utilizing the dividend received from Wellsite.","Moving on to slide 10; please note our 2018 EPS guidance is presented on an adjusted basis. Starting this year, we will be adjusting for acquisition related amortization and right-sizing costs and Wellsite separation costs as incurred. Acquisition related amortization was $0.86 in 2017, and is expected to be $0.93 in 2018. The delta between the years is primarily driven by changes in the tax rate.","Moving to the guide; we expect 2018 total revenue to increase 3% to 5%. Within this forecast, organic revenue growth is forecasted to be 5% to 7%. FX should add about 1%, and dispositions are expected to have a 3% impact. All segments are expected to have solid organic growth. The specific rates could be seen on the slide.","Our forecast for corporate expense is $122 million and interest expense is expected to be about $130 million. The tax rate is forecasted to be 22% and 23%, four to five points lower than the normalized 2017 rate. This improvement is driven by the tax act.","Our forecast for CapEx is 2.4% of revenue and full year free cash flow is expected to be between 10% and 11% of revenue. Further, we expect adjusted segment margin to improve about 110 basis points over 2017 to approximately 15.3%.","In summary, we expect full year EPS to be $5.73 to $5.93. This represents an increase of 19% over 2017 on an adjusted basis at the midpoint. Our guidance does not include any 2018 costs related to the Wellsite separation.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Bob, for some final comments.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Brad. As expected, 2017 proved to be an exceptionally busy year for Dover. During that time, we have remained highly focused on the three year goals we shared at our Investor Day in June. For the period of 2017 through 2019, we communicated our targets to be 4% to 6% organic growth on an annual basis and cumulative adjusted margin expansion of 350 to 450 basis points. Although we know, there is still much to be done, I am pleased with the progress we made in 2017.","On the revenue side, we performed very well against the three year plan, generating 8% organic growth. Every segment hit their organic revenue plan. I would also plan to like out, that the businesses that propelled our growth in 2017 remained strong in 2018. Namely, marking and coding, digital printing, and Waste Handling are all set up to have a strong year within Engineered Systems.","In Fluids, we expect another year of strong growth in our Pumps and hygienic and pharma businesses. Refrigeration and Food Equipment should once again deliver steady growth, and our Energy businesses are well positioned for double digit growth.","Looking forward, we expect E&P related activity to be slow in the first half with tough comps, driven by the compliance date delay we have previously discussed. We also expect retail refrigeration's first half to be impacted by tough comps related to last year's strong shipments in advance of regulatory changes. We are forecasting organic growth of 5% to 7% in 2018, a full point above the target in our three year plan, and we are confident we will deliver.","In 2017, adjusted segment margin improved more than 150 basis points, and we are on pace towards our three year target range. With respect to margins; in Engineered Systems, we fell a little short of our 2017 target, primarily due to significant material cost inflation. We feel better about price costs as we enter 2018 and are also forecasting reduced investment as compared to a heavy investment year in 2017.","In Fluids, commercial excellence programs, productivity, and our retail fueling integration have been and will remain the main drivers of margin enhancement. Refrigeration and Food Equipments margin grew nicely in 2017 on improved productivity, especially within retail refrigeration, and we expect further progress in 2018. And finally, Energy's strong margin growth is primarily as the result of volume leverage, which we expect to continue in 2018.","In total, we expect more than 100 basis points of margin improvement in 2018, and our teams are aligned around achieving this goal.","In closing, I feel that Dover is exceptionally well positioned in 2018. Our markets are healthy, and we have tailwinds from U.S. tax reforms and our right-sizing initiatives. We expect to deliver a very strong year in terms of EPS growth, and will remain disciplined with respect to capital allocation. We will return cash to shareholders by completing our $1 billion share repurchase, and by raising our dividend for the 62nd straight year. And we will continue to expand and enhance our platforms through margin accretive bolt-on acquisitions, and investing in organic growth.","Now Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Bob. Before we take the first question, I'd just like to remind the listeners, if you can limit yourselves to one question with a follow-up, we have a lot of people in queue, and we will be able to hear more questions. So with that Crystal, if we could have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question; earlier in the year, you highlighted smaller acquisitions, something you haven't done before. Can you just comment why all of a sudden, you are putting out press releases on these smaller deals and brought on capital allocation going forward, given Wellsite, and now that we have visibility on taxes, how should we think about capital allocation going forward?","Bob Livingston","So your first question about press releases, is that --","Andrew Obin","Yeah. You are highlighting smaller deals, which I don't think you have done in the past?","Bob Livingston","We just thought they were important to announce Andrew. I mean, there is nothing magical about it.","Andrew Obin","And how should we think about capital allocation going forward?","Bob Livingston","Let's stay first with the share repurchase program that we announced in the fourth quarter, and I think we will have the bulk of that completed by the time we complete the spin in May of Wellsite. We sit here today. I do not have anything significant in our acquisition pipeline, that we would expect to close on, in the first five or six months of 2018. If 2018 does prove to be a light year with respect to M&A activity, I think it's very reasonable to expect the board and I to have further discussions around share repurchases for the second half.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. And just a follow-up question on revenue outlook; lot of companies sort of don't seem to indicate impact of tax reform on demand in their revenue outlook? Where do you guys stand about potential upside to revenue from the tax reform?","Bob Livingston","Yeah, it's not in our guide. I think I am probably giving a simpler response that you have heard or will hear during this earnings season from other capital good manufacturers. When you look around the Dover portfolio, about 30% of our revenue was recurring. The remaining 70% -- Andrew, I would tell you that about 80% of that remaining 70% is either capital goods or components we manufacture that go into capital goods. And a significant percentage of that 80% is U.S. based. In fact, I think our earnings split for 2017 was 60% domestic and 40% non-domestic, am I right on that number?","Brad Cerepak","That's close. Right.","Bob Livingston","And I think -- we will watch two or three areas for a pick-up in capital goods activity that could be a response to the tax act, and we will see it. And the industrial platform of Engineered Systems, I think we will see it in retail fueling, and perhaps as well in refrigeration, especially the Hillphoenix and Anthony business.","Andrew Obin","Thanks a lot Bob.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with UBS.","Christopher Belfiore","Good morning. This is Chris on for Steve. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more color on refrigeration. So could you provide some color on the split of the mix versus productivity in the 300 basis points of adjusted margin expansion? And with regard to that, how far along you think you are in adjusting the model? And the factory performance there, and then for the year kind of going into next year, where do you think margins in region like -- what's the optimal kind of organic growth rate, within that 3% to 4% side?","Bob Livingston","So I don't have the detail on the margin improvement question you've asked. I would say, the lion's share of the margin improvement is productivity initiatives. But I can't give you specific numbers or specific percentage. But productivity has been a big part of it. But we have also been -- this business was probably earlier than some of our other businesses in 2017 to push some price increases through, as a result of the material inflation. I think that helped. But we have also done a fair amount, sort of around the edges. Nothing major, but fair amount of work around the edges to exit some product areas that I would just label it as underperforming historically and coming to a conclusion that we weren't able to improve the margins to where we want it to be. And I don't know what that number is, I don't remember that number. But could be as much as $40 million of revenue in 2017 that we exited.","Brad Cerepak","And another $40 million to $50 million in 2018.","Bob Livingston","In 2018 that we have exited, just because we didn't like the margin profile.","Christopher Belfiore","Okay. And then, just quickly on just the EMV adoption within retail skewing. How much of that was full dispenser replacement versus just the payment?","Bob Livingston","I don't have that data. In 2017, the bulk of our EMV activity as we have reported in the past, was in the first half of the year. We continue to see some activity in the second half, but nowhere near what we saw in the first half. We are taking a pretty cautious approach to the 2018 guide. I would say that, the 2018 guide has less EMV activity, pure EMV activity in the guide than we actually experienced in 2017, and I will repeat myself, I think that's cautious and conservative. We do believe that the EMV activity will begin to pick up in the second half, and we will provide further cover on that activity on the April and the July call, and my hope is, is that it gives us an opportunity to raise our guide as we move through the year.","Christopher Belfiore","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good day everyone.","Bob Livingston","Good day Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","First question Bob, actually just it might be multi-part, but this goes on kind on some of the guidance dynamics here. First, you stated that the guidance excludes Wellsite one-off costs, but I am wondering does it kind of fully reflect the total cost of what we will have, when there is two companies? In other words, just the restructuring you are doing, getting at what we -- for a lack of a better term, maybe call it the stranded costs that would be graded when you expanded [ph] the new company? And then, just secondly on the guidance too, I was wondering that $0.28 to $0.26 for commercial and product investment, never really seen that called out before, I certainly don't recollect. That's a big number. What actually is that?","Bob Livingston","Okay, well let me deal with the first question. The right-sizing activity in the fourth quarter -- let me give you a number there as well. I think our right-sizing in the fourth quarter Brad, were what, $45 million, $46 million, something like that, and there is some carryover that's in our guide for 2018, for right-sizing costs. I think the number is about $11 million Jeff, and the bulk of that -- I am not going to say 100% of it, but I think the bulk of that will occur in the first quarter. And then on top of that, we have another $12 million -- $10 million or $12 million of restructuring costs planned for 2018, that I would label is just normal on ordinary recurring type of activity that you have seen us tackle in the past few years.","With respect to the final separation of Wellsite from Dover, there is going to be some stranded costs that we will have to deal with. We will deal with it at the time of the spin or slightly thereafter. But it is pretty modest, Jeff. Brad, is it $4 million, $3 million?","Brad Cerepak","As reflective of the activities we have been taking, we have narrowed it down to about $3 million to $5 million. Still looking at more ways to reduce the stranded costs inside Dover. Jeff, keep in mind that, when Wellsite goes, the easiest way to think about this is, so does all the segment of DE Energy, the segment costs. Soma and his team and the costs they incur at the segment level, go with the spin. So that in essence is taken care of through the spin activity. They will have to add incremental costs above that number, as a new public company, we say 35. But in reality, it's a smaller piece, because the segment already is staffed up than 35. I hope that helps.","Jeff Sprague","That does help. And then on that -- in the bridge item, that commercial and product investment buckets there?","Bob Livingston","That may be a change with respect to our external communication. But Jeff, I wouldn't look at it as something new within Dover. There is a fair amount of investment we are looking at in 2018 for -- well I call it commercial facing activity --","Brad Cerepak","Including digital.","Bob Livingston","Including our digital activity. And we do have a fair amount of projects around Dover in 2018 for productivity, which we have a tendency to support, not only with people assigned to productivity, but with capital. But I wouldn't look at it as a different activity, it is a slight change in how we present it.","Jeff Sprague","Okay. And then just one other one, and I will move on. Just back to Energy; so it looks like we -- I am assuming this margin, which is nice year-over-year but down sequentially, reflects some moderation in actually drilling activity, and we are starting to get the ducks quacking, so to speak, confusion activities.","Bob Livingston","I wish the duck for quacking more Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Yeah. Can you just kind of walk us through what's happening?","Bob Livingston","I would tell you that, we probably saw two things in the fourth quarter within Energy, within Wellsite, that were a little bit different than we expected going into the quarter. Drilling activity was a bit reduced, especially in November and December, relative to our early in the quarter expectations. And I think the best market indicator there to sort of coalesce with is -- the rig count activity was, I would label it as a bit flattish in the fourth quarter, and we expected a little bit more growth.","The second item is with respect to well completion activity. We did not see the pull-through in our rod lift business to the degree we thought we would. And on the flipside, we saw more ESP pull-through than we had planned, and there is a margin difference between those two technology offerings, Jeff. ESP operating margins are probably five to six points less than rod lift, and I would say, the overall cover with many of our customers -- we heard many comments that my CapEx budget is done for the year during November and the early part of December.","To provide a little bit more cover on that, I would tell you that, activity here in January has been quite strong. Rig count activity has been up, and in fact the rig count increase -- I think it was last week, 15, 16, 17 unit increase last week, I believe was the largest weekly increase in rigs in this recent upturn. But the drilling activity is picking up, it's a little bit ahead of our plan for January, and our artificial lift business is on plan.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning Steve.","Steve Tusa","Hey, what's the -- the tax rate on the amortization add-back looks a little bit higher than what you guys are kind of guiding to for the go forward, what's the difference there?","Brad Cerepak","We are using a tax rate based on the jurisdiction of which the amortization -- the statutory rate in the jurisdiction of which that amortization is incurred. In other words, you think about it, we did acquisitions in different parts of the globe, and we are applying this statutory rate on a blended basis across each of those.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So that's not going to change with tax reform?","Brad Cerepak","No.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then, free cash flow, still pretty solid, but a little bit light of what we were expecting. It looks like there was, we don't have the details yet, but perhaps some working capital. Can you just talk about what your assumptions are there going forward? Is this just a little bit of a working capital build on the back of better volumes? I think you guided to 11 or 13 or something like that, so just curious on the free cash flow front?","Brad Cerepak","No, no, no. Don't take the 13%. We got into 10% to 11%.","Steve Tusa","No you had -- I think you had -- we were expecting something a little bit higher this year, specifically?","Bob Livingston","Actually, I was a little disappointed with the outcome for the year on our cash flow. It was a bit disappointing to not hit the 10% number Steve. But two things, you sort of tried give me an answer that working capital maybe was going up. Actually, let me tell you, working capital for Dover in 2017, we lowered it a 140 basis points year-over-year. What we did see in the fourth quarter was December revenue was much stronger than we would normally anticipate when you look at past years. And we typically get a little bit, I would call it receivable liquidation during December, and with the strong revenue in December, that did not happen.","I think for the most part, I would tell you that cash collections were not really the problem, even though we didn't liquidate draw-down receivables in December. But I think we had a little bit more of an outflow in a couple of areas than we had expected. CapEx spending was a little bit higher in the fourth quarter than we had planned, and I think we would tell you now, that maybe our -- not maybe, our outflow on tax payments could have been lower than the payment we make. And I think even making those adjustments would get us really close to 10% but not over.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then lastly, any price costs, headwinds in your guidance for 2018, steel and like that?","Bob Livingston","That's a good question.","Steve Tusa","Thanks for that.","Bob Livingston","Our material cost dynamic versus price in 2017, we actually had a negative headwind of almost $15 million in 2017. The bulk of that was -- I think all of it was in the first three quarters of last year. As we look at 2018, given the current material costs and the pricing actions we took in the second half of 2017, we see that flipping. We see a $13 million to $15 million tailwind in our guide on material versus price.","Brad Cerepak","That's all-in bulk price.","Bob Livingston","Yeah, that's all in.","Steve Tusa","Great. Okay. Thanks guys.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Bob Livingston","Good morning Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey Bob, [indiscernible] expand on the comment in refrigeration when you said you saw and had some customer rationalization. Just kind of expand what was going on there and maybe size the impact if you could?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So it was actually happening throughout the year. This wasn't just a fourth quarter activity. I think in the first quarter of last year, we said no to about $20 million worth of business within retail refrigeration that we just weren't happy with the margins on. And getting the feel like we could improve them to the point where it would be constructive to our margin targets for this segment. In the fourth quarter we actually divested, was it in -- yeah, it was in the fourth quarter we divested a small business, glassdoor business in China that we have been working very diligently to improve the margins and grow it and just have not been successful. So we divested it in the end of fourth quarter. And I also believe in the fourth quarter, we shut down our aftermarket service business in Canada, that I don't remember the revenue number there Brad, but it was about $10 million. And I believe, the glassdoor business in China, Deane, was also about $10 million.","A little bit here to a little bit there, but they were the three major items. But all in total, it was about $40 million.","Deane Dray","And is that -- do you have more in store for the first quarter? Or has that run its course?","Bob Livingston","I would say that it has run its course.","Deane Dray","Okay. And then on the Energy side, just last question for me, can you clarify whether some of the uptick in the Energy was the recovery from the hurricane dislocations that you saw in the third quarter, it was -- I think you had sized it like $0.04 in the third quarter, did that all get recouped here in the fourth quarter?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So the $0.04, in my recalling, the $0.04 was a preliminary number that I provided, I think in mid-September. That was sort of the risk we were seeing at the time. I think when we actually closed the third quarter, the guys, the business teams had done a tremendous job in closing the gap, and I believe we felt -- at the end of the quarter, we were only a penny off, because of the hurricane. So I wouldn't label much activity in the fourth quarter as being a carryover from the storm interruption in the third quarter.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning Scott.","Scott Davis","Can we just refresh our memories a little bit or refresh my memory I should say, on Pumps. How much of that business goes for distribution versus direct? And I guess part of the question I am getting at is that, the growth you saw, is there some restocking going on that, folks want to make sure they are geared up for higher operating rates?","Bob Livingston","No. So within Pumps, and I am including our PSG business our [indiscernible] business and our hygienic and pharma. Maybe 60% of it is through distribution, the balance of it being direct to the end user or an integrator. No, your question about restocking, I actually believe that the bulk of that restocking activity, we saw in the second and third quarter. I think what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we expect here in 2018 is true end market pull.","Scott Davis","Right. Okay, that's helpful. And then I don't think you said this, and if you did, excuse me. But can you just give us a bit of a walk around in the world, I mean, where you saw strengths and weaknesses globally versus your model?","Bob Livingston","For the fourth quarter?","Scott Davis","Yeah. For the fourth quarter.","Bob Livingston","I would say that China and the U.S. market activity was a bit stronger than we anticipated. In fact Scott, it was interesting, organic growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter was a little better than 10%. We saw good organic growth, double digit in China, and in Europe, we saw flat. It was relatively flat versus the fourth quarter of 2016. But I would give our business teams a little color on that, by pointing out that the fourth quarter of 2016, we had some pretty healthy, I call them project shipments in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2016.","But almost 11% of the U.S. was a little bit stronger than we anticipated.","Scott Davis","Interesting. Okay. Very good. Thank you. I will pass it on.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Hi everyone.","Bob Livingston","Good morning John.","John Inch","Hi Bob, and Brad and Paul. I am coming up to about $4 on Dover Remainco under the old accounting. So excluding -- or including the amortization, excluding Wellsite. Is that -- Brad, is that about the number? And if so, in terms of your guidance for 2018, what kind of a growth rate would that represent Trying to understand sort of how you are guiding your EPS or your thought process around EPS kind of on the apples-to-apples basis, ex-Wellsite?","Brad Cerepak","Yeah. Well I guess I would start by saying, you can anticipate that we will provide clarity on that in the April call, as we get closer to the spin date in May. I would say though, keep in mind, that as Wellsite comes out, the two things I would point out, that the model you would expect when we get to April. One is, is that our forecast or our guidance for 2018, does not include the current thinking around the buyback that we will do, once we receive the cash --","Bob Livingston","The dividend.","Brad Cerepak","The dividend. So the stock will be bought back in that May timeframe, once we receive the dividend. And then secondly, just to give you a little bit of a sense of what direction it goes in. Wellsite is mostly a U.S.-based earner and so the tax rate for us will probably move closer to the low end of the range and they will be slightly above the range we gave. And so that will have implications to your modeling as well. That's probably about all I would comment on at this point, put aside, waiting for April.","John Inch","All right. So Wellsite, just to recap, when you said Wellsite, it's going to have a higher tax rate, and the Remainco businesses are going to have a lower tax rate, I am sorry, is that what you said?","Brad Cerepak","That's what I said.","John Inch","In the range? Okay.","Brad Cerepak","I'd say on the amortization line, because we now start to report that way. If you think about the amortization, we said $0.93 -- amortization related to Wellsite within that $0.93 is roughly $0.23, $0.24.","John Inch","Okay. Good, that's helpful. In the quarter, just a good look at the quarter for a second, I think your restructuring that you actually include, so not the exclusionary stuff was about $2 million. How did that compare with your plan and what is the plan for 2018? I think you maybe -- said it Bob, but I still can't quite understand what's kind of included and excluded? And didn't you say that there was, we are going to do $18 million to $20 million of restructuring in 2017?","Brad Cerepak","Yeah, we had said that around $18 million to $20 million, that's kind of normal for a given year. I think the fourth quarter was a little lighter, to your point. Your number is not that far off for the quarter and for the year, we did about $13 million or $14 million, so lighter compared to the original forecast that we gave. In 2018, we have $11 million of right-sizing carryover, so again $45 million, $46 million in the fourth quarter, $11 million in the first quarter, maybe just a little bit falls into the second quarter, but most of that in the first quarter. And then we had built in to our guidance, what I'd call normal restructuring, things that we do every year, we have been doing for five years, of around $10 million.","John Inch","Okay. So and --","Brad Cerepak","Figure all in, right-sizing and restructuring in 2018 of $21 million.","John Inch","Of which we are excluding the $11 million, is that right?","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","John Inch","And you are keeping the $10 million? The reason that's $10 million versus $18 million to $20 million, is because Wellsites is not there, is that the biggest chunk of it?","Brad Cerepak","Well, I would say, look the right-sizing has captured a lot of things, but as I -- I think we mentioned earlier. I don't think we are done sitting here today. I mean, Bob can comment on this. I mean, I am not for a moment thinking that, we will come in at $21 million. I think that there is likelihood you could see that number come up --","Bob Livingston","Should be higher.","Brad Cerepak","Incremental, not dramatically different, but incrementally higher, as we continue to work through and get closer to the spin-off date. Do you want to add anything on that Bob?","Bob Livingston","No. And the $12 million, would I label as normal and ordinary type of restructuring? John, you have to appreciate, that we know what those projects are. As we roll through the first and second quarter, I fully expect the business team leaders to identify other opportunities, and if it makes sense, we will do it.","John Inch","And then just lastly Bob, refrigeration, when you were transitioning your ops to smaller lot sizes and bulking the sort of more flexible production systems if you will, did that completely through [ph] so that refrigeration margins today are going to be a function of volume and obviously associated pricing mix or is there still work to do around that front?","Bob Livingston","No. I think most of that work around -- that we tackled around the reduction of lot sizes is complete. Now, don't take that statement as meaning that there aren't additional productivity projects that we can tackle this year and next year, because there are. And the fourth quarter, we actually -- in our case business, we actually shut down one of the case factories and have consolidated all of case manufacturing into one factory, which is a byproduct, and the end result of many of the productivity initiatives we have been working on over the last two years, just to -- I'd tell it, react to the difference in the lot sizes and some of the improvements we have made in process a little. But it's a -- the team there did a great job in 2017, and I know that you are very-very [indiscernible] excited about expanding that great job again in 2018.","John Inch","And lastly, sorry, core variable margin contribution, 19, based on your guide, ex-Wellsite, what do you think that is, Brad?","Brad Cerepak","I don't have that number.","John Inch","No, but it has been in the -- you historically had this 30%-35% number?","Brad Cerepak","You know, I'd say it's a little bit higher than that. I think that with all the productivity -- and again, I am doing this on an adjusted basis, adjusted to adjusted year-over-year.","John Inch","Yeah. That's why I am asking.","Brad Cerepak","It's a little bit higher than that. I'd say, it's closer to 38%, 39%.","John Inch","Okay, awesome. Thank you very much.","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Bob, I just want to go back to refrigeration for a second. Maybe just talk about your confidence level in growing that business 3% to 4% in 2018. Obviously, we have seen the book-to-bill relatively weak a little, last two quarters. But do you have the visibility towards bookings growth in the first half of the year, and should we thinking that 2018 is basically back half loaded a bit on the easier comparisons in the second half of the year?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Well on comps, it may appear to be back-end loaded. I would say -- our expectation for 2018 for the food retail business, this is Hillphoenix and Anthony, I think it's going to return to the more traditional seasonal pattern that we have seen over the last seven, eight or 10 years, and that would be that the second quarter and the third quarter are the ramp and the heavy build seasons, with the first quarter and the fourth quarter being, I'd call it, the shoulder seasons. And that's quite different than what we experienced in 2017. The order rates that we are expecting in the first quarter to support our plan for the first quarter and our ramp for the second quarter, I can tell you that here in January, our order rates are on plan. So we actually feel rather confident with our target and our guide on refrigeration.","Paul Goldberg","You still available Andy? I guess Andy is gone. Crystal, you're still there. Is anybody there?","Operator","Yes I am here.","Paul Goldberg","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing or additional remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Chris. So yeah, this concludes our conference call. As always, we thank you for your continued interest in Dover, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a good day. Bye.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our third quarter performance reflected continued strong global markets resulting in organic growth at each segment. In particular, we had strong organic growth across several platforms, including digital printing, waste handling, bearings and compression, and pumps.","We also had solid performances in a number of other platforms including marking and coding, retail fueling and retail refrigeration. In all Dover\u2019s organic growth was 9% in the quarter. In total, our revenue and margin expansion were largely in line with our expectations.

We have continued to simplify our portfolio and invest in market-leading platforms that have strong market positions and margin profiles.","In addition to the planned wellsite separation we recently signed an agreement to sell the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn for $250 million and expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter.","Regarding wellsite, we are continuing the process of evaluating our options for separation, the process is moving along well and before we expect to announce our plans by year end. Within wellsite markets have remained quite constructive and we are on track to hit our 2017 forecast of $1 billion in revenue and $250 million in EBITDA. We are committed to pursuing the transaction that is best for the business and also creates the greatest value for our shareholders.","While our portfolio simplification activities advance, we have continued to build the pipeline with targets that enhance and expand our growth platforms. I am very pleased with our execution on the topline this year and I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019ve made progress on margins.","As we enter the fourth quarter and continue working on the wellsite separation, we are actively reviewing our cost structure to rightsize our company and improve margins. This review was broad-based, excluding wellsite, with the goal of achieving $40 million of cost savings for 2018. The goal of all of these actions is a focused and consistent portfolio with a sustainable runway for revenue growth and margin improvement.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we had a very solid third quarter. We achieved organic revenue growth in all segments and had organic bookings growth in three of our segments. Leverage on this organic growth combined with the benefits of integration led to solid year-over-year margin improvement. Overall, adjusted margin was 13% -- 15.3%.","There were several highlights in the quarter, including broad-based revenue and bookings growth in Engineered Systems, strong revenue and bookings growth in Fluids, along with continued sequential margin improvement, continued organic growth and year-over-year margin improvement in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, and lastly, strong broad-based revenue and bookings growth in Energy.","Also from a geographic perspective, U.S., Europe and China markets all grew organically year-over-year. Our full year EPS guidance remains unchanged. Importantly, this guidance does not include anticipated gain on the sale of Warn, fourth quarter costs associated with the wellsite separation or any incremental rightsizing costs. We record these items as the disposition is completed and as cost of the separation and rightsizing are incurred.","Now let\u2019s go through some details on the quarter, starting on slide three of the presentation deck. Today we reported third quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 17%, organic growth of 9% was complemented by acquisition growth of 10%. Partially offsetting these results was a 3% impact from prior dispositions.","Adjusted EPS increased 40% to a $1.16. This result excludes $0.02 of disposition and wellsite separation related costs in the quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 15.3%, 120 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by incremental margin on increased volume.","Bookings increased 14% to $1.9 billion. This result was comprised of 7% organic growth and acquisition growth of 10%, partially offset by a 3% impact of prior dispositions and reflects strong growth in Engineered Systems, Fluids and Energy.","Book-to-bill finished at 0.97. Overall, our backlog increased 18% to $1.3 billion. On an organic basis backlog increased 12%. Free cash flow was $214 million in the quarter, a sequential increase of $64 million. We expect very strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter consistent with our normal pattern.","Now turning to slide four, organic growth was broad-based. Engineered Systems grew 7% driven by solid activity across both platforms. Fluids organic revenue increased 5% principally driven by solid retail fueling and strong industrial pump in pharma and hygienic markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 2% and Energy grew 31% organically. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 30% in Fluids and 8% in Engineered Systems.","Now turning to slide five. Engineered Systems revenue of $646 million was up 7% organically reflecting broad-based growth. Adjusted earnings increased 5% over the prior year as volume leverage was partially offset by the impact of investments and material cost inflation. Our printing and identification platform revenue increased 4% organically, driven by continued strong growth in digital printing and solid activity in our marking and coding markets.","In the industrial platform, revenue increased 18%, including acquisition growth of 14% and 9% organic growth. The organic growth was broad-based with strong performance in waste handling. Margin was slightly below our expectations, reflecting the timing of investments and modest material cost inflation. Bookings increased 10% overall, including organic bookings growth of 3%. Organic growth reflects solid activity across the segment. Book-to-bill for each of the platforms and overall for the segment was 0.98.","Now on slide six. Fluids revenue increased 36% to $563 million, reflecting acquisition growth of 30% and 5% organic growth. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong industrial pump and hygienic and pharma markets, as well as solid retail fueling activity. Earnings increased 32%, largely driven by volume growth, including acquisitions and productivity gains. Our retail fueling integration continues to be on track, supporting a strong sequential margin improvement. In all, margin was 15.5%, up 220 basis points sequentially. Bookings grew 39%, driven by acquisitions and 10% organic growth. Organic bookings growth was broad-based. Book-to-bill was 1.02.","Now on slide seven. Refrigeration & Food Equipments revenue of $439 million included organic growth of 2%. Organic -- the organic increase was largely driven by solid activity in Refrigeration. Food Equipment results reflect a continued softness in our commercial cooking equipment markets. Earnings increased 2% from the prior year or 7% when excluding the impact from a prior disposition. Margin expanded 70 basis points year-over-year reflecting volume leverage offset in part by business mix. Bookings decreased 11% organically, reflecting a general slowdown in our retail refrigeration markets and the timing of orders in can-shaping machinery. But you know our can-shaping business is expected to have a very strong fourth quarter as we ship against orders booked earlier in the year. Book-to-bill was 0.82.","Moving to slide eight. Energy revenue increased 32% to $359 million, reflecting growth in the U.S. rig count and increased well completion activity. Earnings were $52 million and segment margin was 14.5%, both significantly improved over last year. These results were largely driven by year-over-year improvements in the U.S. rig count, increased well completion activity and continued strong results in bearings and compression, which grew 9%.","As Bob mentioned, our wellsite business had a strong quarter with 39% revenue growth and we are on track to achieve the full year forecast. We expect fourth quarter segment revenue to reflect modest sequential growth. Bookings were up 36% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Book-to-bill finished at 1.04.","Going to the overview on slide nine. Our third quarter corporate expense included $2 million of wellsite-related separation costs. Interest expense was in line with expectations. Our third quarter tax rate was 24.6%. This rate reflects increases due to changes in geographic mix of earnings, which were more than offset by discrete tax benefits. The net result of these items was a $0.04 EPS benefit.","Moving on to slide 10 which shows our 2017 guidance. We now expect total revenue to increase 14% to 15% versus our prior forecast of 12% to 14%. Within this forecast, organic revenue growth is 6% to 7%. The impact from completed acquisitions is unchanged at approximately 10%. The full year impact from FX is now expected to be neutral up 1 point from the last forecast.","From a segment perspective, organic growth is largely unchanged from our prior guidance. Our full year forecast for corporate expense is $133 million and now includes $2 million of wellsite costs incurred in the third quarter, interest expense is unchanged and we expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be about 28%. Our forecast for CapEx remains unchanged and the full year free cash flow is expected to be 10% to 11% of revenue.","In summary, our full year EPS guidance of $4.23 to $4.33 is unchanged. As previously mentioned, this guidance does not include the anticipated gain on the Warn disposition, which is estimated at approximately $230 million net of tax and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. It also does not include any fourth quarter costs related to wellsite separation. And lastly, it does not include any rightsizing costs currently estimated to be about $40 million to $45 million. At the midpoint, our EPS guidance represents an increase of 39% over 2016 on an adjusted basis. Please note that our guidance bridge can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Brad. Throughout the year all segments have grown nicely and we had gain share in several of the markets we served. Additionally, we have made progress on several of our initiatives to drive margin expansion. For instance, our retail fueling integration is on pace and sequential margin expansion in Fluids has been strong. Retail refrigeration margins have also grown on improved productivity.","Looking forward, we have multiple opportunities to outgrow the broader market. Here are just a few. Our unique position in the fast-growing digital textile printing market is providing us a strong growth opportunity. We see the penetration rate of digital technology climbing to 30% over the next 10 years from the 3% to 4% rate of today. Our comprehensive solutions, including equipment, ink and software positions us very well to full leverage this technology shift.","Within retail fueling we expect the EMV upgrade cycle in the U.S. to accelerate as our customers began preparing for compliance with payment regulations that go into effect in 2020. Along with that, our growing offering of remote monitoring and software-as-a-service provides ample opportunity for strong growth.","In Refrigeration we expect food retailers to invest in closed-door refrigeration cases, energy efficient systems and in specialized display cases, as they look to manage operating cost and differentiate themselves in the market. In these product categories we have a leading position.","Finally, within our industrial pumps business, the worldwide growth of plastic usage and our customers\u2019 desire for improved efficiency plays to the strengths of this platform. We have the leading position in pelletizers and other polymer processing equipment due to our higher output, faster changeovers and more compact designs. These growth drivers coupled with our margin improvement initiatives provides a very positive framework for the next several years. And in closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for remaining focused on our customers.","And with that, Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks. Before we take our first question, I just want to remind everybody, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we will get more questions in. So, with that, let\u2019s have the first question, Paula.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Your first question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","So just want to -- hi -- hi, guys. Just want to kick off with ES margins. They came in -- you mentioned, your margin came in more or less in line with your expectation. But just wondering about the impact, if you could maybe just define the impact of raw material inflation and on that topic, I know that the pricing ES improved from 0.3% to 0.5% from 2Q to 3Q. I am just wondering what actions you are taking on pricing to offset that raw mat inflation?","Bob Livingston","The material inflation, Nigel, in the third quarter for Engineered Systems was a little bit higher than we had expected coming into the quarter. You do appropriately note the price increases both second quarter and third quarter, and I would love to have seen more of a price increase in the third quarter and I know the guys are working on that here for the fourth quarter and going into 2018. But the -- I -- at the end of the day even though I say margins overall came in largely in line with our expectations. Margins at Engineered Systems to be frank were a bit disappoint and they should be better.","Nigel Coe","Okay. But it sounds like you\u2019re trying to get pricing pushed through the channel.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then you mentioned obviously in the PR that the process for wellsite is on track. Are you -- given the cost you incurred during the quarter, are you pursuing essentially a dual track process where you are preparing for spin but open to other options, so that if you do decide to spin in December that the process could be relatively quick from there on?","Bob Livingston","We are managing a dual track process. We have been -- we\u2019ve got a rather robust work extreme internally, as well as with our outside advisors to prepare us for a spin process and if we get to year end and declare that our separation process will be a spin, we would expect the spin to be completed before the end of the second quarter.","Nigel Coe","Okay, Bob. That\u2019s great. Thanks. I will leave you there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Steve.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you just talk about -- I heard you say some about $40 million and I believe it was cost savings for next year, but obviously, there is some stranded stuff if you spin or sell. You mentioned that you are going to spend some money here in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s not yet in guidance. Can you maybe just kind of tie those things together and just reminds us what\u2019s new and what\u2019s not in the bridge?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Well, I\u2019ll let Brad deal with the bridge. So the -- first off, I would -- let me respond to your comment about stranded cost. If we were to assume that the separation plan for wellsite is a spin. Steve, the cost connected with wellsite as it operates today within Dover and the segment cost are going to move almost 100% with the spin. So the stranded cost to me is actually a de minimis number.","That said look at as we look at moving into 2018 absent wellsite, it is a smaller revenue base. On a pro forma basis we expect and will deliver improved margins in 2018 over 2017, and we are looking where -- as my prepared comment pointed out, it\u2019s a very broad-based review of all areas of Dover excluding wellsite and we have -- today we believe we\u2019ve got rough line of sight to about $40 million of savings that would show up in 2018 and I think Brad commented on the cost that we would incur to execute on capturing those savings and it\u2019s about $40 million to 45 million.","Here is the problem I have with the $40 million to 45 million and it\u2019s one of timing. We still have some projects to approve here over the next two weeks to three weeks. We have internal communications to rollout. I\u2019m not sure sitting here today that we will end up booking that entire $40 million to $45 million of cost into the fourth quarter, some of those cost may very well bleed into the first quarter. Do you want to\u2026","Steve Tusa","Yeah. Got it.","Brad Cerepak","So\u2026","Steve Tusa","Yeah.","Brad Cerepak","So, Steve, just to clarify the bridge, because it\u2019s still a work in progress.","Steve Tusa","Yeah.","Brad Cerepak","I think we are confident on the $40 million of benefits. We are not as confident as the split on the cost side, but a loin share of it will be in the fourth quarter based upon what we know today and it is not in the bridge, so\u2026","Steve Tusa","And that\u2019s above and beyond, what you\u2019re getting from the restruct -- base restructuring you are already doing.","Brad Cerepak","Absolutely.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Brad Cerepak","So the base restructuring previously we\u2019ve been talking about $18 million to $20 million. We are still -- that base restructuring still ongoing, which gives us over $40 million. That\u2019s -- that generates benefits for us in the current year of about $47 million. There will be some carryover into \u201818 on that as well.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Just one quick question on the -- to follow up on Nigel\u2019s question on the, I think, it\u2019s Engineered business. Anything kind of the distribution channel and product ID that may be influencing margins there, I know your peer reported and margins there were not may be just little bit mixed. Anything going on in PID to kind of stands out from a margin perspective?","Brad Cerepak","No. The -- from a marking and coding perspective, we had a very good third quarter with marking and coding. We are continuing to make some investments within our digital print business and that\u2019s for 2017. Help me with this number. I think it\u2019s about $5 million or $6 million of incremental investment that will not continue and will not repeat in 2018. But with respect to marking and coding it was a pretty solid quarter and no\u2026","Steve Tusa","Got it.","Bob Livingston","To answer your specific question, no issues with distribution.","Steve Tusa","Okay. One last quick one, sorry, Paul, I know you are going to call me for this. Bob, with all this movement around the portfolio, you obviously, had a nice run here, you\u2019ve done a lot at the company and changed it quite a bit. Is there any kind of a step -- further step forward in kind of succession planning, I mean, clearly, the company has changed a lot, you have done a lot of heavy lifting and anything to discuss on the succession planning side?","Bob Livingston","The answer is no, other than I would repeat what I\u2019ve said before with other questions on this topic. The Board and I run and have been running a rather robust process around succession planning. I think the Board feels quite comfortable with it. We are -- we do not anticipate a near-term change.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Bob Livingston","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","Hi.","Bob Livingston","And welcome back.","Brad Cerepak","Welcome back here again.","Scott Davis","Thank you. Sounds like Steve trying to get you to retire Bob.","Bob Livingston","Yeah. Might be. I think that as well, Scott.","Scott Davis","I am just joking. I just had -- I was curious your comment about dual tracking the Energy business is interesting, but is there a scenario where you could sell pieces of Energy and spin the rest. I mean there are some real gems in there?","Bob Livingston","That\u2019s not.","Scott Davis","[Inaudible] (27:39).","Bob Livingston","I won\u2019t say, no, to anything, but I don\u2019t see that -- truly I don\u2019t see that being one of the outcomes.","Scott Davis","Okay. And then on the Refrigeration business when you showed a couple book-to-bill 0.82, I mean, I think, most of us knew that market was getting a little bit softer. But is some of that reflected in the fact you guys have just been cutting your SKUs that kind of redefine your market a little bit? Is there any way to parse that out?","Bob Livingston","No. Not, look, we\u2019ve actually been asking that question ourselves. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s having an impact with our customers or with the business. It\u2019s been a very odd year, Scott, within this segment. We typically have, my goodness, for years have historically seen the second quarter and the third quarter being the high points for this segment with the two shoulder seasons, the first quarter and the fourth quarter being light. We saw the change starting to occur with this segment and the order rates in the fourth quarter of last year, we had very strong organic growth in the first two quarters of this year.","And the questions on every call this year so far had been, well, why aren\u2019t you raising your guide on the Refrigeration segment with respect to the topline. And part of our concern is that we knew we were a bit frontloaded in the first half of this year with respect to some customer activity, most notably around some of the cutover on the DOE regulations. We just did not know what we were going to see definitively in the second half. I fully expect 2018 to return this segment to a more seasonal and normal pattern that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years.","Scott Davis","Okay. Fair enough. Good luck guys. Thank you. Best of luck.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Bob, so during the quarter, actually you mentioned potential for $0.04 of hurricane impact. But it seems like your businesses were able to absorb the impacts pretty well. So could you see and did you end up seeing less impact than you thought and if there was any impact, what particular businesses absorbed the most impact?","Bob Livingston","Well, we -- goodness, it sounds like a huge number, Andrew, but with respect to Harvey in Texas, our energy businesses that have operations there in the Houston area, we actually lost 4,000 work hours due to the storm and due to the factories being shut down for five or six workdays. And at the middle of September we were looking at a better bit of a challenge in closing the quarter to hit the topline plan and believe that we would incur some missed earnings that could amount to $0.03 to $0.04 for the quarter.","The guy -- the teams there did an outstanding job in recovery activity in the second half of September. But I would still tell you that the cost for the incremental overtime and extra work that was done to take care of the customers. I think we incurred probably $0.01 to $0.02 of cost that was related to the storm, it\u2019s included in our EPS results for the third quarter and to a much lesser degree, much lesser degree, when the hurricane came up the East Coast, we had two, if not three of our larger operations on the East Coast that were shut down for one to three days, but the biggest impact was Harvey.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Bob, do you see any positive impacts from the hurricane in terms of replacement in any of your businesses, any step up as you\u2019ve gone through October here?","Bob Livingston","We\u2019re seeing a little bit of an increased activity in the Houston area with respect to glass doors to replace some of the damage doors. They are especially in the smaller footprint stores. And I think it\u2019s possible though we haven\u2019t booked a specific order yet. But it is possible that we see some order activity here in the fourth quarter as a result of storm. But if it happens it\u2019s not in our guide and we haven\u2019t seen the orders yet.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And can you give us a little more color on your fueling and transfer market, you mentioned last quarter that it was actually a rail business that was a big lead on the business this year, was that still the case in Q3 and do you see any stabilization there and do you think a moderation in EMV-related activity that you expected this quarter?","Brad Cerepak","Lot of questions.","Bob Livingston","Okay. So that -- that\u2019s -- so let me be real specific here on transportation within our Fluids segment. That part of the business and Paul what is it, about $100 million in revenue.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","Roughly $100 million in revenue.","Paul Goldberg","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","I think it was down\u2026","Paul Goldberg","18%.","Bob Livingston","\u2026 almost 20% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our retail fueling business\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Stable at that level. But it\u2019s stable.","Bob Livingston","Yeah. Okay. Within our retail fueling business the organic growth for retail fueling was 4%, 3% to 4% in the third quarter. Activity -- whether it would be dispensers, hanging hardware or underground components, activity in Europe and China continues to be quite strong and solid. With respect to the U.S. market, dispenser activity in the U.S. was down in the third quarter as we expected.","The only other color note I would share with you is that in the last two weeks of September and it is continuing here so far in October, the order rates -- the incoming order rates for dispensers is actually picked up comfortably, I mean, it\u2019s a nice pickup. If that were -- if those order rates were to continue to hold or even expand as we go through the fourth quarter, I think this group has the opportunity to outperform on the revenue performance for the fourth quarter. EMV\u2026","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks. I appreciate it.","Bob Livingston","EMV, I\u2019ll give you comment on EMV. It was subdued in the third quarter again as we expected and spoke about in May and our June conference. We\u2019ve been -- we\u2019ve had engagement with three of our top brands, customer brands in this space in the -- just in the last few weeks with respect to discussions on their EMV rollout in 2018 and I think we will have a firming of opinion on what EMV activity will look like in 2018 in another two months to three months.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Appreciated Bob.","Bob Livingston","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Hi. Good morning, Bob.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Andrew.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Andrew Obin","Good morning, guys. Just a question on Engineered Systems, so it does seem that margins have disappointed in the quarter, often when we have these situations it took several quarters for the ship sort of to right itself. How fast do you think Engineered Systems can get to sort of normalize operating leverage?","Bob Livingston","I think you will see an improvement in their margins here over the next two quarters.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. And is it more operational or is it more pricing?","Bob Livingston","It\u2019s -- I would say, there would never be in an absence of operational opportunities. But I would tell you that the disappointment for the third quarter was around material inflation and pricing offsets.","Andrew Obin","Got you. And just a follow-up on free cash flow, your previous outlook was 140% conversion. You are now saying 130%, if we look at, sorry, cash flow statement. What\u2019s driving this? Is it working capital, but you also have sort of other items chewing out cash and there is a tax item that\u2019s chewing out cash. Can you give us more visibility as to why cash conversion is now little bit lower?","Bob Livingston","Brad, can walk you through some specific details, but I would -- number one, I would tell you that, working capital in the third quarter was actually 100 bps better than it was year-over-year. But it was still less than we were looking for and expected. It\u2019s not inventory. We -- inventory came in as we expected, if not a tad better and it\u2019s not a payable issue. We did see, I think -- you have to help me here, I think, sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter, I think, we actually saw almost a full day increase in DSO. But part of this is the working cap -- the absolute dollar increase which comes back to cash, the absolute dollar increase in working capital just to support the strong organic growth that we\u2019ve had in the last two quarters.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. So what, Bob, saying, is -- metrics are actually quite good in terms of working capital metrics. What we are seeing is the increase in accounts receivable specifically as we have the strong -- we\u2019ve had a strong revenue growth. So we are expecting strong collections in the fourth quarter to support a strong fourth quarter free cash flow and put us in that range of 10% to 11%.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, can we just spend a moment talking about life after the wellsite separation?","Bob Livingston","Life after the wellsite, yes.","Deane Dray","Yes. Just how does your oil and gas exposure change and gets, I mean, most of its going to be in Fluid, bearings and compression likely into Engineered Solutions. But if you looked at it percent of revenues but also the upstream, midstream, downstream will change significantly like in more midstream, but can you take a pass at that, please?","Bob Livingston","Well, we have looked at this, we have the date on this and it\u2019s been three weeks or four weeks since I look at it and I\u2019m struggling with recall to give you specific numbers. Obviously, it is down, our wellsite exposure is down. But I would first call out the comment that I made earlier on transportation. We would label this $100 million business in transportation to be energy-related. It may not be all upstream, some of it is midstream, but I would truly label it as energy-related.","And bearings and compression, it\u2019s -- there is some upstream connection to bearings and compression. But it\u2019s not the correlation or the size that we have in the wellsite businesses. And the bulk of it other than bearings and compression is connected into the Fluids segment.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then, as a follow-up on the material cost inflation in ES, just could you size that for us? And I\u2019m surprised, if you -- if I had to guess where you would have seen some pressure, it might have been in Refrigeration with copper being up as much, but maybe you just size the impact there?","Bob Livingston","I will let Brad\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","\u2026give you some numbers on this. But let me comment on your Refrigeration note. We actually started to see material inflation raise its head in Refrigeration in the first quarter and the second quarter. I don\u2019t remember the numbers now. But I actually think our material inflation headwind in the first quarter just within Refrigeration, I think, it was $9 million.","There were prices -- there were price increases put in as we exited the first quarter in Refrigeration. We didn\u2019t have -- we didn\u2019t cover it all in the second quarter, but the gap on material inflation significantly reduced in the second quarter. And I\u2019m not viewing that given our early position on raising prices in Refrigeration to cover the material, I\u2019m not looking at pricing -- price inflation to be a decremental for Refrigeration in the second half of the year.","Deane Dray","Got it. And Brad was going to size the\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","You want to size. Brad, go ahead.","Brad Cerepak","You want to size it. When you are coming out of the second quarter we said we would see about $34 million of net impact on materials for the year. That was our last guide. Now up to $38 million and I would say all of that for deltas in DES, because what Bob is referring to, fundamentally on DRFE we had a first half impact, as they were putting the prices in place and it neutralize itself for the back half. That\u2019s still true today for the most part, very minor change.","Our DE business is seeing some steel increases. They\u2019ve also put in place some price increases here in October. So really is fundamentally move within DES and these guys -- our guys are working on this. They are working on price increases and more productivity. That is just going to take a period of time to offset.","Deane Dray","Got it. And just lastly, and this is not a question, but a comment. Off-road jeep enthusiasts like me are sorry to see the Warn business leave the portfolio today. Let that be noted?","Bob Livingston","Comment noted, Deane. Thank you.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Just a question firstly on the Warn business that you just touched on and I think when you bought that you paid about 2 times, 205 times sales, just wondered if you could give any color on the sale multiple and what kind of lost operating earnings we should dial-in for the next year?","Bob Livingston","So earnings, earnings for the business that was sold for next year -- Brad, I am going to see $0.10 -- it might\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Well, that\u2019s the impact.","Bob Livingston","That\u2019s the impact.","Brad Cerepak","Lost earnings.","Bob Livingston","Lost earnings $0.10. Look, please note that, I was very specific here in my scripted comments. We did not sell the entire Warn business. We sold the winch business, both the consumer and the smaller industrial winch business, that\u2019s part of -- that was part of Warn. What we kept was actually the OEM component business for the auto industry and the business activity that was sold from a revenue perspective, Brad, I think, was -- it would $130 million on that...","Brad Cerepak","Yeah. That was.","Bob Livingston","Yeah.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. Roughly that number.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Julian Mitchell","Very helpful. Thank you. And then my second question just, you saw obviously the big drop in organic bookings in Refrigeration & Food Equipment in Q3. Maybe give a bit more detail around the retail refrigeration softness and whether the cost cutting that you\u2019ve talked about the $40 million, is a lot of that waited into this segment, would you think that that retail softness or that broader booking softness in Refrigeration & Food will reverse soon?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So let me deal with cost savings initiatives, first. As I said, it is rather broad-based, but I do exclude wellsite from that comment and would not -- I would not hang more than its fair share -- pro rata fair share of activity on Refrigeration. There has been activity in the second half of last year and through the first three quarters of this year with a focus on productivity and cost takeouts. There will be some more within that segment during the fourth quarter and going into 2018. But, Julian, this is, when I say broad-based, I mean, across the segments and across corporate and across the regions, it\u2019s going to be quite broad based.","With respect to bookings, I\u2019d also put you back to my earlier comment about how strange or an odd of year it\u2019s been with respect to the, I call it the quarterly waterfall within this segment being quite different than what we have seen historically. That\u2019s part of what showing up in the softer bookings here in the third quarter. But it was not all within the Refrigeration business. We also saw soft year-over-year bookings within our can-shaping business following a very, very strong order pattern we had in the second quarter. And we\u2019ve got a fairly healthy, maybe even record revenue quarter scheduled for the can-shaping business and even some of the orders that have been booked in the last couple of quarters, we actually feel within the can-shaping business and that we\u2019re well-positioned now for 2018.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mircea Dobre of Baird.","Mircea Dobre","Yes. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Mircea Dobre","Just to follow-up on Julian\u2019s question on Refrigeration here, if we are looking at comps, they are getting significantly tougher as we go into 2018 for Refrigeration and if bookings, as you say, remain relatively soft here, I recognize that there is a seasonal issue. But I\u2019m wondering on tougher comps do you believe this business can actually grow next year and volumes aren\u2019t picking up, how should we think about margins?","Bob Livingston","Number one, I would tell you that the segment leadership team, as well as the operating business leadership teams truly are convinced they can grow this business next year. If you look at it on a quarterly basis, again given the change in 2017 on how strong the first quarter was relative to historical comps as we move into 2018, it\u2019s going to be impossible for just the Refrigeration platform to have positive organic growth in the first quarter as you copied against the first quarter of \u201817. But I -- we are convinced that we will return to a more seasonal pattern in 2018 and I think you\u2019ll see the positive comps show up in the second half of the year.","Mircea Dobre","Bob, do you have the sense that there are enough levers in this business where if your expectation for bookings growth doesn\u2019t materialized or things that you can do to address that from a margin standpoint?","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Mircea Dobre","Okay. And then my follow-up on P&I. So I know your comment is that there is quite good growth over there, but my sense again looking at comps here is that your business slowed even though your comp has gotten a lot easier organically sequentially. So I\u2019m sort of trying to understand the dynamics here, are we talking about different growth in textile versus your marking and coding, is there some lumpiness that I am not getting anything now.","Bob Livingston","Yeah. Yeah. Well, there is a different growth profile between digital and marking and coding. I don\u2019t know what that difference was in the third quarter, but the growth in digital textile was pretty healthy in the third quarter. With respect to MI, I am -- I don\u2019t have that number in front of me, what 3% organic growth in the third quarter for marking and coding?","Mircea Dobre","Okay. I will follow-up with Paul offline.","Bob Livingston","Yeah.","Mircea Dobre","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones","God morning, everyone.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Nathan Jones","I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about the pumps business in Fluids. You\u2019ve seen some pretty decent -- pretty good organic growth here in the last couple of quarters against what are fairly easy comps, the comps do get a bit more difficult here. Is the growth here just a result of the easy comps, have you seen that business fundamentally improve and what markets are driving it?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So, yeah, I don\u2019t disagree with you. We look back on the comps. We -- the revenue for this business -- for the pumps group or platform in 2016 we were clearly still feeling the downdraft from the down cycle in the upstream oil and gas activity. We have seen with respect to upstream oil and gas, we have seen a nice recovery in those applications throughout the year. And by the time, I think, the fourth quarter, the comps probably aren\u2019t as easy as they were in the first quarter and second quarter this year, but we are also still showing fairly strong organic growth for the pumps business in the fourth quarter.","But the other -- I call it two areas of pumps outside of our distribution activity is our hygienic and pharma business continues to perform very, very well and strong growth rates, and those comps are not easy, because they have strong growth rates last year as well and the -- our plastic and polymer business within pumps bit more of a project business, so you get some noise when you look at quarter versus quarter and on a year-over-year basis, but we will have strong growth in the plastics and polymer business for 2017 and we will have quite solid growth in that business in 2018.","Nathan Jones","So it sounds like you -- you\u2019re thinking this is more of a fundamental recovery in the business than it is just a matter of comps in there\u2026","Bob Livingston","It did not\u2026","Nathan Jones","\u2026 would that also grow in \u201818? ","Bob Livingston","I am not denying that for the industrial applications related to oil and gas the comps are in our favor. But that\u2019s not what is driving all of the recovery and growth in our pumps business.","Nathan Jones","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Hi. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Scott.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Scott Graham","Just looking at the four -- at the full year organic sales guidance and trying to triangulate toward a fourth quarter number. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the math, but it looks like you\u2019re essentially implying low to mid-single organic, and A, is that about, right, and B, is that wholly due to the Refridge down there?","Bob Livingston","So organic for the fourth quarter, I\u2019m probably rounding to the nearest integer, but it 6%. Now the important question there, Scott, okay, is how much -- how much of the 6% is Dover remain co ex-wellsite. I don\u2019t have that data. But it is positive.","For your comment about Refrigeration, even with the difference in the customer buying activity within the Refrigeration platform in 2017, organic growth in the fourth quarter for Refrigeration is at 1% or 1% and a fraction even with our lower expectations.","Scott Graham","Okay. So that\u2019s better than I sort of was calculating. Great.","Bob Livingston","Yeah.","Scott Graham","The other thing is that...","Brad Cerepak","Well, yeah, you should remember there\u2019s some disposition impact in there\u2026","Scott Graham","Yeah.","Brad Cerepak","\u2026 that you take into account.","Bob Livingston","Okay. Fine. Okay.","Scott Graham","Yeah. No. Got it.","Bob Livingston","Go ahead.","Scott Graham","The other thing is that should we see and maybe the better question is on the ES margin, could you and I know there\u2019s a question around this earlier. Could you kind of give us sort of the buckets for you had an adjusted drop of 130 basis points. Could you kind of tell us, obviously materials is the biggest issue here, kind of give us the puts and takes, and maybe the sizings of kind of what happened there?","Bob Livingston","Yeah. Well, Brad, can probably provide more specific numbers then I can. But I would say that better than a third may be approaching 40% of the drop had to do with material inflation, another...","Brad Cerepak","Which we gave -- which we gave you the number.","Bob Livingston","Yeah. And another third of it and again it may have been slightly more than that -- another third of it was the increased investment that I spoke about with respect to our digital print activity. And then a little bit of noise just around product mix. But that always happens, a little bit of noise around product mix. But that\u2019s -- I would say, 30% to 40% of material inflation, 30% solid on increased investment in digital print and the rest of it was product mix. Brad, do you want to clarify that?","Brad Cerepak","No. I think that\u2019s it.","Bob Livingston","Okay.","Scott Graham","Yeah. And if I could sneak in another one in here, just very simply, you made a comment, Bob that you\u2019re confident that the refrigeration market will improve next year. Could you give us a little bit more behind that thinking? ","Bob Livingston","Well -- I will start first with a roll up with discussions with customers and we do expect our activity to be up next year. I don\u2019t have a final number. We are going through our planning process. We will actually kick that off in about 10 days to solidify our operating plans for 2018. But we know we have been awarded some business. We haven\u2019t received the orders yet. I don\u2019t know exactly what the order level will be in 2018, but it will be incremental. And on top of that even if the revenue line were to hold constant in \u201818 versus \u201817, we see a clear path and opportunity for improvement in margins.","Scott Graham","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your final question comes from Charley Brady of SunTrust.","Patrick Wu","Hi, guys. This is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charley. Thanks for taking my questions.","Bob Livingston","Okay. Hi, Patrick. Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Patrick Wu","Good morning. Good morning. Just -- it sounds like even though you guys are going to the up for your rationalization process, M&A is -- the pipeline is still pretty robust, you guys sound pretty optimistic about that. Can you talk a little bit more about which areas you are looking at and sort of how valuation are right now and are there any areas specifically where you guys would have a big appetite in terms of -- if the valuation is on the high side still?","Bob Livingston","We still are interested in expanding in a general way across different verticals, our pumps play within Fluids and we\u2019re always looking for opportunities. We\u2019ve seen some to expand both in our marking and coding, as well as in our digital print area. But the act -- the areas we\u2019re looking at wouldn\u2019t be any different than we\u2019ve been focused -- than we\u2019ve been sharing even at the June Investor Conference, so there wouldn\u2019t be any difference there.","Your question about valuation, it\u2019s interesting, because the -- we have walked away, well, we have been unsuccessful on a couple of recent opportunities to meet the sellers expectation on valuation and we just felt it was a little bit into the discomfort range for us and we just went pencils down and withdrew and we will wait for the next opportunities\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Bolt-on, add-on.","Bob Livingston","Bolt-on, nothing large, nothing significant\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Nothing that we walked away from that was directly change\u2026","Bob Livingston","Yeah.","Brad Cerepak","\u2026 think about the platforms.","Patrick Wu","Okay. Got it. And then just one more on Refrigeration & Food Equipment, you guys answer the lot of quest -- lot of those questions already, but if we ex-out the sort of around $6 million in inefficiencies from Hillphoenix the last year, if you look at that number year-over-year is, I think, down by like around 50 bps or so. How much of the Hillphoenix -- how much of the drag is still -- Hillphoenix still inherent in that business, is that pretty much all gone now? And then also Wal-Mart has recently sort of talked about online grocery pickups and stuff like that, I think, they open to a tune of around 400 locations this year. Has that been any -- has that incrementally benefited you guys at all.","Bob Livingston","So, let me deal with your Wal-Mart question or comment first. I would say that that activity on their pickup rollout has been minimal -- a minimal impact to our business. I\u2019m -- I know that we\u2019ve had an order here and order there, but it hasn\u2019t been notable with respect to creating any change. The -- within the Refrigeration segment, the opportunity -- the greatest opportunity for margin improvement for the segment resides in Hillphoenix and Anthony, primarily Hillphoenix.","Patrick Wu","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Pat.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period.

Today's call will begin with comments from Bob and Brad on Dover's fourth quarter operating and financial performance and follow with our 2016 outlook. We will then open up the call for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up.","Please note that our current earnings release, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website, www.dovercorporation.com.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions especially in oil and gas.","We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS $0.81 in this driven by solid execution and some year-end tax benefits as our teams continued to pursue customer wins, cost actions and productivity initiatives.","In 2015, we increased our efforts around operating efficiencies through our Dover Excellence program. One key element of this program focuses on free cash flow generation which increased to 795 million for the year. The program also supports our ongoing investment and product innovation and customer activities.","Additionally during the year we took multiple steps to resize our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions, especially in our Energy segment. These initiatives will remain of focus in 2016.","Further we closed on four acquisitions since our last call. These businesses would generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue 2016 and significantly complement and expand our market positions.","Now, let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy exposure in tough comps and retail refrigeration markets, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew more than 4% year-over-year.","On a sequential basis China markets improved and European activity was largely flat. Both regions were down versus the prior year.","In Energy markets were even tougher as we moved through the quarter and into the New Year. Given that as a backdrop our teams focused on actions to drive sales and remained resolute in implementing cost reductions.","Our aggressive cost actions have reduced the impact of volume declines as reflected by decremental margins in the low 30s. On the revenue side, we estimate we\u2019ve generated 5% growth from new business, much of it driven by new product introductions and continuing strong service levels.","In 2016, we will strategically look to win new business with a strong focus on customer service and of course continue to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure.","Engineered Systems had a solid quarter with 4% organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our digital textile printing results were strong, driven by a significant increase in order activity. We also posted good results in our core marking and coding business.","In the industrial platform modest organic growth was led by strong results in our environmental solutions business. Fluids once again posted strong margin, despite revenue being impacted by oil and gas exposure, reduced year-end capital spending and tough comps offer a very strong fourth quarter of last year.","The solid execution resulted in segment margin exceeding 19%, excluding the impact of recently completed acquisitions.","Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, revenue and earnings performance was as expected. Importantly, we now see the benefits of our customer expansion efforts reflected by new wins in retail refrigeration. Our retail refrigeration orders were up 20% over last year, setting us up for an improved start in 2016.","As we\u2019ve discussed, we were able to close as we ended the year. Integration activities are well under way and our customers are excited about the broader product sets we now offer. Early results are quite positive.","Regarding the acquisition pipeline, we\u2019ve continued to look for businesses that expand and enhance our positions in our key markets and will remain diligent and disciplined on valuations.","Now looking to 2016, we expect Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment to all grow revenue this year. Within Energy we\u2019ve remained cautious. We have reduced our full year revenue forecast to reflect weaker U.S. market conditions providing some offset we now have better line up side on incremental new business.","Our aggressive pursue of additional business expanding our international presence and strong focus on cost is ongoing. We expect to make further progress on these initiatives in 2016.","In Engineered Systems, we anticipate solid organic growth led by the leading technology and new products offered across the segment. Specifically, we expect the marking and coding markets to be solid and our digital textile businesses to have double digit growth.","Within our industrial platform, modest organic growth will be led by strong performance in environmental solutions and vehicle services. This performance will be complemented by our continued focus on cost and productivity.","Fluids will grow driven by the recent acquisitions. We also anticipate continued strong core margin performance on the benefits of ongoing productivity projects. In addition, a well-executed integration of our recent acquisitions will provide a path to future revenue and margin improvement and enhanced customer service through skill and efficiencies.","Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment we expect much improved revenue and earnings in 2016, leveraging our leading technology and merchandizing solutions. Retail refrigeration should lead the improvement. We also expect solid performance in our Food Equipment markets.","In summary, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance. With that let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we\u2019ve reported fourth quarter revenue of 1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of 2% and an FX impact of 4%.","Adjusted EPS was $0.81and above our implied Q4 forecast. The performance improvement consists of $0.01 higher segment income and $0.05 on the tax line. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.3%, 150 basis points below last year. Adjusting for fourth quarter restructuring of 16.5 million, margin was 14.3%. Restructuring activities were broad based with a continued focus on Energy.","Bookings decreased 13% to 1.6 billion, largely reflecting significantly lower oil and gas markets and soft macro conditions. Overall book-to-bill finished at 0.96. Our backlog decreased 16% to 1 billion.","Free cash flow was once again solid at 274 million for the quarter 16% of revenue. We are beginning to see the results of our Dover Excellence program reflected in cash flow performance. For the full year we generated 795 million of free cash flow, representing over 11% of revenue, a full point higher than last year.","Now turning to Slide 4, Engineered Systems had solid organic growth of 4%, reflecting strong growth in our Printing & Identification and environmental solutions markets. Fluids decline of 6% was driven by weak oil and gas markets and generally softer market conditions.","Refrigeration & Food Equipments organic revenue declined 6% primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Energy organic revenue was down 40% on significant declines in North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 2% while FX had a negative 4% impact.","Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results, revenue decreased 5% from the third quarter, largely reflecting normal seasonality in our retail refrigeration markets and a continued step down in Energy markets.","Engineered Systems and Fluids were modestly up. Sequential bookings decreased 5%, principally driven by the impact of oil and gas markets and normal seasonality in retail refrigeration. Strong growth in Engineered Systems resulted from solid Printing & Identification markets and robust environmental solutions orders.","Now on Slide 6, Energy revenue of 323 million decreased 41% driving earnings down to 31 million. Energy results continued to be impacted by steep declines in oil and gas markets. However, we continue to see targeted customer wins in the Middle East and North America.","Energy absorbed an additional 4 million in restructuring cost in the fourth quarter and has incurred 31 million in cost for the full year. Excluding the Q4 restructuring cost, our operating margin was 10.8%, reflecting volume and price declines partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring.","We expect the carry over benefits of these and other cost actions to be approximately 40 million in 2016. Booking through 316 million in book-to-bill was 0.98.","Now on Slide 7, Engineered Systems revenue of 597 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, partially offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of 89 million decreased 4%, principally reflecting the impact of acquisitions in the quarter.","Our Printing & Identification platform revenue was 256 million, increasing 3%. Organic revenue was up 8%, reflecting strong digital textile markets and solid North American marking and coding activity. Acquisitions had 6% growth while FX had 11% impact.","In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined1% to 342 million, where organic growth of 1% was offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was once again led by environmental solutions. We incurred 5 million in restructuring cost in the quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q4 restructuring cost, margins were 15.7%, reflecting the benefits of prior cost actions partially offset by business mix.","Bookings were 608 million, a decrease of 2%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 1% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by 5% impact from FX. Organically Printing & Identification bookings were up 6% and industrial bookings decreased 3%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while industrials was 1.05, overall book-to-bill was 1.02.","Turning to Slide 8, Fluids revenue decreased 6% to 356 million and earnings decreased 1% to 62 million. Revenue performance reflects 6% decline in organic revenue, whereby the impact of acquisitions and FX largely offset each other. Our Fluids transfer businesses remained solid and were up slightly organically. While our pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets and the timing of large project shipments.","The impact of acquisitions reduced margins roughly 170 basis points in the quarter resulting in margin of 17.6%. Excluding acquisitions and related purchase having a deal cost, margin was 19.3% reflecting continued strong execution.","Bookings were 321 million, a decrease of 7% overall or 6% organically. This result primarily reflects slower year-end CapEx activity and the impact of oil and gas exposure in our pumps markets. Book-to-bill was 0.90.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9, Refrigeration and Food Equipments revenue of 419 million declined 9% from the prior year and earnings were 43 million. As expected, revenue continued to be impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid and our can-shaping business was improved.","Operating margin was 10.2%, adjusting for 6 million in restructuring cost for the quarter margin was 11.7%, down 50 basis points from ingested prior year reflecting lower volume, partially offset by productivity improvements.","Bookings were 380 million, an increase of 3%, reflecting significant improvements in order activity. Book-to-bill was 0.91, a large improvement over last year. This strong bookings activity sets us up well as we begin 2016.","Now going to the overview Slide number 10, let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was 25 million, down 5 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25%, excluding discreet tax benefits. This rate was lower than our last estimate principally reflecting passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act, as of now [ph] our full year normalized tax rate was 27.8%.","Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been modestly lowered from our recent Investor Day. We now expect revenue to increase 1% to 4%, within this estimate organic revenue is expected to be down in the range of 1% to 4%, one point reduction from our prior forecast due to oil and gas markets.","We expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, while the impact of FX is expected to be about 2%. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, at the mid-point of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 16.5% excluding the impact of recent acquisitions.","Our full year corporate expense and interest expense forecast remains unchanged. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28%, one point lower than our last guide, reflecting the Tax Relief Extension Act and the impact of recent acquisitions.","CapEx remains unchanged as does our full year free cash flow forecast. From a segment perspective, Energy\u2019s full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 11% to 14%, a three point reduction from our prior forecast. The expected full impact from declines in oil and gas markets is partially offset by incremental new business not in our prior forecast. All other segments were unchanged versus our prior guidance.","Turning to 2016 bridge now on Slide 12, let\u2019s start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.55 around $0.07 higher than forecasted at our Investor Day, reflecting slightly better Q4 performance and an improved tax rate. We expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to provide $0.15 to $0.17 benefit.","Performance including changes in volume, productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits will add $0.26 to $0.40 to earnings, modestly lower than our previous forecast. Within this estimate our restructuring benefits of $023 to $0.24. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.26 to $0.28. Acquisitions already completely including Toucan will be about $0.18 accretive.","The carry over benefit of shares already purchased will be approximately $0.08. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will impact earnings about $0.08, reflecting a minor improvement over our last forecast. In total we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.85 to $4.05. This estimate is unchanged from our prior forecast.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Robert Livingston","Thanks Brad. Markets are mixed as we enter 2016. Our businesses with exposure to oil and gas will once again face challenges, whereas Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment should grow organically.","Within this environment we will remain focused on new product launches and innovation across the entire organization, expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies, capitalizing on our customer wins mindset by becoming an even more important partner with our customers and leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow.","The combination of these actions is expected to provide incremental revenue of 2 points in 2016 and increase core margin 20 to 40 basis points. The bulk of this incremental revenue is sales from new product introductions.","Our plan for EPS growth and strong free cash flow in 2016 is supported by three significant activities that have already been implemented. They are the completion of several acquisitions that will deliver meaningful accretion. 2015 restructuring actions that will provide significant benefits this year and completed share repurchase activity that will deliver $0.08.","We expect oil and gas markets to remain uncertain in 2016 and we are poised to take further cost actions beyond what is currently forecasted if necessary. With that I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers.","Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, before we take questions I\u2019d just like to remind you, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow up. We have several people in queue, so the more questions we have the less people we can talk to.","With that Kristine, let\u2019s have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Livingston","Hey Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, Bob I was hoping you could expand on Energy where you said that there was some new business that you had won, maybe kind of expand there, what products, what regions? And you also mentioned international expansion.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Livingston","Sure, I\u2019d like to - look I think I have shared this comment on at least one call if not a couple of calls last year that as we work through this down cycle in the Energy business, we have continued to work on new product, new product launches and targeting specific customers that we thought we should an initial business position with or even a larger business position with. And in 2015, I think in the second half of the year, we estimated that we had about 5% of our revenue in the second half of Energy with relabeled as new wins. As we provided guidance and initial guidance at the December meeting, we knew we were going to keep the business that we had won in 2015, but we were not including in our guidance any anticipated new business in 2016 unless we actually had a contract or knew we had won the business. And since then we have won some business, we\u2019ve got contracts. Some of the business will actually have modest shipments on here in the first quarter and it\u2019s across the segment, specifically within the upstream markets, we continue to win new business with our PDC intro [ph], but it is most noticeable within our artificial lift business. But I would be remissive if I didn\u2019t throw or call that out [ph] to the guys and our Bearings & Compression business, they\u2019ve also been pretty active and have been successful in this endower as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Thanks, good morning guys.","Robert Livingston","Hi Joe.","Joseph Ritchie","Just a quick question on oil and gas, there\u2019s a lot of outcomes and uncertainty as it relates to oil and gas over the next three years. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense on how you\u2019re thinking about [indiscernible] business is set up today if we go to cash cost or if we get an uptick in oil and gas and really just where is your mindset there today?","Robert Livingston","Well, I guess to begin that answer Joe; I\u2019ll revert back to the answer I just provide Deane. We have been very active in taking cost out in 2015 and you\u2019ll see us continue to do that in 2016. But at some point in time we will see a change in this market and we are still convinced that our superior - what we believe are our superior service levels and the continuing investment we\u2019re making in product development are the right things to do to be prepared for an upturn when that occurs. Our assumptions in 2016 guide, we are seeing our plan in the first quarter, maybe even in the first four months of year reflect the current pricing of oil in today\u2019s environment, let\u2019s call it roughly $30. Our plan does assume that the price recovers a bit in the second half of the year. Our plan is based on $40 oil price in the second half of the year.","Joseph Ritchie","That\u2019s helpful Bob and maybe my one follow up is really around margins and Brad perhaps for you, within the 16.5 guidance for total portfolio what is the Energy number and how do you think about them the trajectory of Energy margins if and when do you get an uptick in oil.","Brad Cerepak","Okay, sure, so the 16.5 at the midpoint, that\u2019s an adjusted number, just to reiterate that. That\u2019s excluding acquisition related activity but with respect to our segment, the core margin expansion is really coming from the other three segments. We see Energy year-over-year adjusted to adjust down into 2016 and I would say roughly, we would say the margin expectation in Energy is around 12% to 13% for 2016. I would say the way we see the year on Energy, reiterating what Bob said is that obviously year-over-year in the first quarter energy is going to be down significantly. I would say we should be thinking about energy more like the fourth quarter moving into the first quarter, sequentially being pretty much the same and as it relates to the rest of the year than as we see in our forecast some recovery in the average price per barrel of oil, is modest. We would see some further improvement throughout the year. As it relates to the other segments, year over year core margin expansions so the first quarter and into the year will look a lot like the sequence what we have seen in 2015, that is the way we think about it.","Joseph Ritchie","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on pretty good industrial performance Printing and ID could you get us some color because it seems you guys did quite a bit better than Danaher reported this morning.","Brad Cerepak","Well, we had - as I reported we had a very strong fourth-quarter at Markem-Imaje organic growth for Markem-Imaje in the quarter was 4%. We actually ended up for the entire second half at 4%, we ended up at 5% organic for the full-year, but on top of that we had a very strong performance from MS, our textile printing business. And interestingly enough we didn\u2019t get any contribution for our higher margin accusation JK in the fourth quarter because of our AD&A charges, but we were quite pleased with the performance of the printing and ID platform in the fourth quarter. I would add to that North America was strong for us in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Obin","And could you just point to specific areas of strength that you were seeing as I said because I think the buy side and sell side are still gloomy in North American industrial and you guys are doing so well.","Brad Cerepak","Well, if you look at the three regions North America, Europe and Asia, I\u2019m doing this little bit from memory here, but I think North America was our strongest business and for Markem-Imaje in the fourth quarter perhaps followed by Europe and trailed by Asia.","Andrew Obin","And if I may on other industrial business what trends are you seeing, are you seeing any destocking towards the end of the quarter, once again very strong performance.","Brad Cerepak","No, actually we were quite pleased with the performance from Engineered Systems in the quarter both platforms, both printing and ID as well as our industrial platform and did not see any evidence at all of destocking.","Andrew Obin","Well congratulations, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you, good morning Jim [ph].","Robert Livingston","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague","Hey, good morning, just before my question, one point of clarification, about what Brad said about Energy in Q1 are the comment about similar to Q4 was that similar rate of year-over-year decline organically or similar revenue levels versus Q4.","Robert Livingston","No, actually I would tell you that if you look at the first quarter for Dover, if you go back and look at the first quarter of last year and the results will be quite similar and the other three segments excluding Energy, the real change you are going to change in the - yeah, in aggregate, the real change you are going to see in the first quarter is simply the year-over-year decline in Energy. Jeff as you remember the first quarter of last year was still a pretty strong quarter, I would love to return to that level this year, but the first quarter for Energy last year was pretty strong and almost all of the first quarter of \u201816 down from first quarter of \u201815 is attributable to the decline in energy.","Jeff Sprague","Right I was trying to get at whether or not regarding with an organic\u2026","Robert Livingston","On revenue actually, okay if you want to look at it sequentially I think our revenue guide for energy is probably down very, very slightly, maybe $10 million sequentially from the fourth quarter.","Jeff Sprague","Okay, thank you.","Robert Livingston","Our earnings are flat in Energy fourth quarter to first.","Jeff Sprague","That\u2019s very helpful. Hey can you just talk about the Fluids for a moment, book to bill it is a little bit disconcerting, you mentioned timing, but is the timing around oil and gas related jobs that maybe could continue to be a timing issue if you get my interest and just \u2026","Robert Livingston","Yeah, actually that was probably one area in Fluids that what was a bit of a concern in the fourth quarter, Jeff, the - we do continue to see the impact of our oil and gas exposure, especially in our pumps business and I am refereeing to the upstream oil and gas activity and that was down a little bit more than we had anticipated in the fourth quarter. We see that continuing in \u201816, in fact, I would tell you we have been overall I believe sitting here today we are being cautious with respect to fluids and our guide for 2016 because of that, it is just much more difficult to forecast accurately our activity through our distributors and the upstream oil and gas market and some of the other I call them second-order connect markets then it is with actively direct with OEMs. But on top of that, we did see an absence where I would call normal CapEx spending that you see in the fourth quarter, what I called year-end capital budget flush outs and there was a little bit different profile in the fourth quarter and I think we\u2019re being appropriately cautious with our Fluids guide for 2016.","Jeff Sprague","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Nigel","Nigel Coe","Just wanted to go back to I think the comment that\u2019s you made on regarding Energy the sequential but looks at the last year I think that was the comment and I am just wondering does that includes Tokheim because that is up the - is very material acquisition.","Robert Livingston","No, I\u2019m really referring to earnings Nigel not the top line, obviously in the first quarter we will have the top line performance from Tokheim, but I don\u2019t have the detector but I don\u2019t think we are expecting any contribution or earnings from Tokheim in the first quarter just because we have the normal, well I call it front end of purchase accounting on the Tokheim acquisition. Also don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that as we enter 2016, we don\u2019t drop it to disc ops because that rule was changed but we try to show this details to you on the attached slides that we didn\u2019t disclose a significant business, a $100 million business walk-in covers in the fourth quarter obviously that is not in the numbers in 2016 and we have another pending divestiture that should close here so in the next few weeks that is about a hundred million dollar a year in revenue that is not an guide.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that is helpful Bob. I\u2019m just taking a step back and I guess this repeat into the portfolio, the discussion you just made. How do you think about capital allocation here this year because it seems like it\u2019s a good - better environment to be a buyer yet obviously the macro situations are little bit less visible, so is there a bias towards spending more or maybe conserving capital here, how do you think about that Bob?","Robert Livingston","Well, I always start first with the comment that my preference is to build the business and through capital allocation and will make the acquisitions that are right to help us build bigger businesses and better businesses within Dover. And my second comment is guess we don\u2019t always control the timing of the opportunities. In fact if I remind people here it is rare for us to control the time and we get to say yes or no. I am a little cautious right now with respect to valuations because I think the sort of the down draft on public company valuations is not very well reflected in the - I would call it in private companies that maybe for sale. So we are being a bit cautious here with our outlook here over the next three or four months and then of course that brings up the question of share repurchases. And look, all I can tell you is look at our history we have been quite balanced between M&A and share repurchases over the last three or four years. You should expect us to be as discipline and balance over the next two or three as we have been over the last two or three, but we\u2019re not announcing a share repurchase activity today perhaps more on that over the next two or three months.","Nigel Coe","Okay, very clear, thanks, Bob.","Operator","Again, ladies and gentlemen please limit yourself to one question and one to follow up. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thank you.","Robert Livingston","Good morning Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning, just a question on Refrigeration and Food Equipment, adjusted sales were down 7% in Q4, but your bookings in Hillphoenix were very good. So, when you\u2019re thinking about the sale\u2026","Robert Livingston","Thank you, I thought they were as well.","Julian Mitchell","Right, when you\u2019re thinking about the sales base turning around, you are guiding up to 2 to 4 adjusted sales growth for 2016. Do we see those bookings speed into the revenues early in the year in Q1 or that is more of a second half feedings into revenue?","Robert Livingston","Well, no you will see the bulk of those bookings have the revenue impact in Q1 but not all. I mean we do have a different order profile with some of our customers than we did with the Wal-Mart and I think we are well loaded with respect to - our factories are well loaded in their first quarter with respect to our forecast, but we are expecting to see this business and this segment return to a growth profile and in 2016 and we are pretty confident. I would add one further comment, last year we dealt with loss of significant chunk of business from Wal-Mart. We are not looking at Wal-Mart as the provider of our growth in 2016, in fact I think the guys are actually taking the Wal-Mart business down a little bit again in 2016, but with that we still believe we have got a good executable plan for growth within the Hillphoenix business and within the segment.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks a lot and then my follow up would just be on the Energy segment. You talked about how you lowered your oil-price average assumption for the year, what about your assumption on pricing for your own products within that business of those - has that assumption change at all.","Robert Livingston","No, we closed 2015 pretty dead on about 3% price concessions for the whole segment and I\u2019ve commented on the several times during 2015. The bulk of that we saw within our rods business and artificial lift and as well as our PVC insert business, with our drilling activity. We do include in our guide another 2% down on top of that is 2% incremental for the segment in 2016 and we feel pretty comfortable with that.","Julian Mitchell","Great thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning.","Robert Livingston","Good morning.","Steven Winoker","Just a bit fire point to get on the Energy side what rate kind of assumption are you making in now for 2016 given this continued deterioration.","Robert Livingston","So, let\u2019s say I told you that in the first three to four months of the year we are looking at a price of oil 30 or below 30s. For the recount I think low end of our guidance we see the rig count down 28% or 29%, at the high end point of our guidance it is down 25%, 26%.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great that\u2019s helpful thanks. And then if you breakout both the Engineered Systems the industrial peace within that on the pump side the things that were actually down\u2026","Robert Livingston","Wait a minute pump is not an Engineered Systems.","Steven Winoker","No, no, I know, I am talking about two different segments. So within the on the first on the industrial side of Engineered Systems the down 3% on the bookings front and the down 1% on revenue, obviously that is not environmental which is - what is getting hit in that place, in that segment?","Robert Livingston","Well, I\u2019m not following your - I am not - you have asked me about the numbers but I will\u2026","Steven Winoker","You said environmental solutions was positive something negative","Robert Livingston","More of it, what you need to recognize that included in the industrial platform is a business that we owned in 2015, that we still own today, that we are the process of divesting and it is about $100 million a year and that revenue for that businesses is taking out of our guidance in 2016 and I think you\u2019ll note that is probably the most significant decline.","Steven Winoker","That is hitting organic, okay.","Robert Livingston","That is hitting organic, yes.","Steven Winoker","Okay fine and then I was just thinking on the pumps side within Fluids the non-energy side you got industrial plastics and [indiscernible] et cetera what do you think in those areas.","Robert Livingston","Hold it solid.","Steven Winoker","Okay great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi guys, and sorry if you already answered this question. I don\u2019t recall hearing you say what you\u2019re pricing your backlog look like holistically, was it that you said it was flattish, I think your sector Energy was better than kind of expected but the price for oil.","Robert Livingston","The pricing in our backlog gosh, Scott we are such a book and ship business, it is not something I really pay much attention to as I commented earlier within Energy our price for the segment, our price concessions for the segment were down 3% for 2015 and we expect another 2% down in 2016 but I\u2019m not sure. Does that answer your question?","Scott Davis","Yeah, I guess I was trying to get at the non-Energy stuff and see if there was some price deflation you\u2019re seeing on those businesses.","Robert Livingston","No, no.","Scott Davis","Okay that\u2019s fair enough and then what is the FX impact on the backlog, has to be pretty substantial I would think so trying to get some granularity there.","Robert Livingston","I would say we dealt with the bulk of the FX impact on our backlog in the first nine months of last year. I don\u2019t think we have any exposure in our backlog beyond what we\u2019re already guiding, which is another 2% headwind this year in FX and I should be sitting here with a smile on my face saying it is down from four to two, but still 2% is a pretty significant number for us, but again it is - we are such a book and ship business that you see it sure pretty quickly in revenue and I think we\u2019ve got it covered.","Scott Davis","Okay, all the other questions have been answered, so thank guys.","Robert Livingston","All right, thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Just a couple of questions on restructuring team can you just help us kind of reconcile, what would be the incremental restructuring did you guys took relative to the third quarter in Energy what was - I had my own expectation but kind of what was the steps up and down that was attributable to Energy from your third quarter guide? And then also of what were the year-over-year savings you guys recorded? I assume you\u2019re getting some of the savings where you took some heavy structuring early in the year, what was the savings that is recorded year-over-year in your Energy margin in the fourth quarter?","Brad Cerepak","Oh my goodness, I don\u2019t have that detail with me the restructuring in the fourth quarter and energy was little over $4 million and I think that was - I think it was probably up $2 million slightly it was up about 2 million over what we thought we would do as we entered the quarter.","Steve Tusa","So, I guess the question is if things are worse here going forward if it is not you guys are down more like in line of what you are down relative to rig count this year, I mean are you still taking kind of these only choosy restructurings or do we need to see more dramatic cost take out, because this seems like $2 million relative to your annual revenue rate and the decline to dramatic step down in rigs that we\u2019d had and the dramatic step down on oil price, is it a little bit late to help us feel good about the margins you\u2019re gearing (ph) for next year.","Robert Livingston","I think if we - and it\u2019s a good question Steve, I\u2019d tell you that if we weren\u2019t continuing to try to expand our customer service activity and we did in \u201815 and our plan in \u201816 is again to actually see an increase in product development spending within Energy, if we weren\u2019t doing that you would see actually more benefits coming through from some of the restructuring actions we have taken in \u201815. In 2016, I think our guide we have; I think $20 million of restructuring charges in our guide for 2016, 80% of that\u2019s probably in the first half Steve, there may be a little bit of trickle over into the third quarter, but 80% of it, I would say is in the first half. Of the 20 million probably 9 million of it is Energy. The balance of the 11, a little bit Refrigeration, but the balance of the $11 million is pretty evenly split between Fluids and Engineered Systems and if we see further deterioration in the Energy market - look we have got a - at some point in time we have this push versus pull of taking cost out versus continuing to invest for tomorrow and for being a better partner with our customers. And if we see further deterioration in the energy market that debate gets a bit harsher.","Steve Tusa","Got it, great, thanks a lot.","Robert Livingston","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","In terms of down 45 in drilling and production in the quarter, do you have the split between the drilling and the production piece and then are you seeing any change in sort of drill, but uncompleted well activity or any other dynamics there.","Robert Livingston","So, do I have a split between drilling and production, you will have to follow up with Paul and I don\u2019t have that, I will tell you as a cover comment that through every single quarter in \u201816, our drilling activity was down year-over-year much more than our other upstream activity which is artificial lift and automation. I think our drilling activity in \u201816 was down 60% or 65%, significantly more than we saw in artificial lift and automation. I don\u2019t know, does that give you a little bit color, but I don\u2019t have the exact numbers Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Yeah, that\u2019s helpful and in terms of I mean now that we are down at 30, I mean have you seen any change in behavior on the production side in terms of these uncompleted wells or anything else in the various space.","Robert Livingston","We are monitoring that pretty closely, we continue to see what is the industry, looks like [ph] ducts drilled uncompleted, we continue to see the ducts inventory built during the third and fourth quarter, that\u2019s always hard to forecast. For us it is something that we look at in our sort of our rear view mirror as the data gets released, but we do know that the activity is quite different between the basins here in North America. West Texas or the Permian basin is starting to see some increased completion of drilled, but previously uncompleted wells, we are not seeing that in the other basins and that\u2019s our fourth quarter comment that\u2019s not our first quarter comment.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, that makes sense, thanks a lot guys.","Robert Livingston","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi Group.","Andy Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning.","Andy Kaplowitz","Bob, I think you mentioned that China sequentially improved in 4Q versus 3Q and I know you had some comments of that at the analyst dinner. Maybe you can talk about China across the business, are you seeing more signs of stability there across the business.","Robert Livingston","You are referring to China, if the question is more of a general comment about China, I can\u2019t see the improvement we just don\u2019t see it, even when we talk to our folks on the ground there. I think the improvement we saw in the fourth quarter, I am going to trace it back to comments I have been making all year long it\u2019s - we continue to look for opportunities or new product releases, a new product specific to China market, even with some of the restructuring activity that we have planned in the first three to five months of 2016 and this is [indiscernible] comment within the Fluid segment all of that restructuring is in Europe, People interestingly enough and some of the benefits that we will achieve with the restructuring of China is actually being reallocated to increase our customer facing and service capabilities in China, there are opportunities for growth but I am not going to label, I am not going got label the change we saw in a n fourth quarter is a grounds well changed.","Andy Kaplowitz","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and you talked about Refrigeration already, but the margin itself was relatively low, a lot of that has to do with lower volume, do you think this is the bottom for margin in that segment and do you see have you seen any incremental pricing pressure in that segment or do you expect it to improve.","Robert Livingston","Oh gosh, this is probably the - let\u2019s not talk about the segment, it is specific, my comment would be very specific to Hillphoenix, I would say that this is always been a very price competitive market and we will see what happens in 2016 and 2017 where the change in ownership with our major competitor. Margins in the segment for the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter is historically, traditionally our weakest quarter of the year for margins for the segment. I think we saw that again in the fourth quarter of \u201815, but we do see a pretty good path going forward here in 2016 for margin improvement for the year.","Andy Kaplowitz","Thank you.","Robert Livingston","Do we have another question Kristine?","Operator","Yes, our next question comes from Johnny Wright with Nomura.","Johnny Wright","Good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning.","Johnny Wright","So I think in Fluid, Bob you talked about of extreme exposure 10% - 12% gas, does wondering about mid-stream exposure given we have seen some started to come [indiscernible] kind of more pulling back on CapEx, do you have sense of how big mid-stream exposure there is particular in the [indiscernible] and hearing from customer.","Robert Livingston","We have some exposure, I am not sure what the percentage is, I think it may be less than we have in upstream, we have we have seen it in some of our fuel transfer product that\u2019s deal with terminals and distribution I would say it was softer than expected in 2015 but I would label it as negative, we are taking cautious approach as we look at that part of the market in 2016 but I also point out that we also have this mid-stream exposure around Energy within our Energy segment in bearings and compression and we watch that pretty closely especially the OEM build rates around compressors and that was down in the second half of last year. We are not anticipating a recovery in fact I believe that the guys are actually see further decreases in OEM compressor build rates in 2016.","Johnny Wright","Okay, all right guys, given that on the Fluid sides and giving where you are floor keepers and the sales and the book to bill front, what kind of offsetting positives that give you comfort in that negative 1% to plus 2% organic for 2016.","Robert Livingston","Look, you asked a question about the mid-stream but still the bulk of our by a large percentage, the bulk of our activity and fluids is not in upstream or mid-stream, the retail filling piece which is fairly significant and even more so now with the acquisition of Tokheim we view as solid around the globe in 2016, it has both market expansion opportunities as well as some significant drivers and safety and regulatory issues. And we have embedded within that platform, within our fluid transfer platform is our medical and our connector business or fluid connector business and that business I think had 7% or 8% organic growth in 2015 and is looking at something similar to that in 2016.","Johnny Wright","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached our allotted time for Q&A today and we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 Dover Earnings call.

From a geographic perspective, U.S., Europe and Asia all showed solid organic growth year-over-year. Conversely, Latin America and Brazil activity was softer over that same period.","Now, let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, we continued to benefit from improving well activity and an increased rig count, primarily in our core production and drilling markets. Our bearings and compression revenue was impacted by lower OEM build rates. However, bookings were quite strong, setting us up well for the balance of the year.","Within Engineered Systems, we saw strong growth across both platforms. In Printing and Identification growth in both our fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets complemented by acquisitions, resulted in strong performance. The industrial platform also saw broad-based revenue growth led by outstanding results in both environmental solutions and vehicle services. ","Our fluid segment performed well, where generally healthy market conditions for both pumps and fluid transfer products complemented by recent acquisitions, resulted in solid revenue growth. Our pumps businesses are benefitting from strong demand and the specialty chemicals vertical while fluid transfer is seeing continued strength driven by increased regulatory activity. ","Our refrigeration and food equipment results were generally solid in the second quarter led by strong growth in food equipment. Our quarter two refrigeration results were modestly impacted by the timing of shipments as we completed the transition to our new Atlanta manufacturing center. We expect revenue to accelerate in the third quarter driven by strong bookings and backlog in refrigeration. ","In all, we were pleased with the first half and are positioned well to deliver solid full year results. Business activity in our largest markets continues to be strong as evidence by our bookings and backlog. We also continued to execute on our core productivity and growth strategies in the quarter. Notably, we\u2019ve completed the move to our new consolidated manufacturing facilities in Houston and Atlanta. These facilities not only improve manufacturing efficiency, but we also believe our customer service capabilities will be enhanced. ","Our acquisition pipeline developed nicely in the quarter. I feel confident we will be able to close several deals that expand our product offerings in served markets, especially within fluids and energy. Regarding our near term business activity, we expect ongoing strong performance in energy, driven by the increased North America well activity, continued growth in Engineered Systems driven by solid U.S industrial trends and global growth in Printing and Identification, strong results in our fluid market on the benefits of our recent acquisitions, and generally healthy end markets and improved sequential results in our refrigeration business. In summary, the combination of a strong first half, robust bookings and a growing backlog and our positioning with customers gives me confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. ","With that, let me turn it over to Brad. ","Brad Cerepak ","Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported second quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 6%. Organic revenue grew 3% and growth from acquisitions was also 3%. Adjusted EPS was $1.29, an increase of 14%. Segment margin for the quarter was 18.3%, essentially flat with last year. In the quarter we saw margin improvement of 40 basis points in both our energy and refrigeration and food equipment segments. ","Of note, our overall margin would have been up 40 basis points, adjusting for the impact of acquisitions. Bookings increased 11% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. This result represents broad-based growth across the company highlighted by 26% growth in fluids and 15% growth in energy. ","Engineered Systems and refrigeration of food equipment both posted bookings growth of 5%. Overall, book to bill finished at a strong 1.02, which sets us up well for the back half of the year. Our backlog increased significantly in the quarter, up 12% to $1.6 billion. ","Free cash flow $154 million for the quarter or 8% of revenue. Free cash flow reflected higher working capital in anticipation of a strong third quarter. For the full year we continue to forecast free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue. ","Now turning to Slide 4, all segments showed organic growth in the quarter. Engineered Systems grew 5% with broad-based growth across both platforms. Energy grew 3% on the continued strength of drilling activity. Fluids & Refrigeration and in food equipment grew 2% and 1% respectively, resulting in overall organic revenue growth of 3%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 3% comprised of 9% in fluids, 4% Engineered Systems and 1% in energy. ","Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 9% from the first quarter, where normal seasonal growth of 27% in refrigeration and food equipment was complemented by 8% growth in Engineered Systems. Fluids and energy were both largely unchanged sequentially. Sequential bookings grew 2%, demonstrating continued momentum coming off a strong first quarter. This result was led by 10% growth in refrigeration and food equipment. Fluids grew by 3% and energy was essentially unchanged, whereas Engineered Systems decreased 3%. Overall, the bookings activity was quite positive and positions as well as we begin the second half of the year. ","Now on slide 6. Energy revenue of $481 million increased 3% and earnings of $115 million were up 5% over last year. Energy produced another good quarter with solid revenue growth in our drilling and production markets, offsetting softness in our bearings end markets related to OEM build rates. Within drilling and production, growth was driven by improving well activity and the continued strong performance of our drilling businesses. Notably, our core U.S artificial lift business grew sharply and more than offset tough comps related to our largest drilling contract, which is winding down. We believe we\u2019re well positioned for a follow on contract, which is expected to be awarded later this year. ","Operating margin of 23.9% improved 40 basis points from last year and was in line with our expectations. Bookings were $477 million, a 15% increase over the prior year reflecting broad-based growth across those segments, driven by generally healthy end markets. Book to bill was 0.99. ","Now turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had a strong quarter, with sales of $699 million in earnings of $112 million, each increased 9%. Our Printing & Identification platform increased 15% to $287 million, driven by broad-based organic growth of 6% and recent acquisitions. In the Industrial platform, revenue grew 6% to $412 million, reflecting 5% organic growth. Our environmental solutions and vehicle service activity remains particularly strong in this platform. Margin remained steady at 16.1% with the benefits of ongoing productivity initiatives largely offset product mix and acquisition related costs. Bookings were $692 million, an increase of 5%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 9% to $282 million, boosted by recent acquisitions and strong activity in the U.S and in Europe. Industrial bookings increased 3% to $410 million, largely driven by strong orders in our environmental solutions business. Book to bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98 while Industrials was 1. Overall book to bill was 0.99. ","Now on Slide 8. Fluids posted another solid quarter where sales increased 12% to $346 million and earnings of $63 million were up 7%. Revenue was driven by organic growth of 2% and acquisition growth of 9%. As previously discussed, our organic growth rate moderated to 2% in the quarter, and now stands at 7% for the first half. This result is tracking well against our full year target. Segment margin was 18.2%, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year. Adjusting for recent acquisitions, our core business continues to perform extremely well, with margin of about 20%. We expect overall segment margin to remain in the high teens for the balance of the year, continuing to reflect the impact of recent acquisitions. Bookings were $375 million, an increase of 26% driven by strong project related order activity in the plastics and petrochemical markets, some of which will ship in 2015. Book to bill was 1.08. ","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration and food equipment generated revenue of $522 million, up 1% over the prior year and earning increased 3% to $85 million. Strong revenue performance in food equipment was partially offset by softer Latin American refrigeration markets and the impact related to the completion of the transition to our new Atlanta manufacturing center. We entered the second half with a strong refrigeration backlog, up 16% over the prior year and expect strong shipments in the third quarter. Operating margin increased 40 basis points to 16.3%. This result primarily reflects productivity gains and a favorable product mix. Bookings were strong at $543 million, an increase of 5%, principally reflecting strong demand for refrigeration products. Book to bill was 1.04. ","Now moving to the overview on Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $32 million, up $2 million from last year and in line with expectations. Corporate expense decreased $6 million to $29 million as expected and generally consistent with Q1. Our second quarter tax rate was 30.8%. Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter. Lastly, we repurchased 290,000 shares for $25 million in the quarter. ","Now moving to Slide 11 which shows our full year guidance. We expect 2014 organic revenue growth to be around 4% at the high end of our previous range. We expect energy to be roughly 5%, the high end of the prior range driven by strong North American market dynamics. Engineered Systems organic revenue was forecast to be up one point to 4% to 5% based on their strong Printing and Identification business and improved U.S Industrial activity. Refrigeration and food equipment is anticipated to have approximately 1% to 2% organic growth, reflecting a one point reduction from our prior forecast, primarily driven by a weaker Latin America. Our fluids organic revenue forecast remains unchanged. Completed acquisitions will add 3%. ","In total we expect full year revenue growth to be near the high end of our 6% to 7% range. Segment margin is still expected to be around 18%. Corporate expense is forecasted at $125 million. Interest expense remains at $133 million. Our full year tax rate is estimated to be about 31%. CapEx should be approximately 2.5% of revenue and we expect our 2014 free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue.","Now turning to the bridge on Slide 12. We have raised the bottom and top end of our EPS range to reflect our current view. We now see volume pricing mix contributing $0.26 to $0.33. Productivity will add $0.17 to $0.21 while investment and compensation will have an $0.18 to $0.22 impact. All other categories are either unchanged or reflect minor revisions. In total we now expect 2014 EPS to be $4.75 to $4.85. This represents 11% growth at the mid-point.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts. ","Bob Livingston ","Thanks Brad. Overall, I am pleased with our first half performance. We delivered solid revenue and earnings growth and also saw strong order activity. We are executing well and are well positioned for continued success driven by strong dynamics in each segment. Within energy we expect a strong growth in North American well activity to continue. This growth, combined with our global initiatives, including the potential for additional Australian project business, positions us very well into the second half of the year and beyond. In Engineered Systems, growing global applications for our printing and identification technology, including the emerging textile market provides higher growth opportunities. Within our industrial markets, our customers\u2019 desire for productivity solutions, offer significant growth prospects. Within Fluids, increasing regulations regarding vapor recovery and the safe transport of chemicals and fuels affords a strong business climate for our fluid transfer businesses. Additionally our pumps business is benefiting from strong plastics and petrol chemical markets. ","Finally, in refrigeration and food equipment, we continue to focus on the ongoing needs of our customers for productivity and energy efficient solutions. In addition, we\u2019re continually working to help them drive same store sales growth through our innovative merchandising systems. We expect to outperform market again, driven by market leading products and solutions. In all, the future remains extremely bright for Dover and I am very confident about our positioning and long-term growth prospects. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. ","With that Paul, let\u2019s take a few questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks. Before we put on the first question Laurie, I just want to remind everyone if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow up, we\u2019ll be better able to serve all the analysts out there. So Laurie, what is our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Banc of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. So question on the quarter. As I think about margin expansion opportunities for the year, energy bookings were nice. Fluids were really nice. You actually showed margin expansion in energy, and if you exclude M&A, fluids were very strong. So, what's the opportunity, and why are we still being conservative? What's the big headwind that we should worry about in the second half?","Bob Livingston","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch","Morning.","Bob Livingston","Your specific question is what should we be concerned about with respect to productivity and margins in the second half or was it \u2026?","Andrew Obin \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I guess the question is, if I look at the strong book-to-bill, if I look at the fact that (inaudible) -- for the second half of the year on margin. ","Bob Livingston","I think the guidance or the comment that Brad shared with you that margins for the year we still look to them to be about 18%, I actually feel pretty darn comfortable with that about 18% number. That doesn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not going to sit here and give you a specific guidance that it\u2019s 17.9% or 18.1%, but right now we feel pretty darn comfortable with the 18% number. The growth rate in the second half, organic growth rate for Dover overall should be up a bit versus the first half. We are seeing some pretty positive dynamics across the board in all four segments. Goodness, we could revisit each one of the segments and talk about it, but I think we sit here and look at the second half and feel like it\u2019s strongly within our grasp to just execute.","Brad Cerepak","I guess what I would add, Andrew, is that our first half margin performance into the second half sequentially is going to improve for sure. As we talked about first quarter, we go back to the first quarter, acquisitions impact is about 70 basis points. This quarter it\u2019s about 40 basis points. That starts to diminish as we continue to integrate and bring them on board through the second half where the full year impact is around 30 to 40 basis points. You will see that margin rate first half to second half sequentially improve for us.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch","And just a follow up question on acquisition pipeline development, you started out the year talking about $500 million to $1 billion. Then you dialed it down. Now you guys are talking about M&A opportunities as well, but what\u2019s the reasonable outcome for the year right now and I guess any color beyond that? Thank you.","Bob Livingston","Yeah, you\u2019re right. I opened the year with a little bit of guidance saying $500 million to $1billion in acquisition spend. I think it was -- by the time we got into April and May, I was sharing with you that that number could be closer to $500 million than a $1billion. Without sounding too positive, I would tell you today on an update that it's probably closer to the midpoint. Yeah, it's always difficult to predict an acquisition until we actually close on it. The profile hasn\u2019t changed any from what I've shared with the analysts and investors earlier. There\u2019s nothing that I would label as large in our pipeline. Anything from as small as $10 million to $400 million, that\u2019s there we are. ","Operator","Your next question comes in the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just wanted to get a little granularity on Printing and ID. That was a business that was a bit of a soft spot for you a while and now you've bounced back the last couple quarters. It looks like you gained a fair amount of share this quarter based on at least what your competitor -- main competitor is putting out there. How is -- give us a little sense of the sustainability of this. When I think about it, you're in a share loss position. You came back with some new product. You gained share back. Is this a one-time step-up where you're kind of back in the game, if you will, and then that more normalizes with industry growth or is this something bigger than that?","Bob Livingston","Scott, let me correct a couple of statements first. ","Davis \u2013 Barclays","Please do.","Bob Livingston","I actually think we\u2019ve been back on the game to quote your phrase, for more than just a couple of quarters. I think you can go back over, perhaps the last \u2013 at least the last four or five quarters and see the building momentum within that business. They\u2019ve had -- Markem Imaje had another great second quarter. Actually I think they had a great first half. I think they\u2019ve had a very, very strong last four quarters. Organic growth for MI in the second quarter, Brad was 8%?","Brad Cerepak","8%","Bob Livingston","Okay. It was fairly broad-based. I would point and I think Brad commented on this with respect to refrigeration and I commented on it in my opening comments. All of Latin and South America has been rather soft here in the second quarter across the board for Dover. That didn\u2019t escape MI, Markem Imaje as well. But when you look at our activity in the U.S, our activity in Europe and in Asia, the team is doing quite well. I think it's sustainable. We\u2019re showing very strong positive organic growth for the second half of the year. We\u2019ve got new products being launched in the second half of the year as well. ","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Fair enough. So, this is a little bit of a -- my follow-up is a little bit of a political hot cake. When I think about companies that, like yours, that have relatively high tax rates it's not crazy, but 30% plus is higher than the average in the group.","Bob Livingston","Yeah.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Would you consider an inversion? Has there been any thought of doing something internationally? Because there are some potential targets out there, of course, that could potentially make sense for you guys also and the added benefit of tax would certainly make it more attractive.","Bob Livingston","I don\u2019t want to say never ever but it clearly isn\u2019t in our planning or thinking as we sit here today. ","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Brad Cerepak","Scott, back to the tax rate, we\u2019ve said that we look at our taxes because of our geo mix. As we become more global, we do see a path to below 30%. And that\u2019s where we currently still believe we can get to. We\u2019ll continue to see the benefits of for instance the Markem Imaje growth is very global and it has a lower tax rate associated with it. So I do think we\u2019ll get below 30%. I think we said that by 2016. ","Bob Livingston","And a fair amount of our acquisition spend over the last 18 months has been outside of the U.S. I think seven of our last 10 or 11 acquisitions have been outside of the US. ","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital"," Okay. I guess what I\u2019m saying is does it matter to you that your headquarter is in Chicago versus Dublin or something like that? Does it really matter for Dover?","Bob Livingston","Technically, no.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. That\u2019s all I was really asking. So, thank you guys. Good luck. Congrats on a good quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","I was wondering if we could just talk about energy margins a little bit more. They were up year over year, but last year was depressed. I actually would have thought with a surge in drilling and production in the U.S that would be very mix positive and your margins are actually down sequentially on flat slightly up revenues sequentially. So is there something with mixer investment or something else going on in there? ","Bob Livingston","I don\u2019t think there is anything different going on. We continue and I think I\u2019ve commented on this at least once this year -- we continue to make our investments for supporting our geo mix, growth especially in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia and in Australia. We are at a low point rate now in our Australia activity with respect to energy Low point in sales ...","Brad Cerepak","Low point in sales and high -- and the cost that\u2019s still there for the next ...","Bob Livingston","Yeah, the cost is there. So, that has a little bit of weight on the margins. But Jeff, I would tell you that we ended last year and energy with margins of 24.8%. And I think my comment a couple of times last year is I happened to like that number and I believe that\u2019s about where we are going to end 2014, is about 24.8%.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Would that imply Bob, that there actually is upside in that number and you\u2019re spending it away because at this margin level you\u2019d obviously prefer growth over margin? Or do you think you are at some natural ceiling in that business? ","Bob Livingston","We are -- I would tell you that -- again I\u2019m going to repeat myself with respect to the investment that we are making and our geo mix initiatives as well as the near term carrying cost of what we are doing in Australia, has some pressure on the margins. Some of it also has to do with some of the recent acquisitions Jeff. Every acquisition we make in energy doesn\u2019t come out of the gate with 25% operating margins. ","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Right, and then just finally move on. Someone else this morning indicated a broad-based \u201cfade\u201d in activity in Europe in June. Did you guys see anything like that?","Bob Livingston","Broad-based what? Fade ...","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Fade. ","Bob Livingston","Fade of bookings or activity. ","Bob Livingston","No. I would say our activity in Europe was again pretty solid across the board for Dover businesses. Generally speaking June was the best month for us in the quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Bob and Brad, so I guess Domino called out -- I know you sort of indirectly referenced this, but, they did call out difficult product ID in Asia. What do you -- what's your sense of market conditions in Dover's performance and product ID in Asia? And, maybe you could talk a little bit about what your -- are you looking to do M&A there, or build the presence?","Bob Livingston","Specific to product ID? ","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, please.","Bob Livingston","Was that the question? We continue to see growth in Asia both organic as well as what we are reporting as acquisition activity, John. The recent acquisition we made earlier in the year of MS Printing does -- they do ship a fair amount of their systems into Asia. That said I will tell that the growth rate, the activity for Markem Imaje, specific to Markem Imaje, the activity in China specifically was not as strong in the second quarter as perhaps what we\u2019ve seen over the last two or three quarters. But I think I have signaled that a couple of times here in the last two or three months. ","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","No, I think you have. Any of your other businesses, Bob, inflected in China, either more positively of more negatively that you saw in the quarter? ","Bob Livingston","Well, when you look at the number for Dover for China, to get a real sense of that, you\u2019ve sort of got to pull out the lumpiness that we do experience in our food equipment business specific to Belvac and their project shipments into China. But I think all in for China, what was our growth rate? It was mid-teens in China for the second quarter.","Brad Cerepak","Which included a large Belvac.","Bob Livingston","But it did include a Belvac shipment.","Brad Cerepak","So I think adjusting for that John \u2026","Bob Livingston","I\u2019m not -- let me give you a highlight. I\u2019m not concerned about our activity in China. I know there\u2019s been a little bit of a slowdown that we\u2019ve all been experiencing in China over the past couple or three quarters. I don\u2019t label it as a problem. It has been a little bit -- for the core activities, it\u2019s been a little bit slower in the second quarter than perhaps it was a year ago. But our businesses are doing quite well in China.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah. And then my follow up, Bob, it really is to the energy business you\u2019re putting investment spending into international artificial lift market. Middle East is a source of growth. My question is this turmoil that we\u2019ve seen in the Middle East, has that in any way impacted sort of what your customers have said with respect to project disbursements and spending? I realize your business is not centered in Iraq or Syria or any of those places. But I\u2019m just wondering about the implications of what you\u2019re hearing and does it cause you perhaps to sort of think about modifying your pace of investment spending, either more forcefully or less forcefully in the region for the energy businesses? ","Bob Livingston","Okay, so let me respond to activity. Your first part was activity in the Middle East. Our activity there continues to expand. Perhaps, I don\u2019t have this exact comparison, but my sense is John that our activity in the Middle East is probably at pace or a bit ahead of pace of our investment rate of change in the Middle East. The second part of your question was with respect to customers. It\u2019s interesting that when you\u2019ve read the headlines over the last three or four months with respect to some of the larger oil and gas customers pulling back from either the Middle East or maybe some larger projects around the world and a little bit more focus per se on the opportunities in North America, I think we\u2019ve seen that. On one data point we\u2019d seen that with respect to the increased rig count and well activity here this year. But that whole backing CapEx, I will tell you I happen to think it\u2019s a little bit of the phenomenon behind the slowness or the deferrals we\u2019ve seen in our bearings and compression business activity. ","Operator","The next question comes to the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013Morgan Stanley","So just wanted to \u2013 Brad I think you called out that obviously you have pretty good strength in the fluids backlog, but some of that backlog converts in \u201815. So I\u2019m just wondering are we seeing a change in mix between maybe some large projects coming through there and perhaps you can give some color on that, Brad? ","Bob Livingston","I know -- this is Bob and I know that part of our backlog in fluids is dated into \u201815 and it\u2019s really related to a couple of our more recent acquisitions, the MOG acquisition that was completed about two years ago and then the Finder acquisition that was completed last fall, which are more systems type of businesses rather than distributed product. Is there a change in our profile? Other than that I\u2019m going to say no. The fluid for the segment organic growth in the second quarter was obviously less than it was in the first quarter and I think when we reported first quarter results we clearly indicated that we had some projects that were shipped in the first quarter, that as we opened the year we actually had them planed for shipment in early second quarter and at customer request we pulled them forward. Organic growth for fluids in the first half was 7%, I think we are going to be real close to that organic growth rate, maybe a little bit less in the second half. We will always see a little bit of the lumpiness due to the project nature of the business model we have at MOG and at Finder. Both businesses are doing well with the customers and both businesses are growing. ","Nigel Coe \u2013Morgan Stanley","Great. And then, just turning back to the M&A backlog, you started the year with that range, and then you sort of went below that range and now you're moving back to the midpoint. I'm just wondering, what's happened in the last two months? Are we starting to see more willing sellers coming through, or am I just overthinking this?","Bob Livingston","I think you may be overthinking it, Nigel. We can define a pipeline and Brad and I, internally we review this weekly what our status is and status changes. I would tell you that we are moving forward on an acquisition opportunity today that three months ago I would have told you it\u2019s probably not going to happen until 2015. It\u2019s not a new target. It\u2019s not something that represents a change in our attitude or our pricing discipline. The position with the target changed a bit. So just don\u2019t over think that. I still feel comfortable with the range that I opened the year with, the $500 million to $1 billion. And as I said earlier in the call, maybe today we are closer to that midpoint in that range. ","Nigel Coe \u2013Morgan Stanley","Okay. That's very helpful, Bob. And, just quickly, just to clarify a certain point. Any ambition to move outside of your defined growth areas? So obviously, fluids and NG, refrigeration, PID have been sort of your sort of growth avenues, but any desire to maybe add one or two other growth avenues going forward, maybe Greenfield?","Bob Livingston","I don\u2019t think you are going to see us do that in the next year or two, Nigel. I think what you do see and we\u2019ve been -- I think we\u2019ve been illustrating this for the past couple of years now and these primary growth spaces that we\u2019ve focused on we continue to push into new adjacencies and to grow our market space and to grow and increase the size of the available market that we can play in. And we think we can have plenty of opportunity to continue to do that for the next couple of years. ","Operator","(Operator Instruction) Your next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. ","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","First question is how much of the bookings number is acquired bookings from acquisitions of the 11%?","Bob Livingston","Yeah. I don\u2019t have dollar number. I can give you a data point here though. On the second quarter bookings organic growth, the total growth of 11% of that organic was 7.5%.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, great. And, on the guidance, as I sort of look at what you changed and walked through, it seems like you're looking at something like 33% incremental on the additional volume growth. And then, it looks like investment and compensation improved by $0.01, and productivity tightened up a little bit as well. Am I reading that correctly in terms of how you're thinking about it? And then, on the investment comp side, what was improving and on the productivity side, what changed?"," Bob Livingston","There\u2019s a lot in that question. ","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","I'm only allowed two.","Bob Livingston","The second quarter conversion rate ex acquisition was very, very positive, no doubt about it coming off of first quarter which was reasonably good as well. We are still thinking that the full year conversion on all the volume is in that range of 27% to 28%. So yeah, the incremental is a little bit -- the mix gives you a little bit of stronger conversion. As it relates to changes in the bridge, again I think we\u2019re just typing up a little bit on the volume and the mix. As far as productivity we continue to put considerable focus in this area in order to continue to drive performance and be able to make the investments we\u2019re looking to make. I\u2019d say sitting here today we feel very good about the progress we\u2019ve made on productivity. We\u2019ve got a lot of projects underway that will drive incremental gross productivity for us that\u2019s slightly better than we anticipated early in the year. As far as compensation, I\u2019d say that\u2019s just normal activity or true ups of where we think we\u2019ll be for the year in the compensation.","Brad Cerepak ","Nothing unusual?","Bob Livingston","Nothing unusual.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, great. One follow-up on the productivity side, though. The refrigeration plant move, did you run those plants in parallel? Or, did you do a hard turnover that drove the revenue decline?","Bob Livingston","There was a little overlap and the revenue declined. As we said the decline is just a deferral to the third quarter. We didn\u2019t lose any customer orders or anything in our bookings or backlog. It\u2019s in the backlog in essence. It\u2019s about $10 million or so of sales that will move into the third quarter. We had a little overlap of cost both in Houston and both in Atlanta and I\u2019d say that overlap of cost would cost us about a penny in the quarter in total for both of those facilities. But that will diminish now or go to zero in the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just one on the industrial business. You've had some decent organic growth there the last couple of quarters. Maybe you could just talk about where you're seeing the strength in ESG, VSG and maybe how you see the sustainability of those end markets? ","Bob Livingston","Okay. You\u2019re right. As we commented in the earlier part of the call in the industrial platform, we saw some outstanding activity. We\u2019ve seen it for the year. Actually I would say that this is not new. We\u2019ve been \u2013 these two business areas have been performing quite well over the last I would say at least 12 months, if not 18 months. And we see it continuing in the second half and these two businesses are very well positioned in their marketplace and with their customers. We see that being quite sustainable. ","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. And then, just a follow-up on the free cash flow targets, your confidence there given where you are in the first half, should we just look at it as a normal seasonal pattern, or is there an additional weighting this year toward the second half versus normal?","Bob Livingston","I\u2019d say it\u2019s mostly the same sessional pattern. But if I look at the second quarter the performance was okay, maybe a little bit lower than what we were looking for. But as I said earlier, June was our best month in the quarter and the teams have really \u2013 we\u2019re setup nicely now in going into the third quarter so there\u2019s a little bit of carry of working capital. So, on the edges maybe the second half is a little bit higher than we would have expected to going into the year. ","Brad Cerepak ","But we still feel very comfortable with the 11% target.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","On the refrigeration business, even with the deferral, can you just maybe talk about -- or if you ex out the deferral, could you just talk about what you're seeing from just maybe segment the customers from the Big-Box guys to the more local customers on that front?","Bob Livingston","Okay. This question -- my answer is going to be more specific and I think you question is to Hill Phoenix. First of all on the big customers, without sharing information on an individual customer, I\u2019ll say the big two that we\u2019ve talked about over the last couple of years, Wal-Mart and Target, we\u2019ve got a little bit of headwind that we\u2019re dealing with this year. Most of that has actually occurred in the first half. When you look beyond the big two and look at the regional retailers, that activity has been up for us. We\u2019ve seen it in all parts of the business, be it the cases, be it the doors as well as our refrigeration systems. ","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Got you. And then, just a follow-up --.","Bob Livingston","Steve, I could give you another color point on that. If we have any concern right now relative to where we were coming into the year, I'm going to bring you back to my comments earlier about the softness we\u2019ve seen in Latin America and South America. I don\u2019t know the exact number, but I want to say it was probably somewhere in the $11 million $15 million range for the first half. Revenue expectations in Latin America and South America were that much softer than we anticipated. And sitting here today, I will tell you that we aren\u2019t planning for a recovery or a rebound in Latin America or South America in 2014. That recovery is not in our numbers. ","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And that's core Hill Phoenix as opposed to Anthony?","Bob Livingston","That one is probably \u2013 That\u2019s Hill Phoenix and Anthony and our after-market services all together. ","Brad Cerepak","But it's not entirely just that business sponsor Bob is referring. That\u2019s the total company, but I would say Hill Phoenix is probably a bigger part of that softness that we\u2019re talking about. ","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. And then, just a quick update, so your business is down a little bit in the first half. I guess the margin is down a tad there as well for the whole segment. What is -- how is Anthony doing? And, what's the -- just remind me of the revenue base Anthony will represent in 2014?","Bob Livingston","Oh my goodness. Let\u2019s see. We track Anthony now as the business unit on doors only. All of the after-market activity of Hill Phoenix and Anthony has been combined into a separate business unit that is now reported under Hill Phoenix. So on doors only, what's the revenue base? $250 million just on doors and \u2013 I call it glass and door frames. ","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, and that compares to what in 2013?","Bob Livingston","It's up mid-single digits.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay.","Bob Livingston","Maybe a little higher than that, yeah.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And the margins flattish for the segment?","Bob Livingston","Okay, that\u2019s something \u2013 you\u2019re going to get some detail now that we don\u2019t release, but we\u2019re happy with the margins. ","Operator","Our next question comes in the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on refrigeration again because I guess you took down the organic growth guide a little bit for the year, but you had had a very good book-to-bill in Hill Phoenix in Q1. I think you said it was 1.3. And, the plant deferral stuff you'll get back. So, is it really just Latin America suddenly got very bad in the last couple of months in that business? Because you did have a very -- as you said, you did have a very good book-to-bill in three months ago. ","Bob Livingston","The book-to-bill for Hill Phoenix and for \u2013 especially for Hill Phoenix was very strong in the first quarter as well as it was in the second quarter. It's interesting. Again for Hill Phoenix, because of the way -- I call it the seasonal period builds and runs. That seasonal period being the second and the third quarter combined. Actually you get a better picture when you look at the period rather than the quarters because projects can move from quarter to quarter. If you were to look at the 2014 seasonal period, second and third quarter, versus last year\u2019s seasonal period, I think Hill Phoenix will be up two to three points organically. ","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. And then, just on --","Bob Livingston","We are expressing some caution around Latin America and South America. And I think that\u2019s what you really see reflected in a little bit of the down take on the organic growth rate for the second. ","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. And then, I think just on capital allocation. The last earnings call you talked about maybe giving a buyback update during Q2. I think in the quarter you spent about $25 million on the buyback. Is that a sort of a run rate we should expect, given you sound pretty positive about the M&A pipeline?","Bob Livingston","I think you could expect to see that run rate continue in the second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dean Dray of Citi Research. ","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","I might have missed it, but did you give a specific percentage amount you thought the North American rig count could be trending up for the year? We have been tracking -- it was interesting. In the beginning of the year, it was flattish and then last update, maybe 2%. It sounds like you're a bit more encouraged here. So, do you have a number for that?","Bob Livingston","Yeah. We look at -- based upon the first actuals and the second half forecast we see the rig count in the US being up about 6% over 2013.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","That's quite a jump. Are you expecting thy share gains in that higher volume or just holding steady there?","Bob Livingston","I\u2019m not going to speak to share gains; I would tell you that -- to get a really good feel I probably need to separate some business activity for you, Dean. I\u2019ve commented about our project business in Australia. If you were to separate just \u2013 I\u2019m going to give you some data just on artificial lift, not the segment, but just on artificial lift. If you were to pull out the Australia project business and look at artificial lift without it, the revenue growth in the second quarter was about 8%. Bookings were up about 16%. If you were to look at \u2013 again doing it for the full year that\u2019s embedded in our revised guidance, you would see artificial lift up 15% or 16%. And bookings up \u2013 I\u2019m sorry that would be the bookings about 15% or 16% increase in bookings and low double digit growth in revenue in artificial lift.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","That's for the full year?","Bob Livingston","That\u2019s for the full year. Activity in North America is pretty strong, Dean taking Australia out.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah. That certainly is reflected there. Then, just a last quick one for me, and it's a blast from the past, but for Brad, are there any stranded costs that will be addressed in Knowles, or is that chapter completely closed? ","Brad Cerepak ","I think that chapter has been pretty well complete. We continued to work on some smaller areas. But as we said in the first quarter I think we brought our corporate cost down quite nicely. We continue to keep the cost associated with the regional centers in the sense of where we\u2019re going to try to grow globally or we are growing globally. I think that chapter is really closed at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets.","Charley Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Just a quick one on refrigeration. You had touched on a few points of it, but I guess as I look to the -- you answered the question of the revenue outlook for the second half given some moving parts here. But, if I look to the margin, we don't have a headwind from Target and Wal-Mart. We certainly have a great reduction in that. We've got a catch-up from the shipments from 2Q into 3Q. I guess I look out to the margin expectation in the second half, and I guess particularly into Q3, it sounds as though that ought to get a decent tick-up in some of the margin there. But, I guess what I'm really trying to square that up is, how much of a margin headwind does Latin America really give you to offset these other moving parts that otherwise would indicate pretty good margin performance in 2H?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So look, there\u2019s more to the segment than just refrigeration. We\u2019ve got a sector we call food equipment. And it\u2019s interesting in the first half of 2014, I think organic growth for food equipment was slightly positive, like two points, even with the headwind we had it in Latin America and here is a point where our position, where we actually see a little bit of a headwind in Eastern Europe and in Russia, but it\u2019s minor. But for this sector, for this little group it\u2019s measurable. The second half of the year we see organic growth in our refrigeration business two or three points, but because of the project activity that I mentioned earlier around Belvac, the second half in food equipment could actually be negative organic growth slightly. And here now is the point on your margins. The food equipment group has higher margins that the refrigeration group does. So what you see in the second half is some increased volume, but you don\u2019t see the margin increments flowing through and it\u2019s all due to product mix between the two sectors.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's call will begin with comments from Bob and Brad on Dover's first quarter operating and financial performance, and follow with our 2018 guidance. We will then open the call up for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up.","Dover's providing adjusted EPS results and pro forma EPS guidance that exclude after-tax acquisition related amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis better reflects our core operating results offers more transparency and facilitates easy comparability with peer companies.","A full reconciliation between forecasted GAAP and adjusted measures, reflecting adjustments for aforementioned acquisition related amortization, as well as separation cost and the rightsizing costs, is included in our investor supplement. Please note that our current earnings release, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website dovercorporation.com.","This call will be available for playback through May 11 and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months.

We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement.","Also, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. We would also direct your attention to our website, where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Paul. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our first quarter performance reflects continued broad based strength in our industrial markets. We generated 4% organic growth and delivered margin improvement in three of our four segments. In particular, we had strong organic growth in environmental solutions, printing and identification, heat exchangers and our upstream energy businesses. A number of other businesses also turned into solid performances including Pumps, vehicle service equipment and industrial ventures. Retail fueling revenue was in line with their expectations whereas retail refrigeration was lower than expected reflecting tough comp in south market conditions.","With regard to margin, we delivered 70 basis points of improvement year-over-year and expect further increases in coming quarters especially in fluids and refrigeration equipment. We performed well in engineer systems in energy. Refrigeration and Food equipment was below expectations on lower volume. Fluids margin were slightly off reflecting some temporary inefficiencies regarding our factory consolidation in Europe and all our teams have done a nice job this quarter, a pushing pricing through to offset material cost inflation especially for steel.","We also had strong organic bookings in Engineer Systems and Fluids positioning these segments well as we move through the second quarter. The team made great progress on the spin off during the quarter and on May 9th Apergy will become a fully independent company. During the quarter, we also announced a management transition.","Rich Tobin will begin his President and CEO on May 1st, I'm very pleased Rich has joined us and I'm excited to see him put his stamp on the company. Let me take a moment to cover several other things happening across the company. We have continued to make progress on our digital efforts, our remote monitoring and IOT solutions and retail fueling and environmental solutions have enabled us to win significant new business. We're actively developing several focused offerings to help our customers, manage cost and improved productivity. Our pipeline is developing nicely. We have bolt-on target companies in multiple areas that add either technology or in market presence which is complementary to our existing business.","And lastly, we are well positioned to take advantage of the constructive global macro environment as most of our businesses are booking well and are poised to deliver solid organic growth this year. We had provided pro forma 2018 guidance, which excludes our upstream energy business. We expect solid revenue growth and strong EPS growth.","Brad will now take you through the specifics of our first quarter performance and our guidance, and then I will come back for some closing comments.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. As I take you through the next few slides, please note there being presented inclusive of our upstream energy businesses. As Bob mentioned, our results reflect organic revenue and bookings growth in three out of the four segments. Leverage on this organic growth, combined with benefits of our productivity and cost initiatives, led to solid year-over-year improvement and adjusted margin.","There are several highlights in the quarter; including broad based revenue and bookings growth in Engineered Systems, within Fluids, we had strong performance in our industrial pumps, pharma, and international retail fueling business, as well broad based bookings growth across the segment. And within Refrigeration and Food Equipment, we had strong growth in our heat exchanger and can-shaping business.","In the quarter, we also experienced temporary operating efficiencies including parts availability issues in retail fueling and weaker than expected market conditions in retail refrigeration. From a geographic perspective, the U.S, Europe and China markets all grew year-over-year. Let's go through the details starting on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue growth of 6%, which includes organic growth of 4% and 1% from acquisitions. Partially offsetting these results was a 3% impact from dispositions. FX provided a 4% benefit.","Adjusted EPS increased 26% to $1.16. This result excludes acquisition related amortization cost, as well as costs associated with our previously announced right-sizing initiatives, and separation related costs. A reconciliation of adjusted EPS can be found in our investor supplement.","Adjusted segment margin was 12.5%, a 70 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by incremental margin on increased organic growth. Bookings increased 4% overall. This includes 4% organic growth, which reflect strong results in Engineered Systems and Fluids of no excluding Apergy, organic bookings also increased 4%. Book-to-bill finished at 1.10 excluding Apergy, book-to-bill was 1.12.","Our first quarter adjusted free cash flow was as expected, reflecting a slight increase in working capital and higher compensation payments. Overall, we are pleased with our continued progress on working capital. Specifically working capital as a percent of trailing 12 month in revenue was 17.5%, down 200 basis points from last year.","Now let's turn to Slide 4. As previously mentioned 4% organic growth was driven by broad-based growth in both Engineered Systems and Energy. Fluids Organic revenue was essentially flat were industrial Pumps and international retail fueling was largely offset by U.S. E&P activity which came in soft as expected.","Refrigeration and Food Equipment decrease 7% primarily on the combination of tough comps and lower capital spending in retail refrigeration markets. As seen on the chart, foreign exchange was a 4% benefit while dispositions impacted revenue 3%.","Now, turning to Slide 5. Engineered Systems revenue was up 8% organically, reflecting broad-based growth. Adjusted earnings increased 15% over the prior year and adjusted margin was 15.3%, representing a 110 basis point improvement. These results reflect solid conversion on volume and the ability to mitigate increasing material cost through pricing.","Our Printing and Identification platform revenue increased 4% organically, driven by continued solid activity in both marking and coding and digital print businesses.","In the Industrial platform, revenue increased 10% organically, reflecting strong - very strong shipments in Waste Handling and broad based growth across other businesses.","Bookings increased 6% overall, including organic bookings growth of 8%. Organic growth reflects continued solid activity across the segment. Book-to-bill was 1.01 for printing and identification, and a very strong 1.19 for industrials, and 1.11 overall.","Now on Slide number 6. Fluids revenue increased 5%, including acquisition growth of 1% and 4% from FX. Organic revenue was flat, principally reflecting solid pump international retail fueling and pharma market offset by U.S. E&P activity.","Adjusted earnings increased 7%, largely driven by volume growth. Adjusted margin increased 20 basis points to 10.2%. This performance reflects earnings on volume largely offset by temporary inefficiencies including supply chain shortages of components used in retail fueling. Of no, productivity will improve as a retail fueling factory consolidation is completed in the second quarter resulting in substantially improve margin on a sequential basis.","Bookings activity was strong and grew 11% overall, including 6% organic growth. Organic bookings growth was broad based. Book-to-bill was a strong 1.13.","Now let us turn to Slide 7, refrigeration of food equipment revenue organically declined 7%. The decline is largely driven by tough comps and weaker than expected capital spending in retail refrigeration. Last year we saw seasonally strong first quarter activity in front of the new DOV energy efficiency regulations. We knew that this volume wouldn't repeat in 2018, whereas our can-shaping and heat exchanger businesses performed very well in the quarter. Earnings decreased 13% from the prior year and large contracted 80 basis points reflected the impact of lower volume. Bookings decreased 14% organically largely reflecting softness in retail refrigeration market in order timing in can-shaping equipment. Book to bill was 1.01.","Now on Slide 8, energies organic revenue increased 17% reflecting growth in U.S rig count and increased well completion activity and it includes continued solid results in our industrial winch business. Earnings and segment margin both significantly improved over last year. Bookings were up to 14% year-over-year. Book to bill finished at 1.03. As Bob mentioned, our Apergy business had a strong quarter with 22% organic growth.","Going to the overview on Slide 9, our first quarter corporate expense included $12 million of separation cost and $1 million right sizing cost, excluding these cost corporate expenses was $29 million. Interest expense was $34 million. Our first quarter tax rate was 22.6% in line with expectations when excluding discrete benefits. In the first quarter, we completed $45 million of share repurchases as part of our previously announced $1 billion repurchase plan.","Now moving on to Slide 10, which shows our updated 2018 guidance? Our updated guidance is presented on a pro forma adjusted basis, as discussed last quarter, we're adjusting for acquisition related amortization and right sizing cost and separation cost as incurred. Further updated guidance now excludes Apergy for the full year. Lastly, within our updated guidance bearing and compression which was part of our energy segment will be reported within fluids. And Tulsa Winch which was also part of the energy will be reported in Engineered Systems.","Moving to the guide, we expect 2018 total revenue to increase 45%. Within this forecast organic revenue growth is expected to be 3% to 4%. Acquisition will add 1% and FX should add about 3%. Dispositions are expected to have a 3% impact. All segments are expected to grow organically. Further, we expected adjusted segment to improve about 50 basis points over 2017 to approximately 15.1% at the midpoint.","In summary, we expect full year adjusted EPS of $4.70 to $4.85. Our guidance exclude second quarter costs related to the Apergy separation. Further this guidance represents an increase of approximately 15% over 2017 at the midpoint.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Bob, for some final comments.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Brad. Going forward the strong bookings in Engineered Systems and Fluids and are strong book to bill supports our organic revenue forecast. Additionally, we expect marking and coding, digital printing and waste handling to continue to perform very well. In Fluids, we expected another year of strong growth in our pumps and pharma businesses. We also expect bearings and compression to be solid and retail fueling to sequentially improve. In Refrigeration and Food Equipment, we expect continued and strong performance in heat exchangers and can-shaping equipment, while retail refrigeration will improve in the back half of the year as several customers step up the remodel activity.","With regard to the second quarter, we expect both Engineered Systems and Fluids to deliver solid organic growth as they ship under strong order books.","Retail refrigeration in second quarter will continue to be impacted by tough comps related to last year strong shipments and softer overall markets. We also expect to see improved margin on a sequential basis that all three segments especially at our fluids and refrigeration and food equipment segments. I believe that Dover is well positioned in 2018.","In closing, I just want to say that it has been a great honor and pleasure to serve as Dover's CEO these past nine years and I would like to personally thank every Dover employee for contributing to our success. I wish you all well and I am sure you'll have continued success in the future.","Now Paul let's do some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Bob, before we take questions I just want to remind everybody that if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow up, we'll be better able to handle the 18 analysts that are in queue right now. So with that Jennifer let's take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you, good morning everyone. Bob congrats on a good run; enjoy your retirement thanks for all your help over the years much appreciate it. Hey, I know you don't want to speak for Rich and you made the comment about him putting his stamp on things, but is it safe to assume that given that he's on the Board that this guy that we're getting today and the outlook we're getting today kind of conforms at his views of the world also?","Bob Livingston","He is not inherent of the guide providing today I can guarantee you that, Jeff. I think the forecast and the guide we have shared with you today with respect to I would say with respect to engineered systems reflects the very strong visibility we have for them in the second quarter. And I would also say the third quarter. With the fourth quarter, I think we are being a bit conservative with our outlook in engineered systems. And on fluids I will tell you, we didn't shared this in the comments, in the prepared comments here but we were very-very pleased with the order activity in retail fueling in the first quarter, especially as it build through the quarter, and have pretty strong confidence that we are going to see sequential both revenue and margin improvements in this platform and in this segment as we move through the year. It would be --I think the last thing I would want to do is Jeff as Rich is coming on board would be to raise guidance because I don't think it's necessary today. I think if there's going to be any change in guidance with respect to our strong activity I'm going to leave that for Brad and Rich to speak to you about on the July and the October call.","Jeff Sprague","Great, understood and then I just wonder if we could drill a little bit more in the refrigeration for a moment then obviously there's a lot of uncertainty among grocers in particular on CapEx they want to spend and what they want to spend on and that sort of thing. Can you just provide a little bit more detail what you're hearing from the channel? Do you see capital spend perhaps freeing up later in the year and is there any particular price cost dynamics that influenced the margins in refrigeration in the quarter?","Bob Livingston","So let me deal with the first one. I think there is a growing confidence that we have as a result of input and conversations we're having with customers that we will see increased spending capital spending in the second half of the year. But Jeff I will tell you it is going to be very-very much driven by remodel activity not new store construction. And without sharing the name of the customers, we have a couple of new customers that enter the order books in the second half of the year as well. So I feel pretty good with the outlook right now for refrigeration. Material and cost are pricing, I'll give you a response on refrigeration but I think it's just as important I give it for all of Dover. We entered the year with about $14 million of what we labeled as tailwind for 2018 what we thought we pricing - the tailwind we thought we have pricing above material and cost inflation, some of that has evaporated, Jeff. I think I'd get throughout the number $14 million on the January call and I would say our forecast right now and our guide assumes that $10 million of that $14 million has dissipated. But we have been much quicker this year than we were last year in pushing pricing through and many of our companies especially the larger users of steel have implemented price increases during the first quarter, we are taking orders now that have the new prices increases in them. And feel like we have got a much better start on covering the material cost inflation with our price increases this year than we did last year, across the border yes.","Operator","Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And I would like just congratulations Bob and wish you all the best. On the just looking at that slide in the appendix, you talk about the $0.05 of the EPS this year, coming from incremental share repurchase just wondered what sort of dollar number of buyback spending that tally too, and if there had been any change in the aspiration to spend the spin dividend all on buybacks this year?","Bob Livingston","Well, I'll give you a headline comment or response on that, and Brad can provide a bit more detail. So the nickel change in our guide with respect to share repurchases does assume that the dividend we received from Apergy spin will be fully allocated, 100% allocated to share repurchases in 2018. That said Julian, I will tell you the nickel increase on the guide is as conservative as we can make it with respect to the share repurchase activity. It does not assume an early ASR with respect to share repurchases; it is sort of feathered in our guide to occur during the balance of the year following the spin of Apergy. I will leave to Rich and to Brad and to the Board to make their final decision on how those shares repurchase activity actually occurs. But I'll repeat myself. The nickel could not be any more conservative on our share repurchase activity.","Brad Cerepak","So, let me just add I mean a couple of facts there, I guess our forecast is assuming about 140, 154.6 or so shares weighted average for the year. Remember the timing of the nickel is it could be done lots of different ways to Bob's point. But the power actually comes forward into - goes forward into 2019, where we see those shares, opening up 2019 in that 140, 145 million to 146 million type of share range on spending of that $700 million. So you have this carryover benefit going into 2019.","Julian Mitchell","Very helpful, thank you. And then my follow up would just be around the corporate cost, the guidance has gone up about $7 million I guess that's mostly costs that were in Apergy that are sort of stranded at the remainco for now. But I guess when you think about what that number should be feel revenue based excluding Apergy how much lower do you think that run rate should be than the $129 million? I guess the stranded costs would go away and then some of that base corporate cost also should be coming down because of the smaller revenue base?","Bob Livingston","Well, one of the right sizings we did last year, as you know and that's why we call it rightsizing, getting ready for the Apergy spin. You're correct that our previous guide I believe was one $122 million now $129 million. Little, almost $5 million of that I would say is this Apergy stranded cost that we've shown here in corporate. Of that $5 million we got to work through the details of that we have been working through the details some of it will go away a lot of it will go away into 2019 but some of it fixed infrastructure of a building for instance doesn't go away. But we're active on it. We're on top of it. We expect to continue to work it down and I would expect the corporate cost number to continue to come down a bit into 2019.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning. And Bob congratulations on your retirement and thanks for the hard work over the years.","Just one question given all the macro concerns just wanted to drill into one of the businesses, drill down to one of the businesses, specifically on printing and IT. Could you provide more detail by geography and end-markets both on sales and what are you seeing on orders if you seeing signs of a slowdown in any specific market or any specific geography?","Bob Livingston","Okay. I don't have the detail with me, the geographic detail for printing and IT though I do know in the first quarter I know that order rates were extremely balanced around the globe. There was nothing unusual in growth rates on order activity in the first quarter that would raise any concerns, but I don't have the specific numbers. And order activity the answer is no. We have seen no sign; no evidence in our order book would actually speak just the opposite of your question that the order activity did build through the quarter. And we are booking at a fairly solid 2018 at Markem-Imaje and another double-digit growth rate in our digital print business.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow up on refrigeration and food equipment question, given sort of the weakness of organic orders in the first quarter you are saying that you are seeing pickup in orders, but basically the pickup on orders has to be a fairly substantial to get you to flat revenues for the segment for the year. How much uncertainty is there about the order pickup? Or do you actually have enough visibility at this point to feel comfortable with this forecast?","Bob Livingston","Well number one this business, let's speak to our retail refrigeration, Hill PHOENIX and Anthony. I would tell you that and our customers recognize this is that our lead times over the last I would say six months maybe nine months are significantly shorter than what we were dealing within I think it was in, help me here guys in 2016 and in the first half of 2017 as we were making so many changes there in the factories. So it's the short cycle nature of this business is very well recognized by our customers today. We have very strong input from customers with respect to anticipated spending in the second half and the new awards that I referenced or hinted to earlier those are not yet, I mean we're not waiting for those to be signed they have been awarded.","Andrew Obin","Fantastic thank you very much Bob and enjoy your retirement well deserved.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys, good morning, congrats as well. Congratulations to Mr. Livingston. So just on refrigeration the book-to-bill was good but not perhaps as strong as it's been historically in the first quarter because obviously this is a very seasonal business with 2Q and 3Q stronger than 1Q and 4Q. Should we expect you mentioned back half deliveries, should we expect a bit of a sub-seasonal performance in 2Q before maybe being a bit better seasonal in kind of three in 4Q. How should we just think about all - base in 1Q?","Bob Livingston","Yes I think you will see this year that the third quarter is a much stronger seasonal third quarter relative to the other three quarters of the year that we have historically shown. If you look back in history, many years the second quarter has been the strongest quarter, with the third quarter being strong but typically trailing a little bit behind the second quarter. I mean we see that being different issue. We see in the third quarter, June through September are being the strongest shipment period for this business in 2018. And right now we do expect the fourth quarter to show organic growth for the retail refrigeration part of the business. And again I'm going to reference the new awards that have been booked recently.","Steve Tusa","Right, okay. And as far as the margin guidance for that segment, I'm not sure you've given that specifically but maybe just some color on how you would expect for the year, its play out for Refrigeration?","Bob Livingston","Well, I can't, I don't have it by quarter Steve.","Steve Tusa","No, no, just for the year, just color for the year.","Bob Livingston","I think we're seating 100 bps of margin improvement for the year.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Even with the first quarter start being down?","Bob Livingston","Even with the first quarter start.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks and congratulations Bob. So maybe touching on Steve question there for second on just refrigeration. So I want to make sure that I've got this right. The booking this quarter were down a lot but it sounds like the awards are have been booked, so just like or we're expecting this year?","Bob Livingston","No, no, I referenced two new customer wins. We have those contracts in house. But we don't have the releases yet and when they actually want the product shipped, but we do know there will be shipped in the second half of the year.","Joe Ritchie","So the awards will then be booked in your backlog sometime in 2Q or 3Q?","Bob Livingston","I would expect some of that to be flowing into Q2 and the balance of it in Q3, yes.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That's good clarification. And then I may have missed the last comment you made on a 100 basis points on margin expansion. Are you guys talking about refrigeration specifically?","Bob Livingston","The segment.","Joe Ritchie","The segment.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And that's start to pick up from Acadian perspective in 2Q?","Bob Livingston","Q2.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, great. And then one question on EMV, you saw some softness this quarter. One of your large competitors talked about it last night as well. Maybe talk to it's a little bit about how you expect that to move forward for the rest of the year?","Bob Livingston","Well, Brad, you have to clarify if I'm speaking incorrectly here but I don't think our EMV activity in the first quarter was any differ than what we expected and my statement is true.","Brad Cerepak","That's true.","Bob Livingston","It is interesting that we did see in the first quarter and here you are going to get into the new launches of is it EMV or is it commercial actually normal commercial activity, the order rates were stronger in the first quarter then we had anticipated. Across the board for retail if we like it. And I see across the board, I'm not just referring to our U.S. market. We had stronger booking rates most notably in Asia, especially China and India in the first quarter, but also in Europe, across the board for retail fueling. The order rate increases we're seeing are actually for new dispensers. So, as we get into the second half of the year, we are - our confidence is growing that we are going to see increased EMV activity. But we also know especially as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and even more so in the first quarter that was just completed, that some of the strong dispenser orders we're getting are for applications or for sites especially here in the U.S. that absent, the purchase of a new dispenser, we would be selling EMV kits. So, we've - we're actually quite pleased with the order activity we had in the first quarter and our confidence is growing that we're going to have a very solid year in retail fueling not just here in there U.S. but globally.","Operator","Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you, good morning everyone. Hey, Bob I would have thought that you would have timed your farewell to include one last appearance at EPG, how did that does not happen?","Bob Livingston","I made a mistake.","Deane Dray","Alright, we'll toast you in your absence. Could we talk about the supply chain disruptions, factory consolidation issues in fluids in Europe, just give us a perspective on what is happened and you just try it will be completed in the second quarter, so will it still be disrupted in the second quarter?","Bob Livingston","So, it is within the fluid Segment, Deane, you're correct. But to be more specific it's actually within retail fueling. So we as part of integration plan and activity with Tokheim and Wayne, we are in the process of moving production from the Swedish factory which was the Wayne factory into the Dundee, Scotland factory which was the Tokheim-- is the Tokheim factory. And that move I believe actually believe it gets completed in two weeks. Am I right, Brad? Its May, I think it actually gets completed in two weeks. And the - we did incur some additional I would call it overtime and let's just call it move costs in February and March that frankly we didn't have in our forecast. With respect to the supply chain, I don't remember all four parts and it really was restricted to four components that we had some supply interruption with in January and February. I think two of them were fairly much resolved and behind this but a time we exited the first quarter. The other two are being resolved as we are on this stone right now Deane and will be a non-issue but a time we exit the second quarter. And I think you're going to see some fairly significant improvement in margins for this segment in the second quarter.","Deane Dray","Got it and then for the follow-up, in engineered systems the comment about industrial businesses having broad base growth beyond the highlighted waste handling business, can you just talk for a moment about these other businesses within industrial? They don't usually get much of your time, but maybe if you could touch on those here that'll be helpful?","Bob Livingston","Well again it was broad based; I think I did mention in the script that we saw very solid growth at vehicle services in the first quarter. And I called out industrial ventures which going forward will be in engineered systems, but it was broad based across each of the businesses and the industrial platform. That said I will tell you it was most, the Company that led that platform in growth rates and the first quarter was material handling, they did an outstanding job.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys. Bob congratulations and good luck.","Brad Cerepak","Okay, you have two minutes, because I am leaving at 9:45.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, I'll be quick then. So, Bob can you talk about the change in free cash guidance, just marginal to 10% from 10% to 11% but cash as you know came in a little late last year in terms of conversion. So and you could sort of read into around working capital movement or maybe just being a little bit more conservative at the start of the year?","Bob Livingston","Brad will give you some detail on this, but I look I - we have indicated this pretty strongly, every week, every month, every quarter. Working capital was down again as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter, I think you're going to continue to see that through the balance of the year. But working capital as an absolute dollar amount did increase in the first quarter as a result of some increased inventory and it's totally connected to growth rates. We had really strong growth rates and order rates and engineered systems and in fluids and some of the working capital absolute dollar working capital increase and in the first quarter, are in response to the growth rates. But again as a working capital metric, working capital came down. You want to clarify or add to that?","Brad Cerepak","Not clarify but I would add a few points, our first quarter, we characterize as expected slightly negative; splits between I'll call Dover and Apergy about the same levels meaning about 50:50. And again, if you look at five years trends, we're always somewhat little bit negative to low single-digits in the first quarter, that's traditionally, what we've seen in our first quarter, so nothing unusual there. With respect to last year, I'll just reiterate, when we looked at, last year we came in at about 9%, little over 9%. Again that splits about the same for both companies, so, going forward to 10% called now, I'd say early days, a little bit conservative perhaps but, we think it's a reasonable number as we now go forward on Dover basis ex Apergy. So, we feel like it's a good guide for us.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, that's helpful color. And then obviously, - which might have a different view when he gets into the seat but, are there any more significant actions that you can take in refrigeration, if the weakness in the market persist, if it doesn't come back as you expect, can you do more restructuring in that business?","Bob Livingston","Well, number one, I'd tell you we haven't stopped. I don't remember the count, but I know that in the month of March and coming into the first part of April, there were additional right sizing steps taken, within Hill PHOENIX and Anthony. I don't remember the number but I think it was, gosh I think it was about a 110 employment positions that were reduced in March and early April. So we continue to, I think manage the business really well, and I will tell you the business leadership team at Hill PHOENIX and Anthony has done a very good job over the last couple of years. Relaying out the factories, reducing the factories footprint, and I think, I have a lot of confidence, we say little bit of volume growth here in the second half for the year, you're going to see pop in margins from this business that will reflect all of the work that this team has done over the last couple of years. I actually feel very positive about the work they've done.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Winoker with UBS.","Steve Winoker","Thanks and good morning, and congrats on your retirement Bob. So just you spoke about the M&A pipeline a bit and the richness of that right now, I guess the couple of questions there, one is to what extend is that a little bit on hold given leadership transition at all? And then secondly, Middleby, others have been very active we've seen a lot of closed deals in food equipment et cetera in the recent quarter, just give us a sense for whether that space is still a priority I suppose going forward, how do you think about it?","Bob Livingston","Well, let me correct something, you used the word richness. I didn't use that word. I think our pipeline is fairly active, it is absent at the current time, any significant or large deals, they're all fairly, I call them small to mid-size deals and they're all bolt-on and I would tell you that nothing has slowdown with respect to our pursuit of these opportunities over the last couple of months especially in the last few weeks as we've announced the transition with myself and Rich. And I think you'll hear more from Rich on this topic over the next couple or three quarters I am sure.","Steve Winoker","Okay. Fair comments. And on margins, those long-term margin targets is that in place, you've talked a little bit about it now, but just on the road map to those kind of 300 to 400 basis points for fluid and refrigeration and food equipment. What your sense of the kind of achievability in timing of that now?","Bob Livingston","I think we're in a good position to achieve those targets in engineered systems and in fluids. As I commented earlier with respect to refrigeration, we need to see this leadership team have a little bit of volume here in the second half of the year, pickup over the first half and I think you'll see those margins are achievable as well.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Hi, good morning and re-echo of everyone else, Bob, congratulations and good luck and really enjoy your retirement. I'm just - I'd like to go back and revisit that last question because I think it was a prefaced with a long term characterization. Those are 2019 targets right?","Bob Livingston","Correct.","Scott Graham","So you do feel that with the strong second half you can get to your refrigeration targets in 2019?","Bob Livingston","We're referring to the strong second half of 2018, we still have another year.","Scott Graham","Right, but there is I guess my broader question is there anything right now that you see and sounds like not but just to ask it directly where you won't at least hit the low end of those targets in 2019?","Bob Livingston","No, no. I feel very confident with the bow-end of this target.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. But maybe I inject something here because I want to make sure we're talking a lot about the back half here. I just want to maybe set something up here for a second. I want to go back; I know you don't have 2017 on a pro forma basis that will become -","Bob Livingston","Not yet.","Brad Cerepak","Not yet, but I'm actually going to give it to you right now. But we're going to file an 8-K after the spin and we'll provide all the restated data and you'll have that information. But in 2017 we did $4.15 on a comparable basis to our guide that we're guiding today on an adjusted pro forma basis. The way the year setting up, you think about this way, when you see 2017 you'll see the first half was 44% of our year, the back half was the delta 56%. This year setting up no different. It's -","Bob Livingston","It's actually identical.","Brad Cerepak","It's identical and so when you think about first half, second half and trajectory the business, yes, DR, FE we have some bookings that we expect in Q2 into Q3 which will make the back half better. By the way on food equipment same thing, we won a big piece of business even food equipment's been a challenging market. I'm talking about matching up with the well builds and Middleby, we feel really good about that business and we said this heat exchange your business is going to have an awesome year. And so we feel good about that. The last piece I would say just again you have this data it's coming out. Our first quarter, the way our first quarter on a pro forma ex-Apergy basis will look versus the $1.16 is $0.90. And we're right on pace where we want to be. Our guide hasn't changed; our guide paused for Dover ex Apergy hasn't changed. Our core growth is up 1% on the revenue side. Our segment margin expectation guide to guide on a pro forma basis hasn't changed. There's a little bit of a change in corporate that we talked about, offset by a little bit of interest savings as we paid down the $350 million of debt due in the first quarter. And a little bit of benefit on tax and shares. And that's how our guide sets up. So we're really sitting here today with fundamentally the first quarter as we expected the mix shift is different within the segments. And the trajectory of the business feels good to us.","Bob Livingston","And I echo that strongly.","Scott Graham","Brad that was usually helpful thanks you. I do want to maybe just go back and maybe try to understand price cost where you said that about $10 million of your $14 million, which I assume was positive price cost if I remember that correctly that is $4 million left and you're out there increasing prices so I need to triangulate here a little bit because first quarter inflation certain commodities obviously the metals complex was pretty significant. So are you saying that you are $4 million positive price cost on an annualized basis today?","Bob Livingston","Yes, without further inflation, yes.","Scott Graham","So then your price increases will make you price cost positive in 2018?","Bob Livingston","Slightly, slightly.","Scott Graham","Very good, thanks, that's all I had.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, impacts the margin rate a bit but yes, marginally price positive again. Again, as Bob said, we got ahead of the curve on this and that's where we still see ourselves at this point.","Bob Livingston","And it was different than what we experienced last year. I would say across the board here in Dover, the price increases, they weren't all done on the same day, but the companies all pursue this during their first quarter and we feel fairly comfortable with the position we are with respect to pricing as it exist today for the second or third quarters.","Scott Graham","Very good. I appreciate your comprehensive responses there and again good luck to you, Bob.","Operator","Your final question is from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I will also conclude with echoing the congrats to Bob. Good luck. Just a few follow-ups at this point, on the inefficiencies in retail fueling can you say how much that cost you in the quarter? And was that also a revenue headwind because you couldn't ship?","Bob Livingston","It was a slight revenue headwind. I don't want to make a big deal of the additional revenue but I mean it may have been. It may have been $5 million, $6 million or $7 million, it wasn't a game changer. It did cause us to incur some additional cost on express freight and some overtime.","Robert Barry","Got it. Got it. And following up on something Brad said earlier about feeling particularly good about Food Equipment business those lines up well build and Middleby. I know that's been kind of challenging for a little while is that - do you think that end market there is finally starting to show some traction?","Bob Livingston","I would say it's spotty. I think with some customers - we see some customers buying that or buying more that they were last year, but I would say it's not broad based. We're actually looking at growth within this part of the business for the year. But it's all around special projects and special orders. And I would also tell you they are all on the books. We have the orders in house. But we see a fairly good growth rate in this part of the business in the second half of the year.","Robert Barry","Got it. Just one last kind of big picture question. Are you guy hearing anything from customers about using past savings or new depreciation rules to step up investments at this point?","Bob Livingston","We keep asking that question internally as well. And it's difficult. It's difficult to pin in order to the taxable changes.","Robert Barry","Got it. So not clear yet that it's helping?","Bob Livingston","Correct","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for his closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Yes. So this concludes our conference call. With that, we thank you for your continued interest in Dover. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks again for your interest.

We would also direct your attention to our website, where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I was very pleased with our third quarter results, which were driven by strong conversion on broad-based revenue growth, highlighted by 13% growth in Engineered Systems. I was also pleased to see organic growth across all segments. In all, we generated 3% organic revenue growth, achieved record margin and grew adjusted EPS 23%.","From a geographic perspective, our North American markets were quite positive. Our China markets remained solid, highlighted by active Printing & Identification markets. And lastly, our European markets were improved and showed solid growth after several quarters of contraction. I would not describe Europe as recovered, but we were encouraged with our third quarter results in our early-cycle businesses.","Now some specific comments on our third quarter. At Communication Technologies, our consumer electronics growth was driven by new OEM product launches. These launches provided Knowles the opportunity to supply all acoustic product categories to this key OEM. Our volume was lower than forecasted, driven by 2 factors: the launch occurred later than anticipated, and late OEM product specification changes limited our output in the quarter from initial expectations.","In our Energy segment, we saw significant growth in our drilling and downstream businesses. Drilling benefited from share gains and increased activity in China, and downstream continues to serve a healthy global retail fueling and transportation market.","Within production, artificial lift grew organically at 3%, primarily driven by international activity, but was offset by a weak winch market and the timing of shipments and soft U.S. activity.","Within our Engineered Systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets were seasonally strong and our business performance again was excellent. Regarding our fluids markets, our solid results were driven by our broad-based pump businesses, which more than offset slow heat exchanger and dispenser markets. Our industrial end markets remained solid, with continued strength in our waste handling business.","Within our Printing & Identification segment, growth in both our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets resulted in very good performance. We saw solid growth in Europe and Asia and continued to deliver on margin improvement initiatives.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we see a full quarter of production supporting OEM products launched in the third quarter, which should drive sequential growth in consumer electronics, continued strong performance in Energy, driven by international activity in production and downstream markets, normal seasonality in our refrigeration markets and seasonal strength in our Printing & Identification markets.","We continued to execute on our acquisition pipeline and closed 4 synergistic deals, including 2 in October. We also announced another important pump deal, which should close before year end. Collectively, these acquisitions will help build out our fluids, Energy and Printing & Identification growth spaces. Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce additional deals in the near term. I'm also pleased to report the spin-off of Knowles is progressing well, and we are on track to complete it early next year.","In summary, I am pleased with our execution and results in the third quarter. Though I feel quite positive about our growth and productivity initiatives as well as our acquisition pipeline, we still face challenging market conditions. As a result, we have lowered our revenue growth expectations and narrowed our full year EPS range. As we enter the fourth quarter, I feel confident in our ability to deliver continued strong performance.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad M. Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported third quarter revenue of $2.3 billion, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Organic revenue grew 3%, while growth from acquisitions was 4%. Earnings per share were $1.53. Adjusting for $0.03 of discrete tax benefits, a $0.06 impact related to spin-off costs and $0.02 benefit from other onetime gains, adjusted EPS was $1.54, an increase of 23%. A reconciliation of our adjusted earnings per share is in the appendix of our presentation deck.","Segment margin for the quarter was 19.4%, up 100 basis points. This result was driven by excellent execution, the benefits of prior restructuring and cost reduction activities. The performance was broad-based as each segment reported significant margin improvement. Bookings increased 9% over the prior year to $2.2 billion. Again, these results were broad-based, with growth of 13% in Energy, 11% in Engineered Systems, whereas bookings increased 5% in Printing & Identification and 3% in Communication Technologies. Overall, book to bill finished at 0.96, slightly improved from last year. Backlog increased 2% to $1.5 billion. In the quarter, we generated $283 million of free cash flow, representing 13% of revenue. Our full year forecast for free cash flow remains unchanged at approximately 10% of revenue.","Now turning to Slide 4. Communication Technologies, largely driven by new product releases in the consumer electronics market, grew 4% organically. Energy, Engineered Systems and Printing & Identification all exhibited broad-based organic growth of 3%. Overall, our organic revenue growth was 3%. Acquisition growth was 9% in Engineered Systems and 1% in Energy.","Now let's turn to Slide 5, in our sequential results. Revenue increased 1% from the second quarter. New smartphone releases helped drive 3% growth in Communication Technologies. All other segments displayed sequential trends that are generally in line with our normal seasonal pattern. Sequential bookings declined 2% overall, which is reflective of our normal seasonality. Energy's bookings increased 13% on the strength of large orders received from Queensland Gas. As we mentioned in the last call, this important project will create some lumpiness in Energy's booking trends. While Communication Technologies bookings were essentially flat, order rates in our consumer electronic markets were up 9%. Printing & Identification bookings declined 1%. Lastly, Engineered Systems declined 11%, which is largely reflective of the normal seasonality inherent in our refrigeration markets.","Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $414 million, an increase of 4% from the prior year. This growth principally reflects the impact of new product releases in the smartphone market. In all, our consumer electronics business grew 6%. Also of note, our medical technology and telecom and other markets exhibited solid growth. Aerospace\/defense was flat. Earnings increased 19% to $76 million, and segment margin increased 230 basis points to 18.4%. This performance reflects solid conversion on volume, productivity gains and benefits related to restructuring.","During the quarter, we continued to make significant investments in the soon-to-be-opened Philippines plant to support growth and productivity initiatives for Knowles. Also we are pleased with our progress as we work through the complexities associated with our new acoustic product launches. As previously discussed, these OEM product launches were delayed a few weeks from our original forecast. In addition, late OEM specification changes limited our output within the quarter.","We are now fully qualified and are actively shipping on all acoustic product lines. Looking to the fourth quarter, we see both sequential and year-over-year growth in consumer electronics, driven by new product launches. This year-over-year growth will be partially offset by anticipated lower demand from Nokia and BlackBerry. Bookings were $424 million, up 3% from last year. Book to bill finished at 1.02.","Turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue of $577 million increased 3%, and earnings of $145 million were up 5%. Energy produced another solid quarter as drilling and downstream achieved strong revenue growth. Share gains, coupled with increased international activity, resulted in 12% revenue growth in our drilling business.","Production revenue declined 2% primarily driven by weak winch markets, especially military applications, the timing of shipments, and soft U.S. activity. Within production, our artificial lift business grew 3% organically on the benefits of our continued focus on global market expansion.","Within our downstream markets, we continue to see solid demand in retail fueling and transportation, resulting in 7% growth. Operating margin of 25.2% was up 50 basis points over the last year. This reflects the favorable product mix and strong conversion.","Since the close of the quarter, we have completed 2 add-on acquisitions to expand our retail fueling capabilities. The initial acquisition accounting will put some pressure on margin in the fourth quarter, though we still anticipate ending the year with margin in excess of 24% in this segment.","Bookings were $595 million, a 13% increase from the prior year. Bookings growth was broad-based, with all end markets recording double-digit growth. In particular, production was driven by strong Australia activity. Book to bill was 1.03.","Now on Slide 8. Engineered Systems had another excellent quarter, where sales of $1 billion and earnings of $172 million were up 13% and 19%, respectively. Our Fluid Solutions platform revenue increased 4% to $227 million, benefiting from solid results in our pump markets as we continue to focus on the oil and gas, plastics and petrochemicals and hygiene markets.","In Refrigeration & Industrial, revenue grew 15% to $778 million, reflecting the Anthony acquisition and growth in refrigeration, food equipment and vehicle service markets. Continued strong execution and cost reduction activities drove operating margin to 17.1%, up 90 basis points, reflecting solid leverage on volume.","Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect the normal seasonal decline in refrigeration revenue and the impact of modestly lower order rates. As a result, fourth quarter revenue is slightly off our previous forecast. Bookings were $884 million, an increase of 11%, driven by recent acquisitions. Overall book to bill was 0.88.","Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 12% to $222 million, driven by our long-cycle pump businesses serving the plastics and petrochemical markets. Refrigeration & Industrial increased 10% to $662 million, primarily on acquisitions. Book to bill for Fluid Solutions was 0.98, while Refrigeration & Industrial's book to bill was a seasonally normal 0.85.","Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification produced a very solid quarter, where revenue of $257 million and earnings of $43 million were up 4% and 9%, respectively. Revenue growth was broad-based, as fast-moving consumer goods grew 5% and industrial grew 3%. Also of note, we saw a nice growth in Europe and developing markets grew as well. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 16.7%, reflecting solid conversion, restructuring benefits and improved performance in our barcoding business. Bookings were $256 million, up 5%, reflecting broad-based growth. Book to bill ended at 1, up slightly from last year.","Now going to the overview on Slide 10. Third quarter net interest expense was essentially flat at $30 million. Corporate expense increased $11 million to $43 million, principally reflecting incurred spin-off costs. We also had a onetime pension curtailment gain of $4 million. Our third quarter tax rate was 28.7%, excluding discrete tax benefits. Capital expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. Lastly, we repurchased 650,000 shares for approximately $57 million in the quarter, all of which we repurchased under the $1 billion program. In total, we have repurchased 657 million and remain on pace to complete 70% to 80% of the program by the end of the year.","Now turning to Slide 11 in our 2013 revenue guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of approximately 3%. Adding in 4% growth from acquisitions, full year revenue growth is now expected to be about 7%. Our revised forecast is largely driven by a reduced short-term outlook for our consumer electronics business. Accordingly, we have reduced our organic revenue forecast for Communication Technologies by about 3 points to 6% to 7%. Our full year outlook for Engineered Systems and Energy is at the low end of our prior range, at 2% and 3%, respectively. Our forecast for Printing & Identification remains unchanged.","Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance and now expect full year EPS to be in the range of $5.57 to $5.64. The bridge from our prior range can be found in the appendix to our presentation deck. As a quick review, we now expect full year revenue growth of around 7%. Corporate expense is now $150 million and represents the net impact of incurred spin-off costs, pension curtailment gains and lower spending. Interest expense is slightly lower at $123 million. CapEx should be about 3% of revenue. Our full year tax rate of around 27.8% is slightly higher than our previous expectations due to mix of geographic earnings.","Turning to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. 2012 adjusted EPS was $4.44. For the full year, the impact of volume and mix is now $0.30 to $0.33, reflecting our lower revenue forecast.","Net productivity remained a key contributor and adds $0.25 to $0.28. We expect completed acquisitions to be $0.11 to $0.12 accretive for the year, down from our previous estimate, reflecting a dilutive $0.02 fourth quarter impact from our recently completed acquisitions. These acquisitions are expected to be accretive in 2014.","Investment and compensation will have an $0.18 to $0.20 impact for the year. Reduced corporate spending, coupled with the onetime pension gain, will provide a $0.02 benefit. The combined impact of our ongoing share repurchase program, normalized tax rate, the incremental interest expense should have a net benefit of $0.30 to $0.32. Our slightly higher tax rate had a $0.04 impact. And as mentioned, incurred spin-off costs were $0.08 and discrete tax items provided a $0.41 benefit.","Based on the above, earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $5.57 to $5.64. On an adjusted basis, our revised guidance reflects a $0.02 improvement from the bottom end of our prior range and a reduction of $0.06 off the top end.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks, Brad. As I mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance as we delivered strong results in a low-growth macro economy. I am very encouraged by our continued execution on our growth strategies and productivity initiatives. In particular, over the past 5 years, we have seen the positive impact of our increased focus on expanding our activity outside of our core North American and European markets. The focus is a bit different for each segment, recognizing their uniqueness and opportunity sets. Let me share a couple of data points as illustration.","Within Energy, there has been a focus on the expansion of their drilling activity into China, growing their production business in the Middle East and Australia and building their downstream position in all developing economies. Overall, Energy's revenue outside of North America and Europe has more than doubled over the last 5 years and is almost $400 million on an annualized basis.","In refrigeration, Hill PHOENIX has focused on expanding their business from their core U.S. markets to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and now into South America. Over the last 5 years, refrigeration's revenue outside the U.S. has grown from 10% to 21%.","These growth initiatives have been supported through our acquisition activity. Most recently, the announcements of Finder, SPIRIT, KPS and Fiberly [ph] all bring complementary products and technology to help foster this global growth.","In addition to executing on our growth strategies, we continue to do a great job on productivity and our operational excellence initiatives. We expect to continue our outstanding performance as we consolidate our manufacturing footprint and share infrastructure across our segments.","In all, I remain very confident with our positioning and long-term prospects. In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul E. Goldberg","Thanks, Bob. At this time, I'd like to turn it back over to Laurie. [Operator Instructions] Laurie, can we have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bob, when we look at our variances, it just looked like your margins were very, very strong this quarter. And can you help us understand a couple of things? I mean, one, given how strong the margin performance is, I mean, I understand the top line is coming a little soft. But is there any reason to expect those margins will come down in 4Q that indicates the guidance would come down a little bit? Because there seems a little bit of a disconnect there. And then just as an aside on that, you seemed a little bit more cautious on 4Q. Is that an indication that you saw something in October that scared you a little bit? Or is it just -- are you just being cautious?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, let me take them in order. So your first question, Scott, was about the continuation or sustainability of third quarter margins into the fourth quarter?","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, sir. That's correct, yes.","Robert A. Livingston","So historically, our -- we have so much seasonality in a couple of our segments that the fourth quarter, both revenue and margins, have historically been less than what we achieved in both the second and the third quarter. So you will see the margins come down in the fourth quarter. But I think maybe embedded in your question was, is there anything unusual in the third quarter that benefited our margins? And the answer is no. We have been executing not just this year, but last year, on our productivity initiatives. Scott, we're going to have about $30 million of restructuring charges for the full calendar year of '13, and it was very much front-end loaded. I think 2\/3 of those charges occurred in the first half. And I think what you're seeing here in the third quarter, we'll see some more in the fourth quarter. We'll continue with this in 2014. You're seeing the benefits of some of those productivity initiatives. The second question, am I being cautious? For the fourth quarter, did I see something -- have we seen something different here in October? We haven't seen anything different in October. I would tell you that when you look at our revenue, our revenue guidance, and you go from the top end of our previous guidance of 3 to 5 to our current guidance of 3, I'll throw out a number. Let's just say we're talking about $130 million to $150 million of organic revenue. Scott, from an internal goal perspective, I would say that the bulk of that reduction is a result of third quarter revenue not meeting our internal expectations. We saw a little bit of a miss in Energy, especially in production; a little bit of a miss even with an outstanding quarter with respect to our internal goals. Hill PHOENIX is off a little bit. And then we have the issue at Comm Tech, Communication Technologies. We were probably off, oh, maybe $25 million from our internal goal in the third quarter due to the late product launches. And we're probably going to be about $20 million off our internal goal in the fourth quarter due to some lower volume that we're now seeing at Nokia and RIM -- or I'm sorry, BlackBerry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just -- obviously, you provided some good color in terms of the impact from Nokia and BlackBerry in 4Q. But can you just spend a bit about the $0.06 growth in similar charge between handsets and other fee?","Brad M. Cerepak","Okay. I don't have -- I'm not sure I have that data for the third quarter. I can tell you how we look at it for the year, Nigel. We're looking at, in consumer electronics, a growth year-over-year for the full year of about 13%. But it is interesting. Within consumer electronics for the year, that growth of 13%, embedded in that is handset growth of about 20%. So that sort of begs the question, if handset is growing at 20%, what's not growing? And I would say we're relatively flat in other areas in consumer electronics like components for earbuds, notebooks. And I -- the tablet market has been rather flat, a little bit of growth this year. But I would also point out that we're about ready to see the launch of some new products in the tablet market that we have pretty strong participation in, that will benefit Communication Technologies as we go into 2014.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Now tablets traditionally been quite a weak area for you guys. I mean, would there be share gains?","Robert A. Livingston","Would you repeat that question?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. I mean, the tablet hasn't a been strong area for Knowles traditionally. So would those represent share gains?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, I would say we've had strong participation in the tablet market, but probably not as strong of a share position in the tablet market as we have had in the handset market. I actually believe as we exit this year going into '14, you'll see these guys with a stronger share position in the tablet market than we've had historically.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-on. Post-Knowles, you're obviously going to have a good-sized contribution from Energy in the portfolio. We're starting to see some weakening on the production side in North America. Can you maybe just talk about some of the changes that you've experienced and seen on the production side in North America? And are you content to have such a large proportion of your EBIT driven by Energy going forward?","Robert A. Livingston","The changes we see in North America? Let me give you a comment on the third quarter. I would -- I'd circle a number. I'd circle a number of about $25 million that I feel we were short of with respect to our internal goals for production in the third quarter. Nigel, $8 million of that was actually shipments scheduled for the third quarter that were ready, that were shipped, and we had a deferral on revenue recognition. I'm blaming Brad on that, okay? But we did have a little bit of a slower start in Canada as we came out of the spring thaw. We saw activity a little softer there in July and August. But I would say that the activity in Canada in September and so far here in October has been back to normal levels, and we're quite happy with the activity level. The one comment I'd share on the U.S. market, and this is sort of the reason why I have my comment about softer U.S. activity, it's very, very specific to a couple of Texas basins or Texas fields. The Permian Basin for -- I guess in particular, was down for us, not only down against last year but down against expectations. The other basins around North America, especially in the U.S., were actually solid to strong. But there was a shortfall in the Permian Basin.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And what would have caused that?","Robert A. Livingston","I think most of it is inventory adjustments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I just wanted to make sure I understand the Comm Tech context, because some other tech firms have been reporting weaker China emerging markets this earnings season. So it sounds like, Bob and Brad, that, that's not really what you're experiencing. This was more Dover specific, or is the 3-point reduction, is there any aspect of the market that you are seeing that may not have to do with your own timing of orders?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I wouldn't -- I would not label the change in revenue at Communications Technologies as having anything to do with the geographic market. As I commented, it was all about the OEM product launches that were a few weeks later than we had anticipated, not only the beginning of the year, but I would also say at the end of the second quarter, and continuing, I would say, a continuing struggle that we're having with lower volume, especially here in the fourth quarter at Nokia and BlackBerry. It is interesting, I -- you mentioned China. I'll share another interesting data point. You look at our 3 largest geographic markets, and I'll label them as North America, Europe and then Asia, including China. John, we had 4% organic growth in all 4 markets. We -- it was -- I commented in my prepared script about the growth in Europe. We had 4% growth in Europe. We saw some early signs of that as we were coming out of the fourth quarter -- or the second quarter. But we had a very strong quarter in Europe, especially in 2 or 3 of our early-cycle businesses.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Bob, the performance then of the segment, and I mean you called out a little bit of the issues, was there a difference as you kind of looked into the segment in the fourth quarter between MEMS and non-MEMS business of the segment?","Robert A. Livingston","In the fourth quarter?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, in the third quarter and that leads you to obviously your commentary around the fourth quarter in the slightly lower reduction of target.","Robert A. Livingston","In the handset market? No, not really. We obviously have a stronger position with MEMS in the non-high-handset piece of the consumer electronics market. But I made a comment about late spec changes by the OEM. That was not on just one product. That was on a couple of products. It was MEMS as well as speaker boxes.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then with respect to share repurchase, what are your thoughts -- particularly at Knowles, I'm presuming it's going to pay the parent, you guys, a dividend. What are your thoughts toward extending possibly share repurchase next year based on that, or just the success of the program this year?","Robert A. Livingston","John, I'll wait and comment on that in the first quarter.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Last question, Bob. Was there any benefit? The margin expansion was very impressive. Was there any benefit from -- I mean, you called that restructuring, right? That was front-end loaded this year. Was there any benefit from the supplier sourcing initiatives that Dover had begun under your leadership a few years ago? Or has that, for the most part, tailed off and this is...","Robert A. Livingston","No, I wouldn't say it's tailed off. In fact, it's been rather steady for the last couple of years. I don't have a separate data point to pull out of that. But yes, that has been part of it, and continues to be part of it and will continue to be part of our operational excellence and productivity initiatives for next year.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it sounds like you feel pretty good about the runway, particularly if volumes begin to pick back up again?","Robert A. Livingston","I think we're very, very well positioned for any pickup in volume.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Bob, so can you just explain a little bit more what drove these required spec changes and I guess why they came so late? And have you experienced this type of requirement before? And just -- you talked about some market share losses. Are those recoverable or temporary in the quarter? Maybe fill that out, too.","Robert A. Livingston","Oh, gosh, Shannon. If you're asking me to give you a technical explanation of those spec changes, I could probably do it and be wrong, okay? Is it normal? We don't see it on every product launch. Does it happen on occasion? Yes, and so I wouldn't label this as an unusual occurrence, but it does happen on occasion. And when I say a late spec change, if memory serves me correctly, I think we were dealing with a specification change like 3 weeks, 4 weeks prior to the OEM's product launch. It was that late in the cycle.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And the losses, the market share losses you're talking about, I mean, are those permanent losses? Or what occurred there?","Robert A. Livingston","No. Actually, I will tell you, as we came out of the third quarter and here in October, we are shipping on all of our acoustic products to the OEMs that we're qualified with according to our share award. And furthermore, I would tell you that we're shipping just about everything we can build.","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes, that's what I would have said. We're shipping everything that we can make.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just over on Energy then, on the drilling business, I mean, it was up 12%. Obviously, the comp probably is starting to get really easy there. But you talked about China drilling. I mean, are you actually expecting sort of strong growth to resume in drilling? Or was that kind a comp-related pop this quarter?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, you are right. We did have a bit of an easier comp, but I've got to give some credit to the business guys here. It wasn't just an easy comp. The share gains that I mentioned, I would label that activity around our core customers here in North America. But there has been a growing and a building of activity and expanding their customer base outside of the core customers here in North America, and they've started to have some success over the last couple of years in China. The success has been building this year. And the activity in the third quarter was significant enough for them in China, that I wanted to point that out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I just had a question on the fluids business inside Engineered Systems. At the beginning of the year, there were some customer deferrals. I think those went away. But obviously, one of the major pumps guys came out with some sales reduction this morning. I just wondered organically within your fluids business, what are you seeing? So I think some numbers you mentioned had acquisitions included.","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So organically in fluids, gosh, Brad, help me. I think it was 4%?","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes, the fluids, as we defined it, was more than pumps.","Robert A. Livingston","Yes, but within the platform, I think it was 4% organic. But it's interesting, we've got 3 businesses in our fluids platform. The pumps business that you're referring to was the best performing on a comp basis in the third quarter. In fact, the other 2 businesses in fluids actually had negative organic growth. My comment earlier about our growth in Europe, I will tell you, did not include these 2 businesses in fluids, which is our heat exchanger business and our dispenser business. Both were down in Europe in the third quarter, which is a key market for both. But our pumps business is performing pretty solid around the globe, not just in Europe.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then on the restructuring and the kind of productivity savings, I mean, you pushed up by a few cents the kind of productivity savings you expect to get this year. Does that reflect any kind of acceleration in restructuring spend? Or are you just getting a better payback on the plans that you had outlined at the beginning of the year?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, I think we may be getting a little bit better payback now, but I'm not sure that's the significant item. I think we have found opportunities, as the year has progressed, to increase our productivity actions. I actually think coming into the year, maybe our restructuring charge number for the year may have been low 20s, $20 million or $22 million.","Brad M. Cerepak","$22 million, yes.","Robert A. Livingston","We're going to end the year at ...","Brad M. Cerepak","Almost $30 million.","Robert A. Livingston","Almost $30 million. So we have able to find additional opportunities that we didn't have on our activity plans at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just back to Energy and your confidence in Q4 or perhaps uncertainty on Q4. If we go back to the Q2 discussion and if we would have left that Queensland order in Q2 where it belongs, the book to bill was 1.3. But if we leave that guy over in Q2, it puts the Energy book to bill at only 0.9 here in Q3. So I'm just wondering now, as you look actually at your Q4 revenue forecast, are there substantial kind of book-and-ship type activities that you need to see happen here in the fourth quarter to reach that forecast? Or is it kind of in backlog at this point?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I would -- for the businesses within Energy that I would say actually sort of manage their activity driven by a backlog, I would say the backlog is there for the fourth quarter. Jeff, the bulk of our -- aside from this Queensland order that we referred to a couple of times, the bulk of our activity in artificial lift, and I would say even within drilling and for probably half of downstream, it may not be booked and shipped in the same month, but it's a pretty quick cycle business. The activity -- I'm actually fairly confident with our outlook for Energy for the fourth quarter. I think we'll see a pretty strong recovery in production in the fourth quarter, both here in the U.S., as well as our increased activity in our geo-expansion initiatives. And we're looking for a fairly solid performance again in the fourth quarter from downstream.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. I'm just wondering on back to Comm Tech and the pressure from Nokia and BlackBerry, I think in the Knowles Form 10, only Samsung was called out as being above 10% of sales. I may be incorrect on that. But obviously, Nokia and BlackBerry have been shrinking for a long time. Are they collectively over 10% of sales? Or how big are they at this point?","Robert A. Livingston","Oh, gosh. I wasn't -- I didn't brief myself on the Form 10 coming into this call this morning. I don't believe -- you're asking if Nokia and BlackBerry together represent 10% of Comm Tech's revenue, the answer is no, not even close.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. So that bleed then starts to kind of burn off, right? I mean, obviously, there's some channel disruptions from BlackBerry's failed launches and everything, but...","Robert A. Livingston","Yes, yes.","Brad M. Cerepak","I agree with that.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. Okay. And then just finally, and I'll pass it. Bob, you said Hill PHOENIX came in a little bit light of your expectations. Was there anything in particular that stood out? Was it project timing? Anything of note there?","Robert A. Livingston","If I had to point to 2 things, Jeff, I would say we continue to see softness in the U.S. market in the Northeast. And we saw that through the first half of the year. I would say that it was probably a little bit softer in the third quarter than even we saw in the first half of the year. But I also think that what we're seeing here in the second half of the year is a little bit of a reduced expectations in Mexico for Hill PHOENIX.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Interesting. And Anthony is not in your organic...","Robert A. Livingston","With respect to Mexico, that is timing.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And Anthony is not in the organic yet, right? But how is it actually -- Anthony performing?","Robert A. Livingston","We're very happy with Anthony's performance. The earnings that they're going to deliver to Dover and to us this year is right on our acquisition model and on our forecast.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just going into Energy for a second. The comps going into Q4 for drilling also are pretty easy. And so thinking back to Brad's comments earlier about the margins being 24% plus, that's a pretty wide range into the fourth quarter. Can you describe your confidence in your ability to maybe drive 25% margins based on the mix and productivity issues that you've undertaken thus far this year in Energy?","Brad M. Cerepak","Let me just clarify. My comment was in excess of 24% for the year.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's right.","Brad M. Cerepak","And we did point out that in Energy, there'll be pressure on that margin in the fourth quarter due to these late in the year deals we've just completed in the downstream side. In fact, if you think about how we've guided and you look at the bridge on acquisitions, you'll see that our acquisition expectations for the year have come down just a bit, $0.02 to $0.03. And that's really the deals taking place in the fourth quarter. You can argue that's part of the reason we've come off the top end of our range. $0.06 on a performance basis includes completing these deals and then they'll be accretive into the next year. To just clarify, we do see some pressure on the margin in the fourth quarter because of the amortization and deal costs associated with closing those deals.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful...","Robert A. Livingston","So Joe, if I were to add anything to that, and that's on the top line in drilling, we do expect to see fourth quarter revenue to be down sequentially from the third quarter. But yet when we look at the fourth quarter year-over-year, the growth is going to be high single digits.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one other question on Engineered Systems. I know that the organic growth forecast for the year is now 2%. It still implies a pretty meaningful acceleration in the fourth quarter. And you have some headwinds with seasonally weak refrigeration revenues. The order rates haven't been great. And so talk to me a little bit about the confidence that you have in hitting that mid-single-digit number for 4Q.","Robert A. Livingston","I feel pretty confident with the fourth quarter forecast across all the segments, especially DES. My comment about some of the -- I call it revenue miss with respect to internal expectations in the third quarter, with respect to Engineered Systems, it was almost all at Hill PHOENIX. And I think we've actually taken a fairly conservative view in the fourth quarter forecast for Hill PHOENIX.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Even though you're still continuing to see some weakness in the Northeast, are there pockets geographically where you're seeing some strength as we enter the fourth quarter?","Robert A. Livingston","Especially outside of the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you just talk a little bit about -- I mean, just in terms of emerging markets? I mean, obviously, China sounds as though it's probably stronger than I would have guessed, given the comments I heard from other companies. But just outside of China, in other kind of emerging markets, I mean, are you seeing any kind of tapering of growth there? And then can you also kindly speak in terms of what pricing and raw material costs are looking like? Are you getting any kind of benefit? Because it sounds like raw materials are coming in for [ph] a little bit better than kind of budgeted.","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So I shared my comment on Asia. Other emerging markets, gosh, Charlie, the ones for us that are meaningful is our activity in the Middle East and Australia. Those markets, we continue to see growth in, we'll see growth there in the fourth quarter. We expect more growth out of those 2 markets in 2014. If we look at South America as an entire market, the third quarter activity was lighter than we expected. But I would take that back to my comment around Hill PHOENIX and some deferrals of order, mostly around timing activity in Mexico. But we feel that the emerging markets for the fourth quarter and going into 2014 continue to provide a very nice growth opportunity for all of Dover. I'd like to see the growth continue in Europe.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right. Can you just talk about sort of pricing kind of across the board, across the segments?","Brad M. Cerepak","Well, yes, to your question on materials, we did see a little bit of favorability in terms of material input costs in the quarter. Not a substantial change...","Robert A. Livingston","Pretty modest.","Brad M. Cerepak","Pretty modest coming off of Q2. And I would say some of the pricing that we have put in place related to materials earlier quarters have started to come down a bit. So the net spread on as we track price as it relates to materials sequentially really is pretty flat off the second quarter.","Robert A. Livingston","Not a major change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I have a question about -- you talked about the Queensland orders and that may be a little bit of a comp headwind as we go into next year. Can you kind of frame that for us and how we should think about that in 2014?","Robert A. Livingston","No, okay. So from a bookings point of view, it's always a bit difficult to actually peg exactly when we get the order. It's not a steady monthly drumbeat of orders there. They tend to be an annual award or a semiannual award. So from a -- on any individual quarter, there could be a negative on the comp with respect to that activity. For the year, we expect our activity in Australia and specifically around the Queensland project to be up in '14 versus '13.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess similarly on the margin side, you talked about some of the restructuring expenses going from 20 to 30 this year from original plan. Is -- should we think about the 20 as kind of the ongoing sort of spend? Or is it more of a benefit to the margin as we go into next year?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I -- look, I'm not prepared to start giving 2014 guidance. But with respect to that specific question, I think you should continue to expect us to execute on $20 million plus of restructuring activity in 2014.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is the Anthony seasonality similar to Hill PHOENIX?","Robert A. Livingston","In the U.S., it's almost identical.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And year to date...","Robert A. Livingston","There's a little bit of a difference outside of the U.S., but in the U.S., it's almost identical, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And so I just wanted to make sure I'm baseline correct here. But year-to-date, I've got revenues of about $210 million for Anthony?","Robert A. Livingston","I don't have that detail. I don't have the detail, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. So you guys don't know what the run rate of the -- I mean, you're saying close-the-case has gone well, so it's growing but...","Robert A. Livingston","Close-the-case is going well, yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So how do you track that without the Anthony revs?","Brad M. Cerepak","No, we have the Anthony revs, Steve. We just don't have them right at our fingertips at this moment.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Oh, got you. Okay, okay. That's helpful. An then -- and then -- yes, okay. And then...","Brad M. Cerepak","I mean, we do [indiscernible] close-the-case very, very closely. And I would say coming into the year, we had expectations for close-the-case. And our view right now is we're right on track where we expected to be with that program, and it's providing some nice growth for Anthony. I don't have it in front of me, but Paul could ...","Robert A. Livingston","We also had a fairly aggressive forecast for Anthony for close-the-case, and they're hitting it.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And then just on the margin front, I mean, you guys -- you said 24 plus for Engineered, so that's -- and Energy, that's helpful. Can you maybe just kind of baseline us for the year on some of the other segments? Maybe a little bit of a range, just so we can -- because there's a -- you guys blew it away this quarter. But you said the total margin will be below the second quarter, I guess. Is that kind of the -- from reading the code correctly, is that the way to think about it? Now we're kind of back into the other? Are there any other moving parts in the segments that we should be aware of, I guess, third to fourth quarter here?","Brad M. Cerepak","Well, no. I guess from where we were last time, I would answer that question as no, no significant changes related to where we thought we would end the year. We originally said we would growth 30 to 40 basis points. I think we're on track to do that. I would expect DPI to be a little bit weaker in the fourth quarter not because of the revenue but because we are doing some -- Bob talked about restructuring. There's a lot of benefits flowing through, but you will hear us talk about another restructuring activity in our Printing & Identification business in particular in the fourth.","Robert A. Livingston","Yes. And I know the timing of that may seem odd, but we actually want to get this done in the fourth quarter, not just for margin improvement for next year, but for some, I would call it some customer-facing activity that we want to be executing on going into 2014.","Brad M. Cerepak","I think you'll see DES seasonally, seasonally down. DE We talked about. And in Comm Tech, you'll see a little bit of a reduction going into the fourth quarter as well.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just one last very quick housekeeping item, I guess just going back to this Anthony question. I think in the press release, it was a $310 million business last year, you said in the press release, I guess, when you acquired it?","Brad M. Cerepak","Okay.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If you divide that by the last year's revenues you're getting to about 9% acquisition, 9% contribution of revenues, and you guys are saying it's an 8% acquisition contribution. I just want to make sure that there's not a -- you guys are reporting, maybe reporting a part of the business differently, and maybe there was like some runoff revenue that's not included because there are some acquisitions in there this year, right?","Brad M. Cerepak","Not in -- this year in refrigeration? No.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Or in just Engineered, total Engineered?","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes. I think Paul could take this question offline. But I do think if I recollect the $310 million number, when we acquired Anthony, as I think we pointed out, they were a supplier to Hill PHOENIX. And so that's probably why you're asking the question is that there -- the way we think about it now, is we do not think about Anthony with that internal supply...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, there's a lens, there's a lens. That answered the question.","Robert A. Livingston","If memory serves me right, Steve, I think the -- I call it the intercompany activity between Anthony and Hill PHOENIX was in the $30 million to $40 million range.","Brad M. Cerepak","That's right. That's right.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So that would get you like the 2 -- okay, yes, that makes a ton of sense. That makes a ton of sense. Perfectly.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul E.

Livingston","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I was very pleased with our fourth quarter results highlighted by broad-based revenue growth with all segments contributing. Notably, Engineered Systems delivered 12% growth and Printing & Identification grew 9%. In all, we generated 5% organic revenue growth and grew adjusted EPS, 17%.","","From a geographic perspective, our North America markets remained solid. Our European markets continued to show improvement with double-digit growth driven by our short-cycle business activity complemented by project shipments. Lastly, our China as well as our Rest of World markets were strong across all segments.","Now let me share some specific comments on our fourth quarter. At Communication Technologies, our consumer electronics growth was driven by the continued rollout of a third quarter OEM product launch where we delivered high volumes across all our product lines. Our strong position with this OEM allowed us to grow nicely despite continued headwinds at 2 other customers. Knowles continues to invest in innovative acoustic solutions, which will position them well for future product launches.","In our Energy segment, improving well activity and increased international business drove significant growth in our drilling and downstream businesses. Our modest growth in production reflects continued weak winch markets and reduced sucker rod activity in North America. We achieved growth of 50% in markets outside the U.S., Canada and Europe on the benefits of our geographic expansion programs. Fundamentals remained solid in our artificial lift markets.","Within our Engineered Systems segment, we saw strong growth across both platforms. Our Refrigeration & Industrial results were very solid, driven by improving activity with regional refrigeration accounts and robust growth in the auto aftermarket and food service markets. In our fluids platform, solid results were driven by our pump businesses, particularly those serving the plastics and petrochemical verticals. These results were complemented by improved heat exchanger and dispenser activity.","Within our Printing & Identification segment, solid growth in both our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets resulted in outstanding performance. Geographic revenue growth was broad-based highlighted by Europe, this segment's largest market. It is encouraging to see the benefits of growth and cost initiatives implemented over the past 2 years.","As we begin 2014 and following the spin of Knowles, you should expect us to align our segment structure to better reflect our future growth plans. Regarding our business activity, near term, we expect continued excellent performance in Energy, driven by expanding international activity and the ongoing improvement in drilling. Strong results in our refrigeration and food equipment markets, solid results in our fluids markets on the benefits of our recent acquisitions and, generally, healthier markets and normal seasonality in our fast-moving consumer goods market. We also expect to close more acquisitions in the first quarter and complete our $1 billion share repurchase program.","In summary, I am pleased with our execution and results and feel quite positive about our growth and productivity initiatives. As we begin the year, I feel confident in our ability to deliver excellent performance driven by improving end markets and the strength of our business.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad M. Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Organic revenue grew 5% and growth from acquisitions was also 5%. Adjusted EPS was $1.28, an increase of 17%. A reconciliation of our adjusted earnings per share is in the appendix deck of our presentation deck.","Segment margin for the quarter was 16.5%, substantially unchanged from last year, whereby improved margin in Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies were offset by the anticipated lower margin in Energy. This overall result reflects solid execution and was in line with our expectations.","Bookings increased 9% over the prior year to $2.2 billion. This result represents 16% growth in Engineered Systems and 7% growth in Printing & Identification. Bookings increased 4% in Energy, driven by robust downstream and drilling activity. Communication Technologies bookings increased 3%. Overall, book to bill finished at 0.98, which is in line with seasonal trends. Backlog increased 5% to $1.6 billion. Of note, absent Knowles, book to bill was 1, unchanged from last year; and backlog was $1.3 billion, an increase of 5%.","In the quarter, we generated $376 million of free cash flow, representing 17% of revenue. For the full year, free cash flow was $942 million, representing 11% of revenue.","Turning to Slide 4. Printing & Identification, driven by their fast-moving consumer goods markets, grew 8% organically. Communication Technologies grew 7% on the strength of new product launches in the consumer electronics market. Energy's growth was 4% and Engineered Systems grew 3%. Overall, organic revenue growth was 5%. Our acquisition growth in the quarter was 5%, comprised of 8% in Engineered Systems, 5% in Energy and 1% in Printing & Identification.","Turning to Slide 5 on our sequential results. Revenue decreased 2% from the third quarter, primarily driven by the normal seasonal slowdown in the refrigeration market. Fast-moving consumer goods markets helped drive growth of 8% in Printing & Identification. The rollout of new smartphone releases resulted in 4% sequential growth in Communication Technologies. Energy grew 1%, while Engineered Systems decreased 8% on normal seasonality.","Sequential bookings were essentially flat. Engineered Systems bookings increased 7%; and Printing & Identification grew 6%, aided by solid growth across most served markets and the impact of acquisitions. Energy bookings declined 4%, where solid order rates in downstream and drilling and the impact of the acquisitions was offset by softer activity in production. Communication Technologies bookings increased 12%, largely reflecting normal seasonality in the consumer electronics market.","Now moving to Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $428 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year. This growth principally reflects the ongoing rollout of new product releases in the smartphone market. In all, our consumer electronics business grew 15%. The telecom\/other markets continued to exhibit solid growth and were up 14%. Aerospace\/defense declined 2%, primarily impacted by soft defense spending. The medical technology market decreased 6% where a solid hearing health market was more than offset by weak audio headset activity. Earnings increased 12% to $66 million and segment margin increased 70 basis points to 15.3%. This performance reflects solid conversion on volume, productivity gains and the benefits related to prior restructuring, offset in part by asset impairment charges of $4 million.","We had significant success in the continued rollout of a key OEM smartphone release during the quarter as we shift on all acoustic product lines. Our year-over-year growth with OEMs that are winning market share continues to be partially offset by lower demand from Nokia and BlackBerry. Bookings were $373 million, up 3% from last year. Book to bill finished at a seasonally normal 0.87. For more information on Knowles -- more information on Knowles can be found in their Form 10 amendment, which was filed this morning.","Turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue of $584 million increased 8% and earnings of $135 million were up 1%. Energy produced another solid quarter, as drilling and downstream achieved strong revenue growth. The increase in well activity, coupled with increased international volume, resulted in 13% revenue growth in our drilling business. Production revenue increased 1% with the benefits of strong international activity in acquisitions were partially offset by weak winch markets and softer U.S. sucker rod activity. Our downstream markets saw a solid demand from the retail fueling and transportation markets and benefited from recent acquisitions, resulting in 20% growth.","Operating margin of 23.1% was down 160 basis points from last year. The costs associated with recently completed acquisitions impacted margin roughly 150 basis points in the quarter. Full year margin was very strong at 24.1% (sic) [24.7%] and in line with our expectations.","Bookings were $571 million, in -- and a 4% increase from the prior year. Strong bookings growth in drilling and downstream was partially offset by production. Book to bill was 0.98.","Now on Slide 8. Engineered Systems had another excellent quarter, where sales increased 12% to $920 million and earnings of $121 million were up 19%. Our fluid solutions platform revenue increased 18% to $244 million driven by strong organic growth across the segment and recent acquisitions. In Refrigeration & Industrial, revenue grew 10% to $677 million, reflecting acquisitions and broad-based organic growth across the platform. Continued strong execution and cost reduction activities drove operating margin to 13.2%, up 80 basis points, reflecting solid leverage on volume.","Bookings were $950 million, an increase of 16%, driven by solid demand across most end markets and recent acquisitions. Our fluid solutions platform bookings increased 18% to $248 million, driven by robust activity in the plastics and petrochemical markets and acquisitions. Refrigeration & Industrial increased 16% to $702 million, with food equipment and auto aftermarket showing particular strength.","Book to bill for fluid solutions was 1.02, while Refrigeration & Industrial's book to bill was a solid 1.04.","Let's turn now to Slide 9. Printing & Identification produced an excellent quarter, where revenue increased 9% to $277 million and earnings of $44 million increased 8%. Revenue growth was strong, as fast-moving consumer goods grew 10% and industrial grew 7%. Revenue growth was driven by an improving Europe and we saw growth in the majority of our product categories, including our project business.","Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.9%. This result included $3 million of costs associated with previously planned restructuring activities and acquisitions. Absent these costs, margin was 17%.","Bookings were $271 million, an increase of 7%, reflecting broad-based growth. Book to bill ended at 0.98.","Going to be overview on Slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest expense was $30 million, down $1 million from last year. Corporate expense increased $14 million to $45 million, reflecting incurred spin-off costs of about $16 million.","Our fourth quarter tax rate was 29.4% excluding discrete tax benefits, slightly higher than our prior forecast. Capital expenditures were $79 million in the quarter.","Lastly, we repurchased 551,000 shares for approximately $50 million in the quarter, all of which we repurchased under the $1 billion program. In total, we have repurchased $707 million and expect to complete the balance of the program this quarter.","Turning to Slide 11, which shows selected pro forma financial data, excluding Knowles as if the spin-off has been completed. 2013 revenue grew 8% to $7.5 billion, comprised of organic growth of 2% and acquisition growth of 6%. We saw organic growth accelerate to 4% in the back half of the year as compared to essentially flat in the first half. Diluted EPS increased 28% to $4.79. Adjusting for discrete tax benefits and other onetime gains, EPS increased 18% to $4.31.","Now moving to Slide 12, which shows our full year pro forma guidance. We expect 2014 organic revenue growth to be broad-based at 3% to 4%, which is in line with our second half 2013 rate. Completed acquisitions will add 2%. In total, we are forecasting full year revenue growth of 5% to 6%.","Corporate expense will be about $123 million, primarily reflecting reduced pension expense. Of note, corporate expense does not include spin-off costs related to Knowles. Interest expense is expected to be about $133 million, $13 million higher the last year, principally driven by a recent bond issuance.","Our full year tax rate is anticipated to be around 31%, reflecting the mix of geographic earnings after the spin of Knowles and down about 60 basis points from the 2013 pro forma adjusted rate. CapEx should be about 2.5% of revenue, up 40 basis points from last year on a pro forma basis and reflective of increased investment in consolidation and productivity projects. We expect our 2014 free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue.","Turning to the guidance bridge on Slide 13. As detailed earlier, 2013 pro forma EPS was $4.79. From this, we adjust discrete tax benefits of onetime items. Making those adjustments, the result is pro forma adjusted EPS of $4.31. We expect the full year benefit of volume and mix to be $0.16 to $0.28. Net productivity, again, is a key contributor and adds $0.14 to $0.22. We expect completed acquisitions to add $0.05 to $0.06 as we see the benefits -- the benefits of Finder, KPS and Fibrelite\u00a0deals, among others, begin to flow through earnings. Continued investment in global expansion initiatives and compensation will have an $0.18 to $0.22 impact for the year. Reduced corporate spending will provide $0.03 to $0.05 benefit. The combined impact of our ongoing share repurchase program, higher normalized tax rate and incremental interest expense should have a net benefit of $0.09 to $0.10. We expect margin to remain steady at approximately 18%. The benefits of volume growth, along with our ongoing productivity initiatives, will be largely offset by 20 to 30 basis points of amortization costs associated with acquisition we completed in the back half of 2013.","In total, we expect 2014 pro forma EPS to be $4.60 to $4.80. This represents 7% to 11% growth of our 2013 EPS of $4.31 or 9% growth at the midpoint.","With that, I'll turn the floor back over to Bob for some final comments.","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks, Brad. 2013 was a great year for Dover. We delivered robust revenue and earnings growth and took major steps to position us for continuing future success. We continued to invest for growth. We completed 10 acquisitions last year for $323 million to extend and enhance our market positions and we invested in internal growth initiatives, especially geographic expansion.","Our OPW business is a great example and has grown to a $500 million business thanks to internal initiatives and the addition of Jump, Fibrelite\u00a0and KPS acquisitions. Through their expanded product offering, they can now offer a complete fuel management solution to customers around the world.","Our artificial lift business is another case in point. Here, we've significantly built our sales and service and business development resources in the Middle East, Australia, Southeast Asia and South America, all of which have contributed to significant revenue growth in this business over the last 2 years. We have also increased our productivity investments and have numerous consolidation and Lean projects either completed or well underway. We extended our long track record of increasing our annual dividend and continued executing on our $1 billion share repurchase program. From a strategic perspective, the pending spin of Knowles is a key step in positioning Dover as a best-in-class industrial manufacturer.","I am excited about the growth prospects we have across the company. We have very strong and expanding market positions in refrigeration and food equipment, fluid transfer, including pumps, Energy, Printing & Identification and other market-leading industrial businesses serving the vehicle service, waste management and heat exchanger markets, to name a few. Without exception, all our businesses have meaningful opportunities to broaden the revenue base and push into new markets. We will continue to build our acquisition pipeline and pursue those opportunities that strengthen our market position, with a particular emphasis on geographic market expansion.","In addition to our growth initiatives, we will more aggressively invest in productivity and Lean activities. I believe we can achieve higher-margin and deliver more consistent performance while continuing to be a very strong generator of cash.","In all, I believe the future is very bright for Dover and I am more confident than ever about our positioning and long-term prospects. In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results and I look forward to a great '14.","With that, Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul E. Goldberg","Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions] Jennifer, can we have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, your first question is from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Hey, I know that the 2014 guidance versus consensus is not applicable because we all haven't had the ability yet to restate our models. And looking at and listening to your guidance here, one of the things that I'm not sure I caught was whether the electronic assembly disposition proceeds, as well as the dividend from Knowles, are they included in your '14 guidance? And can you calibrate both of those items?","Robert A. Livingston","No -- well, they're not included in our guidance with respect to having an impact on EPS. The proceeds from the remaining business within electronic assembly and test deck is expected to be about $170 million and the dividend from the Knowles spin is expected to be $400 million. We have that cash to play with for the balance of the year, Deane.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, good. That's what I was looking for. And Bob, did I hear correctly, you said in the first quarter, you expect to announce some new deals? And is the EPS reflected in your earnings bridge under the acquisitions or would that be additive?","Robert A. Livingston","No. No, the guidance for 2014 and what you see on the bridge is that, that Brad and Paul presented, are only including acquisitions that have been closed.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So then just last one for me on that point for acquisitions. You talked a bit about what you're seeing that gives you the confidence that you'll be able to complete some deals this quarter that -- in the first quarter. And can you maybe size for us what we should be thinking about?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, our confidence is the fact that we're sitting here in the first quarter and we're sitting on top of these deals. And actually, our guidance for '14 does include a small acquisition that was completed January 3 or January 5 or whatever. But, Deane, you'll see the emphasis in our pipeline execution here in our first quarter continue to be around Energy and our fluids businesses, as well as some interest we have in continuing to expand our refrigeration business.","Operator","Your next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Bob, maybe just a follow-up to that. I mean, how would you kind of size your acquisition firepower at this point, right? I mean, you've got like $8 million -- I'm sorry, $800 million on the balance sheet. You talked about the DEK proceeds, the $400 million from Knowles, which is I think a little more than the initial expectation. And now you're telling us 11% of revenue from free cash for the remaining co. I mean, that adds up to a good chunk. I mean, is all that, other than dividend, I mean, are you biased to acquisitions on that and how are you thinking about the repurchase?","Robert A. Livingston","Shannon, if you look at -- let's see, I guess the last 2 years, '12 and '13, I think you see a fairly balanced allocation of capital from Dover. We've -- the capital has been allocated to dividends and to share repurchase activity as well acquisitions. I happen to like that balance. And I think that without telling you what we're going to do yet, we'll talk more about that after the Knowles spin. But I think you should expect to see us have that balance of capital allocation going forward.","Brad M. Cerepak","Just to reiterate, our first -- our forecast does include completion of the $1 billion, as I said, in the first quarter. So that's approximately $300 million or so of buybacks to be completed.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It doesn't sound like going forward, there's sort of this pace of buy. I mean the pace of buyback you've been under is related to that $1 billion plan, which was somewhat unusual for you guys. But it sounds like maybe that's not an unusual pace going forward?","Robert A. Livingston","I'm not going to define a number. I'm going to repeat what I said. I happen to like the balance capital allocation approach we've had for the last 2 years. And we'll give you a little bit more insight into that after the spin is complete.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just on -- kind of the outlook for Energy, I mean, drilling went through kind of a soft patch and now it's rebounding strongly. Now production is sort of in its soft patch. I mean, when you think about the pieces -- and of course, downstream was really strong. So I mean, as you think about those pieces going forward, I mean, do you expect production to rebound, the others to slow? Maybe a little color on that.","Robert A. Livingston","Look, we actually look for a fairly well-balanced contribution from all 3 sectors in our Energy segment for '14. Shannon, your comment about the lower activity in production. Let me be more specific. If you look at our production activity, let's label it our artificial lift business, we've got 2 main products or applications: it's the sucker rod and then the pump application at the bottom of the well. Where we have seen some softness in activity in the final, I would say, 3 or 4 months of the year has been specific with sucker rods. And even more specific, Shannon, it's been very specific to Texas activity. Our pump business has continued to be strong and has expanded throughout the year and I would -- not to be defensive, but I truly do see that a lot of the softness we saw in Texas in the fourth quarter around sucker rods was the -- around the initial installation of new artificial lift systems in a couple of the key basins and primarily related to weather.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I don't want to spend too much time in this M&A thing. But can you just give us a sense of a range of revenues you think is realistic to add in 2014? I mean, even if the range is wide, just give us a sense of what you think you might be able to get done.","Robert A. Livingston","Oh, gosh. That's hard to do until we actually sign the deal and close it. I would -- clearly, clearly north of $100 million and south of $500 million. And that's a pretty wide range.","Brad M. Cerepak","I think another way to think about it is, we have 2% that carries over for completed deals. We did 5% in 2013. I would think it's not a specific target or goal. But that round about that 5% range would be something that would make sense, perhaps.","Robert A. Livingston","I agree. Yes.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then as far as the 10 deals you did in 2013, I don't think EBITDA multiples were disclosed on any of them really. But can you give us a sense either multiple price of sales or multiple of EBITDA, what that average was?","Robert A. Livingston","I'm not sure I can give you a specific number on what I call the class of '13. But the EBITDA multiple was -- I can tell you is the class for '13 was less than 10.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. And then just a brief follow-up here. Knowles, is there -- are there costs of preparing for spin that are impacting Knowles' margins at all? Are there anything that -- anything -- or even on the top line, is there distractions and such that may explain some weakness there?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I don't think the spin preparation process has impacted the revenue. There's probably some very minor spending that's included in their earnings and reflected in their margins that's related to the spin. But I'm going to tell you again, it would be rather minor.","Brad M. Cerepak","I think there are some minor overhead adds as well as they get prepared to spin in terms of resources and adding headcount. That's normal for preparing for a spin. That's in their fourth quarter, again, but not a big number at this stage.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a couple of things. First, in terms of your guidance for 2014, can you give us a sense of how the segments fall within the band of those -- that organic outlook? Is there any particular outlier to the upside or down?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, if you look at our guidance of 3% to 4% organic, I would tell you that Energy is slightly higher than that range and the others are centered in the range.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Brad, I was wondering on the tax rate...","Robert A. Livingston","Not a wide disparity between the segments, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. Right. Brad, I was wondering on tax rate, obviously, you knew the step-up was coming with kind of mix shift from the spin-off and you've been working on things. How do you view that 31% for '14 in the context of what a couple more years of tax planning might allow you to do? Is there a clear downside to that number?","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes, great question. Yes -- no, great question. I think -- I just want to say that, first of all, we are seeing -- I want to just go back to we are seeing a lower pro forma rate as we move into '14 by about 60 basis points or so. That's really driven by the things we're doing to drive that rate as we go forward to a lower result. I think I mentioned at one point that -- I mentioned at one point that we were looking to do things in Europe with our businesses to make them more of a principal agent-type structure. We got that completed. That was part of this Markem-Imaje restructuring we were talking about. So that's been helpful to us. Our rate also, as you know, does not include, at this stage, any R&D credits. So that would help that to 30 to 40 bps lower that gets reinstated. As I think about it going forward, right now, you hear us talk a lot about our international investment and international increase in revenue streams. Over the next, say, the mid-term, I'm confident to say that I will see that rate drop down below 30%, high 20s. That's our target.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So it's a 2- or 3-year type of thing?","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes, that's a 2- or 3-year type of thing.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then finally maybe, just back to Bob, just margins in Energy, there's some impact you called out obviously. There's some mix impact in there. How do you feel about margins from here? Are they kind of defensible at this run rate? Is there still a little bit of downward bias, do you think?","Robert A. Livingston","Jeff, I was -- I think we closed the year '13 with margins at Energy at 20%, 24%, 24.1%. And that's sort of have been the target we've had for the guys for '13. And I think I responded to a question either on the October call or the July call about margins for Energy for '13, I think we ended up right where we thought they would be. As we move into '14, I expect margins for our Energy to be just about where they are right now. We'll see a little bit of noise throughout the year, but I would still expect margins for the year to center on that 24% number.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the -- I guess, on the margins for the other main segment, the engineered business, how do you -- what do we -- how do we feel about next year for that -- for those guys? For '14, sorry.","Robert A. Livingston","May be a 10- to 15-bps improvement.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so then -- so if, I guess, if they were up, that means that the product ID margins are down or no?","Robert A. Livingston","I would say they're flat or about the same.","Brad M. Cerepak","About the same, yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then there's a few companies that have come out and talked about a little bit of volatility, I guess, in the revenues and earnings kind of fourth quarter to first quarter for a lot of companies. I guess, just that kind of a choppy economy here, but any dynamics in the first quarter? Or as the kind of growth sequences over the next -- seasonally over the next 4 quarters, do we need to think about maybe just organic growth rate to start the year?","Robert A. Livingston","Good question. So let me give you a comment on the year first. If you look at the absolute numbers on revenue, the first half is actually fairly equal to the second half. They were very, very similar in revenue for both halves of the year. And Steve, you would continue to see the same type of seasonality in our profile that you've seen in the past, where the second quarter and the third quarter are the higher quarters and the seasonal impact that's seen in the first quarter and fourth quarter. But it's -- you're -- you just wouldn't see anything different in our profile from what you've seen in the past.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you said year-over-year of kind of 3% to 4%. That's what you expect, you expect organically in the first quarter.","Robert A. Livingston","Yes, on an organic response, the -- I think the first half rate, it's in the 3% to 4% range in the first half. And it's in the 3% to 4% range, maybe pushing towards the higher end of the 4% in the second half.","Operator","The next question is from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hey, Bob, last quarter, you called out Comm Tech. I think you said there was about 25 million that was really related to delayed product launches. Did you get that back in the fourth quarter? Called it out as a deferral. I'm just wondering if you got it back.","Robert A. Livingston","Well, in essence, you don't. But by the time we hit -- by the time we were exiting the third quarter and entering the fourth quarter, John, we were at, I call it full production rates on all 3 of the acoustic product lines.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But is there anything you can actually state?","Robert A. Livingston","Fourth quarter revenue came in just about on top of what we expected.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's what I was looking for. Bob, is there anything you can actually say about the first quarter in terms of the environment, how it's trending for Knowles? Not specifically, but clearly we're all sort of watching these sort of negative pre-announcements on smartphone volumes from Samsung and Apple. And I'm just curious, I mean, you guys seem to have a bit of a better mousetrap, right, than just the smartphone industry. So how -- is there anything you can kind of say about the cadence of the business?","Robert A. Livingston","I'm not going to say too much, John. I will remind you that the team at Knowles has scheduled their own Investor Day. I think it's for the 19th of February and I am almost certain that that's going to be webcast. But the first quarter profile for Knowles will show the, I call it the normal seasonality that you would see post a product launch and proceeding the next product launch.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. Okay. Well, that makes sense. And then just sort of as a technical question, post the spin of Knowles, that will have 3 segment, but you're still going to have some Comm Tech assets. I mean, is your plan, Bob and Brad, to have still 3 segments and you put some of the Comm Tech stuff in the other businesses? Or are you very going to create a fourth segment and, I don't know, maybe take some of your Energy business assets and put them in that because Energy is big or something. I don't know.","Robert A. Livingston","We'll share a little bit more detail around this post-spin, but you're asking about numbers. I happen to like the number 4, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's kind of where I was going. Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you provided some good detail on the remaining co. Obviously, Knowles, we haven't gotten any guidance for Knowles. Anything you can say at this stage or do we have to wait until the 19th?","Robert A. Livingston","I think I have said everything I'm going to say on Knowles. It's a great story. The guys are getting prepared for their Investor Day on the 19th. And I think they're going to have an interesting and an exciting and enthusiastic message for their investor base on the 19th.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, as I suspected. Obviously, you put on a fairly, I'd say, cautious look at the margins for '14. And obviously, you've got a pretty significant investment headwind in your bridge. And I'm wondering, if we switch just back to Energy, you've got the M&A dilution coming through in 4Q. I'm assuming that, that still is going to be a factor in the first half of the year. So I'm wondering, number one, how dilutive will the margins be, so [indiscernible] to Energy margins in '14, particularly in the first half of the year? And the second part of that point is how much of that investment headwind is coming through in Energy versus the other segments?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. I don't have that detail here on margins by quarter for '14. Let me go back to my earlier comment about the revenue balance between first half and second half. Even though the revenue, even though the revenue is fairly balanced between first half and second half, I think you're going to see our margins a little bit better in the second half than they are in the first half, partly because -- and here's 2 or 3 key points here. Number one, we will continue to see a little bit of margin pressure here in the first 2 or 3 months of the year from some of the acquisitions that have been completed or that -- or that were completed, especially in the fourth quarter of last year. We've got some consolidation projects underway, Nigel, both here in the States as well as in Europe, some of them related to acquisitions that were completed last year, others are, I call it more normal productivity type of consolidation projects. And some of the costs we're growing to incur on those consolidation projects will be borne and reported here on the first half results. And the benefits that we'll receive from those projects will start to flow through in the second half. So even though the revenue is pretty evenly split, you're going to see a little bit better performance in the second half on margins than the first half.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And the -- so the -- just to clarify, the consolidation activity, this is like a little more of a restructuring type of...","Robert A. Livingston","I think a couple of days, we've even already talked about. We've got a significant project underway at Hill PHOENIX with the new facility coming online. And that new facility, I think, replaces 3 rooftop spreads, 3 or 4 rooftops. And the, again, the cost we're going to incur on that consolidation is first half and the benefits we'll see in the second half. Within Energy, we've got new facility coming online down in Houston, actually as we speak. It will be here in the first quarter. And that new facility I think, again, replaces 4?","Brad M. Cerepak","3 or 4.","Robert A. Livingston","3 or 4 rooftops. And the cost again of, I call it the move and the consolidation is a first half expense and we'll start to see the benefits show up in the second half. We have a couple of other projects similar to that, that will be in Europe this year.","Operator","Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to follow up on the EPS bridge. On the volume mix and price line, I guess, if you take sort of $0.22 at the middle of that, it implies maybe a 20% incremental margin for the year as a whole of about 3.5 core growth. I just wondered if that's factoring in some kind of hit or impact from FX? Because it sounds a fairly low number. I understand you have some facilities and so on in the first half. If there was anything sort of abnormal or anything in FX that's maybe weighing on the incrementals?","Brad M. Cerepak","No, I would say your calculation is pretty good. We -- I'd say it's somewhere -- the conversion is somewhere between 23% and 25% the way we think about it on organic growth, which is pretty consistent with what we saw in 2013. Keep in mind that we do put into that line item, not only volume conversion, but mix and material -- cost material spread. And I would say while materials are behaving fairly well going into the first part of 2014, right now, we view that in our forecast to be slightly -- a slight drag, not that large, but a slight drag on that conversion rate.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just my follow-up in terms of the kind of geographic color, you called out Europe was up over 10% in Q4. I guess, when you're thinking about '14 and the 3 to 4 core growth globally, what's the sort of main assumption there? Is that 3-ish in the Europe and the U.S. and a bit more in Rest of World? Or how quickly do you think that Europe number normalizes?","Robert A. Livingston","I think your guess is pretty close for modeling, 3 to -- a little bit lower in Europe and the U.S. and a little bit higher in the emerging markets. We continue to see good and interesting opportunities for growth in China and other parts of Asia. You'll see us do a little bit more in South America in 2014, maybe even a bit more than we've done in the last couple of years. But we do look at the U.S. and Europe to be, I would call it low to -- low single-digit contributors to organic growth in '14.","Operator","Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wonder if I could start with a refrigeration question and talking specifically about Anthony. You've got some pretty nice bookings there. I know you're expecting to see some revenue synergies from Anthony. Have you started to realize those? And how meaningful are they to the business at this point?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, we have been realizing some of those revenue synergies throughout the year. I would say it's been building, especially as we got beyond the first quarter. Nathan, I can't give you a number on that. I just don't have that. We had a very solid second half in our refrigeration business. The profile was a bit different between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The -- I would call it the core refrigeration business, our case in systems business actually was fairly strong in the third and the fourth quarter. And our Anthony business actually was performing pretty much -- very much on plan on our acquisition model through the first, not only 3 quarters, maybe even through the first 10 or 10.5 months. We did see some deferrals late in the fourth quarter that would move into 2014 and it's not in the core grocery business. We see it more in, I call it the smaller format stores like the convenience stores and, perhaps, even sold it more out of North America than we did here in the U.S.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And my follow-up is on the...","Robert A. Livingston","So we're looking for another great year for those guys next year.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Wonderful. My follow-up is on the international expansion on Energy. Can you talk about -- and I mean outside U.S., Canada and Europe, 50% growth in 2013? And I know it's been a strategic goal for you to expand...","Robert A. Livingston","No, I actually think it was 50% in the fourth quarter for...","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","50% in the fourth quarter?","Robert A. Livingston","Yes. For '13, I think it was 40, 42 or 43 for the year, yes.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I know that's been a strategic goal for you to expand that business. How meaningful is that to the business now? And what kind of growth rates do you think you can do over the next 2 or 3 years outside of those typical Canada, U.S. and the Europe?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So when I talk about the geographic expansion and we -- and I gave you this number of 40%, 42% and 50%, what I'm referring to is the growth and what I would label as new markets for Energy. So I'm excluding or including as the core, not just North America, but I'm including as the core, Europe. Okay. I want to make that point first. As a percentage of the total, these new geo expansion initiatives, perhaps, now account for about 18% of the Energy segments revenue. So it's rather significant. Gosh, I think we don't have to roll the clock back much beyond 3 years and we'd only see that number to be 5% or 6% of the segment's revenue. We will continue. We are continuing to add resources, people resources around the world for the Energy segment, as I commented in my opening comments. I would love to sit here and tell you that you'll see 40% growth every year for the next 5 years. The math sort of starts to work against us a little bit. We will continue to see significant growth opportunities for Energy, especially around artificial lift during the next 2 to 3 years. But you should expect that growth to come -- the growth rate to moderate significantly. It's representing 18% of their revenue today.","Operator","And your final question is with Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You talked pretty positively about the Energy trajectory in 2014 and pretty balanced throughout the end markets. Maybe you can just talk a little bit about some of the underpinnings of the assumptions there, whether there's some visibility in international markets or projects, maybe you can just provide a little bit more color on the Energy growth.","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So let me -- I guess, the key assumption or the underpinning behind our guidance and forecast for Energy for '14 would be our take on what we're going to see in rig count activity here in North America. That's always where we start. We actually -- we are -- our assumption is that rig count in both U.S. as well as in North America for 2014 is actually flat with '13. I know there's some reports out there that show rig count activity to be forecasted to be up modestly, but our assumption is that it will be flat. That said, even with the flat rig count, we continue to see and expect increased well activity in 2014. I would call it mid-single-digit increase in well activity. Outside of North America, we continue to see more and more, I call it tender projects that we feel that we should be participants in. That's been a significant part of the growth that we've had in our Energy business over the last couple of years. And we see that continuing into '14 and beyond.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up, there's been a fair amount of talk of FX on the earnings call this far. What's baked into the guidance and maybe just what the impact is in '14?","Robert A. Livingston","That -- I'm sorry, you were fading a bit. You're asking what is the impact of FX in our '14 guidance?","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I was just saying that FX has been a topic of your conversation through the earnings call. I was just wondering what's in the guidance for '14?","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes, sorry. Our guidance would be pretty neutral for Dover. Keep in mind that some of these markets that have seen quite a bit of activity or change in the valuation of their currencies, we're not a big player in some of those markets. So at this point, our forecast is built on pretty steady assumption around FX.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answers period.

As previously communicated, our first quarter was well below our initial expectations, driven by significant further reductions in activity and capital spending within our U.S. oil and gas related end markets.","These conditions primarily impacted our energy segment and to a lesser extent fluid. The market served by engineered systems and refrigeration and food equipment remained solid, resulting in an organic growth of 3% in each segment. In total, we delivered first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 until further steps to reduce our cost and right-size our businesses.","In addition to introducing new products and pursuing share gains, we are increasing the restructuring actions and have stepped up our efforts on productivity, including shared services. Now let me share some comments on the quarter.","From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy segment, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew organically low single-digits year-over-year. Both our China and European markets were down sequentially and also down organically from the prior year.","In energy, markets further deteriorated as we moved through the quarter. Market activity levels hit new lows on continued declines in the U.S. rig count and reduced capital spending, which in turn drove our first quarter revenue and earnings down significantly. Our teams have remained resolute on actions to drive sales and share gains and in reducing all non-essential cost, while still maintaining their engineering talent and ability to respond to customer opportunities.","Engineered systems organic growth was 3%. Within printing and identification, we once again posted solid results in our core marking and coding business. And the industrial platform, organic growth was broad based. Fluids posted strong revenue growth driven by the recent acquisitions of Tokheim, Geller [ph] and Reduction. On an organic basis, our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated energy customers, especially within retail fueling posted declines.","Our Refrigeration and Food Equipment segment grew 3% organically, largely driven by retail refrigeration. Revenue in earnings performance was as expected, benefiting from our customer expansion efforts taken over the last several quarters. Regarding acquisitions, we believe we have line of sight on several deals over the next few quarters and our key growth markets.","Now looking forward, within energy as a result of further U.S. market declines, we have reduced our organic revenue forecast, which is now expected to be down 27% to 30% for the full year.","On a sequential basis, the first quarter was down 12%. We now expect the second quarter to sequentially decline another 10%. In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged, driven by the leading technology and new products offered across the segment. We expect the marking and coding business to grow low to mid-single-digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth.","Within our industrial platform, we expect modest broad based growth. Fluids will grow this year, driven by their recent acquisitions, which should generate roughly 400 million in revenue in 2016. We also expect solid to strong growth from our industrial hygienic and pharma markets. Overall organic revenue is expected to be a few points lower than previously forecasted, as a result of direct oil and gas exposure, lower CapEx spending for integrated energy customers and project timing.","Finally, within Refrigeration and Food Equipment, our plans for organic revenue growth and margin improvement remain on track, heading into the seasonally strong second and third quarters. Our leading technology and merchandising solutions are resulting in customer wins at several regional and national food retail chains.","In summary, we are lowering our full year EPS guidance to reflect the impact of oil and gas markets. Our full year guidance includes 40 million of restructuring costs, which will deliver significant benefits on an annualized basis.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad for further comments.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone.","Let's start on slide three of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 7%, and an FX impact of 1%. Growth from acquisitions of 6% less dispositions resulted in net acquisition growth of 3%. EPS was $0.64; it includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefit and a $0.07 gain from a disposition.","Segment margin for the quarter was 11.7%, a 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for first quarter restructuring of approximately $14 million, margin was 12.5%. Restructuring activities were primarily focused within our Energy and Fluid segment.","Bookings decreased 4% over the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result acquisition growth of 4% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas market disposition and FX.","Organic bookings in our Engineered System and Refrigeration and Food Equipment segments grew 4% and 5% respectively. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1.03, up slightly from last year. Our backlog decreased 10%; to $1.1 billion and was down 6% excluding disposition.","Free cash flow was $96 million, or 6% of revenue consistent with the prior year first quarter. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year.","Now let's turn to slide four. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration and Food Equipment both increased organic revenue 3%. This increase reflects broad based growth of Engineered Systems and in retail refrigeration and can-shaping businesses of Refrigeration and Food Equipment. Fluids organic decline of 3% was driven by oil and gas markets and lower CapEx spending in select fluid transfer markets.","Energy organic revenue was down 33% on further decline in the North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, net acquisition growth was most prevalent as fluid with 22% growth, principally driven by Tokheim.","Now on slide five. Energy revenue of $283 million decreased 34%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $11 million. Energy's results continued to be further impacted by declines in oil and gas markets fundamentals especially the U.S. rig count. Energy incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring costs. Since the beginning of the oil and gas downturn in 2014, this segment has reduced their workforce by 32%, or 2,100 people.","Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 6%, reflecting volume and price decline. We expect to complete additional cost actions in the second quarter and exit 2016 at around 10% margin. Bookings were $273 million and book-to-bill was 0.97.","Turning to slide six. Engineered Systems revenue of $577 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3% and unfavorable FX of 2%, net acquisitions were neutral, where the acquisition growth of JK was essentially offset by the revenue connected with the sale of the business.","Earnings of $94 million increased 6%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity and organic volume leverage. Of note, $11 million gain on the disposition was principally offset by increased cost associated with a factory - of recent factory consolidation and other one-time items.","Our printing and identification platform revenue of $240 million, increased 4%. Organic revenue was up 1%, primarily reflecting solid North American marking and coding market. Acquisitions at 8% growth, while FX was 5% negative.","In the industrial platform overall revenue decline 2% to $337 million, where organic growth of 4% was offset by a 5% impact from a disposition and a 1% from FX. Organic growth was broad based. We incurred $2 million in restructuring costs at the quarter. Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, margin was 16.6%.","Bookings of $573 million was flat, reflecting organic bookings growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%. Largely offset by the impact of a disposition in FX. Organically printing and identification bookings were essentially flat and industrial bookings increased 6%. Book-to-bill for printing and identification was 1.01, while industrial was 0.98. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.99.","Now on slide seven, within fluids revenue increased 17% to $399 million. While earnings decreased 16% to $46 million. Revenue performance reflects 22% growth from acquisitions partially offset by a 3% decline in organic revenue and 2% from FX.","Our fluids transfer and pumps results reflecting impact of weak oil and gas markets, reduced capital spending and the timing of orders, partially offset by solid results in industrial hygienic and pharma markets.","Lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions and 3 million of incremental restructuring costs reduced margin 460 basis points in the quarter. Excluding restructuring and acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was 17.5%, an increase of 70 basis points over an adjusted prior year. Bookings were $418 million, an increase of 23%. This result primarily reflects the positive impact of acquisitions. On an inorganic basis, bookings were flat. Book-to-bill was 1.05.","Now let's turn to slide eight, Refrigeration and Food Equipment\u2019s revenue was $363 million declined 2% from the prior year, and earnings with $38 million, an increase of 6%. Organic revenue growth of 3% was largely driven by wins at several retail refrigeration customers. We also had solid results in our glass door and can-shaping equipment businesses.","Overall, the disposition of our walk-in cooler product line in FX impacted revenue 5% and 1% respectively. Operating margin was 10.5% and 80 basis point increase over last year. This improvement was largely driven by the benefits of productivity and leverage on organic growth.","Bookings of $411 million were down 2%. This result reflects 5% organic growth offset by a 6% impact of a disposition and 1% from FX. Book-to-bill was 1.13, reflecting normal seasonality in the retail refrigeration market.","Going to the overview on slide nine, let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $30 million and net interest expense was $32 million, both in line with our prior forecast. Our first quarter tax rate was 27.9% excluding this pretax benefit.","Now moving to slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been lower to reflect the oil and gas markets. We now expect total revenue to decrease 2% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 5% to 8% a 4-point reduction from our prior forecast. We expect net acquisitions will add approximately 4% growth unchanged from our prior guidance. We now expect the impact of FX to be about 1% negative for the year. At the midpoint of our guidance adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%. Excluding restructuring costs and further adjusting for acquisition and purchase accounting, margin is expected to be around 16%. Our full year forecast for corporate expense, interest expense and the pre-discrete tax rate remains unchanged. Additionally, CapEx remains unchanged as does our full year free cash flow forecast.","From a segment perspective, energy full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 27% to 30%. We have also reduced fluids organic revenue forecast, which now expected to decline 2% to 5%. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration and Food Equipment is unchanged versus our prior guidance, net acquisitions remained at 4% growth.","Turning to the bridge on slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to provide a $0.07 benefit, reflecting total 2016 restructuring cost of $40 million versus $55 million last year. Our revised forecast reflects $20 million or $0.09 EPS in incremental restructuring costs versus the prior forecast. Performance including changes in volume productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits will impact earnings $0.09 to $0.17. This is reduced from our previous forecast principally driven by the effect of lower volume.","Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.19 to $0.22, reflecting roughly $0.07 of reduced spend. Acquisitions plus dispositions will be $0.16 to $0.17 accretive in total. This amount includes the operating earnings of acquisition plus dispositions and the related gain. The carryover benefit of prior year's share repurchases, the impact of interest corporate expense and the tax rate are all unchanged.","Lastly, as I mentioned before, we had a discrete tax benefit of $0.05 in the quarter. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.51 to $3.66, down about $0.50 at the midpoint of our prior guidance excluding the gain on a disposition and discrete tax benefits.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Robert Livingston","Thanks, Brad. As we begin the second quarter, markets remain mixed. Businesses with exposure to oil and gas continue to be impacted by historically weak markets. Engineered Systems is benefiting from solid industrial end markets, healthy printing and coding end markets and a continued growth in adoptions of digital printing and global textile activity. Refrigeration and Food Equipment is also quite resilient due in part to their leading retail refrigeration technologies that helps our customers capitalize on the growing trend of selling prepared and fresh food.","Within fluids, although it's early, we are very excited about the customer response to our recent acquisitions. Within retail fueling customers are now asking us to provide our full scope of products. We are also seeing revenue synergies at our plastics and polymer customers with the addition of gain [ph] and reduction. We will continue to execute on initiatives to help drive growth and fund investments, namely, launching new products across the entire organization, expanding our business with new customers and new geographies, leveraging or Dover excellence program to continue to drive margin productivity and cash flow. And capitalizing on a scale for the establishment of shared service centers.","In all, leveraging these growth opportunities and executing on our internal actions will help to mitigate mixed markets, drive productivity and redirect resources to pursue growth initiatives. We also expect to fully leverage the recovery in our oil and gas markets, when it comes.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. And Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Bob. Before we turn it back to Kristy, I just again like to remind you, if you can limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, that would be helpful. We have about 20 people in the question queue.","So with that, Kristy, if you can give us our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question is coming from Steve Winoker of Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks, and good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Steven Winoker","Could you maybe just start talking about the pacing of the energy revenue, as we move through the year, given the order dynamics, how long it takes to work through and the energy margin progression as well?","Brad Cerepak","Okay, we\u2019ll see, Steve I think in my script I commented on our sequential decline in the first quarter of 12% and that we are anticipating another sequential decline in the second quarter of about 10%. You look at the second half, the second half revenue is closely aligned with what we view as the run rate for the second quarter, and I would add one color comment on that. In the second half, we do have about 45 million of share gain revenue, sort of split evenly between the third and fourth quarter on wins that we\u2019ve won and we have one at slide two, absent the share gain wins, the revenue in the second half would be modestly below the second quarter run rate.","On margins for the year, margins are going to - I think, at the top end of our guide, margins are about 6% or 6.5%, all in, including restructuring. The restructuring activity is very heavily loaded in the first and second quarter. Second half sees the benefits from the restructuring activity and the absence of any new restructuring actions. And we do, our guide does show that we exit 2016 with an operating margin at energy, just about 10%.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And just to follow that up then, if conditions were not to get any worse at this point, Bob and Brad, at what point do you see - could you actually see the comps easing enough into next year that you\u2019d actually be able to crossover in a positive territory?","Robert Livingston","Activity, if we were at the trough now and activity didn\u2019t get any worst, but also assume that it doesn\u2019t get any better than you could see the first quarter of 2017 having a revenue run rate slightly above first quarter 2016.","Steven Winoker","Okay. All right and while let me leave it there, given the number of questions. Thanks, guys.","Brad Cerepak","All right. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. Thank you, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Morning. I was wondering if you could address price in oil and gas, and also in fluids, it does look like you\u2019re expecting pretty good drop through on your restructuring actions, just kind of look at the footnotes of your bridge here, what are you anticipating for price erosion in that guide and in that payback?","Brad Cerepak","Okay. So your question specific to energy and then the follow-up was fluids?","Jeffrey Sprague","Yeah, I think I'm not sure you've got price pressure elsewhere, but I think that was the point.","Brad Cerepak","I would - for first quarter in energy, price was a negative 1% for the segment. Jeff, I would still tell you that in our guide, we still have a negative 2% to 3% price pressure for the year, but in the first quarter, it was 1%. The price pressure in fluids for the year is less than 1% or I'm going to say about 1%, I think it\u2019s actually 0.9 to be specific. And then for the company as a whole, it's actually very, very slightly positive for the year.","Jeffrey Sprague","That is a shockingly okay price down the number.","Brad Cerepak","It's not that much different than what we experienced last year.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yeah. So, people are behaving despite the volume decline on price.","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Robert Livingston","Again, I would tell you that I gave you a number on energy segment and I would repeat myself what I said last year several times. You will get an individual product lines, you are going to see different stories. We still continue to see price pressure in our rods business that's very similar to what we saw last year, in fact last year I think price down on the rods business last year I think it was 9% or 10%, that's not going to be as bad this year. But we're still going to see price pressure on the rod business this year. And then our diamond insert business, I think for last year, Brad help me here 5%, 4% or 5%, 6% last year and we are expecting another price down in our insert business this year of 3% to 5%.","Jeffrey Sprague","So, you've got positive price elsewhere in energy, where we got the -","Robert Livingston","Bearings and compression.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. And then just a quick one to shift gears. How quickly do you think you can ramp up Tokheim's exposure in the U.S. and where you're at on sourcing OPW through Tokheim and some of that vertical integration we are looking at.","Robert Livingston","The first question about Tokheim in the U.S., I'm going to differ a story on that until we get together at our Technology Day and what was it Paul, early or mid-June? We're still early days on the integration, the onboarding of this business and I think we'll have a better answer for you in June that I could give you today. But the integration of OPW and especially on the retail components business, the integration of OPW in Tokheim is moving along smoothly and the pull-through of OPW, I call it especially the hanging hardware is progressing as we expected. It's pretty positive.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you.","Robert Livingston","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. My first question is just on the fluids guidance for the year on the revenue line. You talked in the presentation about the split between sort of solid industrial hygienic and pharma versus the oil and gas and energy stuff. In your full year organic guide now what do you - how do you split out the assumed revenue delta for each of those buckets in terms of oil and gas price -","Robert Livingston","I don't have that detail in front of me, Julian. But to give you a little bit of color, I did use the descriptive phrase solid to strong when I described industrial and hygienic and pharma. I would tell you that in the industrial part of the portfolio mid-single digit pipe of growth and the pharma and the hygienic more so in the pharma, it's - we're seeing double-digit growth in those verticals. And it's been both of those verticals have been areas we've focused on building our product portfolio over the last couple of years. But they are still relatively small. But I can't give you split for the year. I don't have that kind of detail with me.","Julian Mitchell","Sure. And then, if we just look at the Engineered Systems business and the Industrial Parts of Fluids, was there any change in sort of customer behavior in recent months since the beginning of the year. Would you say it's been fairly steady?","Robert Livingston","Well, within Engineered Systems, the comments would be slightly different between the printing and ID platform versus the industrial platform. I don't think there has been any changes in the industrial platform. In fact, my comment in the script was that we had good organic growth in our first quarter, in our industrial platform, and you know that I did not call out a single business or two. Like I have done in the past. The growth in the first quarter was very, very broad based in the industrial platform.","Within the printing and ID platform, Markem-Imaje, I think organic growth was 3% or a little bit better 3% and 4% fairly solid, right on our expectations, interesting, the strong market was not just the U.S. I would call it the Americas. We had strong growth from Canada through Brazil, but the entire America scheme did a very good job for Markem-Imaje in the first quarter.","Little bit lower growth in Europe, but it was still positive. China was a challenge. Now I'll answer your question about profile, I will tell you that and I think I shared this on a call or two last years with respect to both Europe and China. We continue to see a slowdown in a deferral and a longer sales cycle, both in Europe and China with respect to orders that are for what I would refer to as capital goods. If it's for operating type of expenditures that products that we're selling to our customers that activity seems to be holding up fairly well.","Julian Mitchell","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yeah, just a couple of quick questions on segment margins before broader question. Just may be Brad or Bob fluid margins - okay. So fluid margins also impacted by Tokheim accounting this quarter. Can you maybe just size that for us? And also the gain on disposition, did that fall into the ES segments?","Robert Livingston","Okay, Brad can give you some detail, but I am going to enjoy giving you a quick response on the fluid margins, Nigel. If you strip out the acquisitions from out of the fluid segment that we completed in 2015 and then Tokheim in January of this year and just look at the core business. We actually had slight margin improvement year-over-year in the first quarter. I think maybe it was modest, but it was still an improvement, I think it was 30 or 40 basis points improvement in the core operating margin. But obviously the acquisitions are coming on board with lower margins than the core and then we have the purchase accounting on top of that. But Brad can probably give you additional color than that.","Brad Cerepak","Well, the only thing for the first quarter I would add that you know not having the numbers on top of my head right here. We had in the ES about, I don't know about 7 million or so restructuring cost, if I remember correctly. If I adjust for that restructuring cost and I adjust for then the deal, the margins, the margins and fluids would be about 17.5%. So, we can do the math on that and figure out what the delta is on with respect to the acquisitions.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's -","Robert Livingston","Your other question was on the disposition?","Nigel Coe","Yeah, that - yes.","Robert Livingston","Yeah, that was within the industrial platform of the ES and I think the gain that we, I think we commented on this in the script. I think the gain was $10 million or $11 million.","Brad Cerepak","$11 million.","Robert Livingston","$11 million.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. And then just Bob, Energy have plus and minus 10% or more organic growth declines for six of the plus eight years and it looks like next couple of years you're going to have strong double-digit growth -","Robert Livingston","You mean six of the past eight years.","Nigel Coe","Past eight years, no eight years if you get back to 2009.","Robert Livingston","Yes, okay.","Nigel Coe","Yeah, so I mean, I understand the cycles up, cycles down, but given us the account - is that we have to live with and still remain the growth platform going forward or how you're thinking about energy as part of Dover going forward?","Robert Livingston","So, the question is around margins. Let me just - you'd have start you're going to look at it over a longer period of time looking back, you have to start by understanding the effective product mix and acquisitions on the segment margins and I am not just talking about purchase accounting and amortization. But the pure business profile of the acquisitions that we've made over the last four or five years, you go back to 2008, 2009, the two primary businesses within our energy platform as we\u2019ve reported today would be our artificial lift business and our diamond insert business, both of which have margins then and up until 2000 - up until the last, you know, up until the last nine months have had margins higher than the businesses that we\u2019ve been acquiring.","So the mix has changed rather significantly, it\u2019s rather difficult to compare the business - the business margin profile of even prior to the downturn even in 2014 to the business profile we had in 2008. And if you wonder have Paul walk that through you on the call later then he'll be glad to do that.","Nigel Coe","Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot. There was no really margins is more typicality of the business, but I\u2019ll follow up offline. Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey, it\u2019s a follow-up may be a little bit on Nigel's fluid margins question, if we just think about kind of the margins from here in fluids versus the first quarter run rate, I mean, is all of that acquisition impact, is that just normal like ongoing acquisition accounting or was there any stuff that hit more in 1Q that's going to ease through the year or should we - or this kind of a good all-in one run rate, if we just adjust for the restructuring?","Robert Livingston","No, I would say that there is, the answer is typical, there were three acquisitions, we have quite a bit of impact related to inventory turnover in the first quarter that doesn\u2019t continue beyond that, but you do get the normal amortization of the goodwill in the intent, actually the intangibles. So the inventory piece, you know, I would say the first quarter is being impacted by roughly $6 million or $7 millions of inventory, and that doesn\u2019t repeat itself into the second or third, fourth quarters. And then if you think about margins as well on restructuring, we said restructuring was going to be $40 million. If you think about how that\u2019s going to get spend, we had $14 million or so in the first quarter, I would expect by the time we finish the second quarter we'll be about $35 million or so about $40 million spend.","So, again as I start to look at first half and second half even for the company, you know, the first half, second half is not traditional what I would say is the split between first half and second half at $48 million to $52 million which it\u2019s showing up in guide rate now was about 43% ,47%, $57 million, but if you adjust for these one-offs that you\u2019re asking about and restructuring and then relook at it at that level, it has closer to 45%, 46% first half.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. That helps. And then just on, Bob your comment on sort of energy being positioned to fully leverage any ventral recovery, price hasn't actually seen that as bad as Jeff was saying earlier, headcounts now down 32% and we\u2019re going to be, hopefully exiting the year around of 10% run rate, so what is that mean, in terms of fully leveraging a recovery, I mean, in a positive scenario, I mean, where do you really think you can get this energy business back to margin wise?","Robert Livingston","Again it\u2019s - you tell me what - if I knew what the volume was going to be next year Shannon, I can tell you - I could give you pretty good guess what the margins were going to be, it is very volume sensitive. We commented on the margins that we don\u2019t - the EBITDA numbers are obviously in our filings, but even as we look at our energy segment as - if we close - if we exit the fourth quarter with a 10% operating margin run rate, Shannon, our EBITDA on that business is about 20% in the fourth quarter. And what we have tried to protect very diligently and I commented on the script as well, is our engineering capability and our ability to respond pretty quickly. So when I say we can take advantage of the recovery and leverage the recovery well, when it does come, part of its around our response capability, but we have taken enough fixed cost out of this business in 2015 and 2016, that the incrementals on our volume increase are going to be rather impressive.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And as a reminder, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And your next question is coming from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Robert Livingston","Hi, Steve. Good morning.","Steve Tusa","Just I guess a lot of numbers floating around here. For the second quarter, you guys I think you've reached - the numbers have changed a bit, but last year I think it was up EPS wise 30% to 35% from first quarter to second quarter. I'm not even sure what number we're using like let's just use I guess the $0.52 number or maybe like $0.55 to $0.60 number. Because there was a lot of moving parts here. But is second quarter going to be better sequentially than last year or because of the energy dynamics, although small impact now or worse than it was last year seasonally. What's kind of a seasonal color, when you kind of mix this all in for the second quarter?","Brad Cerepak","Well, okay. I understand the question. I haven't done that calculation Steve.","Steve Tusa","Well, I hate to say it's just a question that if you have a view on, if you know what the second quarter is, what is that roughly year-over-year versus the first quarter that\u2019s kind of the baseline question.","Brad Cerepak","I actually don't have the detail in front of me, Steve. I'm taking the guess to even try to answer that.","Paul Goldberg","Yeah Steve, it's Paul. I would just say that the three segments, Engineered Systems, Fluid and Refrigeration and Food Equipment are clearly are going to be improved sequentially second quarter over first quarter. Bob said energy is going to be down 10% sequentially. So the EPS in the second quarter is going to be substantially above, where we are in the first quarter, but we don't give second quarter guidance.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And I guess you guys talked about the energy margin. I assume the energy margin given the revenue decline and as you talked mostly about the back half waiting of, I mean as restructuring coming through et cetera. I assume the energy margins is going to be down in the second quarter.","Robert Livingston","We'll actually all in. I'm not sure that's true Steve. All in the first quarter including I say all in including restructuring charges, I think margins were 4%, 4.1% something like that. We actually do start to get some benefits in the second quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Robert Livingston","So from those restructuring activities that we're for the most part absent in the first quarter. Because Steve most of the restructuring we took in energy and the first quarter occurred in March.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last question just on the --.","Robert Livingston","I actually expect margins in the second quarter and energy to be a bit better than the first. We actually took out 366 ads in the first quarter in energy. And most of them - in March.","Brad Cerepak","So you will see that impact into the second quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then in energy just a follow-up to Nigel's question. I think what he was trying to get at was not necessarily the margin, but just the cyclicality of the business. Is there any part of that business may be drilling perhaps that's going to be little more challenged over the next couple of years? Any parts of those businesses that are up for strategic review and potential divestiture. Obviously you're not going to do the whole segment but are there any parts of that drilling specifically that you'd evaluate as being strategic or non-strategic for the longer-term?","Robert Livingston","Good question. And it's something we look at. We something we look at every year not just on energy. But beyond that I'm not going to comment.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi Group.","Andy Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Andy Kaplowitz","Good morning. So I'm trying to reconcile the EPS of sets of acquisition in 2016. You have $0.16 to $0.17 for the year. You've talked about this little bit in your prepared remarks, but you have $0.18 last quarter. But your numbers now include the $0.07 gain from the disposition. And then of course it also includes the earnings from the disposition of the loss of earnings. So can you talk about how are your acquisitions trending? I know it's early but are they lower than you thought in terms of EPS contribution or the same or maybe a little more color there.","Robert Livingston","Sure. So you're right. And then last forecast we had a roughly $0.18 from acquisition accretion. Where we're stand today in our forecast, we're at $0.19. So roughly it's the same number let's say at that way. So they're trending fine, some are little bit better. Yeah one's up a penny one, there is no big changes, pretty consistent from our last forecast and the way you reconcile it, you get - you take out the gain that to your point and you add and you also have to, you add back the gain and then you subtract out the lost revenue and earnings of the disposition and that\u2019s about $0.09 or so.","Andy Kaplowitz","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Bob maybe I can ask you specifically about the fluid transfer business if I look at that business it did turn down a little bit you mentioned oil and gas you mentioned lower CapEx spending you didn\u2019t specifically talk about OPW that seems fine, but maybe just a little more color on that business, what turned down in that business?","Robert Livingston","So, the OPW first quarter was lighter than we expected and in the first quarter, the softness was almost all, not entirely, but almost all in the retail area. Activity in Canada, our retail fueling was significantly below expectations and even our experience from last year thus the comp part of the reason why I have to comment on the integrated energy companies at least, those are some of our customers in Canada, but we also saw some project timing for shales from the first quarter to second and third from some U.S. retail customers who are pushing out some rebuild projects.","Andy Kaplowitz","So, Bob how do we look at OPW for the rest of the year then how do you look at it?","Robert Livingston","I would say for the rest of the year, our expectation is it\u2019s going to be less of a call it a negative year-over-year comp in the second quarter and we\u2019re actually feeling fairly positive about by the second half of the year.","Andy Kaplowitz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Dean Dray of RBC.","Deane Dray","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey Bob, hope you give us some color on the - in refrigeration those retail wins you had in the quarter and how does that compare to any sort of seasonal expectations?","Robert Livingston","Are you asking it for the customer names, I'm not going to do that, Dean?","Deane Dray","I did not ask for customer names but just some color as to what kind of customers or what kind of products?","Robert Livingston","For those of you who recall that my comments in the first half of last year on refrigeration what we\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter and the first quarter was actually what we were expecting to see in the second quarter of last year, it just took us longer to get to this point. As you know, we did take a significant drop down and the step down in the Walmart business and the efforts by the leadership team and the sales organization in Phoenix has been outstanding over the past year to deal with the shortfall and they are covering it.","They\u2019re covering it Dean, they\u2019ve done a really good job. In fact I would say that the organic growth for the segment in the first quarter just slightly above 3% was actually about a point better than we expected coming into the year and all of that upside was that of our refrigeration business, primarily, but not all, primarily Phoenix and we feel very, very good with the factory load we have right now for the seasonally strong second quarter and the teams are working pretty feverishly and making sure that we can make that same comment as we entered the third quarter. We actually feel pretty positive right now about the seasonal load that we\u2019re looking at here in the second and third quarter.","Deane Dray","And just to clarify so on that filling the Walmart hole, these wins you had they were new customers and that would be considered part of that initiative that you talked about last year about --?","Robert Livingston","No the customers Dean, there\u2019s a handful of new customers in there a single handful, but some of it is just winning larger share.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just a clarification on -","Robert Livingston","I would like to cover a point here Walmart activity is still not where we would expect it to be even in the remodel activity, the first few weeks of the year were actually pretty modest compared to our expectations. March was sort of back on track. But this is a bit of a different year for Walmart. With respect to communication to at least us and to other suppliers that we're aware of is that they have not announced to their supply base a detailed roll out of remodel activity for 2016, it's sort of being done in month or two at a time.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just\u2026","Robert Livingston","For the year.","Deane Dray","Just to clarify on the incremental restructuring that you've announced today. What's the implied payback and you called out the shared service centers a couple times, is that a permanent change and how does that contribute on the cost equation?","Robert Livingston","I'm going to have the Brad on the payback.","Brad Cerepak","On the restructuring. So let's just cover that for a moment. We said incremental 20 million for total of 40 million. So if you think about what we had in terms of benefits in our last forecast where we are today. The benefits on the 20 million incremental spend is up 50 million. I know that sounds like a big number. But in that 50 million I would say 50% of that is right sizing manufacturing so that hourly work variable cost and the other 50% is attribute to structural type of cost take out and so that's what we have in our forecast. So again some of the you'll see the foot note on one of the charts that 100 million now and the aggregate includes we include all in when we say the headcounts are down 366 heads that's also manufacturing and management and overhead type layers as well.","Deane Dray","And the shared services prior the structural change?","Brad Cerepak","Well, yes or no, I mean it's not part of a restructuring activity per se. But it surely is a structural change that we are pursuing here at Dover. We've been running pilot programs where two full years now and this year we sort of announced here internally a couple of months ago the role out of the shared service approach around Dover and it's more than just back office. It encompasses from activity around HR some like activity around finance and accounting. But it's more than just accounts payable and accounts receivable it's much more expensive.","And I think actually by the time we get the year end 2016 we'll probably we'll have one segment pretty much fully transition to shared service approach and the other 3 perhaps 30 to 50% transitioned to the shared service platform. We are not - in our guide there has actually no benefits, not net benefits in our guide this year from the shared service roll out. We've got some spending and some investment that we are making this year, we are seeing some benefits. But that's not going to be a net benefit. We'll actually start to see the net benefits of this program in the 2017 and 2018.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Robert Livingston","Great.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys and thanks for fitting me in.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie","Maybe just on that payback question, I think the genesis of the question is a fact that when you take a look at your payback and what you are spending from a restructuring standpoint it looks pretty like really good payback relative to what other industrial companies are seeing. I guess maybe the question is one what gives you the confidence that you can get that payback and then secondly are there any obstacles that you see as you are rolling out your restructuring programs that would potentially inhibit you from saying that same type of benefit.","Robert Livingston","Okay. So first-of-all all restructuring activity is not the same. The bulk of not all, but the bulk of the restructuring activity we\u2019ve had and energy both last year 2015 as well as the first half of this year has been people related and my goodness Brad, can I say almost a 100% domestic, maybe almost a 100% North America for sure. And Joe the payback on that is pretty high pretty quick.","When you peel off the labor restructuring, the workforce restructuring you look at some of the fixed cost or facility consolidations we did last year and are doing again this year. In a waiting perspective they are pretty minor compared to the benefits we are getting from the workforce reduction and the payback is longer probably more in line with what you are referring to here when you look at the facility consolidations that we have done. But again, most of the work force reduction last year and this year has been North America.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. So I guess the confidence in set in other way your confidence is pretty high - there, okay. And then may be one follow-on question\u2026","Robert Livingston","May be I will get you a very discrete example Brad mentioned that in Energy in the first quarter workforce was reduced by 366 they are either here or not and when they are not I mean the benefits I mean it is a pretty high comfort on that.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay, fair enough. And then I guess, I guess the follow-on question there is really since may be focused on Energy for a second. I remember several quarters ago we talked about additional restructuring actions potentially impacting your service levels and yet you know we have seen that there is no restructuring and actions that are needed to be taken on the Energy side of your business. I guess, I am curious, how are you managing that piece of your business and make sure that service levels are interrupted and when we do see recovering?","Robert Livingston","So like I commented both on the script and in earlier response, we have as good of a job as we can be holding our engineering capability. In fact, I would say at last year in 2015 we actually added resources in engineering. The 2016 we have tweet a bit around the edges on our service response but we have done it, in a way that we know we have got flexibility to move resources around to handle customer demands today, tomorrow and hopefully here whether it is the second half of this year and next year when you start to see a little bit of the recovery. But we have tried very diligently to protect our response time even though we have then sort of trending at the margins.","To that point Joe, I am going to tell you, I do not see a lot more flexibility in the second-half of his year or even going in the next year about restructuring activity at Energy that is in line with what we have done in the second-half of last year or in the first quarter or the second quarter of this year. If there's further revenue declines I think we can always find opportunities at the margin but I am not just being very upfront, I do not see the opportunity to take another $30 million of cost out of Energy in the second-half of this year even if we see a little bit of decline in revenue.","Joseph Ritchie","Hey, that's helpful. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thank you very much.

With us today are Bob Livingston, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Paul Goldberg, Vice President of Investor Relations.","After the speakers' opening remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg, please go ahead, sir.","Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to Dover's third quarter earnings call. With me today are Bob Livingston and Brad Cerepak. And today's call will begin with comments from Bob and Brad on Dover's third quarter operating and financial performance and follow with an update of our 2015 outlook. We will then open the call up for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up.","Please note that our current earnings release, Form 10-Q, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website, www.dovercorporation.com. This call will be available for playback through November 3, and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months. The replay telephone number is 1-800-585-8367. When accessing the playback, you'll need to supply the following access code, 52317274.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today, which are intended to supplement your understanding of Dover, may contain certain forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to uncertainties. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement.","Also, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. We would also direct your attention to our website where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Our team aggressively pursued share gains, cost actions and productivity initiatives which helped to mitigate weak global macro conditions.","I was pleased we were able to sign agreements to acquire two businesses, JK Group and Gala Industries. These acquisitions are in addition to the previously announced Tokheim deal and are expected to close later this quarter. Each of these companies offer industry-leading products and significantly complement and expand our market positions.","Now, let me share some comments on the quarter. We executed well and were able to post solid results. Of note, the sequential rate of decline moderated significantly in our Energy segment while Refrigeration & Food Equipment's results improved sequentially. Engineered Systems and Fluids continued to perform well. Overall, Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment all posted the same or improved year-over-year margin on lower volume. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy exposure and the tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, U.S. industrial activity was solid. Our Asian and European activity slowed on reduced CapEx spending.","Now, some specific segment comments. In Energy, markets remained tough. However, I was pleased with our third quarter results as we posted an adjusted segment margin of over 15%, a 3-point sequential improvement. Our teams executed well on actions to drive sales as well as on broad cost reduction activities. As we enter the fourth quarter, we remain focused on winning new business, maintaining appropriate service levels and continuing to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure.","In Engineered Systems, we achieved modest organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses performed well in North America but were softer in China. European activity slowed partially due to the timing of order activity. In the Industrial platform, modest organic growth was led by solid results in our waste handling business.","Our Fluids segment had a solid quarter, led by our business serving the polymers and plastics market. Fluids segment margin performance was again excellent at over 21%.","Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results improved sequentially. I am encouraged by some important recent wins for our Hillphoenix business, which should set us up for an improved 2016. Our glass door business again performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology.","Our acquisition pipeline matured nicely in the quarter. And as noted earlier, we have signed agreements for three important acquisitions since our last earnings call, Tokheim, JK and Gala. While all three companies serve different end markets, they all have commonality in that they each complement and expand our presence in key end markets, are highly synergistic and position us to be a more important partner with our customers.","In the case of Tokheim, we added leading Dispenser and Systems business to our strong OPW suite of products. Together, we will have the most complete retail fueling solutions available for our customers.","With JK, we add a high-growth, market-leading consumable ink business to our already strong digital printing equipment offering. Our customers will benefit from the coordination and technology sharing between JK and MS Solutions.","And with Gala, we will broaden our position serving the polymers and plastics markets. The combination of Maag and Gala will allow us to participate in more applications in the plastics manufacturing process and, thus, become an even stronger partner with our customers.","In total, we are spending about $1 billion on these three businesses and acquiring about $500 million in 2016 revenue. Excluding acquisition-related costs, we expect about $0.38 accretion in 2016 from these deals on an operating basis.","Now, looking to the remainder of the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have further adjusted our full year forecast to reflect the recent decline in rig count, as well as softer bearings and compression markets driven by slower OEM build rates.","In Engineered Systems, we anticipate modest growth in both platforms in the fourth quarter led by strong results in waste handling and digital printing equipment. Regarding Fluids, though we anticipate growth to slow in the fourth quarter, we expect fluid transfer to remain solid. Overall, we expect to finish the year with segment margin of around 20% driven by the strong focus on cost management and productivity.","And finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect normal fourth quarter seasonality off our lower base. However, we do anticipate our glass door, commercial food and can-shaping equipment businesses to perform well.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide three of the presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 11%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 3%, and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $1.19 and includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefits.","Segment margin for the quarter was 17%, 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for third quarter restructuring of $12 million, margin was 17.6%. Restructuring activities were broad-based and came in toward the high end of our prior range. Bookings decreased 12% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting tough oil and gas markets.","Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.95. Our backlog decreased 20% to $1 billion. Free cash flow was strong at $243 million for the quarter, or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we now expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 12% of revenue, up one point from our prior estimate.","Now turning to slide four. Fluids and Engineered Systems both had organic revenue growth of 1%. Fluids benefited from strong project-related shipments. Engineered Systems growth was driven by solid waste handling markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6%, primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 37%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 3% while FX had a negative 4% impact.","Now turning to slide five and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter largely driven by expected higher volume in our retail refrigeration markets. Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 10%. Fluids was flat while Engineered Systems declined 2%. Energy decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting moderation in the rate of decline following sequential declines of 15% in Q2 and 22% in Q1.","Sequential bookings decreased 1%, principally driven by normal seasonality of Refrigeration & Food Equipment, partially offset by strong Fluid orders. Overall, Fluids grew 7% resulting from solid fluid transfer activity and robust project-related pump orders. Energy grew 2% and Engineered Systems was up 1%, while Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 12%.","Now, on slide six. Energy revenue of $364 million decreased 28%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $49 million. Energy's results continue to be impacted by challenging North American oil and gas markets. Of note, Middle East activity held up well in the quarter and international expansion continues to be an area of opportunity.","We incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring cost in the third quarter and are evaluating additional cost actions as we finish the year. Excluding the Q3 restructuring cost, our operating margin was over 15%, reflecting volume and price declines partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. Bookings were $352 million, a 33% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.97.","Turning to slide seven. Engineered Systems revenue of $579 million declined 5% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 1%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $103 million decreased 5%, reflecting principally the impact of FX. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $228 million decreased 11% due to FX. Organic revenue was flat, reflecting North American growth offset by softer China and deferred digital equipment order activity in Europe.","In our Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $351 million, where organic growth was 1%, offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was led by our waste handling and microwave component businesses.","We incurred $4 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q3 restructuring costs, our operating margins was a strong 18.5%, reflecting the benefits of productivity and completed restructuring, and a positive business mix.","Bookings were $565 million, a decrease of 4%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 2%, offset by a 6% impact from FX. Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 2%, and Industrial bookings increased 1%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.99, while Industrial was 0.96. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.98.","Now, on slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 3% to $352 million, while earnings increased 11% to $75 million. Revenue performance was driven by organic and acquisition growth of 1%, respectively, offset by a 5% FX impact. Our fluid transfer businesses remained solid, while our pumps results reflect strong shipments of plastics-related project orders.","Segment margin was 21.3%, an increase of 260 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Of note, deal costs related to recent acquisition activity were approximately $2 million in the quarter. Bookings were $357 million, an increase of 2% overall or 4% organically. This result primarily reflects strong project orders. Book-to-bill was 1.01.","Now, let's turn to slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $492 million declined 7% from the prior year, and earnings decreased 2% to $77 million. As expected, revenue was largely impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid and our can-shaping equipment results were improved but were impacted by a delayed shipment at quarter-end which will ship in Q4.","Operating margin was 15.6%, an 80-basis-point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects reduced manufacturing supply chain costs as compared to last year and the benefits of restructuring. Bookings were $431 million, a decrease of 6%, principally reflecting slow order activity from our core refrigeration customers. Book-to-bill was 0.87, reflecting normal seasonality.","Now, going to the overview slide number 10. Third quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $26 million, down $2 million reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Excluding discrete tax benefits, our third quarter tax rate was 27.3%, reflecting the benefits from restructuring international operations. Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million and have repurchased $600 million year-to-date, completing our repurchase plans for the year.","Moving on to slide 11 which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 10% to 11%. Within this estimate, organic revenue has been reduced 2 points. It is now expected to be down 9% to 10% for the year. We continue to expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 3% and the impact of FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be around 16% excluding restructuring costs.","Our full year corporate expense forecast is coming down $9 million to $107 million reflecting flow-through of the third quarter reduction and a lower run rate. Interest expense remained at around $127 million. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28.5%, a half point lower than our prior forecast. CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue and our full year free cash flow will now be around 12% of revenue.","From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 33% to 34%, a 2-point reduction from our prior guidance. Engineered Systems' organic growth is now expected to be around 3%, within our prior forecast range. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecasted is expected to be down 7% to 8%, essentially unchanged from our prior forecast.","Lastly, Fluids growth rate has been reduced 3 points to 2% to 3%, driven principally by weak oil and gas markets.","Turning to the 2015 bridge on slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to be $0.02 higher than our prior forecast, and be negative $0.02 to $0.04. Performance largely driven by volume declines and also including $0.02 of deal cost, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $1.11 to $1.15. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.45 to $0.50.","Acquisitions already completed will be about $0.04 accretive. Note that this does not include Tokheim, JK or Gala.","Share reduction will add approximately $0.21. Interest, corporate and a lower tax rate will be in the range of $0.08 to $0.09 benefit. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.73 to $3.80, as compared to our prior forecast of $3.75 to $3.90. This range includes approximately $0.20 of restructuring charges, a $0.02 increase from our last forecast, and now also includes $0.02 of deal cost and $0.05 related to discrete tax benefits.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brad. Although we have clearly been impacted by difficult market conditions, I am pleased with the way our teams have responded and executed in this environment. We've done an excellent job pursuing revenue opportunities and winning new customers. And we have positioned our company well through aggressive cost management and productivity projects.","As I look beyond 2015, I am very excited by the breadth of opportunities across Dover. For example, within Energy, our aggressive pursuit of share gains and expanding our international presence is ongoing as we are currently participating in many foreign tenders. The cost and productivity efforts we have taken throughout the year have permanently reduced the cost structure of the business.","Engineered Systems should significantly benefit from their continued focus on productivity, especially the shared service initiative and by their addition of JK. I also believe our waste handling business will continue to post strong order rates.","In Fluids, I anticipate continued strong performance largely driven by solid results for our businesses serving the retail fueling and polymers and plastics markets. The results will be nicely complemented by the addition of Tokheim and Gala, respectively.","And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, expected improved performance for Hillphoenix will be driven by retail refrigeration customer wins and share gains, and continued strong performance by Anthony. Our Food Equipment businesses should also be solid, boosted by the rollout of new products.","In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.","Now, Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. Before we have the first question, I'd like to remind everybody, if you can limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, we'll get more questions in, and we have several people in queue right now. So, Laurie, can we please have our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Julian. Good morning.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Just a question around the capital allocation. Obviously, the buyback spend has tailed off in the second half, I guess, in line with the initial plan for the year. M&A now stepped up. So, is that just the sort of the vagaries of short-term timing or is there a more fundamental shift in approach on how you're using the cash?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Don't read any \u2013 don't read into this, any fundamental shifts. Oh gosh, Julian, I think if you look at maybe the last three years, maybe even four years, you'll see our capital allocation has been pretty evenly split between acquisitions and spending on dividends, as well as share repurchases. In fact, I think it's been about 50\/50.","I'm not going to comment on guidance for 2016, but I would tell you, if you look at the next couple years or three years, I would not expect the capital allocation profile to be much different than it has been for the last three years or four years.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then, just my follow-up is around the restructuring plans. And you said you'd increased it by a couple of cents for this year. I just wonder if there was a possibility you might have pushed that out more given maybe extra weakness on CapEx outside of the Energy business, and what sort of assumptions you have for organic growth behind that extra $0.02 increase on restructuring.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, we have increased our restructuring activity here in the second half. You see it in the fourth quarter forecast. I would also add that even with the restructuring that we have included in our forecast, we continue to look for opportunities to restructure and to reduce our cost base, especially within Energy, but it's not restricted to Energy.","If you look beyond 2015, I \u2013 sitting here today, I would tell you that I do expect our restructuring activity in 2016 to be diminished from what you've seen us tackle in 2015, and even in the latter part of 2014. It won't be zero, but I don't expect it to be at the levels we had last year and this year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Congratulations on the deal close. You've been pretty active for sure. Can you just maybe just give us some color around...","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","I've been signaling this for the last three months or four months.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I know, but sell side is as cynical as you know. But if you can just give us some color around JK and Gala in terms of growth rates and margin profile, that would be helpful.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Gosh. JK, well, let's see. Of the three, Tokheim, JK and Gala, Tokheim and Gala will both be add-ons to existing businesses within Dover. Tokheim will become part of OPW; and Gala, obviously, will become part of our Maag business. JK will actually be a standalone within our Printing & Identification platform within Engineered Systems.","The margins within JK \u2013 gosh, Brad, are they \u2013 they may be the highest margins, operating margins of any standalone business we have in Dover. Is that a true statement?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that would be close to \u2013 that would be true. And it's a consumable business. So, naturally, we have consumables in our Markem-Imaje business. And I would say it's not significantly different than what we see in our other consumables.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Nigel, the margins will be north of 45%, operating margins at JK. At Gala, low-teens. And I'm not even sure they're at low-teens right now. They're \u2013 but we're very close to it, 12%. But we're pretty excited about this opportunity. It's really easy to remind myself that even three-and-a-half years ago, when we acquired Maag, their margins were pretty similar to what we see at Gala today.","And the margins at Maag, this year, I think we've \u2013 my goodness, Brad, I think we've improved margins over the last three years by about 600 basis points and that is a rough number.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","(29:12) yeah.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","And don't expect that to happen in 2016, but you should expect us to start that journey in 2016, Nigel. And I fully expect those margins to be reflective, if not accretive, to Maag over the next three years or four years.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the accretion numbers for 2016, I noticed in the PR, you mentioned they don't include interest expense. And I'm just wondering, is that because the phantom mix is still pretty Fluids? No pun intended there, but are you still to decide on the phantom mix? I mean, how should we think about, for modeling purposes, the mix between cash and debt, and then the mix on the debt between term and CP?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So...","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Brad.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Let me take that one. So, let me just start with the deals that we expect to close in Q4. As we sit here today, we will execute those deals with existing cash. And the cash that we generate in the fourth quarter, which will be a very healthy, normal fourth quarter that we see...","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brad, the two deals we do expect to close in our fourth quarter are JK and Gala.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. We are not \u2013 sitting here today, we still don't anticipate closing Tokheim until early in 2016. So for next year, specifically \u2013 so the two deals this year, we'll close with cash and cash generated. As for next year, specifically the Tokheim deal, it depends a lot on the timing. But we expect funding this deal now part cash on hand and some incremental debt, most likely, to your question, using CP. And I would say today, sitting here, we've sized that at a range of somewhere \u2013 less than the purchase price, but somewhere in the range of $300 million to $400 million.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just maybe just talk about pricing pressure in Energy and across the other segments. What are you seeing now? You've talked about it in prior calls, a little bit about your expectations. How has that been coming through and what are your expectations going forward?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's really two different topics. It's Energy and then it's the rest of Dover. And in the other three segments, Steve, I would say the pricing has been rather neutral this year. We saw that again in the third quarter. We don't anticipate anything different than that in the fourth quarter. And 2016, though we haven't completed our planning process yet, I would say that our early look on pricing for 2016 would be more of the same. We would expect it to be neutral.","We have seen pricing pressure in Energy this year. I think we opened \u2013 help me here, Brad. We opened early in the year or on our first quarter call, guiding price down, expectations of 3% to 5%, I think it was. I think we'll end the year closer to the low end of that range than the high end, Steve. And it truly is \u2013 you truly do see quite a mix on pricing pressure across the various product lines. And it's not much different during the third quarter or what we expect in the fourth quarter than what I've shared before on calls.","In our rod business, I think price down activity in the third quarter was about 10% or 11%, which was fairly consistent with the second quarter. In a couple of other product areas, it's mid-single digits. But overall, not much of a change since our second quarter call.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, on the implied fourth quarter guidance, it looks like your revenue, sequential revenue is declining about 1%. And I think that compares to about maybe 2.5% to 3.5% over the last couple of years, obviously, always different dynamics here. But as you were looking at the sequential behavior across Energy, particularly in the other businesses, is that just indicative of you \u2013 believing that you're pretty close to bottoming out? Or how were you thinking about that?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, let me give you an opening comment in response to your question, and Brad can perhaps add some detail. If I use the top end of our guidance range that existed \u2013 that we shared with you on the July call and look at where we are today, you would see that revenues coming down, what is the number, about $150 million or $160 million on the guide, Brad?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","For the second half.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Or during the fourth.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","And I would tell you that if it's $160 million, $60 million of it was in the third quarter, $100 million of it is in the fourth quarter. And it's \u2013 in broad strokes, it's three areas. It's Energy, it's Europe and it's China. And Europe and China touched all three segments. The $50 million to $60 million in the third quarter was fairly modest in Energy. We were probably down maybe $9 million or $10 million below our expectations.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But up on earnings now.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","But up on earnings, and feel like we were about $50 million short of our expectations in the third quarter in the other segments almost all attributable to slowdown in Europe and China.","In the fourth quarter, I would peg that number at $100 million. And I'm \u2013 I think we're recognizing the recent activity, recent trend here in rig counts as we went through the second half of the third quarter. But our Energy revenue forecast for the fourth quarter is down about $40 million or $45 million from where we're looking at it in July, and at about $100 million across the other segments, again, mostly attributable to some slowness we're seeing or anticipating in Europe and China. So, I hope that provides some top line cover, maybe.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","It does. Yes. Absolutely.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","So, Bob, a little follow-up to that one. So, it looks like the Energy revenues will be down sequentially another $30 million or so in the fourth quarter. Do you expect that, that would be the bottom or will it depend...","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","No. That's about $25 million.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","$25 million, okay.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Will it depend on \u2013 will that, do you think, mark a sort of sequential bottom for the business or will it depend on rig count? Where are you with destocking, et cetera? I mean, do you think that will be the bottom or not?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think it's going to be dependent upon energy trends. I think we are \u2013 there may be a pocket here or a customer somewhere who still has some inventory that they want to burn off, but I would tell you that the destocking of inventory, we think, is essentially done. We saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. We expected a little bit of that to continue in the third quarter. We did see that. But I think it's \u2013 I think that's behind us. I think the \u2013 I think, again, the best leading indicator that we've been sharing with you here for near-term activity in our Energy business is the rig count.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, in terms of...","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","And you see that almost as quickly as we do.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Yeah. Now, you've had some other dynamics, too. So, I mean at this point, it's pretty much down to that. And so, when you think about next year just in terms of cost-out opportunities across the company, is that still the biggest thing that you could potentially go after, of rig counts or worse, you would take more cost out of Energy or are there \u2013 or will that not be the primary restructuring area next year?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, if rig counts \u2013 if we continue to get pressured in our energy fundamentals, we still believe we've got opportunities to take some cost out. Though, Shannon, I'm going to be real direct here; it becomes more difficult as we go into 2016. But it will become \u2013 in 2016, it will truly become trade-offs between lowering cost and maintaining what we would define as appropriate service levels. But we do know we've got additional opportunities to tackle in 2016 if need be.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But I would...","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","But I'm not so sure I would agree with the other part of your statement that the bulk of our opportunities in 2016 are still within Energy, Brad. I think we do expect our restructuring activity to be less in 2016 than they were in 2015, but the discussions we're having across the board, we have restructuring opportunities that we've identified, some of which we'll tackle here in the fourth quarter, some of which are lined up for the first half of next year across all four segments.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gents.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning. Hey, just shifting over to Refrigeration and Hillphoenix in particular, can you give us any other color on the nature of the customer wins that you're talking about or the size and the impact that this might have on 2016?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't want to give you the individual customers, Jeff. I \u2013 as we talk about share gains and business wins, I will tell you what's not included in that would be any change that we would expect to see next year with our customer that we've been talking about all year long, which is Walmart. But when you look at...","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Any downward change.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","...any downward change. But when you look at the business wins and the share gains that we've experienced and benefited from here in the second half of this year, and look at the carryover into 2016, I would label them mostly regional retailers. And we think we're going into 2016 with about $30 million worth of incremental business from wins that we have earned this year and partly have some of the revenue in the second half of this year, but about $30 million of incremental business into 2016 for these new wins and share gain.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just shifting to Fluids, you'd historically described the direct oil and gas exposure there as some small side, I think maybe 10%, but you're taking the guide down there. Can you give a little bit of color on how hard those businesses are being hit? Do I have that 10% dialed right? What's going on in that?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","10% to 12%. And almost all of the, I would call it, the hit or the down cycle in oil and gas is restricted to some of the oil and \u2013 upstream oil and gas activity that our Pumps business participates in.","As Brad said in his script or in his prepared comments, the down guide on Fluids is principally oil and gas, but it's not all oil and gas. We are seeing some softness in Europe and China in Fluids as well. And we'll see how the fourth quarter shapes up.","I \u2013 the third quarter concerned me a little bit in China. If we were to pull out our project activity, which, as most of you know, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, if we pulled out our project activity from both the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2014, revenue was down in China double digits in the third quarter.","Not expecting it to be down as much in the fourth quarter. In fact, October and September are telling us it won't be. But I'm still being pretty cautious with respect to expectations in China here in the fourth quarter. But our business...","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","How much?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","...is down 15% \u2013 almost 15% in the third quarter in China.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","If I might slip in one more quick one. Your comments about Middle East Energy, there's a lot of stories of budget stress and duress there. And where are you seeing strength in the Middle East and how significant is that?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have \u2013 I'm not so sure I've got exact numbers that I can recall for the Middle East. I know we have, goodness, more than \u2013 we're participating in more than 50 tenders right now in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, as well as South America. Jeff, three years ago, that number would've been 8 tenders. I mean, it's \u2013 the change has been that significant for us. And I would say more than half, probably two thirds of these tenders, I would describe as Middle East opportunities. And the area that has been the most significant for us in the Middle East over the last three years has been our base of activity in Oman, and then the areas in the Middle East that we service from our base in Oman. And that continues to be quite attractive both here in the second half, as well as expectations for 2016 and 2017.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, can you just maybe talk about, just kind of reaffirm or provide some color around what the carryover on savings are for next year, again, on these actions, on the restructuring actions?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Oh, okay. I'll start, but Brad's going to have to help me here. So, as I look at it, Steve, I call it some of the self-help going into 2016. I've already commented that our restructuring charges in 2016 should be less than we've incurred in 2015 and 2014. I'm not going to give you that number until we finished some work. But I think we'll be prepared to share that delta with our investors and the analysts at our dinner in December.","But on the restructuring activities that we have executed on in 2015, I think the carryover that we're looking at is about $50 million, Brad?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's correct.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. $50 million.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. And then just on the Energy, the exit rate for the Energy margin, I'm not sure if you addressed this. What do you expect for Energy margins for the year again? Can you just remind me? Just trying to get a base, trying to get a base for next year, because obviously, 4Q is going to be pretty tough. It's not representative of the year, of course, but maybe just a year.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll give you some color on that to help you with your modeling. The Energy margins for the year is going to be a little bit better than 12%, and this is all-in. Restructuring, this is not adjusted, this is all-in; a little better than 12%. And I think one of the earlier questions was about the decline in revenue. In the fourth quarter in Energy, it's about $25 million. Our margins in the third quarter, all-in, were 13.5%, and will be about 100 bps below that in the fourth quarter.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Any other moving parts or any other segments for the fourth quarter that you want to call out, or is it pretty self-explanatory from a seasonal perspective, and any items to call out within the other segments on the margin front?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","No, there wouldn't be anything unusual to call out.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Would just like to clarify on the financing plans for JK, Gala. There's a \u2013 in the press release, that last sentence said, interest charges associated with incremental debt financing is not included in the EPS estimates. So, Brad said you're going to be using cash and fourth quarter cash flow. So, you're assuming no cost of financing for these deals?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","For the two deals that \u2013 as I said, the two deals we expect to close this year, there would be no financing related to that. It would be cash on hand and cash flow in the fourth quarter. And just to reiterate, on the Tokheim deal, depending on where we close next year, what we said would be $300 million to $400 million of financing; most likely, I view that as using CP.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got that. And then, also on other and corporate, that $2 million lower this quarter, should we view that as a new run rate for that expense? Anything unusual?","Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President-Investor Relations","Is the question on 2016?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I would say the run rate \u2013 as you know, in earlier quarters, we talked about this current year has impacted our compensation accruals. So, I would expect that you see some of that come back across that corporate number into next year. So, no, I would expect it to go up slightly.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, my first question on Energy. Clearly, you guys \u2013 Bob, you mentioned that pricing has been kind of closer towards the down 3% this year. I'm just curious, what are your expectations for pricing in Energy next year? And how are you thinking about the end market across your businesses?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm not giving guidance on 2016 yet, Joe. So, you're going to have to \u2013 I'm going to preface my comment by saying, we're still doing a lot of work on that. But I would tell you, at the sort of the high level assumptions we're making, is that the next couple of quarters are probably going to be pretty reflective of what we're seeing here as we end the third quarter and move into the fourth quarter. And I would label that as stability, but at a much lower investment rate and spend rate with our customers.","It's a little bit more difficult to call right now, the second half of next year. And we'll give you a little bit more color on that at our dinner in December. But for the first half of next year, without any doubt, we are not planning for any recovery beyond our current run rate in the Energy market. And \u2013 but I would also say we're not expecting or planning for another 10% down either.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I mean, maybe just following up and asking a question...","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","And your second question was around pricing.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would tell you that I'm not sure pricing was going to be much different. I think as we go into 2016, we would continue to see some pricing pressure, especially in the first half of 2016. I'm not sure our guide would be much different than we were providing at the beginning of the year for the Energy segment in total, maybe a 3% price down pressure. And again, you're going to see it scattered around different product lines and regions where some price pressure will be greater than others.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Now \u2013 and that's great color. Thanks, Bob. I think the question I was really trying to get at, in the face of potentially another down 3% pricing year for next year, based on all the restructuring actions that you've done this year, can you guys grow margins? Assuming that there is no fall-off in organic growth, can you guys expand margins in your Energy segment next year?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","No. I'm going to preface this \u2013 what my response, again, by telling you, give me \u2013 give us the opportunity to spend some more time on this between now and our investor dinner in December. And I think that this time allows us to come to grips with a little bit of what we're going to be expecting and planning for in the second half.","Now, to your question about margin expansion. As we sit here today, we actually see the opportunity in all four of our segments, to see margin expansion. It will be varied. But I think we can \u2013 in our core business, if you exclude the acquisition activity and aside from JK, the other two acquisitions we've announced do have \u2013 do bring with them, much lower margins than what we have as a Dover average. But in our core business for Dover, we do clearly see the opportunity for margin expansion in 2016. Do you want to add more color to that, Brad?","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The only thing I would add is it gets back to what we're talking about before. We would expect sitting here today, not as much restructuring spend, that's part of that answer, and the carryover benefits, obviously, are quite significant going into next year at $50 million. So, that gives us some jumpstart into that discussion of margin expansion into 2016.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","And on top of that, we are anticipating and planning and identifying significant benefits from productivity in 2016.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Wright of Nomura Securities.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Bob, just digging into your comments on China a little bit. Was that 15% number in 3Q for Dover as a whole? And maybe if you could just dig into the verticals a little bit and talk about which pockets were weakest and how that's trended into 4Q.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It was Dover \u2013 it was a Dover number. And, gosh, Jonathan, I'm going to have to \u2013 I'd be guessing because I don't have good recall on what the down cycle was in China by each segment. It was evident at each segment, that I can tell you. But I don't have the numbers and a good recall for each segment.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","But where is the biggest exposure to China in the portfolio? Is it Printing & ID? Or where is your biggest exposure?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Fluids and Printing & ID. And it's not \u2013 it's actually not insignificant for Refrigeration either.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And then just one more. The comments you made around kind of the international tax planning benefit from the restructuring you've conducted, does that imply a lower tax rate in 2016 or is that sort of a one-off benefit you're seeing this year?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think \u2013 I would characterize it more like a one-off for this year, and probably reverting back to that slightly below 30% rate, at 29% rate for 2016.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Bob, Brad or Paul.","Robert A.

With you now controlling the ink there, is that something you can use as a strategic weapon or a strategic advantage in competing in that space?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't like the word weapon because \u2013 we'll use it as a strategic opportunity to better service our customers.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So the answer is yes. I'll take that as...","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, yeah.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Then my second question is on the cost actions that you've taken so far this year.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","I will underscore how important that question is on this JK acquisition.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I think that answers it. So on the cost out actions that you've taken this year, one of your comments in your prepared remarks, Bob, was that you've permanently reduced the cost structure. Could you give us some flavor for what is structural reduction in cost and what is volume related?","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Oh, my goodness. So, let's see. How do I want to tackle that one, Brad? Let's \u2013 help me with the response here between manufacturing cost and SG&A.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","So for manufacturing cost, our restructuring activity, I think we're at a run rate now, an annualized run rate of $90 million or $94 million, is \u2013 am I right with that number?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","$92 million across all segments, yeah.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","And a significant chunk of that was not recognized for the entire year. We have about $45 million of that, that is a carryover into 2016.

Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","$35 million.","Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer","$35 million in SG&A, of which we would label about 18% to 20% of that as permanent. And it's that permanent part of SG&A that I add to the carryover from the manufacturing cost of about $40 million that gets me to the round number of about $50 million of benefits that we'll see in 2016 as we see these projects complete the annual cycle.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right.

Mr. Goldberg, please go ahead.","Paul Goldberg","Thank you, Kristen. Good morning and welcome to Dover\u2019s second quarter earnings call. With me today are Bob Livingston and Brad Cerepak.","Today\u2019s call will begin with some comments from Bob and Brad on Dover\u2019s second quarter operating and financial performance, and follow with our outlook for the remainder of 2016. We will then open the call up for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up.","Please note that our current earnings release, Form 10-Q, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website, dovercorporation.com.

We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement.","Also, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. We would also direct your attention to our website where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Livingston","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our second quarter results excluding deal costs and one-time items were generally in line with our expectations, but disappointing nonetheless.","Now, let me share some specific comments on the quarter. Within the quarter, our June revenue, earnings and bookings were significantly improved from April\u2019s results. We expect to see this positive momentum carry into the third quarter and give us confidence for an improved back-half of the year.","From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. activity remains solid and grew organically low-single-digits year over year. Our European markets were down sequentially and year over year on an organic basis. China improved sequentially, but remained down from the prior year. We continue to be challenge by weak energy market dynamics.","Though we believe that second quarter will mark the low-point of our 2016 performance in our Energy segment, our markets improved, albeit low April, as North American rig count modestly increased and the price of oil remained in the mid- to high-40s. While, the recent trend is encouraging year-over-year rig count and customer CapEx were still down substantially.","These factors drove our second quarter revenue down about 9% sequentially. This result was slightly better than expected as we continue to see the positive impact of our share gain initiatives.","Engineered Systems\u2019 organic growth was 2%. As the Printing & Identification platform had a very strong quarter posting organic growth of 9%. These outstanding results we\u2019re seeing both by our marking and coding, and digital textile equipment businesses. In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%. This result was primarily driven by environmental solutions due to some deferred activity and tough comps against a very strong second quarter of 2015.","Fluids posted 16% revenue growth, driven by several recent acquisitions. On an organic basis revenue declined 8%. Our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure, and those businesses serving integrated energy customers posted declines greater than we anticipated. Our businesses serving the hygienic and food, and pharma continued to show growth.","Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 1% organically, principally driven by increased volume in display and specialty cases with several retail refrigeration customers. In all, retail refrigeration grew 4% organically in the quarter. Our food equipment markets were mixed, where very weak results in our food processing business in Europe offset growth in other food equipment end-markets.","Regarding acquisitions, we have closed three deals this year, including Tokheim, and have signed an agreement to acquire Wayne, which we are very excited about. Our teams have been fully engaged planning the integration of Wayne and Tokheim, and the market response to the announcement has been positive.","We anticipate the transaction will close around the end of the third quarter. When Wayne closes we will have a $1.4 billion presence in the fuel distribution and retail fueling market, and be able to provide a unique product and service offering to our global customers. This deal along with others furthers our strategy to position Dover with a stronger long-term growth profile.","Now, looking forward, within Energy we are maintaining our full-year revenue guidance. We see modest sequential improvement, assuming current oil prices and the North America rig count stay constructive. Initially, we expect our artificial lift business will benefit from increased MRO activity at the well-site. We also believe an increased completion rate for drill, but uncompleted wells will continue, especially in lower cost basins like the Permian. In all, we expect second-half revenue to be about 2% higher than first-half revenue.","In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged. We expect the marking and coding business to grow mid-single-digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our industrial platform, we expect revenue in the second-half to be similar to the first-half.","Fluids decline in organic revenue will be more than offset by growth from acquisitions. In our current forecast, we have lowered the high-end of our organic revenue as a result of continued soft markets. We have also reduced our growth rate for Tokheim as China activity in volume and other emerging markets is expected to remain weak in the back-half of the year. We expect the solid growth we\u2019ve seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue.","Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment we are trimming the high-end of our full-year forecast for organic revenue growth. While our retail refrigeration business remains solid, driven by our leading technology and merchandising solutions, we anticipate can-shaping orders and shipments to push out over year-end. We have a strong backlog within retail refrigeration, and I\u2019m pleased we have made good progress in our productivity and efficiency initiatives.","In summary, I feel confident that our energy segment will show modest improvement in the back-half of the year. We expect our U.S. industrial markets to remain positive and for Europe and China to modestly improve.","Our pipeline remains active and we expect to announce a few additional deals before year-end. With respect to guidance, we are adjusting our full-year EPS guidance to $3.35 to $3.45, principally reflecting the impact of our full - of our reduced full-year revenue forecast and for deal cost in one-time items.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included in organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.76 including $0.04 of restructuring costs, deal costs of $0.02 and $0.04 of one-time items.","Segment margin for the quarter was 13.1%, 250 basis points below last year. Approximately half of the margin reduction was due to higher year-over-year restructuring deal costs and one-time items. Bookings decreased 2% from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX.","Organic bookings in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% each, overall book-to-bill finished at 1.01%. Our backlog decreased 6% to $1.1 billion and was down 1%, when excluding dispositions. Of note, backlog increased 2% sequentially, largely reflecting retail refrigeration activity.","Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter or 10% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion to net income benefited from actions to reduce working capital. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the year.","Now, turning to Slide 4, Engineered Systems increased organic revenue 2%, while Refrigeration & Food Equipment was up 1%, these increases reflects solid growth in Printing & Identification and in retail refrigeration. Fluids\u2019 organic decline of 8% was largely driven by oil and gas exposure. Energy organic decline was 28% driven by weak North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids with 24% growth.","Now on Slide 5, Energy revenue of $259 million decreased 29%. Earnings were impacted by restructuring cost of $6 million, as well as other one-time costs of $5 million from our decision to temporarily suspend production at several plants and $2 million in settlement costs. Adjusting for these items, earnings were $13 million and margin was 5% in the quarter.","This margin performance largely reflects significant volume declines and price reductions of approximately 2%. We expect $6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter, $3 million higher than our prior forecast for this segment. We continue to believe we can exit the year with margin near 10%. Bookings were $246 million and book-to-bill was 0.95.","Turning to Slide 6, Engineered Systems\u2019 revenue of $592 million was flat overall and included organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings of $104 million increased 8%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity, volume leverage and a favorable product mix.","Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $264 million increased 15%. Organic revenue was up 9% primarily reflecting strong global marking and coding, and digital printing equipment activity. Acquisitions added 8% growth, while FX was 2% negative.","In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined 10% to $329 million comprised of an organic decline of 2% and a 7% impact from dispositions. The organic revenue decline primarily reflected activity deferrals in tough comps in our environmental solutions business.","Margin was 17.6%, a 130 basis point improvement. Bookings of $571 million were up 2%, which included organic bookings growth of 4%. Organically, printing and identification bookings increased 14% and industrial bookings decreased 2%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01. Industrials book-to-bill of 0.93 reflects deferred order activity with environmental solutions. Overall book-to-bill was 0.96.","Now, moving to Slide 7, within Fluids, revenue increased 16% to $406 million, while earnings decreased 23% to $54 million. Revenue performance reflects 24% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by an 8% decline in organic revenue.","The organic decline was driven by our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure, lower spending in certain integrated energy customers, particularly retail fueling and project timing. This decline was partially offset by continued solid results in our hygienic and pharma markets.","Regarding acquisition growth, our retail fueling activity in China was weak, as were other emerging markets. Margin declined 670 basis points in the quarter, reflecting lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions, $4 million in deal costs and $3 million in incremental restructuring costs. Excluding acquisitions related deal costs and restructuring margin was 19.4%, a decrease of 80 basis points over an adjusted prior year.","Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 24%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis bookings declined 1%. Book-to-bill was 1.02.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8, Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s revenue of $429 million was down 4% overall and included organic revenue growth of 1%. Earnings of $63 million declined 4% from the prior year. Earnings were flat with last year after adjusting for our recent disposition. Organic revenue growth was largely driven by increased volume with several retail refrigeration customers, especially in the display and specialty case product lines. Within Food Equipment results were mixed.","Solid results in commercial food service and can shaping equipment were offset by weak European food processing equipment results. Margin was 14.7%, unchanged from last year. Bookings were $469 million, down 4%. This result includes 4% organic growth, offset by dispositions and FX. Organic growth was primarily driven by strong retail refrigeration bookings. Book-to-bill was a seasonally strong 1.09. Of note, book-to-bill for retail refrigeration was 1.13 as compared to 1.06 last year.","Going to the overview on Slide 9, let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million and net interest expense was $32 million, both largely in line with our expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.3% excluding discrete tax costs, slightly lower than our prior forecasted rate. CapEx was $35 million in the quarter.","Now, moving to Slide 10, which shows our full-year guidance, as Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted on the high-end to reflect reduced forecast for Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. We now expect total revenue to decrease 3% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 8% as compared to our prior forecast of down 5% to 8%. We expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX.","At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%, excluding restructuring and deal costs and one-time items. Corporate expense is now anticipated to be $108 million for the year, $12 million below our prior forecast on reduced spending. Our full year forecast for interest expense is unchanged and the pre-discrete tax rate has been slightly lowered to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%.","From a segment perspective, Energy and Engineered System\u2019s full-year organic revenue forecasts are unchanged from our prior guidance. Fluids\u2019 organic revenue has been reduced two points on the high-end, and now is forecasted to decline 4% to 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered one point at the high-end and now stands at 2% to 3%. The impact of acquisitions, dispositions, and FX remains unchanged.","Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11, let\u2019s start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We continue to expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring cost in 2016 to be $0.07. Performance including volume, productivity pricing and restructuring benefits will impact earnings $0.37 to $0.31. This is reduced $0.20 from our prior forecast and now includes $0.05 of deal costs and $0.04 of one-time costs.","Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.20 to $0.17, reflecting roughly $0.02 lower spend from our prior forecast. Acquisition plus dispositions will be about $0.12 accretive in total, $0.04 lower than our prior forecast, primarily driven by slower activity in China retail fueling markets and other emerging markets.","The combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate is about $0.06 better than our prior forecast, driven by reduced corporate expense and a slightly lower tax rate. Lastly, discrete tax benefits of $0.04 are included in our forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.35 to $3.45, down about $0.19 at the midpoint from our prior guidance.","Approximately, $0.09 of this reduction is attributable to deal costs and one-time cost, and a remainder is driven by a lower revenue forecast in Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, offset in part by lower corporate expense and a reduced tax rate.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Bob for some final comments.","Robert Livingston","Thanks, Brad. Let me share some summary comments, as we move into the back-half of our year. We saw a strong organic booking growth in Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, which sets them up well for their second-half revenue plan. In energy, we expect improved sequential performance driven by modestly improving markets, share gain initiatives and a reduced cost base. We also see a renewed focus on land-based drilling and production, especially in lower cost basins.","Within Fluids, second-half revenues will be up to seasonality in our retail fueling business and continued strength in our pharma and hygienic applications. We are excited about our growth and margin expansion opportunities in the retail fueling market, especially with the addition of Wayne.","I am pleased with the many positive changes we\u2019ve made to our business profile over the last few years. We now have several large businesses with global scale and you should expect us to continue the strategy of creating great businesses across our growth markets. In all, I believe we\u2019ll demonstrate much stronger performance in the second-half. We remain focused on improving our financial performance and increasing shareholder value.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers.","And now, Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Bob. Before we take the first question, I just like to remind you as a courtesy, we have several people in queue. So if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we\u2019ll be able to take more questions. And with that, Kirsten, if we can have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, our first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Andrew.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","I\u2019ve just a question and I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions from investors this morning on Energy. Can you just give us some more color as to what gives you reassurance? I mean, the book-to-bill is still below 1 on Energy. What gives you reassurances that things are in fact improving? And when do you think we\u2019re going to start seeing improved bookings? And just a follow-up, I\u2019ll to the follow-up right now, on Fluids, on pumps how bad is the weakness and how long do you think it will last? So these are my questions. Thank you.","Robert Livingston","All right, good. Energy, I think, we started to see the change in Energy in the second quarter, Andrew. There was - actually in my prepared comments, I made a comment that June was much stronger than April and that comment was across the board within Dover. But it was noticeably so within Energy.","Our upstream order activity and Energy in June was up 18% over April. And our expectation for the third quarter and Energy order rates here in the first two, three weeks of July, we\u2019re actually running slightly ahead of our third quarter forecast, especially in what we will label as the early cycle business activity around our rods and our ESP pumps.","We see the term and we feel fairly confident with our forecast for the second-half of the year. In fact, I would - I think another two or three weeks of order activity, like we\u2019ve seen in the past three weeks, maybe I would label the revenue and earnings forecast for Energy as having a little bit of upside for the year.","Andrew Obin","And on Fluids?","Robert Livingston","Fluids, the oil-and-gas hit is in our pumps business, and it\u2019s not just standard. For the most part we\u2019ve been dealing with declines in our standard pumps through distribution, which we continue to see a little bit of that here in the second quarter. It was a bit more than we expected. But the most significant thing in the second quarter was the loss of a - I will label it as an oil and gas project. We lost it on price and it was within our engineered pumps business group, not our standard pumps. It was a one-off order.","Andrew Obin","And do you have a sense how long you think - when do you think orders there start turning positive or could flatten out?","Robert Livingston","Yes, within the oil and gas piece of our Fluids that one is tough to call. If you look back at the - as our Energy cycle or as the Energy cycle started, we probably didn\u2019t see a measurable downturn in our pumps business for probably at least three months after we started to see the downturn in our Energy segment. If we truly are at a turning point here in the Energy cycle, Andrew, my best guess is we are not going to see much of a change in order activity within our pumps business related to oil and gas into early next year.","Andrew Obin","Terrific, thank you very much.","Robert Livingston","We are not forecasting anything, any pickup in our pumps business related to oil and gas in the second half, that\u2019s for sure.","Andrew Obin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Hey, Bob, maybe just a little more explanation on the thought process around the plant shutdowns you decided to do in Energy during the quarter. And then, I think, Brad said that you are ramping up the restructuring more of the third quarter. Yes, that sort of - in the same mix that you\u2019re sounding, you\u2019re sounding lot more positive on the market. So it seems like you\u2019re doing shutdowns and more restructuring, but believing in the turn, so may be reconcile those.","Robert Livingston","As we entered the second quarter, we did have additional restructuring plan, especially in our rods and our pump businesses around artificial lift. And as April unfolded, even though it was as bad as we expected, Shannon, we were sort of firming our opinion that we would see a turn here in the rig count, before the end of the second quarter. And we made a decision to hold the workforce intact in May and June instead of having employee separations.","We shut - I believe you know the count. I think it was at least four factories down for two weeks in the second quarter instead of employee separations. It did call some P&L charges to the quarter that we did not have in our initial forecast or planning, but I would tell you now, recognizing the change in the order rate activity during June, I\u2019m glad we made that decision, the restructuring that we have scheduled for the third quarter, and I think it\u2019s primarily in the third quarter, isn\u2019t it for Energy?","Brad Cerepak","Yes, in the third quarter, it\u2019s incrementally up $3 million in Energy, but in total.","Robert Livingston","In Energy, but it\u2019s in artificial lift interest\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Just in total for the company we\u2019re still forecasting the same level of total restructuring, but Energy is up. And, maybe, Bob, you want to\u2026","Robert Livingston","Yes. And the restructuring activity in the third quarter is not in artificial lift, it\u2019s in a couple of the other businesses. And, Shannon, I would - Brad, correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But I think the charges we have in the third quarter, we do expect the benefits in the second-half of 2016 to equal or be even better than the charges we take.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, just on Fluid margins, as we work up from kind of a 2Q level on Fluid margins to the back-half where do you see them going, I know the elimination of, I guess, the Wayne dale costs will be part of the lift. What else we have going on and what do you think Fluid margins look like for the year now?","Robert Livingston","So reported Fluid margins in the quarter were a little better than 13%, but if you adjust for - if you adjust for restructuring and some of our one-time cost, especially our deal cost that we had in the second quarter, it\u2019s 19%. It is interesting to still note, Shannon, that if we look at our core business. And now I\u2019m excluding our acquisitions that we\u2019ve added here over the past, over the past several months, our core business excluding restructuring and one-time cost was 19.4%. And our forecast for the year in this segment on the same basis - just looking at the core, the margins on our core business, excluding deal cost, 19.9%, almost 20%.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","And then, what you think it is going to look like kind of on a reported basis at this point?","Robert Livingston","All cost in 16% - 15.5% to 16%.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Sorry to just belabor this, so the deal costs go away versus 2Q when you\u2019re at 13.3%, what else lifts you from 13% up to, say, like high-teens in the back-half all in?","Robert Livingston","Shannon, a big change in the second-half with respect to Fluids is volume improvement. You\u2019re going to have to help me here, Brad, with the number, but I think the volume increase in the second-half over the first-half. And I don\u2019t have it compared to the second quarter, but I\u2019m just doing second-half versus first-half. I think the volume improvement is about a $100 million, maybe even slightly more than that, but rough number $100 million.","And that\u2019s driven by the normal seasonality we\u2019re expecting in our retail fueling business and continued strength in our hygienic and Pharma markets. And we do have a change here in the second-half. We feel like we\u2019ve got the benefit of some favorable product mix in the second-half. We\u2019re going to have very good conversion on this volume in the second-half.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay. Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thank you.","Robert Livingston","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, just a question on overall on organic sales growth, so organic sales fell about 7% in the first-half, the year as a whole implies down 7% for the second-half. But you talked about a big or a - or a meaningful sort of delta across the board in June relative to April. So I\u2019m just trying to understand why there is no improvement in sales given an easier comp in the back-half?","Robert Livingston","Well, that answer maybe starts and ends with a comment on Energy. Even though, sequentially we are forecasting a very modest improvement in Energy. Our organic revenue in the second-half within our Energy segment is still down 19% versus last year.","Julian Mitchell","Okay. And then secondly, within Fluids, on the booking side bookings have been sort of flattish organically, but our six months the organic sales worse than that. So maybe just give us a little bit of insight into how much of Fluids is sort of book and ship, and how much visibility the recent bookings give you on the three to six months sales looking out?","Robert Livingston","Sure, if I define book and ship, let\u2019s say, bookings that ship within 90 days, not necessarily within 30 days, my guess would be, Julian, that 75% of Fluids bookings would fall into the book and ship category, book and ship within 90 days. We did see a significant increase in bookings within this segment, as we moved through the quarter.","In fact, the - we started to see, it was a bit late. We actually started - we actually expected to see this in May and it didn\u2019t happen. But the June order rates within Fluids were up 13% or 14% versus April. And this is the start of our seasonal period within retail Fueling and we expect to see that continue.","I\u2019d add a little bit of extra color. If we look at the order rates for the first two to three weeks of July, across the board our order rates are very supportive of our third quarter forecast.","Julian Mitchell","Very helpful, thank you.","Robert Livingston","We will see a significant increase in retail fueling business activity in the second-half.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie","Thank you. Maybe just following upon\u2026","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie","Hey, good morning. Maybe just following up on that last point on the expectation for a big increase in the second-half of the year, you took Tokheim forecast for the year. I\u2019m just curious - give maybe a little bit more color Tokheim. Does that have negative implications for Wayne? And what is - why do you believe that we are going to see a pickup in the second-half in retail fueling?","Robert Livingston","Well, number one on Tokheim, the reduction in our revenue forecast for Tokheim for the year is almost exclusively China. I think it\u2019s, what was it? $14 million is our reduction in the Tokheim revenue forecast. And, Joe, I think we\u2019ve got 12 of that.","Brad Cerepak","12 of it is China.","Robert Livingston","\u2026is China. We expect Europe to exhibit the normal seasonality that historically has been seen in this market. And our second quarter order activity reflects that. In fact, I think our European dispenser order rates in the second quarter, especially in June were quite strong with Tokheim. And I think even for the entire second quarter dispenser bookings - dispenser book-to-bill I think was 1.2.","Brad Cerepak","It was 1.2.","Robert Livingston","\u2026for the second quarter. We are at the front-end of that build in the seasonal ramp in the retail fueling business.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie","Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe, I guess, switching gears, my second question on Energy. The expectation that we could do double-digit - exit the year with double-digit margins, maybe kind of talk me through some of the puts and takes on the restructuring side, because it seems like you\u2019re implying some pretty low detrimentals to exit the year at that rate, even if organic growth is slightly better. So I\u2019m just kind of curious on how we\u2019re getting there?","Robert Livingston","You want to help me with this one, Brad? The plan - what is in our plan and our guidance right now are operating margins within the Energy segment, I think of 9.7% or 9.8% for the fourth quarter. Am I correct?","Brad Cerepak","Yes, yes.","Robert Livingston","Okay. Almost 10%, as I shared in my comments. And we are be - I think we are actually being cautious with this. We are not baking into our expectations, our forecast. I would say the traditional incremental margins that we see on increased revenue within Energy, we have some businesses that have traditionally incrementaled up - converted up, very, very strongly. I think our conversion that we are using in the second-half of the year I think it\u2019s in the low-30s - 32% or 34%.","Traditionally that would\u2019ve been 40%, if not, a bit higher. I think we\u2019re being cautious with respect to anticipating continuing price pressures. And perhaps a little bit of uncertainty as to which product lines actually see the uptick in revenue in the second-half. It is worth noting that here early in July, and I\u2019m repeating myself, we are seeing some - we\u2019re seeing the order rates in our rods business and our ESP pump business come in a bit stronger than our third quarter forecast.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, and, Joe, I guess what I would add to that is first-half restructuring in DE is about $12 million of cost. Second-half we\u2019re looking at half of that, most of that being in the third quarter. With respect to benefits though, benefits are also doubling themselves into the back-half of year. So the first-half benefits on restructurings, moving into the back-half give us strength into the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s also helping us in our view that we can get to 10% margins.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie","Got it, so basically you\u2019re going to hold - you\u2019re going to try to hold margins year-over-year. I mean, organic growth is still going to be negative in the fourth quarter. But the restructuring benefit should help offset. Is that fair?","Brad Cerepak","That\u2019s correct.","Robert Livingston","Yes. Correct.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.","Robert Livingston","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. Hey, hello, could we just touch on price a little bit more? I think they\u2019re down too, that you mentioned, Bob, is in the zone relative to what you were expecting for the year. A little bit of erosion from Q1 and your comment in Q1 was interesting that you thought price wasn\u2019t worse, because there is not enough demand for people to you see any elasticity and therefore why cut price.","I just wonder now if you\u2019re seeing this little pulse of activity how people are behaving on price perhaps it\u2019s too earlier really know.","Robert Livingston","Yes, it\u2019s too early to answer that one, because I would say the pulse in activity is about six weeks old, Jeff. I\u2019ll give you a comp. I think our negative price in the first quarter within Energy for the segment was just a hair under 1%. In the second quarter, it\u2019s a full 2%.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes.","Robert Livingston","But it wasn\u2019t - I don\u2019t think it was any different in June than it was in April. Okay, that\u2019s getting to the heart of your question.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes. And I think you were seeing much that minus 1 or 90 basis points whatever it was in Q1 reflected I think high-single-digits declines in rods and maybe parts of the ESP business. Is that not\u2026","Robert Livingston","And our diamond inserts.","Jeffrey Sprague","Diamond inserts?","Robert Livingston","Yes.","Jeffrey Sprague","I\u2019m sure you had a chance to look or listen to Halliburton yesterday, their comment that 900 is the new 2000 as it relates to absorbing horsepower in the rig count. Some of what they said may not be totally analogous to you. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re familiar with what they said. But how do you respond to that?","Obviously, part of what they\u2019re saying is longer depths and the like, which would apply you, some of it is pumping more sand, which probably doesn\u2019t. But is there anything you could share with us in terms of Dover value per rig or any changes in kind of the mix of your business that may kind of soften that direct correlation to the rig-count that we\u2019re seeing historically.","Robert Livingston","Near term, I don\u2019t think there is, Jeff. I think for the next couple or three quarters you\u2019re going to see especially - again, especially within our upstream business activity you\u2019re going to continue to see a pretty high correlation with rig count. The longer laterals do benefit us with respect to rods and the pricing around some of our pumps. And I think it will also benefit us. We may not see it right away, but I think it will benefit us with respect to our automation business.","Jeffrey Sprague","Then just one last one, you probably have little more real-time data than I do, but kind of the commentary around the ducks, [ph] what I had heard, there is just really not any major change in kind of the uncompleteds out there. Are you in fact starting to see that, perhaps that\u2019s more in the data in the last month or so?","Robert Livingston","Yes, and I would - you are correct. I would say it\u2019s all within the last month there. The change in June wasn\u2019t stark, but what there was a rate change in June. And I think - I have, I commented this in my prepared comments. I think we will see increased activity around well completions in the second-half.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right, thank you very much guys.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, due to time restraints, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","Good morning.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Winoker","You maybe just - I just wanted to follow-up one of those earlier points. You\u2019ve got, I recall $95 million or so projected savings in 2016 from restructuring. How far through are you? And you still see that as the number?","Robert Livingston","You\u2019re going to help me on this one, Brad.","Brad Cerepak","I would say, okay, so $95 million. That $95 million has increased since our last discussion on this topic. So I would say at this point we\u2019re about $10 million higher. And remember in the $95 million there is carryover in that number, but which completely from 2015. But in terms of our restructuring we expect to have the 2016 action substantially complete here early in the third quarter. And the benefits flowing through in our P&L this year, again I was talking Energy before between first half, second-half.","If I look at the total company incrementally new benefits over the carryover that number again in first-half doubles itself into the back-half. So we had - think about it this way, we probably had $20 million of savings in the first-half, we\u2019ll see $40 million plus in the back-half of savings plus the incremental piece get you the - let\u2019s call it $105 million, roughly speaking, benefits.","Steve Winoker","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, could you maybe talk a little bit more about, I guess, let\u2019s say, something positive here around Wayne. You laid out for some high-level expectations earlier, when you announced the transaction dilutive in 2016, modestly accretive in 2017, and more accretive in 2018, I guess, the EBITDA in the 130 range including run rate synergies. You have any more clarity around what you\u2019re expecting there, early view, maybe even down in EPS, any thoughts? I\u2019m going to try.","Robert Livingston","Before Brad answers you, I think he is prepared to, let me tell you that even though we believe right now we can close this in the third quarter that\u2019s not entirely under our control. And it is possible that this moves into the early fourth quarter as a close and that will have depending upon the quarter, even though it may only be three or four weeks difference that that will have a bit of an impact on the - impact it has on our results in 2016.","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Robert Livingston","Now with that qualifier - but there are lots of qualifiers here, Steve.","Brad Cerepak","But let me start by saying that when we talked about - let me just clarify the P&L that we have, the forecast that we currently give you here in this update. It includes deal costs in the second and third quarter in our Fluids business, which we highlighted that\u2019s all related to Wayne.","What we don\u2019t have in our forecast, is any contingent upon completion costs, which will come at the time we complete the deal. If we complete the deal at the end of the third quarter here going into the fourth quarter, we feel pretty confident with the numbers that we had previously stated about the amount of sales that they expect for 2016. We said 550. I think they are actually right on that number to doing quite well, quite frankly.","So without giving a lot of details around seasonality, if you took one fourth of that number, and then you looked at deal costs and amortization step-ups and the like, our view is it will be in the fourth quarter, incremental to the forecast we just gave you, dilutive, because of again finalization of deal costs, amortization step-ups hitting the P&L, positive operationally. But after those costs dilutive and then of course you would have the funding costs or the interest costs associated with the purchase price of $780 million that would also hit the P&L in the fourth quarter.","Steve Winoker","Okay, okay. And Bob, your comments, are you saying, you weren\u2019t saying it\u2019s more likely it\u2019s going to hit the fourth quarter, you\u2019re just saying possible.","Robert Livingston","No, right now our opinion is that it could close in the third quarter. I\u2019m just repeating myself, we don\u2019t control that.","Steve Winoker","Yes. Okay, thank you, guys.","Robert Livingston","We are fully prepared for it to move into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.","Stephen Tusa","Hi, hey, good morning.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Tusa","So just to be clear on what you\u2019re saying on this Fluids stuff, to get to a 15%, close to a 16% margin, that implies something in kind of the - I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s kind of the second-half total profit number? I mean, I have $100 million to start with here in the first-half. Typically over the last three years pretty consistently you\u2019ve been up, half-over-half around high-single-digit.","This would seem to be a more dramatic type of increase. I mean, almost like I don\u2019t know, almost 650 to $60 million maybe $70 million bucks. I mean, I\u2019m just kind of struggling with, why you have this kind of confidence?","Robert Livingston","All cost in - you are using all cost in as opposed to adjusted numbers. So our revenue we\u2019re looking in a better $100 million revenue increase in the second half. And, yes, you are correct, the earnings increase in the second half is just about $60 million.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. And you\u2019re saying that is for a Tokheim business that is underperforming, you\u2019re saying that\u2019s on kind of an organic basis, that\u2019s the retail fueling business?","Robert Livingston","That\u2019s the Tokheim European activity that we expect to be much stronger in the second half and a significant increase in the OPW business with respect to retail fueling in the second half. And the absence of some charges that we had in the first half that aren\u2019t repeating.","Stephen Tusa","But you do have some deal charges in Wayne, I mean is it R&D take more deal charges in Wayne in the second-half as well?","Robert Livingston","We - I think, we have, what, $3 million to $4 million?","Brad Cerepak","We are, Steve, but we did have from the original Tokheim deal, we had rollover of these inventory step ups\u2026","Stephen Tusa","From all the acquisitions?","Brad Cerepak","And all the acquisitions, Gavorez, [ph] all that in the first half, they don\u2019t repeat itself. So the standard amortization stays in place in the second half, but that big inventory rollover is gone, as is restructuring - restructuring in the second half is less than the first half. But you are right, deal costs for Wayne first half to second half in the forecast is basically the same number.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. Is Tokheim on it kind of a run rate basis is Tokheim making money on common all-in, including the amortization that kind of stuff?","Robert Livingston","Including amortization in the first half, I think it was slightly better than breakeven, and the loses which we took, the charges we took in China. And the second quarter, I don\u2019t have - the second quarter was when we made the transition. And we started to see the improved activity at Tokheim, I think it was in May. Steve, the Tokheim, I think 80% of our earnings for Tokheim are actually in the second half of the year.","Brad Cerepak","But after the amortization, the answer is, yes, it is possible, it is accretive.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. And then one last question just on energy. What you see the third quarter being there from a margin perspective?","Robert Livingston","Oh, goodness. I don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s less than the - it\u2019s less than our forecast for the fourth quarter\u2026","Brad Cerepak","It\u2019s kind of linear, it\u2019s linear\u2026","Robert Livingston","So you got the back-end to that, yes.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, it\u2019s linear coming out of the second quarter.","Robert Livingston","5% to 7%.","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Good morning. Hi.","Robert Livingston","Hi Nigel.","Nigel Coe","So just wanted to I mean, cover obviously lot of the major topics. Just wanted to dig into Engineered Systems, the strength in P&I, that\u2019s normally pretty steady business, so the strength you called out is a bit surprising, especially given the underlying production backdrop. So just maybe, Bob, Brad, if you could just address that, maybe throw in color on new products, market share gains et cetera.","Robert Livingston","Yes. Well, the product ID had a very strong quarter Nigel, thank you. The core business, the business we\u2019ve owned for a long time our marking and coding business, help me here with my recall, I think organic growth for the quarter was 6%.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, 5%, 6%.","Robert Livingston","That was strong, but we\u2019ve been working lot of issues there over the last year or so and we\u2019ve seen a lot of improvements in the business. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color on the marking and coding business beyond that. Sequentially, the business was up I think, 8% or 9% coming out of the first quarter. Nigel, it\u2019s around the world with the exception of China. It\u2019s around the world with the exception of China.","In fact, organic growth for the marking and coding business may have actually been higher in Europe in the second quarter than it was here in the States, which is a bit of a change. But our - we had very strong organic growth here in North America. I think, organic growth in Europe may have been 7% or 8%. And we saw it in both increased sales of equipment as well as consumables. And I would also say it continued to build through the quarter.","Nigel Coe","But I\u2019m assuming the underlying market is not growing.","Robert Livingston","But what looks - pardon?","Nigel Coe","So I\u2019m assuming the underlying market is not growing at those kinds of levels, so I\u2019m just wondering what drove the up-movements [ph].","Robert Livingston","We view the underlying market that this business is serving with a growth of about 3%.","Nigel Coe","Okay, okay. And then you mentioned the environmental solutions business down some deferrals there. Waste management at the well [and the pumps at the well] [ph] is doing quite well right now. So I\u2019m just wondering if you have any context on why there might be some deferrals. And maybe just remind us, how does this business cycle with the broader truck cycle.","Robert Livingston","I\u2019m not sure I have a correlation for you with respect to the broader truck cycle. And my opinion would be that it\u2019s not very highly correlated financial.","In fact, I would tell you that when the truck cycle is up it does create some challenges for our business in just getting customer deliveries on time. The second quarter - we expect to see growth in this business for the year. We expect to see growth in the industrial platform in the year. I think we have a schedule or planned it at 2%. We saw some projects slip out from the second quarter into the balance of the year.","I wouldn\u2019t label it as slip or slips or deferrals with the two major haulers, but more with municipalities, and a recent acquisition with two of the smaller players - a recent merger of two of the smaller players.","Nigel Coe","Okay, okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. But I almost understand it. I can\u2019t agree with the second-half versus first-half. And I believe we can\u2019t get the $100 million of sales ramp up, but we\u2019ll follow-up offline. Thanks, guys.","Robert Livingston","Okay.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we had now exceeded our allotted time for Q&A. And it\u2019s my pleasure to hand our program back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Yes, thank you very much for joining us for the second quarter earnings call. In advance, I\u2019ll apologize for any people who didn\u2019t get on. We tried to get more calls on, but they kind of dragged on a little bit. So I will follow up with you later in the quarter and we look forward to talking to you in the third quarter. Thanks a lot. Bye.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's call will begin with some comments from Bob and Brad on Dover's second quarter operating and financial performance and follow with our outlook for the balance of 2012. We will then open up the call for questions.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our second quarter results, I would like to share a few observations on the changes we saw in the macro environment during the quarter.","We entered the second quarter knowing, we were dealing with some modest challenges in Europe and a slowing economy in China. The decline in Europe was greater than our expectations. These weaker conditions were felt most notably within our Fluids platform and our Printing & Identification segment.","With respect to China, we experienced some of the effects of a slowing export market in a few of our businesses. Our U.S. markets held quite well, namely, refrigeration and food equipment, industrial, energy, commercial aerospace and life sciences.","Now, let me provide some comments on our second quarter results. We posted revenue of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8%. Our second quarter EPS of $1.15 was a slight improvement over the prior year adjusted EPS.","In our Energy segment, we continued to see growth across our end markets with production in downstream being the strongest. As a result, we posted strong organic revenue growth in the quarter.","As I have shared with you before, while rig count has flattened, market dynamics provide a solid environment for our products and services. These dynamics include the ongoing shift from gas to oil, oil prices supporting continued CapEx for production and a strengthening downstream market. We expect Energy results to remain solid for the balance of the year.","At our Communication Technology segment, we saw the continuation of a strong smartphone market as well as solid commercial aerospace and life science markets. Telecom markets remained weak.","The highway was 25% organic growth in our MEM sales to the handset market in the second quarter and we expect even stronger MEMS performance in the second half. Although results at Sound Solutions continue to be significantly impacted by further OEM share shifts, I was especially encouraged by increasing order rates on new design wins in the quarter and expect shipments at Sound Solutions to accelerate through the second half.","Within our Engineered Systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets were solid as were most of our U.S. industrial end markets.","Regarding our Fluids platform. The strong start for Maag Pump was offset by a weaker Europe and China. The result for this segment was lower than anticipated revenue in fluids, largely offset by 8% revenue growth in refrigeration and food equipment.","Going forward, we believe second half results in refrigeration will remain solid on the strength of an active remodeling market, our leading technology and our customers' continued focus on energy efficiency. Our U.S. industrial markets which account for 65% of segment revenue should be rather stable.","Within our Printing & Identification segment, we continue to see a weak, but improving market for electronics equipment. Within our consumer goods and industrial markets, our focus on new products, channel expansion and service is making a difference.","Markem-Imaje this results in a 5% organic growth excluding the impact of currency, a strong result in North America and modest growth in China offset a weak Europe.","We expect improved results in the back half of the year driven by new product launches, normal seasonality and the benefits of our first half restructuring activities. Overall, the strength of our businesses enabled Dover to deliver segment margin of 16.7% in the quarter, inclusive of $11 million of restructuring and deal cost. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of 0.99.","I was pleased with our free cash flow generation in the second quarter as it improved 30% over the prior year period. Our teams continue to focus on working capital management and lean activity.","Our acquisition pipeline remains active and we remain highly disciplined on valuation. The opportunities in front of us are all strategic add-ons, highly synergistic and offer strong integration opportunities.","In summary, I believe our second half will be stronger than the first as revenue in our handset businesses will be up significantly. I also expect solid contribution from our businesses serving the oil production, downstream energy, fast-moving consumer goods and U.S. industrial markets.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion comprised of 3% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, offset in part by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.","Earnings per share was $1.15. This result was below our expectations, primarily due to a $0.07 impact from a weaker Europe and unfavorable foreign exchange.","After adjusting for $0.12 of tax benefit in the second quarter of 2011, EPS improved 1% over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.7%, a decline of 140 basis points. This result reflects solid performance in energy offset by lower volume in Printing and identification, volume declines and cost associated with new design wins at Sound Solutions and mix within Engineered Systems.","We also absorbed nearly $11 million of restructuring and deal cost in the quarter. Absent these costs, segment margin would have been 17.2%. Bookings increased 9% over last year to $2.1 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in energy and communication technologies and a solid growth in Engineered Systems.","In Printing and Identification, bookings decreased 7%, or stable order rates in our consumer goods markets were offset by tough comps in our electronics markets. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.99. Backlog grew 12% to $1.7 billion.","In the second quarter, we generated $178 million of free cash flow or 8% of revenue, an increase of $45 million over the prior year. We expect free cash flow for the year to be around 10% of revenue.","Now turning to Slide 4, which shows our revenue growth. Organic growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 14% in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies, both grew by 4% driven by refrigeration and food equipment, commercial aerospace and handset markets. Printing and Identification was down 10%.","For the quarter, acquisition growth at Communication Technologies was 22%. Energy and Engineered Systems, both posted acquisition growth of 6% led by our recently completed deals PCS, and Maag, respectively.","Turning to slide five and our sequential results. Revenue increased 5% from the first quarter with all four segments showing sequential growth. Engineered systems increased 8%, primarily driven by refrigeration, food equipment and acquisitions.","Printing and Identification increased 5% with all markets except the silver portion of electronics showing sequential improvement. Communication Technologies and Energy, both increased 1%. In Energy, production in downstream markets performed well, sequentially.","Bookings decreased 2%, sequentially from the first quarter. Growth of 7% at Communication technologies was led by the handset market. Sequential bookings growth of 3% at Printing and Identification was broad based.","Engineered Systems' bookings declined 3%, sequentially, largely impacted by the timing of refrigeration orders and continued weakness in the refuse vehicle portion of our industrial markets. Energy bookings declined 9%, primarily driven by moderating North American rig count, Canadian spring thaw and large international orders in the first quarter.","Now on slide six. Communication technologies posted revenue of $362 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. These results reflect strong MEMS, commercial aerospace and life sciences activities partially offset by weak telecom markets.","Sound Solutions volume accounted for 22 points of the revenue growth. Earnings of $50 million were down 8% and segment margin was 13.9%, a decrease of 500 basis points. Adjusting for Sound Solutions, margin would have been 20.8% in the quarter.","We continue to expect segment margin to improve in the second half on the anticipated benefits of higher volume. Bookings were 383 million, an increase of 24%. This growth was largely driven by our handset market book-to-bill finished at 1.06.","Now, turning to slide seven. Energy revenue increased 19% to $539 million, while earnings increased 21% to $134 million. Energy produced another strong quarter as the average North American rig count was up 6% from last year and oil prices remained constructive for continued production.","Although rig count remained flat sequentially, we continue to benefit from several factors, including approximately 70% of active rigs dedicated to oil as well as a solid downstream market. As was the case last quarter, we saw year-over-year growth across all end markets led by production.","Operating margin was 24.9%, a 60 basis point improvement from last year. Bookings were 530 million, a 12% increase over the prior year book-to-bill was 0.98.","Now on Slide 8. Engineered Systems sales were $886 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Earnings improved 4% to $134 million. Fluid Solutions grew 19% to 212 million, benefitting from recent acquisitions while Refrigeration Industrial grew 4% to $675 million.","In our Fluids platform organic revenue was down 4%, due primarily to a weaker Europe. Operating margin was 15.1%, a decrease of 50 basis points from the prior year. This performance included roughly 100 basis points of incremental acquisition and amortization costs. Bookings were 870 million, an increase of 9% resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98.","Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 16% to $204 million, while Refrigeration Industrial was up 7% to $666 million. Book-to-bill for Fluid solutions was 0.96, and Refrigeration Industrial was 0.99.","Bookings at Fluids Solutions included 21% acquisition growth while Refrigeration Industrial was principally led by our businesses serving food, equipment and U.S. industrial markets.","Now, let's turn to Slide 9. Printing and Identification revenue was $370 million, a decrease of 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 39% to $42 million. The revenue decline reflects the expected continued weakness in our electronics' markets as compared to a very strong prior year, a weak Europe as well as unfavorable foreign exchange.","The solar and semi exposure of our electronics market now about 16% of revenue was down approximately $47 million year-over-year. That aside our consumer goods and industrial markets continued to perform well. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth and consumer goods and industrial end markets was 5%.","Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 11.3%, reflecting significantly lower volume in electronics and $5 million of restructuring cost and continued strategic investments. The restructuring actions taken in the quarter are to better align our global footprint with higher growth geographic markets.","Also, our investments in sales and service are yielding benefits in the form of year-over-year growth in North America and Asia. Bookings were $358 million, a decrease of 7% from last year. In the consumer goods and industrial markets, bookings increased 3%, book-to-bill ended at 0.97.","Now on Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were generally in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.5%. This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast and largely impacted by mix of geographic earnings.","Now, turning to Slide 11, and our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of 8% to 10%. Organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5%, and completed acquisitions adding around 5%.","Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be 17% to 18% for the year about five percentage points lower than our last guidance. This forecast is comprised of 7% to 8% organic growth and 10% from acquisitions. The main drivers of this revision are primarily OEM share shifts and timing of orders at Sound Solutions.","Energy growth is expected to be in the range of 15% to 16%. Organic growth is largely unchanged at 10% to 11%. Acquisition growth will be around 5%.","Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow 9% to 10%. Organic growth is down roughly 1.5 points to 3% to 4% from our prior guidance on a weaker Europe and a slowing China market, acquisitions at 6%.","Lastly, in Printing and Identification, a weak Europe including unfavorable foreign exchange and a more conservative outlook on electronics is driving our organic revenue forecast down six points. We now expect revenue to decline 7% to 8.5% as compared to the prior year.","Moving onto slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx remain substantially unchanged. We now expect our 2012 tax rate to be around 27%.","Based on the above, we expect full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.70 to $4.85. This guidance reflects a $0.125 reduction from our prior forecast at mid-point. This change primarily reflects a $0.15 reduction related to Europe, China and unfavorable foreign exchange.","Now, let's turn to the earnings bridge on slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of discrete tax benefits. Volume mix and price will contribute roughly $0.28 to $0.37 for the full year while net productivity will add $0.22 to $0.32.","Investment and compensation is now $0.08 to $0.14, reduced by $0.11 from our forecast. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.03 to $0.05 for the year, down from our prior forecast. This revision largely reflects the timing of orders and OEM share shifts at Sound Solutions.","Interest expense, share count and our tax rate should yield a $0.01 benefit, down slightly from our prior forecast, largely driven by slightly higher tax rate. The net result is EPS growth of 12% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the mid-point.","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments.","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Brad. As I mentioned upfront, I am convinced that our second half will be stronger than our first half. Our participation in the handset market, our production in downstream energy businesses and our businesses serving the vast moving consumer goods and U.S. industrial markets will lead the way.","I expect Dover's second half revenue to be up about 7%, sequentially, and anticipate solid leverage on the increased volume. As always, our teams are focused on programs and initiatives to reduce cost and increase productivity.","As I look beyond 2012, I remain confident in our positions and our five key growth basis. I am convinced our play and the energy, fluids, refrigeration and food equipment, product identification and communication components offer growth opportunities built on technology leadership, geographic expansion and commitment to our customers.","In closing, I would like to thank our entire Dover teams for their hard work and dedication. Their focus on servicing customers and achieving results will continue to drive Dover's success.","With that, Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thank, Bob. Before we take questions, I just want to remind everybody if can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we'll be better able to get more questions.","So with that, Jacquie, can we have our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Guys, I know this is kind of a tough question to answer I am guessing. But, when you look at Comm Tech. and your book-to-bill 1.06. I mean, how do you see that kind of guessing that's a little bit better than you thought it would be for the quarter, but when you think about 3Q, is this something that ramps up and continues to improve from here and to what magnitude do you think?","Bob Livingston","Well, the driver in the second half is going to be very similar to what we saw driving the strong book-to-bill in the second quarter and it is going to be around our handset business both, Knowles and Sound Solutions. Maybe Brad has the number. I can't recall what the book-to-bill is in the second half for our handset business, but I know it's very positive.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. When you think about Sound Solutions, I mean at what point do you call a text, I guess or how close are we to that?","Bob Livingston","Well, I'm not going to label it fixed until we are performing like we expected this business to perform at the time of the acquisition, so I think you are going to see some trends here in the second half of the year with a much stronger fourth quarter than third quarter. It is going to accelerate during the second half.","Brad can probably correct me here on my answer, but I think sequentially as we look at Sound Solutions coming out of the second quarter, the revenue expectations in the third quarter are up about 20% to 25%, and another sequential improvement in revenue in the fourth quarter of additional 20% to 25%. And, Scott, I think by the time we get to the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we are going to start to see the operating margins of this business set the base for what we will expect in 2013, which I think will be very reflective of the business performance on this business that we expected when we made the acquisition, so you asked a very important question had we seen the trough. I think we have.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Fair enough. Good answer. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Robert W. Baird.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","Good morning, guys.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Bob.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","I'm just a little bit confused about the components of the change and outlook of communications technology. The 11 to 13 that goes down to 7 to 8, how much of that is a function of more adverse currency translation and how much of that is the change in the actual organic outlook?","Brad Cerepak","I would say, you are talking about Comm Tech in particular, it's very negligible, very small impact in currency in that particular segment or segments on currency that impacted the most are DBS and DPI, on foreign currency. The whole move down on DZT is really related to Sound Solutions.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","Okay. As opposed to, in terms of its organic contribution, second half of the year.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah. Exactly. As you know, when we turned the first year of ownership, we put it into organic, so we are seeing now our last forecast the decline in Sound Solutions of approximately let's say $80 million in the second half, and the way to think about that, we've been chasing no key and rimmed down the whole year, big share of that over 50% of that revised forecast is due to continue what we call these OEM share shifts, where we are seeing losses of volume, continued loses in volume in Nokia and RIM and some other smaller handset providers.","Then again, the other piece of that is really timing related to how we see the launch coming now as we are in launch in phase and how we see that launch progressing the third quarter into the fourth.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Then again, in terms of the actual blocking and tackling. My recollection is that you expected to bring two of the new lines up in the quarter and it would leave you one more to do in the third? Do I have that right and are we still on that track? And, is there any change in progress just in terms of executing the transition of manufacturing?","Bob Livingston","I would label this after quarter as being successful at Sound Solutions with respect to our automation projects. It actually may be signed off today, Rob, by the time we closed the month of July, we will have five of our new lines not just turned over to manufacturing, but signed off on by our customers. Pretty good.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","Okay.","Bob Livingston","So, I am very positive with the progress we made in the second quarter on that activity.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Then if I can follow-up. Just two quickly in terms of Printing and ID, I think I got the message that your outlook in fast-moving consumer goods is essentially unchanged. A quarter ago, you were talking about expectations for high single digit growth there. Except any impact from currency has that changed any material way?","Bob Livingston","My answer is no. Brad may have something more definitive, but the impact you are seeing is primarily FX.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","In the shortfall it's concentrated in the electronic sector. I understood that. I just want to make sure that your outlook for fast moving consumer good was essentially unchanged.","Bob Livingston","Essentially unchanged.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Wondering if you could just put a final point on a couple of points, I'd appreciate the info so far, so if we think about Nokia and RIM coming down about.","Brad Cerepak","Jeff, come a little closer to the phone.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Can you hear me little better now?","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Can you give us a sense of where Nokia and RIM are now or what percent of your handset sales?","Brad Cerepak","No. I can't give you an exact number. I do know that it's less than 20% in the second half. I don't think it's less than 15%, so I am giving you a range. It's between 15% and 20%, but I actually don't know the exact number, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","That's the second half.","Brad Cerepak","Second half. And, if I had to take a guess on this, I am doing some recall here. If I need to take a guess for the second quarter, it was probably high teens.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay. Maybe those teens in Q2, it probably should be lot more in 15% to 20% in the second half, right?","Bob Livingston","It might be closer to the 15 number, Jeff. I know it's less than 20.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Then if we think about what you expect for ongoing profitability for Sound Solutions. If even margins were 20-ish in 2011, clearly you would have expected the margins to come down on investment spending, purchase accounting and all those sorts of things but just remind us where you do think Sound Solutions' margins can kind of normalize once you get on the other side of this investment spend and this remixing of the portfolio is behind you.","Bob Livingston","We are still convinced that once we get into a steady state with this business that our operating margin should be in the mid-20s. I think help me here, Brad. I think as we look at the second half of 2012, the outlook we have now for the fourth quarter, the operating margins are probably going to be in the mid-to-high teens. I think Brad wants to clarify.","Brad Cerepak","Mid-teens in the second half, and I would just want to clarify that when Bob says operating EBIT, that's creating the step-ups.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And then finally, what are you thinking on share purchase? Obviously, unfortunately the stock has not been great this year. You've got a lot of liquidity. It doesn't look like you did anything in Q2 and as it was late in the quarter, what's your thought process there?","Brad Cerepak","It's a discussion topic, but I have nothing to announce, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Morning, Terry.","Brad Cerepak","Morning, Terry.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Bob or Brad, I wonder if you talk about the second half organic revenue growth outlook for the energy division. I think the guidance might imply 4% or 5% year-over-year growth. I wonder if you can give us a little color by drilling production downstream on that assumption and then also given the book-to-bill is sub-1, why do you think we can get some positive organic growth in the second half?","Bob Livingston","Brad may have the year-over-year comps for the second half. What's forefront in my thinking is right now is sequentially, so let me response sequentially.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Bob Livingston","With the three sectors, drilling, production then downstream. Drilling, I hope we are being conservative, but we are actually putting in into the guidance that our drilling activity will be down in the second half versus the first half modestly. I think 2% or 3%.","Production remains fairly strong, Terry. I don't remember now what the number is, but I think it's about 8% second half over the first half in production. Some of that is through the benefit of the acquisition we made in, what was it? I guess, April of PCS, and some of the big chunk of the growth in the second half is actually from our international activity. Downstream, I think that's also about 8% or 9% sequential growth in the second half. Strong activity in downstream right now.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","And what is the book-to-bill sub-1 worry a little bit with regards to the overall total organic outlook in the second half? Is there more production in downstream business? It just doesn't run through the orders in the backlog, or is it something else?","Bob Livingston","I would say that the negative in the second quarter, book-to-bill at energy, we always deal with the Canadian strength. Some years that gets highlighted and some years it doesn't, but it was very real here in the second quarter, and I think in the drilling activity, we did see some moderation of orders in the early part of the quarter, especially April, little bit better order rates in June, but I think the whole decline in orders from what the expectation would have been in the second quarter would be able to (Inaudible) and some moderation activity in drilling.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Then in the Q, you mentioned some signs of life in the telecom piece within communication technologies. I wonder if you can elaborate on that.","Bob Livingston","Help me again here, Brad. I think that comment may deal with booking activity. Our bookings in the first, I'm going to say two-thirds of the quarter, April and May were actually fairly positive and gave us some positive comps year-over-year in bookings. I can't say the same about June. June was soft again, but for the quarter the activity was up in telecom. It's not reflected in our revenue in the second quarter. We are expecting a little bit better second half at our telecom than we had in revenue in the second quarter.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Then just jumping back over to PID and the outlook for margin improvement in the second half. Obviously, the second quarter you called out the $5.5 million or so restructuring impact there, but second half guidance is still got big margins probably moving into what the mid-teens or something like that and is that new product effect and how should we think about the risk reward around that assumption given the uncertainty in Europe.","Brad Cerepak","Well, I would like to think we have discounted Europe appropriately here as we look at Product ID. You've got two label in structural items in the second half that are providing some windage to the margin and that is the restructuring activity we've taken here in the first half. We'll capture some of the benefits of that in the second half of the year.","We've been sharing with you for the maybe the past year our increased investment activity in sales and customer service activity. That continued to expand during the first half. I would label the second half as being rather flat with that spend activity.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Bob, could you maybe switch gears and talk about the U.S. It looked like we saw some weakening from a macro level in June. Can you maybe talk about what you saw in June and going into July?","Bob Livingston","Just with the U.S.?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Within U.S. Yeah.","Bob Livingston","Nigel, I think we've called this out. I think, Brad called it out in his prepared comments. Our U.S. industrial activity has held up quite well in their first half. Maybe with the exception and this is where it think Brad called it out in a refuse market, but if you look at business grow across the board from all of this to the refrigeration and food equipment business activity, the activity continue to be strong during the quarter as we ended the quarter and the early read in July as order activities continue to be fairly healthy here in July.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, so sounds like nothing surprise you to downside.","Bob Livingston","Nothing surprised us in the second quarter. Engineered Systems and as I had in my prepared comments, we're expecting our U.S. markets to be stable in the second half.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then you talked about the Sound Solutions listen to the forecast in the second half of the year. You referenced some OEM share mixes, but then you also referenced about timing on shipments, which I am assuming is timing on some of the new platforms. If something happens in terms of the supply chain or intelligence that you had from your customers suggests that there's no platforms now later in the year than you had expected?","Bob Livingston","Well, you've got two questions there. Supply chain and then the launch of the platforms. The launch of the platforms are probably at least month or six weeks later than we were expecting three or four months ago. We also have heard some of the noise and the chatter about supply chain constraints with some of the product platforms that are being launched, but it's hard to point anything specific, Nigel. We hear the same chatter that I am sure you do.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just finally, FX. Can you just tell us what you are using for planning in the second half of the year, and maybe if you just call out, Brad, what the guidance looks like by segment axe FX.","Brad Cerepak","Okay. Well, first on FX. In our previous guide, we were about around \u20ac34. We're about \u20ac122 in this particular forecast. It cost us in terms of our growth rate total Dover at about 0.06, 0.07 of FX impact.","To put that in dollar terms, point to point at the mid-point, just to clarify the thing we've been talking about, we're down about $180 million or so at the mid-point of our revenue guidance range. A piece of that or let's say $50 million of that give or take a few dollars is FX. $50 million of it is the Europe and slowing China, and the rest remaining to be Sound Solution.","Bob Livingston","About 80.","Brad Cerepak","As it relates by segment, most of the FX is in DPI. DPI was negative 2 to start in our earlier guide in the year, down negative 4. And then a little bit in DES, where you get about a 0.5 impact on FX related to their European-based business mainly in pumps by the way and in the [business].","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just a clarification, so the 3% to 5% organic, if we take out FX, that's more like what 5%?","Bob Livingston","If we take out FX, FX is 2 for the year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Just curious on the dynamics of the third and fourth quarter. You've been giving a lot of good detail on first half to second half, but your bookings were I guess 2.14 in the second quarter, and your sales have somewhat tracked your bookings. I mean, you are not that long cycle in nature, so maybe it's got two to three month lead time, so I am just curious usually you have a decent performance from 2Q to 3Q, but the bookings are kind of down sequentially.","Is the difference there, can you just maybe talk about that walk and I guess, will everything kind of perform seasonally with the exception of this ramp in Comm. Tech and I guess on the ram in Comm. Tech it sounds like that's little more fourth quarter weighted than third quarter?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Well, let's see. We've got three or four questions there, so let's.","Brad Cerepak","Maybe I'll start backward, Steve.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Yes.","Brad Cerepak","For Sound Solutions, the answer is the definite yes. The fourth quarter is heavier than the third quarter on revenue and contribution margin obviously. That's not true. That's not true in our MEMS business. I think we've got a fairly even spread in the second half between third quarter and fourth quarter with the total Knowles business.","The other part of your question was around seasonality?","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Yes.","Brad Cerepak","The only difference in the second half of this year with respect to seasonality would be around the Comm. Tech part of the business and it is interesting. Just because of the timing of these product launches, Steve, historically we've always looked at the Knowles MEMS business is being 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half, and historically that's where you can sort of lay the revenue waterfall during the year because of the strong product launches in the second half. It's probably closer to 40.60, and that's a significant change. Beyond that, you are not going to see any other differences in our seasonality. We still look at a seasonably weaker quarter from Hill PHOENIX in their fourth quarter than we do the proceeding three quarters and I am not sure if there is any other business in Dover that has such a strong seasonal trends, HP.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. So, we basically the bookings for this quarter and then add on what we kind of figure out for the ramp at the Comm. Tech business everything else should be kind of track the bookings pretty closely.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. Now, let's see. Maybe I can give you a little bit more detail on that and I'll comment, I shared with you in my prepared comments that the second half revenue, we see it being up about 7%, sequentially. Those 7 points, so even better. 1.5 of that is coming from acquisitions that were made in the first half of the year. That's primarily the Maag and PCS, but that's 1.5% of the 7%.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, and then you are not going to give us.","Brad Cerepak","Half of the 7 points.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And then you are not going to give us the 2Q to 3Q. Just seems like it's pretty fourth quarter. Just to make sure our models are right, because there are a lot of moving part heading into fourth quarter.","Brad Cerepak","Steve, I don't have that data in front of me. But, I will comment. Again, on this seven-point sequential growth in the second half, half of that is coming from our handset business.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot. I just wanted to follow-up on the Printing and ID business in terms of the, obviously the decremental margins in the first half very strong sort of 40% or 50%. It sounds like that they actually little bit better in the second half because of the absence of the year-on-year effect of increased spending, but could you just clarify a little bit how you expect the margins to tend in the second half when you take the combination of less investment spending and some cost savings starting to come back?","Bob Livingston","Well, I know the number. I have in memory, Brad is looking at me to make sure I give you the right number, but I think sequentially second half over the first half just within, you asked about segment or you asked about MI?","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Yes. Segment Printing and ID overall. Yeah.","Bob Livingston","Okay. What is it about 350 basis points, Brad? Second half versus first half?","Brad Cerepak","Yes. About that. For an average, yes.","Bob Livingston","Yes. About 350 basis points improvement in the second half. Most of that is coming from Markem-Imaje. We are seeing a little bit of an increase in margins in the second half from our electronics businesses, but it's very modest.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. And then on Markem-Imaje, specifically, could you talk a little bit about what trends you are seeing in different regions? I think back in early June, you talked about Northern Europe slowing a little bit. It's about business China was still good. How are things looking right now?","Bob Livingston","You're referring to the second quarter?","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Yes, so just the trends you've seen in recent weeks or months and how you think about the second half by region after Markem-Imaje?","Bob Livingston","Second quarter we had our strongest growth region in the second quarter was actually North America. Actually to be more specific was actually U.S.","I think our second strongest growth region and it was high single digit growth in the U.S. Our second growth area in the second quarter was China. Brad, I want to say it was mid-single digit, 5%, 6% in China?","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Yes.","Bob Livingston","Europe was down. Gosh, I don't remember. How do I pull out FX from this? I think organically, MI was probably a couple of points maybe one point in Europe, in the second quarter and the rest were about as expected or as you would expect. Second half, I don't think the growth rates are any different in the second half than what we were experiencing in the second quarter. Julian ","Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. And then finally just on your China business overall, I mean you've referenced the slowing there a couple of times on this call. Are you seeing any change in demand conditions or something getting excited because certain time calling a turn and so just. What are you seeing in China?","Bob Livingston","Well, we talk about it internally and it's really the tale of two different industries in China, or the business activity in China that is in support of what I call the China export machine. It has been weak in the second quarter and it weakened during the quarter. You would see a little bit of that impact at Markem-Imaje and some of the verticals that they support and service really geared towards the export activity.","You would see some of that lower activity in our pumps business in some of the verticals they support. You would see this in our Electronics equipment business. In the parts of our business and in the verticals we serve that I would label as domestic consumption, the activity held up fairly well during the second quarter.","As far as your other comment, some people calling it a turn now in the second quarter, I'm not willing to do that yet. I think we've taken a rather cautious outlook for China in the second half.","Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","On sound solutions in terms of this timing and share shift stuff, I mean does that mean obviously the second half is $18 million lower, does that mean the exit rate for the year is lower do we ramp further into first half of '13 to get to where you thought you were going to be or is it the whole number just reset lower now?","Bob Livingston","So, the question is our fourth quarter outlook lower than it was 90 days ago for Sound Solutions. The answer is yes.","Brad commented earlier that our outlook for Sound Solutions, we've taken $80 million of revenue out of the second half forecast. I am not sitting here who is doing a recall on how that split between the third and the fourth quarter, but I do believe the bulk of it was in the third quarter, but not all of that, so the fourth quarter hit a little bit lower.","We're looking at an exit rate here fourth quarter revenue forecast for Sound Solutions, somewhere around $110 million. If you want to annualize that, Shannon, I would expect that to be what I call the absolute base line for 2013, and I will tell you our expectations are going to be it will be hard.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. And then maybe just a question on M&A. I mean, you did really actually ramped the buyback in the quarter, I think. Right? I mean, it was around 3.5 times that you did in the first quarter, or lot more than you guys have done in a while, so I am just.","Bob Livingston","Recall that 1.6 million shares or so related to the shares we issued in connection with the PCS acquisition.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay.","Bob Livingston","So, we went right back into the market and bought those shares back. Think about that as really an acquisition cost.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. So, as you think about the M&A pipeline out there in terms of what could be out there relative to attractiveness of buy back or on stock here. I am just wondering how you are thinking about that trade-off?","Bob Livingston","There is a trade-off. As I commented earlier, it is. The share repurchase topic is getting a lot of discussion, but I have no announcement to share with you.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","But I think, I would just add to that as Bob put in his commentary, maybe our focus has shifted a little bit, Shannon, to highly integrative bolt-on deals and price discipline and that's key, I think. That's a key thought process that.","Bob Livingston","Okay. Yes. Any further color on that I guess would be, don't expect us in the second half of this year to announce a large acquisition.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. So, any deals would be fairly small, easily integrated bolt-ons?","Bob Livingston","I don't think we have anything in our pipeline that has any likelihood of closing in the second half of the year. Help me here, Brad. That would be greater than $250 million.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah. Well, roughly speaking.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel Nicolaus.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning, Brad, Bob.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Still a pretty strong quarter for bookings in refrigeration and in industrial, but it was probably below the normal seasonal increase in those businesses. Can you talk about the drivers? What impacts with the benefit of you think would weather in the first quarter that might have had in pulling demand forward. What impact the economic uncertainty is having and what your expectations are for the back half of the year?","Bob Livingston","I am not sure I can label any activity in the first quarter as a go forward related to weather. With maybe one possible exception and it's just hard to know. It's all supposition. We had a very, very strong start to the year at Hill PHOENIX, and I don't remember the comps from the first quarter but good news. I think books in the first quarter were up 16%, 17%, 18%?","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Bob Livingston","Over the first quarter of last year. Again, we had a very, very strong start. Second quarter revenue at Hill PHOENIX is probably what, Brad, up? 9% or 10%? 9% or 10% over the second quarter of last year. I would label that the Hill PHOENIX market activity and the Hill PHOENIX business activity has been quite strong in the first half. I'm not sure any of us could point to anything else within Engineered Systems that could either be remotely labeled as a go forward of activity into the first quarter.\\","","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Then just jumping over the balance sheet. Inventory seems to be getting up to reasonably higher levels. Can you talk about what's driving that build? Whether it's primarily related to Comm. Tech versus other areas where inventories building to satisfy back half demand or maybe if the downturn in Europe caught you with too much inventory and if you are satisfied with where the inventory levels are.","Bob Livingston","I would say it's more normal seasonality, a little bit related to acquisitions, but there is nothing unusual about the working capital, nor the inventory in the quarter based up on what we normal think. So, in other words, I think our working capital as a percent of sales is roughly around 17.92% of sales and that's historically about where we would expect to be, so we'll sit here today with a feeling that we have excess inventories in any particular area of any significance.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thank you, Jacquie. This concludes our conference call.

We would also direct your attention to our website, where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. We are off to a very solid start this year with first quarter revenue and segment earnings both up 14% over last year. Organic revenue growth was 9%. We delivered first quarter EPS of $1.05, a 19% improvement over the prior year adjusted EPS. ","These results illustrate the strength of our business mix and reflect the positive portfolio changes we've made over the last three years. ","In our Energy segment, we continued to see strong activity across all end markets, with double-digit sequential order growth. Market dynamics including the ongoing shift from gas to oil remained very positive for us and we anticipate the strength in this segment to continue. ","Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and food equipment businesses had a great quarter capitalizing on strong customer service and product innovation. We saw strong seasonal increase in bookings in refrigeration and our well positioned to have an outstanding year. ","Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The fluids' performance was driven by the significant investments we've made the last several quarters. Solid business trends continue as bookings grew nicely. I am very pleased with the first quarter performance in Engineered Systems and am confident they'll have a great year. ","At our Communication Technology segment, we saw a solid life science and commercial aerospace markets and strong MEMS microphone activity in the first quarter. We continued to ramp production at Sound Solutions and expand capacity at Knowles. We anticipate a stronger back half of the year as Knowles and Sound Solutions benefit from new design wins connected with anticipated OEM product releases. ","Within our Printing and Identification segment, the new products introduced by the Markem-Imaje team are winning in the marketplace. We believe our new products coupled with our stronger sales and service organization has enabled us to grow even in slower markets. We will continue to invest in products and people to draw a stronger global growth at Markem-Imaje. ","Overall, I am pleased with our margin performance in the first quarter. Our productivity and cost takeout initiatives enable us to continue to invest for growth. We ended the quarter with a solid book-to-bill of 1.06 despite some anticipated market softness, most notably in Europe. ","I am also very pleased with the significant progress we achieved on several other fronts during the quarter. We continued to work on the ramp of new customers and products at Sound Solutions. The magnitude of this undertaking and the related market opportunity is significant. By the end of our first quarter, we had two semi automated lines up and running in our Beijing factory and we expect that number to at least double by the end of the second quarter. These lines enable us to increase volume, improve yield and margin and increase our customer service flexibility. ","We also made progress on our globalization efforts. I'm happy to report these efforts are bearing fruit as we are now winning business in smaller markets like the Middle East, Australia and Russia. For example, our Energy segment recently won a major contract, significantly increasing our business in Australia. ","I was also pleased we closed on the Quattroflow and Maag Pump acquisitions in the first quarter. These deals fit in our strategy of expanding our Fluids platform. We believe that adding pump technology, integrating our manufacturing book ramp (ph) and leveraging our global sales channel that allows us to create value for our customers. ","Finally, our acquisition pipeline remains active. We expect to announce another acquisition in our Energy segment within the next few weeks and would hope to announce additional deals in our growth spaces in the coming months. ","With that, let me turn it over to Brad. ","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today we reported first quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14%. Earnings per share also increased 14% to $1.05. After adjusting for $0.04 of tax benefits in the first quarter of 2011, EPS improved 19% over the prior year. Segment margin was 16.2%, flat with last year. This result reflects very strong conversion in Energy and Engineered Systems, as well as our traditional Knowles markets. ","This outstanding performance was partially offset by the expected lower volume in Printing and Identification and in general softer volume and higher cost at Knowles Sound Solutions as we ramp up production in automation related to new design wins. ","Bookings increased 7% over last year to $2.2 billion reflecting double-digit growth in Energy and Communication Technologies and solid growth in Engineered Systems. In Printing and Identification, bookings decreased 21% where solid order rates in our fast-moving consumer goods markets were offset by weakness in our solar and semi markets. ","Overall, book-to-bill finished at a very solid 1.06, which is in line with our seasonal pattern. Backlog grew 12% to $1.7 billion. In the first quarter, we generated $89 million in free cash flow or 4% of revenue as the first quarter is typically our lightest in terms of cash generation. We expect free cash flow for the year to be approximately 10% of revenue. ","Now turning to Slide 4. First quarter revenue growth of 14% was comprised of 9% organic and 5% from acquisitions. Organic growth remained strong at Energy achieving 23% in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw solid growth; 12% and 7% respectively, driven by the refrigeration, fluid, industrial and handset markets. ","Printing and Identification was down 9% as growth in the fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets were offset by the expected weakness in solar and semi markets. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies where acquisitions contributed 26%. ","Turning to Slide 5 in our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the fourth quarter driven by strong results in Energy and Engineered Systems. Energy's results were broad based while Engineered Systems growth was primarily led by Hill PHOENIX. Printing and Identification decreased 4% while Communication Technologies was down 10%. ","These results largely reflect seasonality in the electronics markets coupled with softer volume at Sound Solutions. Bookings increased 9% sequentially from the fourth quarter with continued strong growth across Energy and Engineered Systems. Communication Technologies bookings in the fourth quarter were impacted by the timing of orders, which we anticipate will accelerate in the coming quarters. ","Now moving to Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $358 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year. These results reflect strong MEMS, life science and military defense activity partially offset by weak telecom markets. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 26 points of the revenue growth. ","Earnings of $46 million were down 2% and segment margin was 13%, a decrease of 460 basis points. Earnings increases in our MEMS business were partially offset by lower telecom results. Sound Solutions reduced margin approximately 600 basis points in the quarter. We expect segment margins to significantly improve as the year unfolds, most notably in the second half on the expected benefits of higher volume and automation productivity gains. Bookings were $356 million, an increase of 30%. This growth was largely driven by our handset markets. We also saw robust order rates in life sciences and aerospace. Book-to-bill was 1.00. ","Turning to Slide 7. Energy produced another excellent quarter as the average North American rig count was up double-digits from last year and oil prices remained favorable. Although rig count flattened sequentially, the ongoing transition in drilling from gas to liquid and oil rigs accelerated during the quarter. Oil rigs are now approximately 66% of the market, which lines up well with our product offerings. ","Revenue increased 25% to $532 million while earnings increased 42% to $132 million. As was the case last quarter, we saw a growth across all end markets; drilling, production and downstream. Operating margin was 24.9%, a 300 basis point improvement from last year. Margin performance was driven by very strong leverage on volume and lower acquisition costs. Bookings were $586 million, an 18% increase over the prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.10. We expect the Energy segment to remain strong, driven by solid market dynamics, our focus on globalization and significant new customer wins. ","Now, Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $822 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 11% to $180 million while Refrigeration Industrial grew 15% to $642 million. Segment earnings increased 24% to $122 million. These excellent results were broad based with strong performances in both platforms and all end markets highlighted by another outstanding performance in refrigeration and food equipment, which was up 21% over last year. ","Operating margin was 14.9%, an increase of 130 basis points reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $896 million, an increase of 8% resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.09. Our Fluids platform booking increased 6% while Refrigeration Industrial was up 8%. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 1.02 and refrigeration industrial was 1.11. The growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad based while Refrigeration Industrial continues to be led by very solid refrigeration equipment orders. ","Now, let's turn to Slide 9. Printing and Identification revenue was $356 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 40% to $33 million. The revenue decline reflects the expected continuing weakness in solar and semi as compared against a very strong prior year. These markets now represent about 15% of this segment's revenue were down approximately $35 million year-over-year. ","That aside, our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets continue to perform well despite the economic challenges in Europe. We believe our new product initiatives and the strength in sales and service organization has enabled us to grow our business in a challenging environment, a trend we believe will continue. ","Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 9.3% reflecting significantly lower volume in electronics, continued investment in our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets and product mix. We continue to drive actions that increase our flexibility and operating leverage. We completed some targeted small restructurings in the quarter and we expect some further actions to better align our footprint with the faster growing market opportunities. ","Restructuring costs related to these action will be approximately $5 million in the second quarter. Bookings were $347 million, a decrease of 21% from last year. These results were driven by weakness in solar and semi where as bookings grew 1% in our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets. Book-to-bill ended at 0.99. ","Going to Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense, corporate expense and our tax rate were generally in line with expectations. ","Now, moving to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of 10% to 12%, which is an increase from our prior guidance. Organic growth is estimated to be 5% to 7% with completed acquisitions adding around 5%. ","Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be unchanged from our previous forecast at 11% to 13% organic, while acquisitions will add 10% to 12%. ","Energy's growth is expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%. Organic growth should be 9% to 11%, up one point from our prior forecast. Acquisition growth is unchanged at 2%. ","Engineered Systems is now forecasted to grow 10% to 12%. Organic growth is up one point to 4% to 6% while acquisitions are up five points to 6%. ","Lastly, Printing and Identification revenue is forecasted to be down 1% to 2% versus our prior flat forecast. ","Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned we now expect total revenue to be in the range of 10% to 12%. CapEx will be roughly 3.5% to 3.8% of revenue, up from our prior forecast as we aggressively invest in our growth spaces, especially in automation and capacity at Communication Technologies. ","All other aspects of our prior guidance remain substantially unchanged. Based on the above, we are raising the low end of our range and now anticipate a full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.80 to $5.00. ","Now, let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits. Volume mix and price will contribute roughly $0.33 to $0.49 for the full year while net productivity will add $0.19 to $0.29. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22 for the year. Investment and compensation is $0.03 lower than our prior forecast. ","Interest expense, share count and our tax rate should yield a $0.03 benefit, up $0.02 from our prior forecast, primarily driven by lower average shares. The net result is EPS growth of 15% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the mid point. ","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments. ","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Brad. I am more confident on 2012 than just a short 90 days ago. Our Energy and Engineered System segments had a strong first quarter and are well positioned to produce excellent results for the balance of the year. ","Printing and Identification is facing tough comps and a slower economy in Europe in the first half. I do, however, expect a stronger showing in the second half as we benefit from our people and product investments, improved productivity and a modest second quarter restructuring. ","Communication Technologies is investing quite heavily in the first half on automation at Sound Solutions, capacity expansion at Knowles as well as significant design win efforts. Anticipated second half product launches, benefits from automation and additional capacity will be quite noticeable in our second half results. ","I expect Dover's second half revenue to be up about 6% to 7% from the first half and anticipate solid leverage on the increased volume. ","As I look across Dover, I am extremely pleased with our positioning. Trends and global energy demand and wireless communication, a recovering US economy and the continuing opportunities in emerging economies fit well with the focus and the direction of our businesses. We maintain our focus and financial flexibility to continue to expand in our five growth spaces. We are poised to have a great year with record revenue, earnings and cash flow. ","In closing, I'd like to thank our team for a very solid start to the year. As always, your focus on customers, productivity and winning in the marketplace has enabled us to begin 2012 on a very positive note. ","With that, Paul, let's take some questions. ","Paul Goldberg","Thank, Bob. And with that, I'd just like to remind everyone if you can limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, that would be much appreciated. And with that, Marie, if you can queue up the questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please go ahead. ","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","","Morning, guys. ","Bob Livingston","Morning, Shannon. ","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","So, the first one is on Communication Tech. So, ex-Sound Solutions, the margins were up I guess 90 bps year-over-year, so around 18.5, which I think implies Sound Solutions probably lost a little money in the quarter versus it used to be kind of I think like a mid-teens margin business. So, clearly sort of an unusual period here you're going through. Just maybe a little more color as how you see this ramping and where you think Sound Solution margins kind of finish off once you're past the transition, you've got the automation where you want it. Where do you think Sound Solution normal margins will be?","Bob Livingston","Okay. You have a couple of observations and a question. Your comment on the DCT, Communication Technology margins excluding Sound Solutions are about right. Shannon, let me step back a little bit here and take a historical perspective on Sound Solutions and then I'll give you a direct response to your question. ","If you look at \u2013 first of all, we had been looking at this business as an acquisition target for several years before we actually made the acquisition. And if you look at the second half of 2010 and I'm going to pick the second half of 2010 because that's before the noise with the Nokia market share drop started to affect the business. ","If you look at the second half of 2010, their quarterly revenue was running at about $80 million a quarter. And at that time, about 75% of their business was with Nokia and RIM, 25% all other. Now, we sort of know what happened during 2011. We experienced the decline, or Nokia experienced the decline in their market share. We've seen it with a couple of other customers and you've heard up comment about the activity we've been undertaking for the last couple of quarters on production ramps with other customers. ","But now let's bring it to the first quarter of 2011. The revenue was about $70 million \u2013 first quarter of 2012, I'm sorry. So the revenue was about $70 million. But the share positions with customers has changed significantly. Nokia and RIM is down to about 35% of our business. Now, all other and all other is a fairly long list, but all other is about 65% of our business.","When you do the math, what this business has been able to do and is trying to expand even more is increase this business with all other account list excluding Nokia and RIM. And over the last several months, we've actually just about doubled that amount of business with the other customers. ","Now, your comment on margins. All in including our acquisition charges, Sound Solutions was negative for Dover in the first quarter and I'm going to tell you, we expect it to be negative for Dover in the second quarter. But I again I emphasize, all in including the acquisition charges. On an operating basis, it's mid perhaps a bit higher than mid-single-digits operating EBITDA.","That is much lower than it should be and it's much lower than what we expect it to be in the first half. We get to the second half, Brad, help me with the numbers here at bit. We get to the second half, the significance and these design wins and the impact from the automation projects as well as the anticipated customer launches in the second half \u2013?","Brad Cerepak","Gets up back to the historical \u2013","Bob Livingston","The revenue increase is significant \u2013 ","Brad Cerepak","Right.","Bob Livingston","And the second half margins get us back to the historical margins that we saw and continue to expect from Sound Solutions. ","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. Yes. That's a pretty big swing. And you feel like you have visibility now. You've got the design wins. It's a matter of sort of the timing to flow from there, right? ","Bob Livingston","It's a matter of timing. We have worked quite diligently in the second half of last year, the first quarter of this year, continuing to work on it for more design wins. But we believe the design wins that we need for the second half production ramp have been won and it is a matter of product launches with the customers. ","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. And then just a question on Energy. So the comps have already gotten tougher here. We've had the declines on the gas side but organic growth was still 23% and you had this 13% sequential increase in bookings. It sounds like international's becoming sort of a more important thing for you. And I'm just curious if that's right and how we should be thinking about it and how you're seeing the international side of the story develop?","Bob Livingston","International is growing for us. Actually it's the fastest growing part of our Energy business right now. We had a great first quarter. The guys did an outstanding job. But our downstream business, Shannon, is also growing nicely. If you look at the guidance that we have provided here, that Brad provided earlier here on the revenue guidance for the year, the comps do get tougher. ","We are not \u2013 we are not forecasting significant volume increases in our Energy business beyond the first quarter level. We do have some increases but they're not significant. I think if I remember correctly the second half of 2012 for our Energy business is up low single-digits over the first half. And we do expect the rig count to be moderating here as we go through the year. ","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. Thanks, guys. ","Brad Cerepak","All right. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of  Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.  ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. ","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Jeff.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you for that very detailed answer on Sound Solutions. I just wonder one other element to that, Bob. Are you in fact struggling in some way with the automation ramp relative to what you were expecting? It sounds like that's an undercurrent of some of what you're talking about here today. And what are those issues and how long should those take to be worked out?","Bob Livingston","I would say that the first two lines that we have brought up in Beijing have come online slower than we would have liked and actually slower than we believed four or five months ago, Jeff. As of the end of the first quarter we do have two lines commissioned. They are fully owned now by production and we're focused on getting at least two more lines up in the second quarter and we expect the commission of these two lines perhaps even a third one, to be much more efficient and quicker than we experienced with the first two. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Great. And I'm wondering on M&A \u2013","Bob Livingston","It was a great learning exercise for everyone on the first two. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Yes. I guess so. Well as long as it's working by the time those product launches come, I guess it all works out. ","Bob Livingston","Yes. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","On the M&A front, can you give us a little color on kind of order of magnitude, size you're talking about given that you've got some stuff kind of near in your sights here? ","Bob Livingston","Well, I guess the only one I would comment on was the deal we'll announce here in a couple or three weeks in our Energy segment. Brad, do you have the details on that? ","Brad Cerepak","Yes. So, as Bob indicated, we expect to close a deal in the Energy space in the next couple of weeks. Size-wise, it's roughly going to mean about a $100 million of sales on an annualized basis for us in our Energy business. Purchase price, it's going to be around $220 and so we're excited about adding that to the Energy business. It will be just very slightly dilutive for us this year because of deal costs and amortization step-ups, especially on the inventory as it turns out, Jeff. ","But this has high margins like other businesses we've done in the Energy space. Other acquisitions we\u2019ve done. ","Bob Livingston","And, Jeff, and folks, this is an acquisition addition into our production segment in Energy, around artificial lift. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And just maybe just a small follow-on and I'll pass it on. Did you have some deal dilution as it related to Maag Pump or other things in the quarter? You didn't call that out but I assume there was some (inaudible) there.","Brad Cerepak","We only owned it for about two weeks. So it was kind of neutral within the first quarter. But for the second quarter we're going to see that those costs, those initial start \u2013 in essence roll out of the inventory in the second quarter. And so the second quarter will get hit by about, I would say about $0.01 to $0.02 of dilution. And then as the year progresses, we expect that to now be slightly accretive for us, Jeff. ","Very, very strong business performance so far in this year. Even for the period that we didn't own them. We have high expectations for the rest of the year on that business. ","Bob Livingston","Strong order rates and backlog on this acquisition.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thanks a lot, guys. ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of  Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick follow-on with the M&A backlog. It sounds like there's a few more deals that you have a bit of visibility on. What would you say is the probability of a big deal this year?","Bob Livingston","Gosh. Nigel, the only reason I'm commenting on this Energy deal is because it's sort of already in the public space. We've received HSR approval. And that's \u2013 beyond that, I really don't want to comment on size or number of deals in the backlog or the pipeline. It's \u2013 we never know we're going to close one until we close it. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That's fair enough. And then looking at the Markem-Imaje performance. Looks like (inaudible) in organic growth. You had come to (inaudible). You're looking for double-digits. You've got a lot of new product launches coming up. Can you just give us some visibility on when you expect to see the benefits of those launches?","Bob Livingston","We did have positive organic growth in the first quarter. It's really modest. And I have to tell you that as we started the year, January was a bit of a hold for us, that the revenue was quite a bit less than we expected. And we were feeling it most notably in Europe. February and March activity returned to normal and expected levels. ","The second half of the year actually is a pretty strong forecast for Markem-Imaje and as of right now, Nigel, our internal plan, we've backed off a point or so on the internal plan from what we had 90 days ago. But the internal plan for Markem-Imaje is still high single-digits organic growth for the year. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just another quick one on this \u2013 the book-to-bill of 0.99. How did that break out between electronics and other?","Bob Livingston","Goodness. Let's see. I'm not sure I can give you both numbers. I know Markem-Imaje was a positive book-to-bill. I think Markem-Imaje book-to-bill in the first quarter was 1.03. The electronics in semi and solar obviously would have been a less than one. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks, Bob. ","Bob Livingston","But I do know Markem-Imaje was 1.03.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning, guys. ","Bob Livingston","Hi, Terry. ","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Maybe, Brad, I'm wondering if you might scope out your thinking on year-over-year margin change for the segments. You had talked in the past, Energy up 50. Looks like you're tracking well above that. Com's up 120, probably below that, so forth and so on for the segments. ","Brad Cerepak","Okay. So you're referring back to when we scoped that out for Dover Day. ","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Right. ","Brad Cerepak","Yes. So, I guess if I just generally speaking we said at Dover Day total Dover, total Dover would be up somewhere between 40 to 70 bps. And one of the things that is influencing that overall number at this stage is the Maag acquisition. So, you've got \u2013 that was not known at the time of the Dover Day guidance and so that brings down our total Dover about 20 bps or so. ","So, total Dover, we're looking at going from about a 17 actual to up somewhere between 17 to 17.3 or so. As I think about the segments, generally speaking I would say the margin rate we've had in DE in the first quarter of about \u2013 it's almost 25%. We should see a little bit of improvement in that throughout the year. ","DES also at almost 15. We\u2019ll see a little bit of improvement throughout the year on DES as they continue to get leverage on volume. DPI, obviously we have expectations that the second half will be better than the first and better than the first quarter and we'll see some significant improvement there. As well as in our Communication Technologies group. ","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just on the acquisition where you've got the HSR and we've got a little bit of dilution this year. Any way to scope out the potential accretion in 2013 as you're viewing it today?","Bob Livingston","","I don't have that data with us, Terry. ","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then, Bob, I guess looking at the semi and solar businesses, are you pretty confident that you've moved sideways here indicating a bottom and are you seeing any signs of a pick-up on the order front or do you think that's second half? Or how do you think about those businesses as you move into the second half and into 2013?","Bob Livingston","Let me give you one quick comment on solar. It's low. I think we've got less than $40 million of revenue in our plan for 2012 for solar. Okay. So let me go to semi. I think we shared this with the audience on the January call that we felt or believed at that time that we had hit a trough in the third quarter of last year on bookings. And that trend continues to hold. I think our fourth quarter sequential bookings improvement in semi was up about \u2013 like 18%. ","First quarter over fourth quarter, sequentially up about 7% or 8%. And we expect some very, very modest improvements in that business throughout the year off of the first quarter order rate. On revenue for semi, first quarter was our trough. That would fit with the order rates and we expect a little bit of improvement throughout the year in semi revenue. But it is still pretty modest. ","I think in our total forecast for Dover, I think we've got $200 million of revenue in for semi. ","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just lastly, weather impact in the first quarter. Did you get some pull forward at Hill PHOENIX? Do you think OPW got some benefit? Just overall reflect on the \u2013","Bob Livingston","I know. That's always \u2013 my response would have to be that it's possible. But it's very, very difficult to pinpoint anything, Terry. Your comment on HP, we came into the year and the Hill PHOENIX folks did expect their market to be up in 2012 over 2011. And that has been the case in their first quarter. The guys had a very, very strong first quarter. Their revenue was up 20% year-over-year. ","And the bookings, the bookings increase was a similar number. I will tell you, we're not \u2013 the guidance we're giving you here on revenue for the year, we are not raising the Hill PHOENIX plan. And maybe that goes back to your question. It is difficult for us \u2013 it is difficult for us to have great visibility into the second half right now. We believe we're going to have a very strong first half at Hill PHOENIX. We're at this point in time, we're holding the annual plan for Hill PHOENIX.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks very much. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of  John Inch of Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","John Inch - Bank of America","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. ","Bob Livingston","Good morning, John. ","John Inch - Bank of America","Bob, I want to talk a bit about the downstream energy business. I think you made some positive commentary toward it. It did in the quarter have the slowest growth. So, are you expecting the business to sequentially improve more so than the other businesses as the year progresses? And kind of the angle I'm fishing for a little bit is low nat gas pricing. Maybe you could talk about how that perhaps dovetails into an opportunity set for that business.","Bob Livingston","Well, John. You're right. It did not have the growth rates in their first quarter that drilling and production did. But, John, don't ask me to apologize for 14% growth in our downstream business. It was a pretty solid quarter for the guys. ","The growth for the year, we're forecasting double-digit, low double-digit growth for the downstream business for the year. I think the low natural gas prices will have a positive influence on activity and projects in downstream markets. I don't think you're going to see a surge in business in the second quarter or the third quarter but I think you are going to see an increase in permitting and interest and quote activity as the year goes on. ","I would tell you to think more about the downstream business as having a bump from the low natural gas prices as being a bit of a tailwind for us late this year and going into 2013. ","John Inch - Bank of America","Okay. That kind of makes sense. I guess about Hill PHOENIX, obviously the \u2013 I'm presuming that Hill PHOENIX surprised even you guys in the quarter. Kind of looks like you're gaining share, maybe share significantly in the Case business. Is this a \u2013 and I realize you don't want to talk about customers, but was this a kind of a one-off win proportionately as you look at it? Or is there \u2013 maybe you could just provide a little more color \u2013 product momentum or what's really going on there?","Bob Livingston","So, let me remind you that I think even on the January call I commented about how strong the bookings were at Hill PHOENIX in the fourth quarter. They were quite a bit stronger than we had anticipated. So, John, to be frank, coming into their first quarter there were probably some questions or concerns that maybe for whatever reason, project timing and customer decisions that some 2012 business that we were expecting had been pulled into 2011.","Well, the first quarter sort of proved that concern to be false. The business increase at Hill PHOENIX was very broad based. It was not driven, I think you're referring to the big projects at Wal-Mart and Target. It was not \u2013 we had nice increase with both of those customers, but it was not driven significantly so by those customers. We had very strong business increases in Canada and Mexico, which has been a focus for the business over the last couple of years to grow the business outside of the US.","And did we take share? We think we did. We believe that at least on the data we're looking at the end of February. I do not have full first quarter data. But through the end of February our share of the Case business is up about 4% to 5%. I'm talking low 40s. ","John Inch - Bank of America","Okay. No, that makes sense. And then maybe just lastly, Brad or Bob, you referenced weak. You're up obviously Europe is in a recession. I realize you don't have a ton of exposure. It\u2019s somewhat limited. But you're European businesses, just talk about them. Are they in a holding pattern? Are you getting \u2013 seeing things soften or maybe even strengthen a little bit? Just any color you could provide would be great. Thanks. ","Bob Livingston","Okay. Well, Brad can probably share some data points with you, but I don\u2019t think we would talk about Europe and use the word strengthening. In Europe we have the most significant presence obviously with our Markem-Imaje business, with our SWEP business and with some of our semi and solar activity. Europe as actually as a percentage of our revenue, was actually rather flat with what it's been over the last several quarters at 17%. ","If you exclude the impact of Sound Solutions, because obviously part of Sound Solutions is European, if you exclude the impact of Sound Solutions, our European revenue in the first quarter was down 1% I think. Brad, is that right? And you hate to cheer a negative number but I was pleased with their business performance in Europe in the first quarter. ","John Inch - Bank of America","How would that have compared to December? Was it better? The December quarter, sorry. ","Bob Livingston","Well, the latter half \u2013 it's better than the latter half of the fourth quarter. ","Brad Cerepak","It's basically flat quarter-to-quarter. Sequentially flat and as Bob said, slightly down year-over-year. ","John Inch - Bank of America","Got it. Thank you very much. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning, guys. ","Bob Livingston","Hi, Scott. ","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","A couple of questions for you. One, AAC been talking pretty aggressively about taking share in MEMS. Do you see a more aggressive competitor there? Is it just at the margin or is there something kind of bigger going on that we should be aware of? ","Bob Livingston","Taking share \u2013 Scott, we see AAC at one customer. Our MEMS business in the first quarter on revenue was up \u2013 what was it, Brad, 25%, 24%, 25%. And our handset business, our activity was up like 25% and other MEMS business like tablets and some other applications it was up 20%. You're going to see some changes from quarter to quarter. We think our business is doing quite well. ","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Yes. Clearly. I just wanted to give you a chance to rebute their comments. So, can we talk a little bit about ExRight (ph). Danner (ph) announced that deal not so long ago and I'm guessing you guys took a look at it. Does it \u2013 when you think about kind of the future of the printing business or whatever you want to call it. Does having a color business, is that important? Is it going to become more important? Is this something where you guys need to start looking at assets that are similar to ExRight (ph)? Or is this just more of a one-off?","Bob Livingston","Gosh. You're asking me to comment on someone else's acquisition and I really don't want to do that, Scott. If you go back to what we shared with everyone at Dover Day, with the strategy we have for our Printing and Identification segment, we do want to look for other printing applications that just necessarily would not be an add-on to Markem-Imaje. But do expand our play in other printing applications. The one you're referring to is that an example? That would be an example. ","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Okay. So is it fair to say you looked at it then?","Bob Livingston","It's fair to say. ","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Okay. Good enough. That's all my questions. I'll pass it on. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of  Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Steve. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So, just the energy dynamics, you're talking about basically kind of \u2013 you're not modeling much sequential improvement. Is that just your conservatism or is that kind of the rig count dynamic you guys see out there? And then as we move into 2013 assuming that the mix in the rigs doesn't change that much more dramatically. If rig counts are flat, do you guys grow in 2013? Is there still the content story? Or is this kind of like the bump that we've had stabilize here? ","Bob Livingston","Okay. Let's see. You've got three or four questions there. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Is there share gain? I guess just a commentary on you guys talked about kind of flattish sequential energy revenues, but you've talked about higher content in oil versus gas and so I'm just curious if there's anything else that \u2013 ","Bob Livingston","Let me deal first with what our assumptions are in our planning for the rig count. When you look at averages, we still \u2013 we've taken down the rig count deployment for 2012 slightly from where we were 90 days ago. But we're still looking at about an 8% year-over-year increase in average rig count deployment. At year-end here in the US for the December quarter, I think the number was like 1973 or 1975 rigs. The average in the first quarter here in the US was actually down a bit. ","And we believe that the second quarter here in the US is going to be flat with the first quarter. You'll see some noise during the quarter but flat with the first quarter. For North America, I would say the commentary is similar for North America, which is primarily we're adding Canada. ","The question you're asking about content on the rigs, actually affects \u2013 it has little impact on our drilling business and our drilling business had a very, very strong first quarter. Actually of the three segments, they had the strongest growth. Our growth in drilling in the first quarter was 30%, Steve. And I don't have the slices and the detail on this, but I would guess that perhaps as much as a third of that growth could be share gains in the first quarter. ","Would that continue? We fully expect that to continue. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. And then just curious on the CapEx versus investment. Why is comp and investment lower and then the increase in CapEx as a percentage of increased sales, is that the majority of that? Is that in CMT or is that in other areas as well?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Repeat the question, Steve.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","In the earnings grid you guys did \u2013","Bob Livingston","So you're question \u2013 the CapEx question \u2013","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Yes. Because it goes from 3% to 3. \u2013","Bob Livingston","We're guiding up 3% to about 3.5%. I would say that the bulk of that increase, the bulk of the increase is in Communication Technologies but not all of it. Probably 60% of that increase is in Communication Technologies. But let me give you a little bit of color on that. ","If you look at our CapEx plan for the year as we've shared with you for the total number, Steve, probably 80% of that CapEx is in our five growth spaces. And I would say that well north of 50% maybe even as high as 70% of the CapEx in those five growth spaces, it's all for better positioning or capacity or automation for \u2013 to capture opportunities outside of the core markets like here in the US. ","The bulk of the other CapEx, that's not in our five growth spaces, gosh, I would say at least half of that is what you and I would label as maintenance CapEx. Does that provide some color for you?","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. Yes. Absolutely. And then just one quick question on the other telecom and other revenue in the Communication Tech segment, down 14% in the quarter but you said your other MEMS business I believe you reported in there like the \u2013 your tablets and stuff, if that was up 25 \u2013 sorry?","Bob Livingston","You want to know the detail?","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","I'm just curious at (inaudible) because if that was up 25% and the segment was down 14, that means telecom was down like I don't know 30 to 40 or even 50 or something like that. ","Bob Livingston","No. I'm going to \u2013 Brad, help me here. 25%, 28% down?","Brad Cerepak","Yes. Around 30%. ","Bob Livingston","Around 30%. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. So then the other MEMS stuff was up kind of mid-teens type of thing, type of stuff?","Brad Cerepak","Twenty. ","Bob Livingston","Twenty. Yes. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jim Lucas of Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning, guys. One follow-up question just coming at M&A from a little different direction. Could you comment of what you're seeing in the overall multiples given that there's just so much cash still on the sidelines? And in particular, just areas where you're seeing maybe a little bit more attractive, less competition. Just any color you can give on the pipeline would be appreciated. ","Bob Livingston","Okay. Goodness. I guess my first comment would be every single deal is so unique and so specific to the seller and the market opportunity. I think I've shared this comment on the January call that if you look at the last three years, I think our average PE on trailing EBITDA, Brad, help me here, 8.5, 8.3 or maybe pushing 9? It was in that range. ","Brad Cerepak","Eight to nine range. ","Bob Livingston","Eight to nine range. And I wouldn't change my comment on the deals that are, I call them the closed end deals that we have in our pipeline. The multiples are rather constant. That doesn't mean that there haven't been some deals we've seen that have gone at higher prices and we've just elected to not chase the higher prices. ","Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, with regards to Fluids, could you give a little color of what you're seeing there. You've done a good job of making some nice acquisitions to compliment it. Kind of talk about how that segment is positioned today and any particular areas that stood out as you look out for the rest of 2012?","Bob Livingston","Well, the \u2013 as Brad commented for the first quarter, our business was up about 11%. We're going to have very strong growth in this business for the year with a significant chunk of the growth coming from the Maag acquisition as we've shared. But you're asking on specific areas, I tell you, it's very, very broad based. We have seen parts of this business continue to do very, very well in Europe and China even with all of the reported slowdowns in market activity. ","We've also seen a couple of smaller parts of the pump portfolio that have been impacted by the slowdown in Europe and especially some of the tempering or the slowdown in construction activity in China. But the business continues to expand. This is a very, very balanced global business for us. It's probably as equally balanced between US, Europe and emerging economies with an emphasis in China and Asia as any other business we have in our entire portfolio.","And I tell you, the 11% growth in their first quarter I think is a pretty good indication of what we would expect from this business for the balance of the year absent the positive impact from the acquisition. ","Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets","Perfect. Thank you very much. ","Operator","","Your final question comes from Charlie Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. ","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Charlie. And welcome. ","Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. Just on Communication Technologies I wanted to go back to that. You commented on the telecom other piece of that business a couple of questions ago. Are you still looking to that segment, that piece of it to be down 3% to 5% for the year? And then in a larger sense, for the segment as a whole it looks like you're growth from acquisitions has dropped a couple hundred basis points. Is that a function of kind of first half Sound Solutions activity or is there something else in there?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Hey, Brad, how about I take the first part and you take the second part? So, you're asking about telecom other, for the first quarter I think we were reporting it down, what 13% or 14%? ","Brad Cerepak","Thirteen percent. ","Bob Livingston","Thirteen percent. And the down part was telecom infrastructure. Some of the other was up for the year. It changes significantly for the year. I think we're looking at negative growth in telecom other for the year to be only like a minus 1% or minus 2%, minus 3%. ","Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. So it's a little bit better than you had a few months ago?","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Brad Cerepak","And with respect to the second question, you're right. When we were at Dover Day, if that's what you're referring to, we expected acquisitions to add a few points greater than what we see now. And it goes back to the discussion we had about the softness in our business in Sound Solutions. If you recall, we treat acquisitions organic once we hit that date we acquired it. So, it's really a first half number for Sound Solutions. And that's the way \u2013 that's the impact that you're seeing there. Slightly slower volume. ","Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Great. Thanks. ","Operator","","Thank you. That does \u2013 I'm sorry, sir. Go ahead with your closing remarks. ","Paul Goldberg","Yes. So this concludes our conference call today. We thank you for your continued interest in Dover and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. And I just want to remind the investors and analysts out there that we do have our Technology Day on June 4 and an invitation will be coming soon. It's in New York City.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our businesses continue to perform well against the backdrop of significant headwinds in our Energy-related markets, as well as the increasing FX impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and slower than expected activity in our core retail Refrigeration markets. These headwinds caused our first quarter results to be below our expectations.","We continued to take aggressive restructuring actions to better align our costs to anticipated demand, just as we did in the fourth quarter. From a geographic perspective, our non-Energy related U.S. markets moderated, while Europe and Asia were solid. Excluding U.S. Energy markets all regions grew in a quarter.","Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, our drilling and production businesses were significantly impacted by a sharper than anticipated decline in the North American oil and gas markets, resulting in customer destocking and lower order activity. In response, we took restructuring actions during the quarter to better align our cost base and we will continue to pursue appropriate cost reductions going forward.","In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. Within printing and identification, our businesses performed very well globally. The industrial platform achieved broad based organic growth lead by continued solid results in our waste handling and auto-related businesses.","Our Fluids segment once again performed well. We are continuing strong market conditions for fluid transfer products were primary driver. The majority of our pump markets remained solid. Though, year-over-year comps were impacted by strong project shipments in the first quarter of last year.","The Refrigeration & Food Equipment market has remained stable. We expected a slow start to the year based on reduced activity from a key retail Refrigeration customer and volume from other customers has been slower to develop than anticipated. We expect overall customer activity to pick up in the back half of the year. Additionally, our glass door business has remained strong.","Our acquisition pipeline rebuilt nicely in the first quarter and is now quite robust. And I am optimistic that we will close on several acquisitions in the back half of the year. In addition, we completed the sale of the business in the first quarter for $185 million and also announced the agreement to sell another for $500 million. We will use the deal proceeds to complete our previously announced $600 million of share repurchases in 2015.","Now let me address our revised outlook for the year, which is largely unchanged for Engineered Systems and Fluids except for FX. Their markets have remained healthy and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015.","As you would expect, North American Energy fundamentals are having the biggest impact on our forecast. As a result, we expect significantly lower revenue in our drilling and production businesses.","Several of our other businesses in our Energy segment are less expose to upstream oil and gas activity, and thus have been less impacted than our drilling and production businesses. Overall, we expect the second quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year for Energy.","In Engineered Systems we anticipate continued growth in our industrial platform and strong results in printing and identification driven by new product introductions and positive market dynamics, largely offset by increased FX headwinds.","Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for fluid transfer and most of our pumped businesses. Our expectations are supported by ongoing safety and environmental regulations, a positive retail and fueling environment and new pumped product introductions partially offset by the impact of FX.","And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we now expect a tougher year driven by lower order activity for our cases and systems. We do expect our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform well and help mitigate the previously mentioned softness.","With that, let met turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on slide three of our presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6%, growth from acquisitions of 5%, and an FX headwind of 4%. EPS was $0.72, including $0.10 of restructuring. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.5%, 340 basis points below last year. Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting cost, our overall margin was 15.5%.","Bookings decreased 11% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, reflecting weak energy macros, softer orders rates in refrigeration and FX impacts. Overall book-to-bill finished at 1.02. Our backlog decreased 13% to $1.2 billion. Free cash flow was strong at $103 million for the quarter or 6% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide four. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 6% with broad-based growth in both platforms. Fluids grew 2% benefiting from solid fluid transfer markets, partially offset by tough comps connected to a larger order shipped last year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s organic revenue declined 7% on tough comps in retail refrigeration and can shaping equipment. As discussed on previous calls, the can shaping business can\u2019t be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but the market remains solid overall. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 24%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 5%, comprised of 15% in Energy, 2% in Fluids, and 1% in Engineered Systems. FX impacted to total company by 4% as seen on the chart.","Turning to slide five in our sequential results. Revenue decreased 13% from the fourth quarter primarily reflecting weak drilling and production markets, softer retail refrigeration activity, impact of FX, and the timing of pump shipments. Overall Energy decreased 22%, Refrigeration & Food Equipment decreased 19% coming off a strong fourth quarter, Fluids was down 10%, and Engineered Systems declined 3%. Sequential bookings decreased 7%. Of note, Energy declined 22% on weak market fundamentals. Engineered Systems was down 8%, principally driven by tough comps in waste handling. Refrigeration & Food Equipment seasonally increased 14%, although less than anticipated.","Now moving on to slide six. Energy revenue of $430 million decreased 10% and earnings of $52 million decreased 56% from last year. Excluding the combined $29 million impact of Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings decreased 32%. Energy\u2019s results were significantly impacted by a steeper and broader deterioration of the North American oil and gas markets than previously forecasted. The result was reduced E&P CapEx spending and significant customer destocking, most notably in our North American drilling and production markets. Solid activity in compression winches ESPs and international markets helped to partially offset challenges in our business.","We took additional restructuring actions in the first quarter to better align our cost. Over the last two quarters we have incurred approximately $25 million in charges in our Energy segment. These actions will provide $45 million in benefits this year. In addition, we have taken other cost reduction actions, which should provide an incremental $30 million in savings. Excluding the Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, our adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, reflecting lower volume and modest price declines, offset by the benefits of productivity and prior period restructuring. Bookings were $417 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.97.","Turning to slide seven. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where total revenue of $573 million was up 1% overall, earnings of $88 million increased 6%. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 1% overall. Of note, organic revenue grew 8% but was offset by significant FX headwinds. These results were driven by continued strong digital printing activity and solid global markets in our core printing and coding business.","In the Industrial platform, revenue grew 2% to $343 million including organic growth of 4% offset by FX headwinds. Revenue growth continued to be particularly strong in our waste handling business. Margin was up 70 basis points to 15.4% on volume leverage and productivity. A one-time insurance recovery of $4 million largely offset incremental restructuring charges in the quarter. Bookings were $573 million, a decrease of 8% reflecting an organic bookings decline of 3% and 6% impact from FX.","Our Printing & Identification bookings deceased 6% to $236 million. However, adjusting for FX, organic bookings were up 3%.Industrial bookings decreased 9% to $337 million, largely reflecting impact of order timing and waste handing and softer markets in a hydraulic cylinder business. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.02, while Industrials was 0.98. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.","Now moving to slide eight. Within Fluids revenue decreased 1% to $340 million and earnings of $55 million declined 6%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 2% and acquisition growth of 2% offset by FX headwinds. Our Fluid Transfer businesses continue to benefit from strong demand in global retail fueling markets and ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results were primarily impacted by the timing of large shipments to customers in the plastic and polymers markets. Segment margin was 16.1%, a decrease of 70 basis points largely reflecting product mix. Bookings were $339 million, a decrease of 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps, partially offset by solid fluid transfer markets. Book-to-bill was 1.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide nine. Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s revenue of $372 million declined 10% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 19% to $36 million. Revenue performance in the quarter was essentially as expected.","Our results were largely driven by reduced order activity for refrigeration systems and cases by a key retail customer, which offset solid heat exchanger in commercial Food Equipment activity.","Operating margin was 9.7%, a 120 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $420 million, a decrease of 15%, principally reflecting slower and anticipated order activity from our core Refrigeration customers. Book-to-bill was 1.13.","Going to the overview slide number 10. First quarter net interest expense was $32 million, in line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $35 million, up $4 million from last year and consistent with expectations.","Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 29%, essentially in line with our revised full year forecast. Capital expenditures were $28 million in the quarter. Lastly in the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $200 million. As previously communicated, we will repurchase a total of $600 million in shares this year.","Now onto slide 11, which is an update on Energy. We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 16% to 18%, a reduction of about 10 points from our prior forecast or about $200 million in revenue with organic revenue declining 24% to 26%.","The biggest changes in our Drilling & Production in automation markets and although less exposed, our Bearings and Compression forecast has also been revised to reflect general energy market conditions.","Moving onto slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be down 4% to 6%. Our expected organic revenue will decrease 2% to 4%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 2%. We now expect the total impact of FX to be approximately a 4% headwind.","Segment margin is estimated to be between 16.8% and 17.3%, excluding restructuring costs. Corporate expense remains at approximately $125 million and interest expense should be around $127 million.","We now expect full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 29%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue.","From a segment perspective, Energy\u2019s full year organic revenue forecast has been reduced to a negative 24% to 26%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 1% to 3%. Energy Systems, Engineered Systems and Fluid organic forecasts are essentially unchanged.","Turning to 2015 bridge on slide 13. In 2015, we now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to be a $0.01 impact to a $0.02 benefit. Performance largely driven by volume but also including items such as price, productivity and restructuring benefits will reduce earnings $0.47 to $0.58. Within this estimate, our restructuring benefits of $0.31 to $0.33.","The benefit of acquisitions already completed will be core to success. Shares will provide $0.23 to $0.24 based on an estimate of $600 million and repurchases in 2015 and the carryover impact of our 2014 repurchases. Interest, corporate, and the tax rate will be in the range of a $0.02 impact to a $0.01 benefit.","In total, we now expect EPS to be $4.20 to $4.40, inclusive of $0.15 to $0.18 of restructuring costs. Incremental $0.05 to $0.08 of restructuring costs will mostly impact the second quarter.","Regarding the second quarter, we expect revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially, largely driven by a seasonal increase in Refrigeration & Food Equipment and a sequential decline in Energy.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Brad. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the way our company\u2019s performed in the first quarter in the phase of tough markets. We continue to focus on lean and productivity initiatives across the organization. Through all of our actions, we have better positioned over for both our current demand environment and for margin enhancement over the longer term.","With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces. We remain focused on growth investment, as well as investment and productivity initiatives, including supply chain optimization and shared infrastructure.","As I look beyond the current environment in Energy, I\u2019m excited about Dover\u2019s position. We have structurally improved our cost base while at the same time, continued to invest in product development and innovation. These internal initiatives when combined with value-creating acquisitions give me confidence that we will not only leverage volume improvements but also deliver very strong performance.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. And Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Bob. At this point, I would like to remind all our listeners to limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, so we can get more people in the queue. And with that, Angie, if we can have our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning and thanks for detail around the energy markets.","Bob Livingston","Good morning to you, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Good morning. So, Brad, you provided some color on 2Q sales, which is helpful but any interesting to call out in terms of the margin and particularly with -- in terms of Energy and also the impact of restructuring payback primarily?","Brad Cerepak","Okay. So, you were asking about -- okay. So Q2 margins -- we really not going to get into a discussion on it. But as far as the year is concerned on Energy, we would see the margins continue improve throughout the year as those restructuring benefits begin to take hold. As we said, Q2 will be impacted by further Energy restructuring costs. By the time we exit, we would expect our decrementals in energy to significantly improve. So the first quarter, the decrementals were about 39%.","I would see decrementals into the second quarter slightly higher. Let\u2019s say two points higher than that about 41% on Energy. And then for the year, we would see decrementals on our Energy business slightly below 40. We had previously thought that would be somewhere between 30% and 35%, but you know, Nigel, the steepness of the curve and the downturn has been significant. So getting to cost out and holding to those lower decrementals is a challenge right now.","Nigel Coe","Right, right. Exactly. So I\u2019ll leave energy that I had. I\u2019m sure other people will come back to that. In terms of refrigeration, obviously a lot of your competitors have been calling out it trends well. So I\u2019m just wondering, I understand some of the commentary around the customers but it seems like a general market pause here. So I\u2019m just wondering what is your perspective on what\u2019s causing this pause? What gives you confidence, it\u2019s going to come back and can you maybe just talk about market share as well? Do you feel you hold market share here?","Bob Livingston","Nigel, hi. This is Bob.","Nigel Coe","Hi Bob.","Bob Livingston","I\u2019m going to add -- I'm going to take you question but I\u2019m going to add something to your earlier question on the energy margins. I will tell you that with everything we\u2019re working on with all of the cost takes out that the teams are working on with all of their product development activity that their teams are working on and the opportunities that they think they have in front of them here over the next two to three months, our objective is to exit the year with something very, very close to 20% operating margin. That\u2019s not the second half. I\u2019m saying exit the year. So I\u2019m really speaking to the fourth quarter. And I think we have a lot of confidence not just here with Brad and myself but with the business team leaders that we can do that with an energy.","Refrigeration, I\u2019m -- I have been sort of restrained on talking about this over the past year. But I need to take the refrigeration story back to about this time last year, the April-May time last year. And we received notice from Wal-Mart, who has been a very, very significant and good customer for Dover and for Hill PHOENIX and for Anthony for several years that in their global bid, we were not going to participate in their next cycle for their large format stores.","That is starting to show up in our first quarter, first half 2015, full year revenue and order activity. Nigel, the impact of that, it\u2019s -- first off, it\u2019s not all of the business that we enjoy and appreciate with Wal-Mart. I think last year we did about $300 million with Wal-Mart. But it does have an impact on this year\u2019s revenue load with Wal-Mart of about $100 million.","We have known that since last spring. We were not sure of the timing of the cutover or the transition and we\u2019ve been working pretty feverishly within the business to back fill and to capture additional market share from other national and regional accounts and we feel good with that progress. But the impact in 2015 on a refrigeration segment is about $100 million reduction with Wal-Mart activity and we feel that we have back fill that with about $60 million to $70 million of new business that we have captured year-to-date though it\u2019s not showing up in our order rates.","Nigel Coe","Well, thanks Bob. That\u2019s great color. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Good morning guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning Andrew.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on pumps. Just want to understand what these delays have to do. I guess, you mentioned chemicals from the guidance that seems that you guys fully expect to get it back, just would like to get more color here?","Bob Livingston","Okay. First, I wouldn\u2019t use the word delays. Part of the tough comp and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to in the first quarter is that we had significant project shipments in the first quarter. And if you go back and look at our notes, the notes in the script from last year, I think Brad we may have reported organic growth last year in the first quarter of 12% to 14%. And we told you then it was significantly boosted by project shipments with a couple of our businesses.","It sort of -- we went back to -- I think 1% or 2% organic growth rate in the second quarter of last year. And you really have to look at the two quarters as an average to get a feel for the typical run rate for the pumps businesses. You are going to see that again in the first half of this year only it\u2019s flipped. Lower organic growth rates in the first quarter against their tough comp last year. And you\u2019ll see a much higher organic growth rate out of the fluids business and our pumps businesses in the second quarter of this year.","Andrew Obin","Got you. So when you say\u2026","Bob Livingston","It\u2019s simply is just a timing of project shipments. I\u2019m sorry. Yeah.","Andrew Obin","Got you. That makes perfect sense. The other question I had, a lot of companies are sort of talking about this CapEx delays, sort of, global CapEx delays this quarter. Yet if I look at your printing and ID business, it seems to be doing quite well. Can you just talk a little bit more about this dichotomy between CapEx and maybe something more consumer-driven spending that you were seeing?","Brad Cerepak","Well, I think that -- I think you just summarized the difference. I wouldn\u2019t label the bulk of our product -- of our printing and identification business as CapEx. So a piece of it, especially within our digital print business is surely there. But bulk of it being Markem-Imaje, we would not label as typical CapEx spend. It really is an operating expenditure with our customers.","We had very strong organic growth in the quarter in that platform 8%. It was across the board with all three businesses. In fact, I think Markem-Imaje, which is obviously our largest business within that platform was 6% organic growth for the quarter. So which -- good quarter and we expect it to continue for the year. We think that\u2019s a very solid business for us for this year.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Steven Winoker","Just on energy, what rig count assumptions are baked into your revised guidance now?","Brad Cerepak","Lower than they are today.","Steven Winoker","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","We have -- let's say as we said here, as we said here in the call, I think the latest data point I have quoting, Steve, I\u2019m quoting a U.S. number. I think as of last week, the U.S. rig count was down to 9.50 or 9.54. While a much, much sharper, steeper decline over the last four months than we anticipated three and four months ago. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to bottom out. I don\u2019t think anybody does. We feel fairly -- we feel very comfortable with forecast we have for energy for this rig count to go a bit lower.","I think I will tell you that if the rig count does pierce below the 900 level, we have additional actions that we need to take beyond what we have contemplated so far in the second quarter. And we will take them.","Steven Winoker","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","But our -- we feel comfortable right now with the plan we have -- with the plan we have in place and the actions we\u2019ve taken over the previous two quarters, the actions we\u2019re taking here in the second quarter, we feel pretty comfortable that our businesses are right sized to deal with the 900 level or perhaps a bit lower if it pierces that significantly, we have other actions we need to take.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And then on pricing, we\u2019re hearing from a number of your peers about pricing pressures from both currency as well as of course in energy that are on the way. And how are you guys thinking about it and seeing and dealing with that?","Brad Cerepak","Okay. I have to -- I confess I missed the first part of that question. Can you repeat\u2026","Steven Winoker","I\u2019m asking about pricing pressure that we\u2019re hearing from\u2026.","Brad Cerepak","Pricing pressure.","Steven Winoker","\u2026that we\u2019re hearing from your peers\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Steven Winoker","\u2026about and whether or not you are -- whether or not you are seeing anything yet and even if you\u2019re not, you are anticipating it, how are you dealing with it, both currency and energy driven?","Bob Livingston","Yes. We are experiencing it, and yes, we continue to anticipate it. I think, everyone, all of the supply base and the -- especially here in North America in the oil and gas market has dealt with, I will use the phrase either price pressure to significant price pressure over the last three or four months from especially the important customers, our larger customers, we\u2019ve dealt with it, we deal with it on a -- in an account sometimes even a field-by-field basis. And it is -- the type of discussion we have varies significantly from product line to product line.","And the -- in the first three or four months of this year we have seen more engaging discussions and you could interpret engaging as you wish, but we've been incurred more engaging discussions around our PDC inserts in our Sucker Rod products, more so than some of our other products. We do have price concessions still to be negotiated in our forecast for the year.","But I think, the experience we had in the first quarter gives us some confident that we can deal with them and still exit the year at a something close to a 20% operating margin for our Energy business.","To size this for you, I think, in the in the first quarter it was, Brad, somewhere around 2% for the segment and -- this is not a product commentary, this is a segment number about a 2% price impact for the segment in the first quarter. And for the entire year we are fully prepared to deal with a 3% to 5% price concession and it is in our forecast.","Steven Winoker","Great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey, Bob, you said the second quarter would be the lowest revenue of quarter for Energy, is that sort of the end of destocking or seasonality or any other reason you feel like at the bottom?","Bob Livingston","Yeah. I am going to label it as the destocking impact more than the seasonality of the business, Shannon. I'm -- I would say that for both our PDC inserts, as well as our Sucker Rod business that the destocking we believe we'll see the bulk of the destocking activity occur between February and May. In fact, some of our customers are signaling now pretty strongly that the second quarter will see the end of their stocking activity.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great. And then it sounds -- yeah..","Bob Livingston","It\u2019s been insignificant. And I\u2019ll give you one example, Shannon. It's probably been most prevalent within our PDC inserts business. In fact, the first quarter our revenue with our PDC inserts business was down 43%. And I think about two-thirds of that was related to reduce activity in the oil and gas markets here in North America. I think the other one-third was destocking.","I think we'll see that continue during the second quarter. But I think by the time we get through the second quarter that we will see the disappearance of the destocking activity in the second half of the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, in terms of capital deployments, you sound pretty optimistic about some deals in the second half of the year. Any color there on sort of magnitude a focus areas of what you are looking at?","Bob Livingston","Well, so you noticed my comment was in the second half of the year, not the second quarter. So, obviously, nothing is close to closing right now, so I'm going to defer any specific color and size comments perhaps until the July call.","We are fairly -- we\u2019ve got a fairly active pipeline in three of our four segments, the one being absent is Energy and it's not that we would not be interested in adding to a couple of product areas, especially around automation. But the -- I would say, there\u2019s been a scarcity of attractive properties and businesses that have come to market here in the first four or five months of the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Wright with Nomura Securities.","Jonathan Wright","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Jonathan Wright","Can you just talk me through on restructuring size for Energy? How\u2019s this playbook evolve, can you talk through, what the first place you go to in 4Q, is it way you look to expand that through the course of the year, just closing service facilities, how do you -- where would you go as the sort of downturn evolves?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So you want me to go back to the fourth quarter.","Jonathan Wright","Well, just talk through the, what\u2019s the initial response than incrementally what can you add on to take cost out of the business?","Bob Livingston","So let\u2019s say from the beginning of the fourth quarter through the end of the first quarter headcount reduction within Energy is slightly over a 1000 employees and I don't have the exact number. But I do know it's like 15.5% of our employee base that existed at the beginning of the fourth quarter.","In the early days and I would label that as a fourth quarter most of those headcount reductions, I would say, were, well, like not all hourly, but it was really related to reducing output capacity that we were anticipating. So let\u2019s call it variable type of activity.","And we\u2019ve seen a much healthier -- heavier load here in the first quarter on SG&A. The one thing we haven't touched yet and I want to emphasize this, I want to emphasize both parts of that statement. We haven\u2019t touched and then yet is product development in R&D. And we have been, I have been, we\u2019ve all been rather moved to reduce the ongoing product development and innovation work we are doing within, within these key businesses.","As I mentioned earlier, if we see rig count prepares the 900 level and drops significantly below that, then I would say we start to look at some other cost decisions that up until now I have, we have been reluctant to pursue.","Jonathan Wright","Okay. Great. That was perfect. On the Fluid transfer size, I think sales growth adds, still looking very strong. Is there any risk to OPW from the four O'Neil pricing, some of that railcar business, is there any change in customer behaviour within the Fluid transfer fees?","Bob Livingston","Yes, a little bit, we have. I don't remember now the exact numbers but we actually have taken down our expectations in the second half of the year on our -- both our over the road as well as rail cargo activities that\u2019s related to rail transport. It's not a significant piece of our business. In fact, I would give you this data point for the entire segment, not just fluid transfer.","This is for the entire segment of Fluids. About 10% of the Fluids revenue is exposed to let\u2019s see -- I guess the right phrase here is oil and gas oil & gas upstream CapEx activity. And that 10%, it\u2019s about half in North America and about half outside of North America. We have seen a little bit of that decline, especially within our pumps business in the first quarter.","We think we\u2019ve had that decline appropriately sized and anticipated for the balance of the year. But even with that, we see strong growth potentials in some of our other markets and verticals. And we\u2019ve got a fairly health organic growth rate, not just for fluid transfer but for the entire segment, for the year. We feel pretty comfortable with this segment.","Jonathan Wright","Thanks. Great. Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Thank you.","Bob Livingston","Hi Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. You called out mix as a margin headwind in all the segments except Engineered Systems. I guess within Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment in particular, how quickly do you think that mix headwind on margins can reverse?","Bob Livingston","Well. Okay. Let\u2019s deal with it, I guess specifically within Fluids. Brad may be able to size this better than I can. I\u2019m sitting here doing just for recall. But the mix would be yes. The margins were down a bit because of mix. But we are not talking a 150 basis points or anything think like that. I think we are talking maybe 20 or 30 basis points on mix, so it was rather modest. And it will just -- it just work its way through the product line. There is nothing unique or nothing alarming in the first quarter activity.","Julian Mitchell","I think it\u2019s sort of a tough comp.","Bob Livingston","Yeah. It has a lot more to do with the tough comps from the first quarter of last year. But let me give you a commercial or an advertisement here for our performance in Fluids. Margins in the first quarter, I think were 16 in a fraction. Operating margins, we do have in our objective for the year, operating margin for the Fluids segment to be 20%.","And we know that\u2019s a tough reach for the business teams. But we believe we will be very, very close to the 20% operating margins for the year. And you are going to see some rather market improvement in margins from the segment, especially in the second and third quarters.","Julian Mitchell","Great. And then just circling back to capital allocation, just the size of what you think you can spend. I mean is it fair to say that you are looking to deploy this year the free cash flow after dividend and the sort of $100 million or so extra from divestment proceeds? So that\u2019s maybe $600 million plus you could use on deals in the second half?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Look, let me just tweak that statement. You should look at the share repurchase activity for this year. And my goodness, we\u2019ve said these six times over the last two quarters that the number will be $600 million. It\u2019s primarily being funded by divestiture of the two businesses that we have announced here in the first quarter, one that\u2019s closed in the first quarter and the second one that will close here sometime in the next few weeks. So that\u2019s really funding the share repurchase activity. So after CapEx and after dividends, we still have a fairly healthy cash flow that\u2019s available for M&A allocation for the balance of the year. And Brad and I will go in a room and arm wrestle as to how much more he allows me to spend if the opportunities present themselves.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Who usually wins the arm wrestle?","Brad Cerepak","Bob does.","Bob Livingston","You have to understand. I\u2019m right handed and Brad is left handed. We do arm wrestle with the right hand.","Nathan Jones","Just following on to your answer to Julian\u2019s question that with the 20% targeted margins for Fluids from the year, 16 and a fraction in the first quarter, there looks to be some seasonality in the margins in 2Q and 3Q. But that\u2019s a pretty healthy target. Can you maybe give us some more color on how you get to 20% for the full year?","Bob Livingston","Actually, there is a little bit of seasonality in the Fluids business. We typically see the second and the third quarters being the high revenue quarters for the entire segment and that will hold true again this year. So some of the -- some of it will come from growth and volume leverage, some of it is the increased revenue level we see in the second and third quarter.","But here I\u2019ve got -- I have to give credit here to the business team and to our segment leadership team, very, very focused on productivity and cost takeouts as we grow the business. And we are making very good progress there. There is no silver bullet. It\u2019s just a lot of blocking and tackling and good execution on productivity.","Nathan Jones","So you would say then it\u2019s primarily cost out and productivity improvements and that is things that are in your control?","Bob Livingston","Yes. The volume, the organic growth rate for the segment for the year is 5% to 7%. That type of volume on top of our productivity initiatives is a pretty powerful combination.","Nathan Jones","What\u2019s your level of confidence that actually making that? I know you said it was a bit of stretch goal at actually making that 20% for the full year.","Bob Livingston","I feel fairly confident sitting here today.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Fair enough. If we just look at the drilling and production business again here, can you maybe talk about the difference in the pricing pressure at US Synthetic versus the artificial lift businesses given the steep decline in US Synthetic at the moment?","Bob Livingston","Well, it\u2019s easy for me to give you the example for our PVC inserts because for all intends and purposes, it\u2019s a single product business. You get into artificial lift and my goodness is that the product portfolio there is not just very broad from an application point of view, it\u2019s pretty broad from a -- it\u2019s even broader from a product point of view.","I did state earlier that up until now we\u2019ve seen the bulk of the price pressure and I\u2019m not saying the bulk of the discussions but the bulk of the price pressure to be most evident around PVCs as well as sucker rods. And I would expect that statement to hold true for the second half as well.","Nathan Jones","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Bob Livingston","I really don\u2019t want to talk about the pricing on specific products.","Nathan Jones","Okay. And just a quick one for Brad, is there any of the step-up purchase price accounting left to get through and accelerated in the second quarter?","Brad Cerepak","No. Mostly it\u2019s behind us. Again, this was the inventory turn in the fourth quarter of 2014 into the first quarter. So that\u2019s behind us at this point in time.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Jeff.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague","Good morning. Just wondering if you could touch based a little bit on the change in automation. And I guess there is a couple threads to my thought, but we\u2019re seeing these stories out of Baker Hughes and others about wells being drilled and not completed and kind of decontenting and the like. Is that what is going on with the automation business? Or is it just simply kind of the first rig count as we\u2019re just catching up with the business?","Bob Livingston","Well, I think it\u2019s both of those items. I see different statistics. The latest one I saw, I think over the weekend was an estimate that perhaps as many of the -- even with the reduced activity environment that we\u2019re in that perhaps as many as 20% of the wells that were drilled in the first quarter are waiting to be completed at some future date. So obviously that has some impact not only on our artificial lift business but also on our automation business.","There is a little bit of a detail here that I think is important to understand that there is one product area within our automation portfolio that I would label it as being down-hole. Everything else all over other product offerings and productivity packages and solution offerings are all top of well or field type of automation products and solutions. The one product that is down-hole has probably seen a decline similar to what I shared on the earlier question, similar to what we\u2019ve seen with our PVC inserts, it\u2019s in the 40% range, Jeff.","Brad Cerepak","Clearly, I would add there, Jeff, that we thought this business would be more resilient because of the expectations around productivity at the wellhead and continued completions which \u2026","Bob Livingston","And we still believe that.","Brad Cerepak","And we still believe that and we just think it\u2019s is a bit delayed.","Bob Livingston","We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s with the significant inventory of uncompleted wells. The one thing I will share with you Jeff is that we are not forecasting -- we are not forecasting a sudden surge in the second half of these uncompleted wells coming online to be completed. We have not forecast that with our automation business and we have not forecast that with our artificial lift business.","Jeff Sprague","So that should imply that drilling should fall further, right if people are not going to\u2026","Bob Livingston","No doubt, but I will tell you. Brad made a comment that our energy segment in the second quarter will be the low quarter of the year. And from a revenue perspective, we see a further drop in the second quarter in both drilling activity as well as our artificial lift activity. That said because of the significant amount of destocking, we actually believe we\u2019re becoming convinced that there is going to be a slight recovery. And I emphasize the word and I put it in caps, slight recovery in our drilling activity in the second half of the year.","And I think it\u2019s we just look at that as this destocking activity for PDC Inserts. Jeff, I cannot emphasize how significant it has been in the last couple of months. And further destocking anticipated here in the second quarter but we do believe it comes to an end here with the second quarter.","Brad Cerepak","I think it\u2019s been steeper.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Brad Cerepak","And more significant than what we saw during the recession time.","Bob Livingston","Correct.","Brad Cerepak","And then attributable in my mind to this destocking, right.","Jeff Sprague","And just a follow-up back to fluids then?","Bob Livingston","Back to what?","Jeff Sprague","Back to fluids.","Bob Livingston","Fluids, yes.","Jeff Sprague","Yeah. So in December you were guiding margins up 80 to 100 basis points and I\u2019m not sure exactly what the date is, right? There\u2019s a few things moving around but the organic growth, look it\u2019s about the same. Can you just give us a little bit more -- I mean, you always have seasonality, right. I mean, what is that would drive such a step function change in your view on margins and fluid. And is 20% in your guidance or that\u2019s an aspirational target?","Brad Cerepak","I think embedded in our guidance is an execution on margins that is very, very close to the 20% number that I told you is our objective.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah. its about of 80 basis point from give or take, 50 to 80 basis points from where we were in the last guide is really driven by -- like Bob said, execution and productivity initiatives. And we did take some restructuring in this segment and have been working on our cost for the last two quarters \u2026","Bob Livingston","Even longer.","Brad Cerepak","\u2026.little bit longer and I think that\u2019s going to show.","Jeff Sprague","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I know we covered a lot of ground here. Just looking back, Bob, at your comments, I\u2019d be interested in hearing any additional color regarding that last business with Wal-Mart. I know what happened a while ago but you gave us some insight there but maybe just reflect on why did you miss that business? Were there any lessons? And then the new business you\u2019ve got, the $60 million to $70 million with those new customers. And just any kind of color there would be helpful? Thanks.","Bob Livingston","So to put it pretty bluntly, Deane, when we went through -- when our teams went through that global bid exercise and let say that would have been --and oh gosh, second half of \u201813 even though we were not informed of the customer decision until the spring of \u201814. We made a decision we did not want to chase the price down as low as the price was going. It was really that simple.","It was not a product decision. It was not a feature decision. It was not a capacity decision and it was not a technology decision. It really was a pricing decision. I want to put this in a broader context here. I\u2019ve shared with you what our objective is as we exit the year on margins for energy and I told you what our objective is for the year on margins for fluids.","We continue to make very, very good progress within the businesses and the segment within engineered systems on margin improvement and this has been a significant discussion with the leadership teams within refrigeration and fluid equipment to improve the margins. And you\u2019ll see a little bit of an improvement in margins with refrigeration and fluid equipment this year, I think we have more to do.","And I would like to think as we go through. As we go through 2015 and \u201816, you will see us execute on that objective on margin improvements within refrigeration. And at the pricing level that was being offered or I would, maybe more appropriate put it at the pricing level that this order activity, this award was led at, we just found it unattractive.","Deane Dray","That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ve already spent a lot of time for questions and answers. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Angie. This concludes our conference call for the first quarter.

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us to this morning's conference call. Let's gets started on Slide 3. Q1 organic revenue was up 8.3% for the quarter, driven by very strong performance in our fluid segment, solid trading conditions in engineering systems, and modern improvement in Refrigeration & Food Equipment markets with food retail business, posting top line growth for the first time in six quarters.","Adjusted segment earnings increased 24% to $251 million, 230 basis point improvement over the comparable period driven by cost cash and carry forward, good performance on price realization versus input costs headwinds and volume leverage across the portfolio. Adjusted Q1 earnings were up 29% to $182 million and adjusted EPS of $1.24 per share was up 38%. Discrete tasks items added $0.06 of favorable EPS impact.","As announced, we completed the divestiture of Finder pump manufacturer, serving the upstream oil and gas industry. This asset is still reflected in our Q1 results and we recorded a loss on sale of $47 million, which reflects the write-off of intangible assets and the elimination of accumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment or CTA as required by accounting standards.","Overall, we're pleased to get off to a good start in 2019. Demand remains robust across much of the portfolio. We are delivering on our cost programs, incremental margins on volumes for the most part solid, and we are pleased with the bookings increased in Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment. There remains much to do to deliver on our full year objectives, but it's encouraging to get out of the blocks with positive momentum.","And I'll hand it over from Brad from here.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Rich. Good morning everyone. Let's go through the details starting on Slide 4. Revenue grew 5% to $1.7 billion and as mentioned, it was driven by strong demand in Engineered Systems and Fluids and improvement in Refrigeration. GAAP EPS increased 3% to $0.72.","Moving to non-GAAP results. As mentioned, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBIT and margin all increased substantially, reflecting solid margin conversion on growth and cost actions. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $317 million or 18.4%.","Key adjustments for non-GAAP results this quarter were acquisition-related amortization, loss on assets held for sale related to Finder and restructuring and other expenses. The EPS increase was supported by $0.06 or $8.4 million of discrete tax benefits versus $0.03 in the first quarter of the prior year.","Turning to Slide 5. Let's get into a little more detail on our revenue and bookings results in the quarter. As mentioned in our summary, organic growth was strong at 8.3% with all three segments seen positive organic top line momentum. The impact from FX was a 3.4% headwind.","From a segment perspective, Engineered Systems grew $39 million or approximately 6% organically and Fluids grew $95 million or 15% organically on broad-based activity across both segments. Refrigeration & Food Equipments revenue increased $2 million which represents 0.7% organic growth.","Organic bookings were essentially flat year-over-year. All-in bookings declined $42 million or 2% versus the first quarter of the prior year primarily due to FX headwinds. Backlog increased 5% compared to the end of Q4, most notably in Refrigeration & Food Equipment.","Organic bookings for Engineered Systems declined $33 million or approximately 4% driven by expected reduction in new order inflow in our industrial businesses, particularly, environmental solutions group, which had a large backlog increase last quarter.","Organic bookings in Fluids increased $29 million or 4% with strong order activity in pumps and process solutions, while retail fueling and transport continue to work through the backlog from last year. Bookings in Refrigeration & Food Equipment grew $6 million organically. Rich will provide additional color on performance in some of the individual businesses later.","Finally, overall book-to-bill finished at 1.03, reflecting healthy orders across our segments. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. our largest market grew 7% organically where we saw a strong growth in Engineered Systems and Fluids. Europe was up 14% organically with strong performance across all segments and Asia was up 5%.","Within Asia, China grew 1% organically driven by growth in our Fluid segment offset by a slight decline in Engineered System. The rest of Asia, which represents a revenue base about the size of China for us, grew at 9% primarily driven by Fluids.","Let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 6. Starting on the top. Engineered Systems adjusted segment EBITDA improved 19 million, largely driven by strong conversion on broad based revenue growth across the segment, more than offsetting headwinds from FX.","Fluids EBITDA growth of 32 million reflects a combination of robust growth continued margin improvement in retail fueling as well as strong conversion on volume and other businesses. The 3 million decline at Refrigeration & Food Equipment reflects lower volume in Belvac as well as unfavorable shift in business mix.","Additionally, our broad base rightsizing initiatives have been delivering savings as expected and improved margins across all segments. Going to the bottom chart, adjusted earnings from continuing operations improved 41 million or 29%, primarily driven by higher segment earnings offset by higher taxes. Interest expense was lower in the quarter.","Now going to Slide 7. Free cash flow for the quarter was a reasonably expected negative 13 million, which is an improvement over last year. The first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash flow quarter. In the quarter, strong top line growth was supported by working capital investment of 138 million, with over two-thirds of the year-over-year change, driven by increased accounts receivable. Capital expenditures was 37 million.","With that, I'll hand it back to Rich.","Richard Tobin","All right, thanks Brad. I'm on Slide 9. Engineered Systems had a solid broad base quarter with top line organic growth of 5.8%. Incremental margin conversion in the quarter was very strong driven by volume leverage, productivity improvements and cost actions. Our Printing & ID business delivered strong organic growth with double-digit growth in digital printing. Despite the weak GD prints in Europe, demand in the region is robust during the quarter for this platform.","The industrial platform performed well with most businesses posting mid-to high-single-digit growth rates. Our ESG business continued to deliver strong growth on unit delivers. But more importantly, we're very pleased with the traction the business is getting in assistance and software products. TWG and MPG contributed mid single digit growth and margin expansion supported by constructed demands in the respective end markets.","Trading conditions in our vehicle services industrial clamps businesses are more challenging largely as a result of input cost headwinds and exposure towards European markets. Going into Q2 bookings for Engineering Systems remain solid. The segment posted book-to-bill above one. In Fluids, the segment posted organic growth of 15% for the quarter with the majority of the portfolio posting double-digit growth rates. Incremental margin was 43%.","As volume leverage, increased productivity and cost controls more than offset the impact of unfavorable product and geographic mix and inflation. Our pumps and process solutions business had an excellent quarter with organic growth rate of 10%. Volume conversion was significantly accretive to platform margins as a result of good price and productivity versus cost ratio and improved mix of products and services delivered.","Fueling and transport posted exceptional top line growth of 20% as demand remained robust and production performance in our operations gained traction. Margin conversion on volume was improved quarter-to-quarter and we expect that trend to continue to the balance of the year as we track towards meeting our margin objectives that we had targeted in September.","Moving onto Refrigeration & Food Equipment, organic revenue was up 1%, improved bookings in the fourth quarter translated into Q1 organic revenue growth of 1.9% in food retail, which was the first positive revenue rating in the last six quarters.","Quotation and booking activity in food and retail remain constructive with the book-to-bill of 1.15, particularly in core refrigerated case product line and was in line with expectations in the first quarter. Unified Brands faced slower demand at the beginning of the year in the institutional market, but the environment has been progressively improving and the business has posted single digit growth in Q1.","Margin performance for quarter was negatively impacted by volume at Belvac customer mix translation from SWEP and transitory product redesign cost in the food retail as we prepare for a large automation project. If current trends continue, we remain cautiously optimistic for improved revenue performance in 2019 for the segment in line with the expectations we've included in our annual guidance.","On Slide 12 reconciles the key components of the comparable 38% increase in adjusted EPS. As we have forecasted, key contributors are delivering on a cost program and margin conversion on growth and to a lesser extent, it's rebasing our share count and tax benefits. As we noted, we've indicated the discrete tax impact on the EPS and consider our -- that'll put us at the low end of our ETR, our expected tax rate for the full year.","Reflecting solid demand conditions that we see in the markets, we have increased our organic growth guidance by 1% in Fluids and Engineering Systems, and reiterate our prior guidance for Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Despite the negative 300 basis points foreign exchange translation headwinds to revenue in the first quarter, our full year estimate is 100 to 200 basis points. Dover has delivered on the solid start for the year which allows us to reiterate our full year guidance of $5.65 to $5.85 per share.","To wrap up, Dover is maintaining solid momentum as it represented by our Q1 organic growth rate, solid bookings and backlogs across most of our portfolio, and margin expansion driven by volume, productivity and cost initiatives. We continue delivering on our commitments for improved performance, reinvestment in our growth platforms and disciplined portfolio management and capital deployment.","With that, let's moving on to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","One of the questions we've been getting from investors this morning is that. Very nice beat in Q1. You've raised organic growth number for the year. Yet you kept the EPS. What are the headwinds do you have more concerns about second half, just if you could give us more color about the modeling process here for 2019?","Richard Tobin","Alright, couple of things. We're clearly tracking towards the top end of the range at this point. I think that we're pleased with Q1's results. And it's always off to get -- it's always good to get off to a good start because we don't want to be in a position of chasing a comparative fourth quarter that we had last year. So to the extent that we're getting in front and we're in front last year because of the fact of production performance and DFS by our ability to a couple of things.","If you look at the backlogs, there's some concern about the backlog is going down. But I would tell you that in ESG that particular business grew by 11% in the first quarter. So the conversion and the availability of our chassis was there, so we're able to convert on the revenue side and then you've got the backlog is going down in engineering systems, but we don't find that problematic because order covers in that particular segment goes well into the third quarter.","In DFS, as you know, we've been struggling in terms of output. We had a high backlog exit of Q4. Production performance in DFS was excellent. So, it's another business that grew in the high, grew 17% in the first quarter. So, backlogs are going to come down because of production performance. I think the good news on the ESG conversion was the margin conversion rate was satisfactory. I think that we have work to do because we would have expected for the more, the accretive margins and DFS to be higher. I think we've got a plan to track that through the balance of the year.","So overall, it's not a question of us being overly concerned about the metrics of backlogs. It's just purely a question of. We've got range -- we've got a range up to 585 a share. We're tracking towards that. We'd like to get another quarter under our belts so we get some visibility into Q4. And I'm sure we'll give an update at that point.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question, how has your thinking, your stock is up, everybody else stock is up. How do you think about cash in 2019 and within your previous range? And also how do you think about cash deployments in 2019? And has your thinking evolved given that the world is changing?","Richard Tobin","We don't necessarily make decisions on share place as it relates to cash deployment. I think that we've clearly got a bias for inorganic growth and we've got some things in the pipeline. So to the extent that we can use our available cash, there we will. If we are unable to find inorganic opportunities then clearly we would average in terms of share buyback. So, overall, I think our thinking is consistent on that matter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","In terms of I guess the Refrigeration & Food Equipment business, margins slightly down there despite the encouraging organic top line performance. How should we think about margins in that division for the year as a whole? And how quickly should we expect those margins to start to grow year-on-year when looking at the balance of 2019?","Julian Mitchell","Okay, Julian. Well, it's moving parts here, right? So part of the margin decline is on translation from our SWEP business, which is levered mostly towards Europe and Asia. So, you've got some translations decline there. Belvac, I think that we went through that in some details end of Q4. We said as part of our guidance for 2019 that we didn't have a lot of visibility for Belvac of the comps in the first half of the year. We're probably going to be poor and we'll see what happens in the second half of the year. That view is not changed.","So that is dilutive to comparable margins year-over-year. The Refrigeration business, it's a bit of a tale of two cities. We're happy with the volume being up modestly. So that's going to be helpful to us, but we are doing a lot of work on that business in preparation for a large capital project that we're going to be initiating this year. So, we had some transitory cost on product redesign to allow that transition to happen. I think that we're well beyond that. So, we're thinking that we're probably going to get margin accretion going forward in the refrigeration platform.","Julian Mitchell","And then secondly, when we're thinking about Fluids business, you did take up the organic growth guide slightly. You've got a very tough comp in the fourth quarter coming up. Maybe just talk about how you see fueling and transport playing out over the balance of the year in that context? And any updated thoughts around the EMV build out within the U.S. specifically?","Richard Tobin","Sure. Well, I think you put your finger on it to a certain extent. We have a tough comp coming in Q4 and we have a lot of visibility into Q4. So depending on how this business develops and how EMV develops over the year, there is an opportunity for us to raise our revenue in that particular segment but we like to see some visibility there and be cautious only because the math works against us in Q4.","Comments on EMV, the only thing that's been different for us so far is, we're shipping more full dispensary units than kits. So, we're getting more revenue, but that's actually dilutive to margins. So, we'll take it as it comes. I don't think the total value is about where we'd expected it to be, but I think that the mix that value is slightly different.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Rich, Europe up 14%, I think it was up 10% last quarter. You mentioned the strength in marking and coding, digital printing in particular. How are you able to maintain the stable momentum despite the weaker backdrop? Is it just really led by stricter regulation? And from what you could tell does the growth seems sustainable here?","Richard Tobin","Yes, look, I mean, that's why I put it in the prepared remarks because that's the way that we look it here too. We're getting weak GDP prints out of Europe and we're taking that into account of our own forecast. But I think we'll just need to recognize that Europe is levered towards auto and machinery, and those markets are under pressure. And that necessarily is linked in any way to marking and coding.","So, to a certain extent, marking and coding is not part of the process that's giving kind of pressure to European GDP prints. Look, we'll take it where we, as long as we can get it. It ends up being a business like digital printing. All of its revenue is European, but despite the fact that shifts globally. So, it ends up being recognized as European revenue. So, it's a bit of a misnomer to a certain extent.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, let me ask you the opposite question then around China. It seems like China has been decelerating to your little, Fluids up, Engineered Systems down. Can you give us some more color on marking and coding in China? Is there anything concerning going on there? I mean, do you still expect China to be up for the year for Dover on the strength in Fluids?","Richard Tobin","Look, the environment is clearly slowed. We are up when it was a 1% for the quarter. Right now, I would expect it to be up for the year in consolidation whether it's slightly down in certain segments and slightly up in other. It's hard to say right now because we're working at 100 basis points. But overall, we would expect it to be up for the year. I don't really have a view on Printing & ID at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Rich, on the automation project in Refrigeration in particular. Is this something you're going live on now as we speak, I think you said the preparation is behind you? And I'm just wondering about kind of managing through that on kind of a peak season as it were for Refrigeration?","Richard Tobin","Yes, we're not going to become operational until Q1 of '20. What we're doing now is intervening on the configuration of the product itself to accommodate that change. So, which is part of the question on we've incurred some costs to allow for that transition. In terms of, if the volume goes up, are we going to get caught with our pants down to a certain extent?","I think that we're lucky that we have adequate footprints to initiate this project, not at the same -- in the same physical location that we make the product at this time. So, we're reasonably comfortable that we're going to be able to accommodate any shift in demand during '19, if it comes, that we're not going to get caught sideways here.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right, and on the factory issues in fueling. Are those completely behind you at this point? Or are there still some -- you're always going to be looking for efficiencies, but kind of the big obvious problems are those largely fixed now?","Richard Tobin","Well, I think that the management deserves a lot of credit in terms of being able to get the throughput out. So part of the reason that the revenue was higher than we had forecasted into one is that we were being cautious in our ability to get the throughput out of those two main principle factories and they got them out. So, that's the good news.","The not so good news is. The margin conversion on that volume is not entirely satisfactory. I think that we've got a plan to increase margins throughout the rest of the year. But look, we're able to get the units out and that's important. Now, we need to kind of grind down on efficiency on top of that volume leverage.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just one last one from me. In terms of like cleaning out the closet from an asset standpoint, I mean, the Finder was a particularly bad deal legacy item obviously. But is there much more that that you're kind of breaking through kind of the smaller assets?","Richard Tobin","Nothing, that looks like Finder.","Operator","Your question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Good execution so far. On kind of the free cash flow, actually better than last year seasonally. How do we -- how should we kind of think about the seasonality of that free cash relative to prior years with everything that's going on? Should it be kind of roughly in line with what would what happened last year? Just kind of wanted to get some color on how 2Q and 3Q we're going to play out.","Richard Tobin","One would hope that we don't wait till Q4 to get it all like last year and we're kind of progressively -- look, if I look at Q1, the inventory change relative to last year is lot smaller. So, which is a reflection of our ability to convert and I just answer the question about what we are doing in DFS and ESG. So, that's a function of not having industrial inventory because our conversion rates are going up. That I would expect, should improve through the year.","On the receivables balance side, I guess it's a question of what do we think about revenues for the year and what do we think about fourth quarter? Right now, I like where we are right now with the strong Q1. I would have -- the fear around here was to kind of get through it and have to have and be forced into a position to get to the top end of our guidance of having another massive Q4.","Now, we've brought some room there, so we've got an opportunity to look at how demand and backlogs developed over the year. Quite frankly if we get caught out a little bit on receivables because our volumes way up, I'll take the tradeoff between earnings and receivables. But I think that the core improvement that we can expect here is on the inventory side.","Charles Tusa","And then just looking back to the fourth quarter and the strong orders. Is there anything -- any kind of pre-buy dynamics that you noticed there based on the tariffs and price increases just broadly?","Richard Tobin","Yes, it's really hard to say. I think there is probably a little bit of an element of that because we've been trying to get price. So, as we're announcing price increases that drives let's get in front of that to a certain extent. In DFS in particular, I think it's no -- we've been pretty forthright that we were having issues about getting the throughput out of our factories, so that was building up a backlog for us. And that's a lot of what cleared in Q1. So that kind of normalizes backlog, if you will. It's hard to say, I mean I think by the end of this next quarter, we're probably have a really clear idea of where we are. But right now, we're never comfortable, but we feel good about the backlogs that we have across the portfolio.","Charles Tusa","Okay, one last one on EMV. Any update on kind of the trajectory there accelerating, decelerating the back part of the year? Any updates on the EMV transition?","Richard Tobin","As you listened to the comment before about dispensers versus kits, it looks like it's decelerating, because the last guys in are going to be kit-only and kind of our kit-only shipments right now are relatively low. So, it seems to be stretching out further.","Charles Tusa","So, you're already kind of seeing deceleration, but it's a -- like you said before, it's kind of an elongated cycle. So, that's pretty different than what I think was the original assumption six months ago, which was very strong kind of '19 and then drop off, right?","Richard Tobin","Yes, I think, but you've got -- it's a mix in revenue question. Right now, revenue looks great because we're doing the entire systems right.","Charles Tusa","Yes.","Richard Tobin","The margins around the kits and I think it's pretty intuitive, it says the last guys in aren't going to do a complete referb, they're just going to do the kits. So, I think that in our estimates and it's a funny one right, because the revenues less and the margins up. So, it's accretive to margins but dilutive to trajectory and revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Rich, I was hoping you could give us the update progress report Phase 1, Phase 2, and then on the benefits we see they're lumped into corporate. How will they be spread over the segments for this quarter?","Richard Tobin","Okay, I think, I understood the first question. I'm going to need some clarification on the second one. Where we are and you're talking about footprint?","Deane Dray","Yes, right.","Richard Tobin","We are -- look, what we've announced, let's consider that Phase 1. Phase 2, we need to deploy some capital, which we're doing now in order to move onto that particular portion of it. So, we're in a little bit of a transition period. And I think if you go back and look at our disclosures from Q4 about how we called out the capital investments that we're making those words to accommodate for their actions into the future. Other than that, that's really all I can say until we're ready to call one of them off, but we're making reasonably good progress. But some of the bigger moves that we need to make require initial capital.","Deane Dray","So, the moves that you've made so far and the pay back on those, are we seeing that today in the results today? Because it looks like, it was all being carried in corporate as opposed to\u2026","Richard Tobin","I know I've got your question. You don't see anything in Q1. That's why, that's not there. This is zero in Q1. It's come for the footprint.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, SG&A is there, if you were asking about the SG&A.","Richard Tobin","So, it's not like to move the footprint pennies into another block, it just zero.","Deane Dray","Got it. And what about SG&A then?","Richard Tobin","SG&A, about beating a dead horse, we're clearly on track in delivering the objective because of the fact that we started in the second half of the year. You're going to get real good comps in Q1, Q2, then it will dilute in the second half of the year.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre of Baird.","Mig Dobre","Just want to go back to price cost, I think, I heard you mentioned good price cost in Fluids. Maybe have you comment on the other segments? And how do you think about this dynamic through the year? Your cost specifically, how do you think those are going to progress through the years?","Richard Tobin","I love it. We have Brad to correct me, but I think that in consolidation, we're slightly negative in price cost in Q1. We would expect to make progress on that through the year as price increases gain traction as we go throughout. In engineering systems specifically, we have done well on price cost. But in consolidation, it's slightly negative.","Mig Dobre","So, but you said that price cost was positive in Fluids as well. So was it a drag in basically the remaining segment here?","Richard Tobin","I think it's by platform. So, we're parsing now between individual platform was in the segments. I think the headwinds are in the industrial side, pieces of the industrial side of engineering systems, headwinds in refrigeration and food retail, doing this off the top of my head; and in fluids, I think that were positive overall.","Mig Dobre","And then lastly. As you think about the full year, do you expect to be positive from a price cost standpoint?","Richard Tobin","That's our expectation.","Mig Dobre","Okay, great. Thank you.","Brad Cerepak","It widens out a little bit to the back half.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett.","John Inch","Hey, Rich, ESG, so it was a big slug of the organic. You said you have enough back log to work through the third quarter and you're excited, I guess you said about systems and software. Do you expect the bookings to pick backup again? Just I call it out. I realized it's a small business, but it was an outsized impact right to the booking trends this Q. So\u2026","Richard Tobin","No, it's not that small of a business. Look, we don't have any visibility into Q4 at this point. So, despite grinding down some of the backlog that we had because of chassis availability and good production performance, the number like you know -- that's why it was called out in the presentation, it flexes the whole segment because of the total value of that business and its weight within the sector. We've got a really good backlog. I think that in any other year we'd to be super happy about what we've got. Let's get another quarter under our belt and we can probably say where we are for the full year, but we're into Q3 now which is pretty good.","John Inch","Yes. I'm just trying to understand. You're not expecting an extending air pocket in future bookings based on what's where\u2026","Richard Tobin","I have no indication of that is going to happen.","Brad Cerepak","No reason to believe that.","John Inch","The SG&A stays for the year, I think $72 million. If I thought they we were going to be -- well, we just made an assumption maybe kind of linear, which suggested maybe $0.10 of benefit this Q, but it was 15. I don't want to split hairs, but did you pull some of that forward, which is not a bad problem to have or issue to have?","Richard Tobin","Yes, I think that estimate, you know, I think that we knew from a comp point of view, it's going to be weighted towards the first half because we had 30 plus in the second half of last year. Getting it down to the millions of dollars, I mean we'll take it as it comes to a certain extent, right.","Brad Cerepak","But there is -- let me just articulate here that, there is a slight difference in presentation just so you aware. The $0.15 is pure SG&A, not reinvestment, whereas before we were netting reinvestment in there, so I'll just clarify. So, the 50 -- we have reinvestment in the first quarter. I'd call it roughly $0.02, $0.03 of reinvestment. Reinvestment will ramp as we said before in this year. So, we're not changing our views on reinvestment.","But you're looking at $0.15 in the quarter, which is we take it $28 million. So, you've got to think about that as pre-reinvestment. That will track to the back half pretty solidly except then you get the year-over-year the impact. Remember, we did $8 million in the third quarter, $22 million in the fourth quarter. So, again, I think, we're right on track where we expect it to be, maybe even a little bit higher based on the first quarter $0.15 print.","John Inch","Yes. I was going to ask, did 72, has it changed? And it sounds like it maybe got up a little bit.","Richard Tobin","Yes, slightly a little bit better.","John Inch","Last question Rich. So selling Finder and we're working towards this portfolio, I guess, you're going to have a portfolio coming out partly in September. Can you talk a little bit about just your process? How you're working towards that? Like in other words, presumably there is got to be a lot of depth that occurred to then be able to say look, here is how I'm thinking about portfolio look done this clean up. But how do you go from sort of where you've been to where we're going to be able to talk that? Because I'm really curious how you're working through this?","Richard Tobin","It's a really long answer. We are looking at future projections and return on invested capital by operating company, right, and then where they're performance relative to their peers and then relative to the market structure. Clearly, Finder comes out like a bit of a sore thumb, so it needed to be action quickly. I don't think that there's anything in the remaining portion of our portfolio that's got remotely the same dynamics that that does. So, I mean, we're looking at it holistically meaning that, it's not a question of portfolio purity, it's purely a question of future returns by operating company relative to their participation in the market structure. That's how I got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","We covered a lot of ground already so just a few follow-up here. Obviously, great progress on the SG&A initiatives. I'm just curious Phase 2 is obviously more COG focused, but your SG&A is going to be relatively high compared to peers. I'm just wondering, if there's a Phase 2 in the SG&A beyond this year, Rich?","Richard Tobin","Look, nothing of the quantum that that we've done, right. But understand in the background, there's a lot of what we're doing about these digital initiatives that enhance our ability to consolidate back offices. So but those are longer running programs that were running in the background as opposed to kind of just core let's kind of revisit what we've got.","So I think that there is opportunity, but I don't expect that there's a Phase 2 SG&A takeout kind of low hanging Fluids. I think we're just going to have to, it's more SG&A goes into the total productivity equation now as opposed to and standalone. And to be fair, SG&A at Dover as got R&D and I think once we split R&D out of SG&A, we're going to comp better also.","Nigel Coe","And then, there is a bit of friction around the 1Q setup for consensus, especially as it relates to the Fluids seasonality. So I'm just curious, if you've got any -- recognized you don't give quarterly guidance, but any commentary around 2Q in particular with regards to that how you see Fluids ramping up seasonally? And then maybe Refrigeration margins, how those look relative to the 1Q? Would you expect those to setup in a similar vein what we see normally?","Richard Tobin","Yes, I mean, I think that the two businesses we've identified, both have a good dynamic in terms of their top line, which is helpful to us improving the margins of those two segments. So, I think progressively through the year, we expect to make progress in both of those particular segments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Burzynski of Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Burzynski","I think to those the point of the last question we covered a lot of ground, but maybe just to stick with SG&A for a second. Rich, I think the initial progress there was pretty immediate, once you guys announced it. And I would imagine that, there were probably areas since then that you found maybe a bit more opportunity or perhaps on the other side where there was maybe some indiscriminate cuts. Should we see the shape of SG&A start to look a little different as you refine the program? Are you pretty satisfied with kind of the initial phasing? And how that went across the organization?","Richard Tobin","I'm satisfied with the organization's ability to undertake, which was a difficult exercise and the speed of which is done. It's never going to end, but this was a particular program that we thought was important to identify and execute on. Once we reach that program limit relative to the restructuring charges that we took, it can foresee that these EPS bridges won't have that SG&A, any other ancillary benefit will rollover into conversion at the end of the day.","So at a certain point, we're just going to stop reporting on it once we've reached conclusion, because then it becomes relatively discrete and it's not part of a program, right. What we said back in September is, if we take a charge for it, we're going to report back on delivery for that charge. Once, we've beyond that phase, it's just going to go back into conversion.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","And then it's just a follow-up on Refrigeration. I guess similar to what you guys have talked about in Fluid. How should we think about the phasing of the year there? I think orders have been positive for a couple of years. You've built some nice backlog. Do we start to see revenue growth move closer and walk step with orders from here? Is there still going to be kind of another lag in that execution of those shipments?","Richard Tobin","I don't know is the answer to that. I think that we can see in the backlog, we can see that from a production point of view, we're doing a decent job in terms of getting into that backlog. Now, we're really not seeing it yet in terms of the margin conversion, but I think that we have some transitory costs. I'd prefer to wait till the end of Q2 to kind of get more granular, but we're -- it's a positive thing. For the first time in six quarters, the backlog is up and our revenue went up. I think that we've still got a lot of work to see what that means in terms of kind of pre-industrialization margin performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Obviously, a lot asked, so mine are piggybacks on maybe some clarifications. Is it possible Brad on the ES bookings the organic? If we were to pull out the ESG, what that number -- what that minus 32 would look like?","Brad Cerepak","When I think we can give you that is a follow-up, we haven't to calculate it. We can give you that one offline.","Scott Graham","Okay. Secondly, on price cost, I know there was a question asked earlier, but kind of where you stand today with some price, some commodity prices going down and your pricing in? Would you expect at December 31 to be on a full year basis price plus neutral or sort of at December 31, price plus neutral?","Brad Cerepak","I think that we will work our way there. We are slightly negative now. It is highly dependent on price realization. Our expectation is to be positive. I can't give you the quantum at the end of Q1.","Scott Graham","That's fair. Last question is related to the Refrigeration business. I know that there is only so much you can say about that, but all of your customers have set their budgets for '19. Is there anything there that they're telling you that is of concern, moving towards more digital spending? It doesn't sound like it or are you just maybe a little bit guarded on saying anything right now or are they seeing anything negative about spending on your product on merchandizing?","Brad Cerepak","No, not negative. I think which is reflective in the backlog. I just think that we're cautious on, they've got a 1% growth embedded in our forecasts would be like to take that off based on backlog. Yes, but I think there were cautious because we don't have a lot of visibility into the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from line Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","So just focused on the Refrigeration business for a second and the full commentary around price cost, I saw that pricing this quarter was pretty de minimis and you guys put the recent price last year effectively. I'm just wondering like. Are you expecting to get more price in that business this year? And then specifically on margins, is your expectation at this point that margins in the business will be up year-over-year?","Richard Tobin","I think that we're cautious about price realization in this business and our expectation is from margins to increase in the Refrigeration segments of the business. In the segment, I think that we're going to have to wait and see because of Belvac's ability to swing margins.","Joe Ritchie","And then I guess just my one follow-up and just again, just kind of focused on margins for a second in the Fluids segment. Can you give us an update on Wayne specifically and how that businesses doing? And what impact at all that's having potentially to margins as we saw pretty much flat this past quarter?","Richard Tobin","Wayne, North America is doing very well in terms of production performance and margin.","Joe Ritchie","So, Wayne, North America, okay, international, not as good?","Richard Tobin","Right, I think that we've been pretty upfront that. Our -- the margin performance between our North American and European operations is quite wide. So part of the area of focus for us, meeting our objectives in that particular segment is to deal with a relative underperformance and in margins in Europe.","Joe Ritchie","Rich, are you starting to see any of that turn it all? Or is this like a longer process and just maybe any color around that would be helpful?","Richard Tobin","I think, to their credit that the European operations have fixed their throughput challenges. So, that's a big step and getting there, but we got a long way to go.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Charley Brady","On Refrigeration & Fluid Equipment on a transitory cost, can you quantify what the margin impact is on them in the quarter end? And if I heard you correctly, it sounds like those are essentially done, so that pressure isn't on the remainder of the year. Is that correct?","Richard Tobin","No, I can, but I won't quantify them. Our expectation is that their impact going forward will be less than it had been in Q1.","Charley Brady","And on the on the pumps business, obviously, pretty strong growth and bookings there. Can you just give a little more granular on we're seeing that? I think in the queue you talk about large in the OEMs, just what's driving that the strong growth in pumps?","Richard Tobin","It is across the platform. So, it's not any particular business out of the few that are in there. I think that it's just across the entire platform. I think that market demand remains robust and I think that that our businesses are winning in the marketplace also.","Charley Brady","Last one for me just on labor and freight costs. It is common what you're seeing their trend wise. Is freight getting any better? Are you seeing a tick down some of the rates? Or is it still tough sledding?","Richard Tobin","I think we would have expected it to come down, but it's been offset by fuel surcharges. Now, the fuel is gone back up to four bucks a gallon of diesel, so net neutral.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Galiuk for closing remarks.","Andrey Galiuk","Thank you. This concludes our conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call.","Let me begin by saying that the Energy markets have been more challenging than we anticipated, and the impact on our results have been quite significant. I do believe we are taking the right actions to address the current environment. And I am confident we will improve our performance in the coming quarters.","Now, let me share some comments on the quarter. We face tough markets in the second quarter which included diminished demand and significant inventory reductions in our North American Energy markets. We also saw reduced activity tied to customer capital spending in retail refrigeration and oil and gas related pump markets.","Regarding our Industrial platform, the U.S. was very solid, partially offset by some softness in Asia and Europe. These factors more than offset the cost containment actions we've been able to achieve and the very solid results we're seeing in Engineered Systems and Fluids.","From a geographic perspective, our U.S. activity declined, largely driven by our exposure to oil and gas markets. Our Asian activity also declined on tough comps and food equipment, and reduced industrial capital spending in China. Overall, Europe remains solid and grew organically in the quarter.","Now, some specific segment comments. In Energy, our drilling and production and automation businesses were significantly impacted by the severe North American oil and gas market declines. We also saw some weakness in energy-related bearings markets, while our compression business held up well.","In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses again performed well and the Industrial platform achieved overall organic growth of 3% led by solid results in our waste handling business.","Our Fluids segment had a strong quarter where market conditions for fluid transfer products were solid and we had strong shipments in our project-related pumps businesses. Fluids segment margin performance was excellent at 20%.","Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results were soft. We expected activity to replace previously lost volume to be more robust at this stage of the year. I am encouraged that bookings improved at Hillphoenix as we moved through quarter. Additionally, our glass door business performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. Our acquisition pipeline developed nicely in the second quarter and we have the opportunity to close on several bolt-on acquisitions in the second half of the year.","Now, let me address our revised outlook for the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have adjusted our full-year forecast to reflect the weak second quarter and continuing low demand levels in the second half.","On a positive note, we believe we are at the very beginning of a change in direction for our drilling business. Specifically, we saw drilling bookings stabilize and slightly improve off a low base as we exited the quarter. In addition, we have been actively expanding our customer base and select product categories and gaining business with new products and technology.","In Engineered Systems, we anticipate growth across both platforms.","In Printing & Identification, we continue to win business globally, and organic growth should remain very healthy.","In the Industrial platform, we expect second half organic revenue growth to remain solid, quite similar to the first half supported by strong U.S. markets.","Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for fluid transfer and most of our pumps businesses, and margin will remain strong in the second half.","Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we have lowered our forecast due to reduced expectations at Hillphoenix. However, we do anticipate our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform quite well in the back half.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide three of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 10%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 4%, and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $0.97, including $0.01 of restructuring.","Segment margin for the quarter was 15.6%, 300 basis points below last year. Bookings decreased 14% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting weak energy macros and softer capital spending in retail refrigeration, oil and gas exposed pump markets, and our industrial businesses in Engineered Systems. Overall book-to-bill finished at 0.98. Our backlog decreased 17% to $1.2 billion.","Free cash flow was strong at $175 million or 10% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue.","Now, let's turn to slide four. Fluids' organic revenue grew 6%, benefiting from solid fluid transfer markets. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 3%, reflecting solid growth in both platforms. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 12% on slower spending by our retail refrigeration customers and tough comps in our can shaping equipment. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 34%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 4% while FX had a negative 4% impact.","Turning to slide five and our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the first quarter, primarily reflecting normal seasonality, largely offset by Energy. Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 20%; and Engineered Systems and Fluids were both up 3%; Energy decreased 15%. As we discussed earlier, the decline into the second quarter in Energy was deeper than expected.","Sequential bookings decreased 1%. Of note, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 16% as we began to see orders for Hillphoenix improve, as we exited the second quarter; Engineered Systems and Fluids both declined 2%; while Energy declined 17%.","Now, on slide six. Energy revenue of $366 million decreased 24%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $41 million. Energy's results were impacted by the steep deterioration in oil and gas markets, most notably in our North American drilling and production and in our automation markets where we continue to be impacted by diminished demand and significant customer destocking. However, international activity continues to be an area of opportunity for us and held up well in the quarter.","We incurred an additional $3 million in restructuring costs in the second quarter and expect to take another $6 million to $7 million in charges in Q3 to further reduce our costs. Excluding the Q2 restructuring cost, our operating margin was 12%, reflecting significantly lower volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and prior-period restructuring. In 2015, we expect to take almost $90 million of costs out of this segment, a majority of it permanent, to better position us for the future. Bookings were $345 million, a 28% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.94.","Turning to slide seven. Engineered Systems revenue of $593 million declined 3% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 9% overall. Organic revenue grew 4%, driven by solid global markets for our core printing and coating business.","In the Industrial platform, revenue was essentially flat at $363 million and includes organic growth of 3%, driven by growth in our vehicle service and waste handling businesses, partially offset by softness in Asia and European industrial markets.","Margin declined 30 basis points to 16.3%, primarily on business mix and the impact of FX. Bookings were $560 million, a decrease of 8%, reflecting an organic bookings decline of 2% and a 6% impact from FX. Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 3%, while Industrial bookings decreased 5% on softness in Asia and Europe. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while Industrial's was 0.93; overall book-to-bill was 0.94.","Now, on slide eight. Within Fluids, revenue increased 2% to $352 million and earnings of $70 million, increased 11%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 6% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by FX.","Our fluid transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets in ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results reflect strong shipments of project-related orders and favorable comps. Segment margin of 20%, an increase of 180 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Bookings were $334 million, a decrease of 11% overall, or 9% organically. This result primarily reflects softness in our oil and gas related markets within pumps and the timing of project-related orders. Book to bill was 0.95.","Now, let's turn to slide nine. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $448 million, declined 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 23% to $66 million. Revenue performance was impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer, as well as lower than expected shipments to other retail customers. Also impacting results were tough comps in our can shaping business.","Operating margin was 14.7%, a 160 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $487 million, a decrease of 10%, principally reflecting slower than anticipated order activity from our core refrigeration customers, partially offset by robust food equipment orders. Book to bill was 1.09, supporting an anticipated better second half.","Going to the overview, now, on slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $20 million, down $9 million from last year reflecting broad cost management initiatives and reduced compensation expense. Our second quarter tax rate was 29.3%. Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million and have repurchased 500 million year-to-date. As previously communicated, we expect to repurchase a total of 600 million this year.","Moving to slide 11, which shows our full-year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 8% to 9%. We expect organic revenue to decrease 7% to 8%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 3%. We continue to expect the impact to FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be between 16.1% and 16.4%, excluding restructuring costs.","Our full-year corporate expense forecast is down $9 million to $116 million, reflecting flow-through of the second quarter reductions. Interest expense should remain around $127 million. We continue to expect the full-year tax rate to be approximately 29%. CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue, and our full-year free cash flow will be around 11% of revenue.","From a segment perspective, Energy's full-year organic revenue forecast is now negative 31% to 32%, a reduction of around 6 points from our prior guidance. Within this estimate, all three end markets have been revised downward to reflect general North American market conditions. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 6% to 8%, a reduction of 5 points, reflecting slower customer volume in retail refrigeration. Engineered Systems and Fluid growth rates had both been trimmed 1 point off the top end for reasons previously outlined.","Turning to the bridge on slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to be negative $0.02 to flat. Lower performance largely driven by volume declines, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $0.92 to $1. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.36 to $0.38.","Acquisitions already completed will be $0.02 to $0.04 accretive. Share reduction will add $0.20 to $0.21. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will be in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 benefit. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.75 to $3.90 inclusive of $0.17 to $0.19 of restructuring costs.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brad. We clearly have faced some tough market conditions in the first half which will largely continue for the balance of the year. Our teams have managed well through this environment, and I'm confident they'll continue to do so.","As I look forward, I see opportunities for improvement at each segment, which should result in better performance in the back half of the year and into 2016. For example, within Energy, I expect drilling destocking to dissipate. We are also aggressively pursuing share gains and expanding our international presence.","I am pleased we've been able to grow our share in select product categories over the last year in the face of tough markets, and that we are actively bidding on many international tenders. I expect Engineered Systems to show growth in both platforms and I'm encouraged by a big recent win for waste hauling equipment, as well as a large Navy contract we just secured.","Fluids has demonstrated very solid growth in fluid transfer, which should continue. On the pumps side, we continue to grow in international markets as evidenced by an important plastics order we were just awarded in China.","And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, I anticipate a better second half on improved order activity at Hillphoenix. Our food equipment businesses will also have an improved second half, boosted by stronger project shipments and new equipment rollouts for a couple of key restaurant customers.","With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces, and I expect us to complete some acquisitions in the back half of the year.","With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.","With that, Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. Before we take questions, I just want to remind everybody, as a courtesy, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we'll be able to take more questions from more analysts.","And with that, Maria, can we have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Bob, I guess I'll start with this bottom\/inflection point in drilling. I mean, maybe a little bit color on what you're seeing there and are we just seeing kind of an end of the bleeding? Or do you actually see something you like there?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Gosh, Shannon. Right now, it's hard to have rosy glasses when you look at our activity in the energy market. Rig count continued to decline during the second quarter and we track that most closely related to our drilling business, our insert business for drill bits. And we saw the low point in the quarter in the first half of June. The second half of June was up about 10% or 12% over the first two weeks of June. And I would share with you that the order activity in July is up, so far, just month-to-date, is up about 15% above what we saw in May and June. Shannon, I don't \u2013 I'm not attributing that to a market recovery. It does reflect what I believe is the coming to the end of the destocking activity we've experienced with many of our customers.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the cost side, why was there only $3 million of restructuring this quarter in Energy? I would have thought \u2013 I mean, last quarter there was, I think, $18 million; you said you're going to do $6 million to $7 million next quarter. Was there a reason that there was a little bit of a lull, I would think \u2013 I would have thought it would have been pretty intense restructuring in the quarter?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would tell you \u2013 I think there would be some people within energy that would tell you that there was some intense restructuring, it just didn't cost as much as what we're going to experience in the second half.","Brad is going to have to help me here with an exact number, but I think head count was reduced in energy by almost 400 folks in the second quarter. And there just wasn't a lot of restructuring cost associated with those employee reductions. Second half of the year, I think embedded in our guidance is about $15 million of restructuring costs.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Total for the corporation.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, for the corporation. And probably two-thirds of that is in Energy, Shannon. We continue to whittle away at the cost base.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So it's just how much it's costing to take it out \u2013 that's not aligned exactly with the...?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The restructuring in the second quarter did not include assets.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It was all people related.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Scott.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Can you give us a sense \u2013 I didn't see anything in the slides or commentary related to price in the backlog, particularly, in Energy, is there a \u2013 have you hit a point now on where folks who've wanted a repricing have got it, and what you see in the backlog is stable price or are we not there yet?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As soon as I answer the question affirmative, we're going to get another request for another tough discussion with a customer tomorrow, Scott. I believe that the bulk of it is behind us. I think I've shared this on the April call as well as at a couple of conferences that I spoke at during the second quarter that the bulk of the price reduction activity we've experienced in Energy has been in our drilling products as well as our rod products within artificial lift.","Not a lot has changed. In our drilling products, it's still going to average for the year about 5%, and that's what we saw in the second quarter. A little bit more aggressive actions that we've taken along with some of the customer demands in rods, and that's probably averaging about 10%. Don't see it being much different during the second half of the year. And the net impact for the segment for the entire year, I would tell you it's still within the range we've been sharing with you for the past couple of calls, which is 3% to 6%, 4% to 6% in that range.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Understood. And on corporate expense, it's down $9 million year-over-year. Is that \u2013 could you give us a sense of how much of that is lower bonus accruals and how much of that is kind of real cost-out?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, yeah. I'll take that question. I guess, Scott, about half of that is us reaching a threshold on our revised guidance whereby the long-term plans won't pay out. And so think about it as half is comp-related; the other half, about 50% of that is real cost takeout.","So I would say that's related to our functional cost initiatives around reducing the corporate overhead. And then, we have miscellaneous and other stuff that normally happens in any given quarter comprise the remaining piece of that balance.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's it. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Steve Tusa.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The restructuring dynamics in Energy. Could you maybe just remind us of what the expectation is? What you spent this year? What you expect to book this year in savings? And then, what the carryover is into next year? I think that's kind of an important piece, obviously, in being optimistic about next year.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I'm going to let Brad tackle that one.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Let me start and then you could follow on if I don't hit all those questions. So we're saying $40 million to $45 million total corporation this year in restructuring charges, $0.16 to $0.19 range. Of that amount, we're looking at $27 million to $30 million of that being in the Energy.","In terms of the benefits, we continue to see \u2013 by the way, I'll just make mention of this now that, as we continue to work through our restructuring, our benefit estimates have actually come up a little bit since our last forecast, just more confidence around that benefit number.","But in terms of Energy, I pointed out in my prepared remarks that we expect to take $90 million of cost out this year. Steve, there's two pieces to that: there's a piece that's funded through restructuring; there's a piece that's just day-to-day initiatives around structure that doesn't cost us effort \u2013 costs us money, I should say, cost a lot of effort, but money. And so Energy will take $90 million out.","The run rate on that, obviously, is much more significant. For the total corporation, I would say we're on restructuring. Now, I'm going to go back to just the restructuring piece, $90 million to $95 million of benefits, the run rate will be more like $130 million to $140 million going into next year on those actions.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And of the $90 million, how much is actually from the restructuring?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The $90 million in Energy you're referring to?","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So about $60 million to $65 million.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","$65 million. Yeah.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then I...","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The rest coming through real initiatives around just cutting back the spend levels that \u2013 we expect some of that to be permanent.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And lower product cost.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And I think you said last quarter there were $30 million of temp stuff. Is that still kind of \u2013 I guess, that's what that implies, that's still kind of the number. But you're making that sound like it's a bit more structural perhaps now.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think that number has changed much now.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last quick question just on Refrigeration & Food. The margin has been down in the first couple quarters here. What do you see there for the year? Is there \u2013 I know your volumes maybe return a little bit in the second half, what margin are you expecting in that business for the year?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Gosh. For the entire year, at least 13.5%. It may push 14%, Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In Refrigeration & Food?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In that segment, yes.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I mean, that's a huge, I think, bump-up from \u2013 I know you had restructuring in the fourth quarter, but, I mean, that's definitely a hill to climb in the second half.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me give you a little bit of color on anticipated second half margins for Dover...","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...which I think would be helpful for everyone to understand. As we look at the second half, we are anticipating operating margins to be up about 250 basis points over the first half. Steve, the bulk of that goes back to your first question. About 150 bps of the 250 bps improvement we're seeing in the second half is the recognition of increased benefits of restructuring and lower restructuring cost versus the first half, and about 30 bps of improvement in the second half from what I would just label as normal productivity initiatives. And then...","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...some improvement in margins from increased volume. We are looking at volume in the second half to be up. I think it's about $130 million over the first half. And we'll see some increased margin activity from that increased volume.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Keep in mind the discussion that Bob \u2013 the numbers he has given you is all to the high end of our guide range, just to be clear.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for all the color. It's great to have all these details, and thanks for trying to make a call on some of the stuff that's incredibly fluid over the last couple of quarters. All the detail is very helpful, so thanks.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Hey, just a couple others, thinking about this back half, you had previously been pretty explicit about how you thought Energy would exit the year. Could you give us that granularity? Also what's embedded in your guide?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The second half guidance \u2013 second half forecast on Energy \u2013 second half versus first half, Jeff, the revenue is down $40 million, but the second half run rate is fairly consistent with the second quarter. Obviously, that said, that means that the first quarter will be the high quarter of the year for Energy. Three months ago, I truly did anticipate that we would exit the year with a 20% margin in Energy. I still think this business is a 20% margin business. We're just not going to see it in the fourth quarter, not with the volume that we're anticipating now. I think the number we have in our forecast for a fourth quarter exit rate is 15% or 15.5% margins.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I wonder if you could actually address that kind of earnings power comment in a sense. I mean, it seems as if there is, in fact, some very significant changes going on in the market and how people are approaching fracing, kind of the geological services that Schlumberger and Halliburton are offering to drive the business. It would seem that you're not particularly well equipped to compete with that. I just wonder how you respond to that. Is there things that you need to do with your portfolio? And is there some impairment in the margin rate of this business kind of normalized going forward relative to what you saw historically?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me start first by saying we're not really a participant. I shouldn't even use the qualifier, not really. We are not a participant in the fracing market. We'll participate in the drilling activity with the inserts and we'll participate once the well has been fraced. We will participate with whatever technology of artificial lift is appropriate for that well. But in the pure fracing application, that's just not something we participate in.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. I was thinking more along the lines as they get better and better at re-fracing, we're doing less drilling and therefore...","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're still in the early days of seeing this re-fracing application here in North America. Look, you re-frac, you've got to pull the gear out of that well. And we believe there is an opportunity for us as that gear, as that system comes out or either if it's been downhole a short period of time, a year or so, maybe two years, there's an opportunity for us on the downhole pump, either a service, a repair, a rebuild or a new pump. If it's a rather new well, it would be unusual for the rod strings that need to be replaced. But if it's an older well, we think there's an opportunity that some of these well operators may take and actually replace the entire rod string. It really does depend on the characteristics of that individual well.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just one follow-on on the restructuring, the paybacks are really phenomenal. So $40 million to $45 million in spend is driving $90 million to $95 million in benefit, and I heard run rate $130 million. I'm just wondering if you could...","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, $130 million to $140 million. Yes.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So do you have to get into a heavier level of restructuring, so that I think you've \u2013 I guess what this implies is you've taken out people in places where they're not unionized and you just let them go and there's not a lot of severance and the like, but you need to actually adjust your footprints and get into some more costly heavier restructuring.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. You saw us take some steps \u2013 let's see, did we do this in the fourth quarter? For sure, we did it in our first quarter. You saw us take some steps in our first quarter with respect to footprint consolidation. And, my goodness, I don't remember how many field locations were actually removed during our first quarter. I mean \u2013 but double-digit number of field locations.","And with that, you see a little bit of our charge activity related to some asset charges. In the second half of the year, within Energy, you'll see a little bit more activity around, I call it, footprint consolidation.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Deane.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey. Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","On the refrigeration side, when you talk about the slowly to develop replacement activity, I presume that's what you were trying to fill the hole in the lost Walmart business.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So did you miss out on orders from those customers, like not get that share or are the customers just not ordering?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't believe we've missed out on any orders that we had planned for the second quarter. We have seen that activity shift to the right. I'll give you a little color on that, Deane. April order activity wasn't that bad. In fact, it was probably similar to, or maybe even slightly above March activity, as we exited the first quarter. May was a surprise. I don't remember the exact numbers at Hillphoenix, but May order activity may have been down as much as 15% or 20% \u2013 15% from March and April. June came back very strong. In fact, it was not only strong at Hillphoenix, the bookings for the segment in June were the highest monthly bookings we've seen in the last 18 months or 24 months. It was a very, very strong June. And order activity here in the first few weeks of July is quite supportive of our third quarter forecast.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you. And then just \u2013 could you clarify, in the negative preannouncement, you talked about the oil and gas pump market being particularly weak, can you just flesh out that? What exactly did you see, pricing, competitive dynamics? Just anything you could share would be helpful.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. There may have been a little bit of pricing. I wouldn't say there was much difference in competitive dynamics. It was all attributable to the continuing decline in the North America oil and gas market, especially upstream. And I would say we saw a little bit more distributor inventory management in the second quarter than we would have anticipated.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Inventory management by distributors, that isn't destocking?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Destocking by distributors.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That was the word I was looking for. Thank you.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Next question?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Obviously, you covered a lot of ground already. There's obviously a little...","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're going to cover a lot more with you, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I really just want to dig into some points already covered. And the payback, the first $0.02 to $0.08 (40:51) of payback in your bridge, obviously, you had quite a heavy 4Q restructuring quarter as well. So I'm wondering how much of that is coming from the 4Q restructuring actions rolling forward into 2015, i.e., how much have you already realized in the first half?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I would \u2013 okay, you're asking how much is the benefits first half versus second half of this $90 million to $94 million we're talking about?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I would say in the first half we've seen about $30 million to $32 million of the benefits roll through second quarter, significantly better than first quarter in terms of benefit profile. And then, obviously, the back half gives us the remaining piece with it building sequentially through the year and into next year, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And that's within \u2013 that's for the whole of Dover, not just Energy, correct?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's for the whole of Dover. Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's very helpful.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would say Energy is similar, very similar profile, building sequentially into 2016 with the first quarter being only about $4 million, $5 million of benefits, and then the rest really picking up pace in the second, third, and fourth quarters.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. No, that's helpful. It helps explain the way that it rolls forward.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Let me just reiterate what Bob said. The back half margin profile versus first half is up 250 basis points. 150 basis points of that really is coming from reduced \u2013 right now in our forecast, reduced spending level on restructuring and better benefits.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Okay. And then, the second part of my question is, I think, Bob, you mentioned the second half Energy revenue is similar to the 2Q run rate. And in the past you've said, you expected 2Q to be the trough on Energy revenues. So it sounds like 3Q might be the trough. So if you just clarify that point and then second...","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, actually \u2013 I used a phrase or the script or (43:03) similar, I will tell you that we do anticipate a very slight improvement in Energy revenues in the third quarter and the fourth quarter over the second quarter. And, Nigel, the only difference is we do expect a better revenue profile out of our drilling insert business in the second half of the year versus the second quarter, because we do believe that the destocking by the drill bit customers is almost complete.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And recognizing...","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That truly is the only change in the second half versus the...","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...second quarter, is a little bit of an uptick in our insert business both from destocking \u2013 but I will also tell you that some of the increased order activity we saw in the second half of June and that we're continuing to see here in July is the result of new products and some new technology that we've delivered to some customers, and the take-up has been rather significant on the new products.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That...","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I will add another bit of color, take the opportunity to do it now. I think in my prepared comments I shared with you the activity we're engaged in with respect to international tenders. We are bidding on and tracking, actively tracking, almost 50 international tenders as we sit here today. The timing of the awards and the actual award amount is a bit uncertain. None of those tenders, none of those tender awards that we could win are included in our second half forecast.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's encouraging. Any way to try and size the impact of the inventory headwinds that you had in the first half of the year, in particular the second quarter?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's hard to tell. I mean, it's \u2013 all I can give you is some data points. So, for example, if I compare second quarter 2015 to second quarter 2014 year-over-year, the rig count decline was 55% here in the U.S., I'm ignoring Canada. Here, in the U.S., the rig count decline was 55%. Our revenue decline in our insert business was almost 70%. It was that significant, Nigel.","Now, that 15 point delta between the rig count decline and our revenue decline, I would say perhaps 4 points or 5 points could be attributable to price. The rest of it \u2013 at least 10 points, at least $40 million or $50 million is attributable to destocking.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Joe.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","On the Fluids segment, you've talked about an organic growth guide of 5% to 6%. It seems like that's going to imply a bit of an acceleration in the second half on similar comps, and the order trends in the first half were pretty negative. So I'm just trying to understand what the offset is that's driving the confidence and the excellence in the second half.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So organic growth in the first half was 4% for Fluids. We're looking at 5% to 6% for the year. The low point was actually quarter one. Quarter three should look very similar to quarter two. And quarter four may be a little bit better than quarter one. It's how the waterfall looks.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And is there any...","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We do see a little bit of improvement in the FX hit in the second half of the year.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. But is there anything underlying? It seems like you called out oil and gas softening a little bit within the Fluids segment. So I'm just wondering if there is other end markets that you guys saw some improvement in as we were exiting June or into July. I'm just trying to get a sense for what the underlying trends are.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Again, I think I shared this data point with the callers on the April call. About 10% of this segment's business base is connected to upstream oil and gas that was weaker in the second quarter than the first quarter and it was weaker in the second quarter than we anticipated. It's not 30% of the Fluids segment. It's only about 10%.","Order rates, I would tell you that outside of oil and gas, order rates around the segment were pretty solid with the exception being oil and gas, and the absence of some larger project orders that we would have \u2013 that we did have in our order book in the second quarter of last year. We do anticipate some project wins here in the second half.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Okay, great. And then maybe my one follow-up is, Bob, you mentioned earlier that there were several bolt-on acquisitions that you're working on potentially that could close in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering if you could just provide some more color on potentially size of the acquisitions and what segments you're looking to bolt-on in?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the sizes are, my goodness, anywhere from \u2013 I don't know, the smallest one could be under $20 million; the largest one could be, I don't know, of $300 million or $400 million. And which segments? I think that you'd see the bulk of them in Fluids.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks a lot. Just on...","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Just on Refrigeration & Food. I guess one sort of shorter-term question just around food equipment, seems that was down sort of high-teens in the first half; maybe just explain a little bit what's going on in the market and your own share position. And then, just more broadly, longer-term, on the segment in aggregate, how you feel about the positioning of where you are in different pieces within it in terms of the ability to drive decent earnings growth from here?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me take food equipment platform first or market sector first. Second half will be quite different than the first half. I would say, in the first half, most notably true in the second quarter, we saw a real absence of what I call the projectivity with our can-making equipment. We see that picking up in the second half. And we have the orders in our backlog to support that forecast.","Organic growth in food equipment in the first half was 19% negative \u2013 I'm sorry, 14% negative. In the second half, it's a positive 9%. That's how much of a true change there is within this platform from first half to second half.","A big boost in the second half is the rollout. We are currently engaged in right now with two key customers on some restaurant equipment and that will have a rather significant impact on the growth rates in the second half.","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I would add \u2013 to reiterate what you said, Bob, we have good line of sight in the second half of the food equipment.","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very good line of sight, yes. Second half versus first half in the refrigeration piece of the segment, what is the revenue growth? I think first half \u2013 second half over first half, the revenue growth in that part of the segment is \u2013 I think it's $50 million.","And given the backlog that we ended the quarter with, given the order rates that we saw in June and the activity we're seeing here in July, I will tell you that our third quarter factory load is pretty solid to support that forecast, and we have lowered our expectations for the year. I think we have set a bar that we can hit here for the second half of the year in this segment.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thanks. And then just to follow-up on Fluids again, how much of your second half sales are in your backlog today?","Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Oh, Gosh. I don't have that number. Let's see. For the whole segment, it's pretty much, I would say, 75% of our revenue, maybe even 80% of our revenue in this segment I would label as quick ship type of sales. The project business may only account for 15% or 20%. And we're fairly comfortable with the order rates continuing in the second half that we've seen here over the last two months or three months. And the project revenue forecast we have in the second half, I think with the exception of one project, we actually have on our order book today.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator",". Our final question will come from the line of Mig Dobre of Robert Baird.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys. A lot have been covered, so I just have one question. Maybe some color on your automation business and Energy. My understanding has always been that that's a, call it, stabler business, if you would, compared to your drilling business and yet we've seen a pretty big sequential downtick there. How should we think about this business in the back half?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The back half \u2013 Brad, you'll have to help me here with this detail. But I think the back half \u2013 the second half of the year is fairly consistent, similar with the revenue stream we saw in the second quarter. It is down from the first quarter run rate.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","But is it fair for me to think of this business as being inherently more stable than the production business?","Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Parts of it would be, but don't lose sight of the fact that there is, oh, Gosh, 20% \u2013 there's 20% of the automation business, maybe a little bit more than that, Brad, at least 20% of the automation business that would be connected to more of the drilling activity than well completion and production monitoring.","Mig Dobre - Robert W.

Mr. Galiuk, please go ahead.","Andrey Galiuk","Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to Dover's third quarter 2019 earnings call. The audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website.","Our comments today may contain forward-looking statements. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law.","With that, I would like to turn this call over to Rich.","Richard J. Tobin","Thank you, Andrey. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us this morning's conference call. Let's get started on slide 3. Q3 organic revenue was up 6% for the quarter. The growth was broad-based across the portfolio and was positively impacted by improved production performance allowing us to ship product at a higher rate than Q3 last year particularly in the Fluids segment.","Bookings in the quarter were solid with 7% organic growth with Fluids and Engineered Systems posting book-to-bill above one. Adjusted segment earnings increased 17% to $320 million contributing to 180 basis point improvement in operating margin over the comparable period. These results were driven by strong revenue conversion on volume leverage and continued improvements in productivity and cost controls more than offsetting unfavorable mix and labor cost inflation.","Adjusted Q3 earnings were up 15% to $235 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60 a share was up 18% year-over-year. As mentioned during our investor meeting in September this is the last period, which we'll report under the legacy segment structure. Starting at Q4, we will report using the new structure and provide full year comparative data.","Overall, we are encouraged with the results in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. Our revenue has increased organically by 5.5% year-to-date and our rightsizing and operational actions are yielding robust margin improvement with resulting increase in comparative free cash flow. We are entering the last quarter of 2019 with a solid order backlog across all our businesses as well as strong momentum and execution towards our margin targets. And as a result we are tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to the top end of our range from $5.82 to $5.85 per share.","I'll pass it over to Brad here.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go through the details starting on slide 4. All-in revenue grew 4% to $1.8 billion and was driven by strong demand throughout our Fluids and Engineered Systems segments. GAAP EPS increased 33% to $1.40.","Moving to non-GAAP results. As mentioned, we achieved significant margin accretion in the quarter with adjusted segment EBIT up 180 basis points over the prior year reflecting strong conversion on increased volume and continued execution of productivity initiatives.","Adjusted segment EBITDA was $385 million, a margin of 21.1%. Key adjustments for non-GAAP results this quarter were acquisition-related amortization and rightsizing and other expenses. The EPS increase was supported by $0.04 or $5.2 million of discrete tax benefits, slightly below the $0.05 benefit in the prior year.","Turning to slide 5. Let's get into a little bit more detail on our revenue and booking results in the quarter. As mentioned in our summary, organic growth was solid at 5.6% driven by Fluids and Engineered Systems and partially offset by Refrigeration & Food Equipment. As you can see foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue and bookings.","FX was 1.6% or a $29 million headwind for revenue, which had a $4 million impact on earnings with the most notable impact on our businesses levered to Europe and Asia. We expect these FX headwinds to persist in the fourth quarter. From an organic growth perspective Engineered Systems grew $42 million or approximately 6%, while Fluids grew $68 million or 10%.","Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue decreased by $12 million or 3%. Bookings increased organically 6.7%, and were \u2013 and all in were negatively impacted by FX. At Engineered Systems organic bookings increased $61 million, or approximately 9% driven by strong order intake in digital printing and the Environmental Solutions Group. Bookings in Fluids also increased $61 million, or 8% organically with strong growth in the fueling and transport and process solutions markets. Bookings in Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined $8 million.","Finally, our book-to-bill finished at 0.99, while backlog at the end of Q3 was 3% higher than this time last year driven by Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. From a geographic perspective the U.S. our largest market grew 7% organically driven by strong performance in Engineered Systems and Fluids, partially offset by Refrigeration & Food Equipment.","Europe was up 8% with all segments posting organic growth and a particularly strong quarter from Fluids which was up nearly 20%.","All of Asia grew 6% organically with China driving the growth at 20%. Our Fluids business was up 6% in Asia overall with nearly 30% growth in China on the strength of both retail fueling and process solutions businesses.","Engineered Systems was up 10% in Asia whereas Refrigeration & Food Equipment was down mid-teens, primarily due to slower demand for heat exchangers in the region.","Let's go to the earnings bridge now on Slide 6. Starting on the top. Engineered Systems adjusted segment EBITDA improved $17 million, largely driven by volume and productivity initiatives more than offsetting headwinds from FX. Fluids growth of $35 million reflects a combination of robust growth, continued margin improvement in retail fueling, and acquisitions. The $7 million decline in Refrigeration & Food Equipment reflects lower volumes for SWEP heat exchangers and slower activity in food retail.","Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations improved $31 million or 15%, primarily driven by higher segment earnings, partially offset by higher corporate costs and taxes. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately 22% for 2019, 30 basis points higher than the prior year on a comparable basis.","Now on Slide 7. Year-to-date free cash flow was $447 million, a $163 million improvement over last year. Our cash flow was strong in the third quarter at 16.7% of revenue versus 11.8% in the comparable prior period.","Despite strong topline growth through the year, our focus on working capital efficiencies drove a net improvement year-over-year. As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, given the uncertain macro environment, we will manage our production schedules to meet our cash flow objectives.","The fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest cash flow quarter. Capital expenditures were $137 million year-to-date, slightly ahead of last year. While we expect our capital expenditures to ramp in the fourth quarter, we do expect several of our investments planned for 2019 to carry over into 2020.","With that let me turn it back over to Rich.","Richard J. Tobin","Thanks Brad. Let's move to the segment slides. Engineered Systems delivered topline organic growth of 6.3%, largely driven by our industrial platform. As you can see in the bridge incremental margin was strong exceeding 50% as we converted well on volume growth in digital printing and refuse trucks and have continued to gain efficiency across the businesses.","Our Printing & ID platform grew organically by 4%, driven by activity in digital printing on the heels of a strong order pipeline coming out of the ITMA trade show in June. Overall, the platform has performed well with particular strength in Asia where increased shipments in digital printing more than offset the weaker demand environment from marking and coding in China.","The industrial platform posted 8% organic growth. Our waste handling business continued to deliver double-digit growth as demand remained strong for both traditional equipment and software with digital solutions business growing over 50% year-over-year.","Our vehicle service business posted 8% growth on stronger aftermarket demand in Europe which has been slow in the past few quarters. DESTACO continued to experience slow demand in automotive OEM and MPG was flat for the quarter due to timing of orders for a specific defense program, but continues to carry a significant backlog as demand conditions in the defense sector remain constructive.","Bookings for Engineered Systems remained solid. All but two businesses posted book-to-bill above one with particular strength in digital printing and waste handling which booked several large orders replenishing at strong backlog.","Overall, we entered the last quarter on solid footing for the segment, largely driven by Printing & ID platform which is accretive to consolidated margins. The Fluids segment posted strong organic growth of nearly 10% for the quarter with continued strength across all businesses.","Adjusted segment margin increased 340 basis points with incremental margin in excess of 50%, driven by volume leverage and improved productivity more than offsetting negative geographic and product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 24.2%.","Our pumps and process solutions business had an excellent quarter posting organic growth of 9%. Maag had a strong third quarter deliveries in the plastics and polymer markets in Europe and Asia which were back-end loaded to Q4 in 2018.","Biopharma and thermal management markets continued to deliver double-digit growth during the quarter. Shipments remained robust for our industrial pumps and precision components business despite the weakening macro demand environment.","Fueling and transport posted organic growth of 11% as demand remained robust across all geographies for both underground and aboveground equipment systems with particular strength in China which is going through the final stages of its underground piping upgrade cycle.","EMV demand in the U.S. improved sequentially, but remained choppy and was not a significant contributor to comparable growth. Bookings in the segment grew 8% organically over the comparable period. The macro environment has shown signs of slowing in some end markets, but we remain constructive as the segment enters Q4 with a backlog roughly flat year-over-year albeit more skewed towards longer term projects.","Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue was down 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.3%. The margins were pressured by lower volume and frictional costs as we continue to restructure our manufacturing footprint in this segment.","Activity in food retail remained mixed. Systems and services projects continue to decline year-over-year as new store activity remains subdued. Our core case -- door case product line food retail's largest sustained double-digit growth in revenue and backlog as retailers continued investing in store remodels.","SWEP posted a flat quarter on a rebound in European demand offset by continued weakness in demand for heat exchangers in Asia. Bookings in the segment declined 2% organically mainly due to lower activity in refrigeration systems business. We enter Q4 with two-thirds of revenue in the backlog for food retail business and a constructive outlook to book shipments against several large contracts we signed last quarter. SWEP and Belvac enter Q4 with an increase in comparative backlog.","Moving to slide 12. Slide 12 disaggregates the key sources of EPS accretion this quarter. Solid growth and operational actions continue to yield strong results driving the majority of the 18% EPS growth. Incremental conversion of the margin for the quarter was 60%.","We are reiterating our revenue guidance for Engineered Systems and tightening upward the guidance for Fluids. Recall Fluids posted 17% organic growth in Q4 of 2018, setting a high watermark for comparable -- for the comparable period this year. We expect Refrigeration & Food Equipment to post flat revenue in 2019 after an 8% decline in 2018 as the market stabilizes after resetting to remodel driven demand.","Overall, we are encouraged with the performance so far this year as we continue to deliver robust organic growth and margin conversion. We are executing well on productivity and cost initiatives and are working closely with our customers to sustain growth.","Demand conditions remain constructive across most businesses but visibility and sentiment are cautious in some sectors. We have a lot on our plate between now and the end of the year with several major capital projects underway and an interesting inorganic pipeline but we remain focused on closing out 2019.","So to wrap up despite the uncertain macro environment, a strengthening U.S. dollar and a challenging Q4 revenue comp, we are well-positioned to deliver a solid close to the year for both cash flow and earnings. And as such we are tightening our full year guidance to the top end of the range from $5.82 to $5.85 per share.","And with, that let's move on to the Q&A. Andrey?","Andrey Galiuk","Stephanie let's open the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Good morning Rich.","Richard J. Tobin","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Hi, good morning everybody else. I landed at 3, last night. Sorry, I\u2019m still trying to wake up. Look, let me ask you a lot of -- sort of we got questions from investors on bookings. Those were very good. And given the tough comps in Q4; A, how much of one-time stuff did you have in the third quarter because it does seem that you were helped by the Printing & ID? I think some of the refrigeration bookings maybe happened that you got in second quarter, happened in third quarter sort of. So how much of one-time stuff did you have in 3Q in terms of robust bookings? And can you think you can deliver positive bookings in Q4?","Richard J. Tobin","Well, I think that -- I don't want to comment on where we end up on Q4 bookings. We'd like to see that end. But I'll give you some color right? A lot of what we did in Q3 comparatively was based on production performance and to a certain extent order timing.","So if you remember last year we were just coming out of a period in the Fluids segment where our backlog was high but that was driven by the fact that we were having trouble getting product out at this time last year.","Our production performance in retail fueling was significantly better this year than it was last year, which both drove the revenue line and the margin delivery. In addition, to that in the Pumps and Process Solutions business, particularly in MAAG, we delivered basically our Q4 last year in Q3. So it was great to get the product out because these are our systems related in Q3 but that makes the Q4 comp even more difficult than even we would have estimated at the beginning of the year. The fact of the matter is if we got it out of production and it's ready to go let's ship it.","In terms of backlog, I mean if you go back and look at the comments, the backlog is great. It sets us up well. But the fact of the matter is if you look in ESG, our backlog, a lot of that is flowing into 2020 as opposed to our ability to convert it into 2019 and especially so in MAAG and in precision components also. Those are longer-term systems contracts, which we're happy to have because we'd be shipping the next year. But I don't think that we're going to be able to convert them in Q4 just because of the long cycle nature of production.","Andrew Obin","Thank you. And then the question on Refrigeration. What's happening to labor cost in Refrigeration? And any way of sizing the OpEx investment around the planned automation into 4Q and into 2020?","Richard J. Tobin","The bigger issue in Refrigeration is not labor cost per se. It's labor availability that ends up rolling into over time, which ends up, so the labor cost net-net is up but it's -- the real struggle we're having is not the rate of labor cost, it's more of the availability. So running a bunch of overtime trying to get the product out and it is negatively impacting margins. But at the end of the day that is what we're hoping to resolve in the future by automating the process and taking a significant amount of the labor out. So if you looked at the P&L, labor costs will be up but it's not driven by rate. It's driven by the amount of OT that we're running.","Andrew Obin","Rich, Brad you made it look easy this quarter. Thank you.","Richard J. Tobin","Thanks.","Andrew Obin","Congratulations.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.","John Inch","Good morning everybody.","Richard J. Tobin","Good morning, John.","John Inch","So Fluids, I think if I look at your guide, right for organic revenues for the year, it implies the core down high single digit. Rich, you went through some of that based on the timing MAAG pull forward and so forth. Is that it? Or is there something else -- firstly, am I kind of right about the down high single-digit core for Fluids in the fourth quarter? And is there something else going on that maybe could actually boost that business versus expectations today?","Richard J. Tobin","Okay. Well look, I mean at the end of the day, I think that we've been trying to tell everybody all year that the comp in Q4 in the Fluids segment was going to be tough because we grew 17% in Q4 last year. I think, it's going to be interesting when we go to the new segments because, when you look at bookings and revenue, you've got really two different kinds of businesses in there kind of like short-cycle demand which would be fueling systems and then you've got kind of long-cycle demand. And what we have going on is, backlog is up, but it's biased toward longer-term demand which is DPC and MAAG because those are longer-term projects.","This is not to say that the above -- that fueling solutions is going to have a bad fourth quarter, but the fact of the matter is that we've known all along, that we shipped a lot last year because we had a self-induced backlog and not being able to get the product out. And we've done a much better job in terms of production performance this year, which is reflected in the margins. So, there's really nothing going on so to speak other than timing differences on production performance.","John Inch","Well, so, I guess part of the issue is that we're going to have tough compares into -- literally through the first three quarters of next year too. All else equal, does that prospectively subdue growth similarly and I realize there were some kind of one timer\u2019s right in the fourth quarter.","Richard J. Tobin","Look, if I look at estimates for topline growth for '20 today and we haven't given out any guidance for '20, but if I look at it, I don't think that we will have an issue based on our backlog right now.","John Inch","Got it.","Richard J. Tobin","But clearly -- and I've read a bunch of the research reports, this notion of us kind of missing Q4. Well, we just beat Q3, so the assumption is you've got to moderate Q4. And we've been pretty clear that the topline was going to be a tough comp for Fluids in Q4.","John Inch","No, that's clear. The RF&E segment, so I mean it didn't show sequential improvement, so it deteriorated on the margins sequentially. I think you sort of explained that. The question is -- and I think the automation stuff obviously picks that back. Do you still see a path Rich to 15% to 16% margins in retail refrigeration that you outlined in the...","Richard J. Tobin","I do. I do. Look, we're in the midst of consolidating on UB's platform which is causing some consternation in terms of getting the product out and some transitional costs because we're going from five to three in terms of the footprint. And we are throwing labor right now at increased volumes in door case and it's costing us some money to do that. But I think we should have some good news in terms of backlog based on what I can see in door case leading to Q4, despite the fact that Q4, the seasonality is usually one of the worst quarters. But I think we're lining up to have some good news in terms of bookings at least going into '20.","John Inch","Just last, given the choppy economy, did you see -- like how did the third quarter play out for you? Traditionally, September is a very strong month right for most industrial companies. Were there anomalies as you went through July, August and as you ended September and October?","Richard J. Tobin","I think that there is an amount of caution that's out there especially through distribution about everybody trying to manage their inventories through the end of the year. I think that we performed in the Fluids segment better than we expected, especially on the underground side and that -- because of this transition with the regulatory environment on the piping, so I think the guys did a fantastic job of getting the product out, but that's kind of pulling away from Q4 to a certain extent. And we knew that that was going to slow into '20. So, we're maximizing performance, but clearly the market sentiment is not as good as it was this time last year.","John Inch","It's refreshing to hear a company not managing quarters, but actually just getting the stuff shipped. Very much appreciated. Thank you.","Richard J. Tobin","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey good morning guys.","Richard J. Tobin","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Rich, so food margins have continued to rise. And you talked at the Analyst Day that fueling solutions continues to be a near-term opportunity for margin enhancement. Are you basically at the point now through restructuring that you got to the 15% to 17% margin in DFS? And as you've gone through it, have you found incremental margin opportunities? Or are the strong incrementals in that business really just a function of the strong growth that you've had?","Richard J. Tobin","Well there's two pieces to it, right? I think that when we referred to the margin catch-up opportunity, that was on the aboveground portion of fueling solutions. And I think if you -- we don't disclose that number, but I can tell you that that is where a significant amount of the year-over-year margin accretion has come from. So the team has done a really good job in terms of executing on that. On the belowground side, that's just pure volume, right? I think that we've had arguably leading margins in the belowground side and they've been executing well. And I believe that we've gained market share in that particular segment. So, I don't think that we've extracted everything that we can from the aboveground portion. I think that -- as I mentioned back in September, I think that we need to improve our margins in the EMEA region. But overall, I think that we're reasonably pleased, but we don't feel that we're at the end of the runway.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. And then, just talking regionally about your performance, obviously you just mentioned the underground inflection has had a regulation in China. But China was a bit weak for you last quarter. Obviously, very strong this quarter and Europe continues to be strong. So, maybe you can talk about those particular regions and what you see going forward. Did you see any stability for instance in businesses like MI in China? Or have they continued to weaken?","Richard J. Tobin","I think that the rate of weakening in MI is relatively static to last quarter, okay. So it didn't get any worse and it didn't get any better. I think that we performed well better than expected in Fluids on the underground portfolio of fueling solutions and that may be a little bit of a pull forward.","EMEA, for us, as you know, is always a messy number, because we've got some substantial businesses there that export a lot. We do our best of trying to recognize revenue, but you've got a business like digital printing, for example, that had an excellent quarter, as we expected. That is -- 100% of that output is recognized in euros but it's exported around the globe. So our euro or our EMEA number is always -- it's more MEA than the E, if you follow me.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Yeah. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.","Richard J. Tobin","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, just back on fueling Rich, I think you just said you got more runway there. Not surprised to hear that. But the improvement that we're seeing, would you call this still just kind of better operational execution among the business as it sits today? Or are we seeing kind of fruits of really trying to maybe better integrate OPW and Tokheim and Wayne and just thinking about what was rolled up in prior years and maybe wasn't really fully stitched together?","Richard J. Tobin","More the former. Right? So I think a lot of it is some of the operational issues that we had last year have been -- not fully but a lot of that has been rectified. So when I referenced the issue of improved production performance Q-to-Q that's really what I'm talking about.","I think that we've made a lot of initial progress in terms of the integration, but that's really a European phenomenon for the most part. And really that's what we need to continue to work on. I think that there's been a lot of work done on it in preparation for harmonization of platforms between Wayne and Tokheim in Europe, but I don't think we're really seeing the benefit of that yet. That's to come.","Jeff Sprague","And you said that EMV did not contribute to growth. Does that mean it didn't grow? Or it didn't grow at a different growth rate than the segment?","Richard J. Tobin","It grew, but it did not materially impact the growth rate in Q3.","Jeff Sprague","And just one last one, cases versus doors. Were you saying just doors were up double-digit? I didn't really catch that.","Richard J. Tobin","No. It's an integrated offering now almost. It's door case.","Jeff Sprague","Yes. Okay. Up double digit in the quarter?","Richard J. Tobin","Yes.","Jeff Sprague","Okay. Thank you. ","Richard J. Tobin","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Richard J. Tobin","Good morning ","Brad Cerepak","Good morning","Nigel Coe","So, great, so free cash flow in the quarter. And obviously free cash is being a little bit lumpy. You've got strong growth no surprise there. But Brad you called out the seasonality impact in 4Q. Normally 4Q cash flow is higher. Number one, do you feel comfortable that you can grow free cash flow sequentially from what you did in 3Q? And therefore, I'll be pushing towards the upper end of the range in terms of the free cash margin guidance.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. Okay. Well, quite frankly, we're pleased with the execution here in Q3. And also, I think, it's the first time we're actually calling out that we've made progress on our working capital, which is great to see. We're continuing that -- those actions into the fourth quarter.","The thing we did point out and we continue to say is, that this is going to be a more heavily invested year, which means we're set up to have a stronger CapEx spend in the fourth quarter. Having said that, I still see that into the fourth quarter and we'll be delivering strong cash again year-over-year. So we feel confident about our cash flow for the year.","Nigel Coe","Okay. I think that's good enough. And then just \u2013 obviously, most of the metrics came in extremely strong. If I had to be critical, gross margin conversion was not a great quarter if I sort of like sort of dig into kind of what needs to improve.","So maybe just unpack gross margins and the \u2013 that decline, I think, it was year-over-year. Kind of what impacted that maybe price\/cost mix? And then, Rich, what improves in 2020 in terms of getting that gross margin converted better?","Richard J. Tobin","It was mix more than anything else. If we unpack it between kind of input cost headwinds and labor inflation versus price, we're better than \u2013 in tariffs, we're better than neutral. It's really mix at the end of the day. And mix you can't control.","I mean, if you look at -- let's pick one, like a company like VSG that posted an excellent top line growth, but the gross margin was down some. It's all mix related, but that's something over time that we think that we can rectify, because it's a specific product line that's kind of ramping up and we're dealing with some of the costs associated with that.","So there's a lot of different initiatives that were going \u2013 that are going on and will take some negative mix. It's not price driven. We're not buying market share, but it's kind of some transitory issues in terms of building up new product lines and the like. And if you look at the geographic mix of our revenue, let's go back to the questions I talked about before and we would be pretty upfront that Fueling Solutions' EMEA margins are negative to consolidated margins and they had a pretty good quarter.","So we'll take the revenue and we'll take the absolute earnings, but it comes out as a negative -- as in the negative mix. So the mix we can't really control. I think that we're trying to be disciplined in terms of pricing and a variety of other things. But you don't want to shut off the top line trying to manage gross margin.","Nigel Coe","Absolutely. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks a lot. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a first question around Refrigeration & Food Equipment demand, not so much around door versus case or door case bookings in Q3 versus Q4, or whatever. But just last year, as you said, organic sales down 8%. This year maybe flat \u2013 flattish let's say. How do you think about the overall customer spending environment? Maybe be for 2020 or even for the medium term, do you really think this is a floor in sales for that segment? And where you think we are on the sort of replacement cycle for customers?","Richard J. Tobin","I think that the market is transitioning the way that we expected it, meaning that it's now driven towards repair, refurbishment which is good. And that's what's driving the door case portion of the volume. I think the greenfield build-out has continued to be weak, so it's a negative to systems.","So systems from here, it's hard to say. I mean, it's how one is a piece of a string. It's pretty damn low in terms of the demand right now, because we don't see a lot of big box greenfield expansion going out there. But we are getting slightly encouraged at least in terms of the door case demand, which is the bulk of the business and that's the part that we're intervening on in terms of its cost structure.","So we feel -- based on what we can see right now and as I alluded to during -- earlier in the call, I think that we should hopefully have some good news about bookings and door case closed in Q4, which sets up 2020 better than 2019 on the systems side. I would hope that we're at the floor right now.","Julian Mitchell","And if you think about what that means for margins, I mean, this year in Refrigeration & Food you've got flattish sales, margins down slightly probably for the year. If you had flattish sales in 2020, do we think the margin performance can be better?","Richard J. Tobin","I hope so. I mean a lot of that is going to be predicated on how we execute on the startup of our automation on the Hillphoenix side of the business. So I would expect that we're going to have some hiccups in Q1 and Q2. I mean, it's a pretty big project, but I think overall I think that we can post increased margins that we're expecting to -- post increased margins on the top line next year.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just my second and last topic would be around capital deployment. Buyback spend in the nine-month period I think $23 million so very, very low. I think in the prepared remarks you've mentioned some attractive M&A opportunities. Maybe just flesh out how you're thinking about that and whether there are a lot of opportunities that you can still do at that 10% year three rolling hurdle rate.","Richard J. Tobin","Well, it's interesting. I think that the amount of opportunities has increased significantly over the last let's say six months, but the pricing environment is still tough. We lost out on one in Q3 that we would've liked to execute it, but the purchase price just got -- we got bid out at the end of the day. But having said that, I think that we've got a better -- a much better pipeline than we did last year, remains to be seen if we can have a meeting of the minds in terms of valuation and get them done. So I think that we feel good that based just on the number of attractive opportunities that you'll see some increased activity there.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hey, good morning guys. ","Richard J. Tobin","Hey, Scott.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Scott Davis","Richard has there been any real change in the M&A processes? Kind of how you guys -- whether the bodies or the process or the filters or anything that you're doing differently since you came on board?","Richard J. Tobin","I guess that's hard for me to say. It's been the same for the 1.5 years that I've been here and I've never retrospectively looked back at the processes in the past, but I think that we've got a pretty robust process for it right now. We walk away from quite a bit unfortunately considering the pricing environment. So we got to have the discipline.","Like I just mentioned we spent a lot of time and money on one that we just lost out on due to valuation in the quarter and that's life sometimes. So I can't speak to the past of the process. I can just say that we are confident in the team that we have here that is objectively evaluating these businesses.","Scott Davis","And just to follow-up on that, I mean, where are the lion's share of your opportunities come from? Are they books that are out there? Are they -- the sponsor stuff? Is it stuff that you guys are internally cultivating or a combination of all? Just\u2026","Richard J. Tobin","It's a combination of all. It's a combination of all.","Scott Davis","Fair enough. Thank you guys.","Richard J. Tobin","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Pat Baumann","Oh, hi. Good morning guys. This is actually Pat Baumann on for Steve Tusa. Thanks for taking my call. A question and I missed it at the very beginning part of the call so I apologize if this is repetitive. But as you look at the segment guidance for organic growth and you look at the year-to-date numbers, it just seems like Fluids the exit rate is going to be at least for the guide maybe just conservative. But just curious it looks like it's going to trend down high single-digits or so in the fourth quarter. Is that just comps timing? Like how would you kind of characterize that? First of all is that the right read in terms of guide?","Richard J. Tobin","No. It's correct and it's what we've been guiding all year that we grew 17% on the top line Q4 last year that there was no way we were going to do that again, because that 17% growth was timing of shipments in our process solution group that some of which that we recognized in Q3 so that business will grow year-over-year. It's just a timing issue.","And the fact of the matter and in fueling solutions we had a self-induced backlog of our inability to get the product out last year, which we've done much a better job this year. So our revenue growth has been more evenly blended. So it's going to be a difficult comp. I think the headline figure is going to be what it is, but I think that we're confident that we can increase absolute earnings quarter-over-quarter despite that difficult top line comp.","Pat Baumann","Understood. And then in the context of what looks like a tough comp to start next year there? Or do you expect kind of next year start out slower than ultimately ends just given those comps?","Richard J. Tobin","I don't want to get into -- look we haven't given that guidance for next year and I'm not going to give out sequential guidance for next year. So let's wait until we close the year, we can deal with seasonality of 2020.","Pat Baumann","Okay. Make sense. And then just my second follow-up would be, just in terms of the incremental cost savings expected for 2020 could you remind us what the total number of the incremental cost savings number -- I wouldn't think that that's changed but just remind us what that is. And then...","Richard J. Tobin","You mean the famous $50 million? I knew, we'd finally got a question. Congratulations Pat. Yes, it's $50 million.","Pat Baumann","So, $50 million. And then should -- like I know you don't want to guide for next year, but you gave that number. So just curious, if we should be thinking about that weighted to 1.5 of the year versus the other...","Richard J. Tobin","You can't stop yourself with the seasonality can you? All right. $50 million is all you've got. Thanks Pat.","Pat Baumann","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys. Just a follow-up on kind of the core margin conversion this quarter, Rich, and I think in some of the past quarters you tried to isolate what was the self-help what was kind of the core conversion. Earlier in the year, I think you would've said core conversion could have been better. Obviously the 60% is a very good all-in number. Just wondering how you kind of grade those different pieces in the quarter.","Richard J. Tobin","It's better and it continues to get better as we've gone through there. Mix aside and a variety of -- just take the noise out of the numbers, it's getting better. And a lot of that is based on improved production performance year-over-year. Now the reason that we stopped disaggregating it is because we said that we were going to do it for a year and the SG&A line especially because of FX movement is now getting really messy, right, because you've got headwinds on profit translation which is offset by kind of core cost on currency which positively impacts in our case the SG&A line.","So it looks like we're overcooking SG&A now. We knew this was coming as we watched FX develop through the year. So overall, look we're never completely satisfied. I think that we've been open about where we need to improve next year. But overall, I think the gross margin conversion or the operating conversion we feel good about.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And then I know you made mention to it a few times on some of the various moving pieces on revenue timing. Any way to kind of size the totality of the revenue that might have been pulled forward for the fourth quarter? Just for the sake of confusion so no one kind of gets that number wrong?","Richard J. Tobin","Yes. We knew -- you can imagine as we were closing this quarter and we knew that we were going to be explaining this Q4 squeeze when we actually beat our own internal estimates for Q3 revenue in Fluids and only became -- made the problem harder. The fact of the matter is, especially as it relates to process solutions to the extent that the product is ready and we can ship it. We'd be crazy not get it out of the door and try to manage the Q4 number.","So it's pumps and processes solution, especially Maag had an excellent Q4 last year. We recognize that in Q3 and I think that we've beaten this whole Fluids issue between the bad comp that was self-induced last year on the aboveground and the fact that we performed very well in Q3 in China, in Q3 and we would not expect that to do that again in Q4 on the underground side.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it, that's helpful. And then just one minor one, anything that you saw, on more of the pumps side of Fluids that matched some of this kind of macro agita out there? It doesn't really seem like it. But given that it's longer cycle maybe it's not something that's apparent in the numbers?","Richard J. Tobin","Yes. I think that the longer-cycle systems business continued to book well for us. I think on the pumps business, we saw some weakening at the end of Q3 going into Q4.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it appreciate the color. Good quarter guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks good morning guys. So we've talked about the 4Q guide to some extent on the Fluids it implied 4Q organic for Fluids. Maybe just thinking about Refrigeration & Food Equipment, it seems like the flattish guide for the year implies about mid-single-digit growth in 4Q. And so just curious just how much of that you already have in your backlog versus meeting short cycle to get better in order to hit that number.","Richard J. Tobin","I would think that we've got the majority of it in backlog.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. All right. Good enough. And then I guess maybe kind of thinking about next year and clearly on the fueling and transport side, you guys have been great regionally but very specifically in China you mentioned an upgrade cycle coming to an end. I guess how do you think about the growth rate in China on the fueling side of the business next year? And is there a headwind that we should be aware of as we're thinking about our own planning for 2020?","Richard J. Tobin","Yes. We think that the belowground portion has got a headwind specifically in China because of the runoff of the regulatory environment. We're working on plans to make it up in other regions at the end of the day. But clearly on the underground side, we would expect that to be a headwind going into next year.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Is your expectation at this point that China overall on the fueling side is still growth next year?","Richard J. Tobin","I hope so, but I think it's a little too early to tell whether -- what the quantum of the underground side versus the catch-up on the aboveground side. So let's -- we don't know yet but that's kind of our planning.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey Rich you've used this term improved production performance multiple times over this call and I would love to hear more specifically around that. What are you doing differently especially in Fluids now versus last year? Is it automation you've added? Did you take out bottlenecks, streamline SKUs? Just give us some color for like what changed that -- in totality is this characterization of improved production performance?","Richard J. Tobin","I think that arguably year-to-date 2019 that the Fluids -- or our fluid solutions group has done the best year-over-year improvement in operations, meaning I think that we were pretty upfront last year that we were struggling with the planned consolidation in Europe that need to be rectified. And to a certain extent we were struggling, not struggling but we felt we had room to improve with our North American operations and both have improved year-over-year. So that's what it is. It's \u2013 so it's \u2013 there's no frictional cost, not a lot of overtime. We're basically \u2013 it's manifesting itself in reductions in working capital terms. A variety of different ways that we measure the performance.","So it's helped us. It's part and parcel to the year-over-year revenue growth because we had the same backlog last year. We're just getting it out in a more sustained fashion this year and not squeezing it into Q4 which happened. So it's that more than re-platforming. I think that the group is doing a lot of good work on re-platforming but that's a benefit I would expect that we see in the future.","Deane Dray","That's great. And then just as a follow-up on the geographies, I'm trying to figure out which is more impressive, the fact that you had all segments growing in Europe, considering some of the anxiety we've seen in slowing there or China being up 20%. Just start with Europe, the balance of the segment growth there and in terms of recent weakness that we've seen in those geographies.","Richard J. Tobin","As I mentioned earlier, we continue to perform well in Europe. And almost inexplicably, I mean, I think I wrote that into our comments despite the bad macros and everything else. But remember too that it is an EMEA comment. It's not necessarily what we would consider the old Western Europe, right? And there are headwinds there.","We run through headwinds in both DESTACO and to a certain extent VSG on our auto OEM European auto OEM volume that we've offset and we've made a lot of that up on Printing & ID that are shipping into greater EMEA. So it's not like a lot of that product is being shipped into Germany per se. A lot of it is being shipped into the Middle East and Africa.","So overall I think there's some timing differences on VSG. I think that Europe was actually up, off of two previous down quarters. And the balance of it is mostly in the Printing & ID segment and on the pumps on the biopharma side.","Deane Dray","And then China, no sign of trade friction fallout?","Richard J. Tobin","No. There's all kind of signs of trade friction fallout for sure. But at the end of the day I think that the Fluids group and digital printing offset weakness in pumps I think and MI in Markem-Imaje.","Deane Dray","Very helpful. Thank you.","Richard J. Tobin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your final question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.","Mig Dobre","Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the China Fluids discussion. Can you help size maybe the benefit that you've had from this pre-buy? I don't know how else to call it but ahead of regulatory changes.","Richard J. Tobin","No. I can just tell you that our estimates for Q3, we did better than we would have thought in terms of timing. Whether we can squeeze out some more growth in Q4 it remains to be seen. But we consider it to be a headwind going into 2020 just because of the end of the transition. But I can't size it.","Mig Dobre","I mean we're all wondering about the materiality of that specific business to the segment overall.","Richard J. Tobin","No I get it. And it's \u2013 the good news for us is that we've got a variety of different \u2013 first of all, once we go to the new segment structure you're going to be able to unpack the long cycle portions of Fluids with the short cycle side. So we'll give you a lot more transparency there.","So before you start taking the entire larger old segment and putting a total headwind on it of some percentage basis I would caution you, why don't you wait to Q4 and then you're going to see the split between the long cycle and the short cycle.","Mig Dobre","Okay. And then lastly on ESG, we've seen some pretty good order volatility throughout the year. I think orders were down quite a bit in the first half. Obviously, you made up for it in the third quarter. What's sort of going on here? In terms of timing is there some specific product rollout? Is this just lumpiness from large customers? And what's kind of the setup going forward?","Richard J. Tobin","It's the latter, right? So we recognize in that particular business that there are large high-value kind of blanket orders that come in from large customers that you've got to deal with the timing of the runoff. So part of the backlog positivity that we had this quarter is the fact that ESG is beginning to bring in orders for 2020 and that's reflected in our backlog.","Mig Dobre","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer period. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Galiuk for closing remarks.","Andrey Galiuk","Thank you. This concludes our conference call. We thank you for your interest in Dover and look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's third quarter 2019 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"6791":["Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 24, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Bob Livingston - President & CEO","Brad Cerepak - SVP & CFO","Paul Goldberg - VP, IR","Analysts","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Scott Davis - Barclays","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Deane Dray - Citi","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 Dover Corporation Earnings Conference Call.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call.","2012 was a strong performance year for Dover in revenue and earnings, and a truly important year for us as we continue to execute on our strategy.  Before I get to our fourth quarter results, I'd like to comment on a few of our key accomplishments during this past year.","With respect to strengthening our company, we continue to concentrate on building our five key growth spaces.  We achieve this in two important ways.  First, we work quite active in acquiring market leading businesses, investing a total of $1.2 billion.  These acquisitions expanded our markets, enhanced our technology and product offerings and broadened our customer base.  For example, through the addition of Anthony in our refrigeration space, we now have access to new markets and new geographies.  Our product offering is greatly expanded lead by the exciting close to key strength and we have gained access to another set of customers.  The same can be said for our Mag Pump and PCS acquisitions, which also added market leading businesses and technologies to our fluids and energy spaces.","Secondly, we announced our plan to divest our electronic assembly and test businesses.  Those strong performers these businesses served historically volatile end markets.  We believe that this position, these businesses will greatly improve the consistency of our future results.  These activities position us very well as we head into 2013.","Additionally in November, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.  In total for the year, we repurchased 12.3 million shares for roughly $750 million, which includes $250 million against the $1 billion program.","Overall I am very pleased with our financial results for the year.  The highlights include 5% organic growth, acquisition growth of 6%, margins exceeding 17%, and nearly $1 billion in free cash flow.","Now some comments on our fourth quarter results.  We posted revenue of $2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6%, and our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of a $1.09, was a 7% improvement over the prior year.","In our Energy segment, increased production activity, especially international markets and continuing strength in downstream distribution and retail fueling were among the trends that drove solid results in the quarter.","Our drilling results as expected continue to be impacted by the lower year-over-year North American rig count.  Overall Energy's performance was characterized by modest revenue growth and strong margins.","At Communication Technologies, the consumer electronics market continue to be strong, especially smartphones.  Our MEMs activity was again very strong reflecting the breadth of our OEM coverage and the benefits of multiple designs wins.","Regarding Sound Solutions, we are now on an improved path and achieved sequentially better performance in the fourth quarter.  We expect this positive trend for Sound Solutions to continue sequentially and for 2013 to be a much better year.","Within our Engineered System segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets remain solid, and our business performance was again quite strong.  We were also very happy to close the Anthony acquisition in the quarter.","Regarding our fluids platform, our acquisitions completed earlier in the year are performing very well and while overall markets remain much the same as last quarter, we began to see improvements in order rates during the fourth quarter.","Within our Printing & Identification segment, solid organic growth in our fast moving consumer goods market, more than offset the choppiness in our industrial markets.  We also saw our European markets begin to stabilize in the fourth quarter.  Our business teams achieved strong margin improvement driven by earlier restructuring activities.","Now, looking ahead to 2013.  In Energy, we expect continued expansion in our production and downstream markets, driven by international activity and constructive oil prices.  To accelerate this international activity, we completed a small bolt-on acquisition in the fourth quarter to serve the international artificial-lift market.  We also expect North America rig count growth to turn positive in the second half of the year.","In Communication Technologies, the smartphone market is forecasted to be strong in 2013, supported by numerous new product releases.  While OEM market share shifts are always possible, we expect to have a key position in virtually all planned smartphone releases and remain highly confident with our full year forecast.  We expect 2013 to be a very strong year for Engineered Systems.  In fluids, we expect a year of growth, as we leverage our recent acquisitions and continue to expand geographically.","Within the refrigeration and industrial platform, we anticipate a year of strong growth for refrigeration and food equipment, driven by customer wins and active remodel market, our expanded product offerings, and recent acquisitions.","In Printing & Identification, we expect the fast moving consumer goods market to remain strong in 2013.  We are also excited about the release of several new products in the coming months and expect our industrial markets to improve.  Our acquisition pipeline remains active and I am confident our M&A program will continue to strengthened over.","Our outlook for the year is unchanged from Dover Day.  We expect to leverage our strong market position, productivity initiatives, and share repurchase program to deliver EPS of $5.05 to $5.35, which represents 17% growth at the midpoint of our range.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Bob.  Good morning everyone.  Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck.  Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 6% over the prior year.  This was comprised of 2% organic growth, 5% from acquisitions, and an unfavorable impact of 1% from FX.","Earnings per share were $1.16, which included a $0.07 benefit from discrete tax matters settled during the quarter.  After adjusting for tax benefits realized in the fourth quarter of both periods, adjusted EPS of $1.09 improved 7%.  Segment margin for the quarter was 16.6%, down 30 basis points.  This result reflects acquisition related costs and significantly higher restructuring, as we continue to pursue productivity and cost reduction initiatives.","In the fourth quarter, these costs were more than $14 million and roughly $7 million being incremental over the prior year period.  Bookings increased 4% over the prior year to $2 billion.  These results represent solid 6% growth in Energy and 4% growth in Engineered Systems.  Bookings were essentially flat in Communications Technologies and Printing & Identification.  Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.98, which is in line with historical trends.  Backlog grew 7% to $1.5 billion.","In the fourth quarter, we generated $482 million of free cash flow.  For the year, free cash flow was $964 million, which was 12% of revenue and a 116% of net income.  Cash flow generation continues to be a strength of Dover.","Now, turning to Slide 4, which shows our revenue growth.  For the quarter we achieved organic revenue growth in all segments.  Engineered Systems driven by refrigeration and food equipment lead the way with 4%.  Communication Technologies, Energy, and Printing & Identification each achieved 1% organic growth, driven by strong MEMs activity along with our medical technology, energy production, and fast moving consumer goods and markets.  For the quarter, our acquisition growth was in our Engineered Systems and Energy segments as they posted 9% and 5% growth respectively.","Turning to Slide 5, in our sequential results.  Revenue decreased 4% from the third quarter largely in line with normal seasonality.  Communication Technologies increased 1% on solid 7% sequential growth at Sound Solutions.  Energy decreased 4% principally due to lower drilling activity, while Engineered Systems decreased 8% largely the result of normal seasonality in the refrigeration end market.  Printing & Identification increased 3% driven by their continued market expansion activities and favorable FX.","Bookings were essentially flat from the third quarter and in line with historical trends.  We achieved growth at three of the four segments, with Energy largely driven by its production end market growing at 4%.  Engineered Systems grew 2% driven by solid fluids orders and Printing & Identification was up 3%.  Communication Technologies bookings declined 14% sequentially.  This result reflects normal seasonality in the handset market, as well as lower order rate late in the fourth quarter, indicating a sequentially softer start for the year.","Now, on Slide 6.  Communication Technologies posted revenue of $401 million, an increase of 1% from the prior year.  These results reflect solid growth in the MEMs portion of consumer electronics, offset by lower revenue at Sound Solutions.","Our Medical Technology and Aerospace\/Defense markets were strong, while Telecom markets remained weak.  Although Sound Solutions revenue decreased year-over-year, it improved 7% sequentially as previously mentioned.","Earnings decreased 18% to $58 million and segment margin was down 330 basis points to 14.6%.  This performance reflects weak telecom markets, lower Sound Solutions volume, and $4.7 million of restructuring costs and one-time charges.","As we start the year, we expect segment revenue and margin to moderate sequentially on anticipated lower volumes primarily due to seasonality.  Bookings were $353 million, essentially flat with last year.  Also consistent with last year, book-to-bill finished at 0.88.","Now, turning to Slide 7.  Energy revenue increased 6% to $540 million, while earnings increased 10% to $134 million.  Energy produced another solid quarter as oil prices remained supportive of continued production activity and downstream markets continued to expand.  Rig count declined year-over-year impacting our drilling business.  Our focus on product innovation and international growth, especially in Australia and Middle East, allowed us to post another quarter of solid revenue growth in both production and downstream.","Operating margin remained very strong.  Our 24.7% margin was an 80 basis point improvement from last year, reflecting our strong market position and productivity initiatives.  Bookings were $550 million, a 6% increase over the prior year.  Book-to-bill was 1.02.","Going to Slide 8.  At Engineered Systems, sales were $819 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year.  Earnings improved 10% to $102 million.","Fluid Solutions revenue grew 27% to $207 million benefiting from acquisitions completed earlier in the year.  Fluid Solutions organic revenue was down 4% with solid results in North America and Asia, offset by a weak Europe.  Refrigeration & Industrial grew 8% to $613 million, including 6% organic growth.","Operating margin was 12.4%, a 30 basis point decrease from the prior year.  This result primarily reflect acquisition related cost associated with Anthony.  Excluding Anthony, segment margin would have been 15.4%, an increase of 270 basis points.  Bookings were $816 million, an increase of 4% resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.","Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 32% to $210 million, while Refrigeration & Industrial decreased 3% from last year to $607 million.  Refrigeration & Industrial bookings included approximately $40 million of orders in the prior year, primarily related to Target's PFresh project, which is now winding down.","Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 1.02, while Refrigeration & Industrials was 0.99.","Now, let's turn to Slide 9.  Printing & Identification revenue was $254 million essentially flat with the prior year.  Earnings increased 22% to $41 million.  Revenue gains in our fast moving consumer goods market helped to mitigate relative softness in our industrial markets.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth in our fast moving consumer goods end market was 4%.","Operating margin improved 280 basis points to 16%.  The benefits of prior restructuring, continued cost improvements, and favorable customer mix helped drive margin improvement.  Bookings were $253 million flat with last year.  Book-to-bill ended at 1.","Going to Slide 10.  Fourth quarter net interest expense was $2 million higher than last year driven in part by higher debt levels related to our recently completed acquisitions.  Corporate expense decreased by $1 million year-over-year.","Our fourth quarter tax rate, absent discrete tax benefits of $0.07 was 28.5%.  This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast, reflecting mix of geographic earnings.  For the full year, our normalized tax rate was 28.2% after adjusting for $0.09 of discrete tax benefits.","Our capital expenditures were $88 million in the quarter.  Lastly, we repurchased 5.8 million shares in the fourth quarter, which includes 4 million shares repurchased under the $1 billion program.  For the year our share repurchase activity contributed $0.12 to our EPS.","Turning to Slide 11, in our 2013 revenue guidance.  Our revenue guidance remains unchanged from Dover Day.  We expect full year revenue growth of 7% to 9%; organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5% for the full year, with the impact of foreign exchange being essentially neutral.  Completed acquisitions will add around 4%.","Now breaking down revenue growth by segment.  We expect Communication Technologies growth to be 9% to 11% for the year, primarily driven by an active consumer electronics market.  Energy growth is expected to be 5% to 7%, including 3% to 5% of organic growth, and 2% from acquisitions.  Engineered Systems is forecasted to have strong growth at 10% to 12%, which includes 2% to 4% organic, and around 8% growth from acquisitions, primarily Anthony.  Lastly within Printing & Identification we expect growth of 2% to 4%.","Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance.  As previously mentioned, we expect full year revenue 7% to 9%.  Corporate expense will be around $150 million, largely reflecting higher pension costs driven by a lower discount rate.","Interest expense will be around $130 million, which is up from last year, and reflects higher debt levels.  CapEx should be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of revenue.  We expect our 2013 tax rate to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%.","Turning to the earnings bridge on Slide 13.  2012 adjusted EPS was $4.44.  For the full year, volume and mix will contribute roughly $0.28 to $0.46, and we expect pricing to be essentially stable.  Net productivity should add $0.12 to $0.22.  We expect completed acquisitions to be $0.13 to $0.16 accretive for the year largely driven by Anthony.","Investment and compensation, including higher pension expense will have a $0.10 to $0.16 impact for the year.","Our ongoing $1billion share repurchase program, coupled with the tax rate and offset in part by incremental interest expense should have a net benefit of $0.23 to $0.28.  The largest component of which is our reduction in our weighted average shares, which will provide a $0.25 to $0.30 benefit.","Based on above we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share to be $5.05 to $5.35 representing 17% growth at the midpoint.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Brad.  As I mentioned earlier I am very pleased with our fourth quarter and 2012 performance.  We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in a tough environment.  This is clearly a testament to the strength of our businesses and the responsiveness of our leadership teams across the company.","Looking ahead to 2013, I remain confident in the positions we hold in our five key growth spaces, which now represent nearly 80% of our revenue.  Our continued focus in these areas offer substantial growth opportunities.","I feel very good about the prospects for 2013 in all four segments.  The acquisition of Anthony and new product offerings will help drive growth at Engineered Systems.  Communication Technologies will continue to grow as consumer demand for better audio products and their mobile devices surges on.  Global expansion opportunities in production and downstream will fuel Energy's growth.  And Printing & Identification will benefit in growth from a expansion of core applications and new product launches.","Going forward, we continue to make internal investments to ensure we can properly support and service our customers.  Included in our plans this year is the build out of a manufacturing facility in the Philippines, which will support the growth we anticipate in both the handset and hearing aid markets.","In addition, we are supporting our growing heat extinguisher business with a new manufacturing plant in Oklahoma.  We also plan to consolidate several facilities serving the Energy market into a new Houston operation and consolidate some of our refrigeration plants into a new facility in Georgia.","Of course, we will continue to make innovation investments to ensure we stay at the forefront in technologies that help our customers win in their markets.","In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for the hard work and dedication in 2012.  Their focus on serving customers and achieving results will continue to drive our success.","Okay, Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Bob.  At this point I'd just like to remind everybody, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we will be able to get more questions.  So with that, Paula, if you can give us the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, since -- okay I am first up, so maybe I'll steal this question.  Can you make comment on any noise that might create in 1Q for Compaq?","Bob Livingston","For 1Q?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Just for 1Q, yeah.  So it looks like there's going to be sequential down tick in handsets volumes in 1Q, which is not untypical, but it looks like I mean the book-to-bill within Compaq was 0.88, which was flat year-over-year, but I would have expected that I had given up Sound Solutions on an upswing.  So, I'm wondering should we expect sharp a seasonal down tick within Compaq in 1Q versus 4Q?","Bob Livingston","Well, let me back up and put this in a little bit of context, Nigel and I think we shared a lot of this with you and others at Dover Day, but there are several trends driving our handset business in 2013.  We still expect the smartphone market to grow in the mid 20% range this year and it will be supported by several new product releases probably from every major OEM and we continue to see the transition to smartphones from the lower end handsets.","We continue to see the trend of using multiple mikes in each smartphone.  We expect that to expand.  In fact, we're now seeing several of the OEMs and there new designs for releases this year that are moving to three mikes per phone.  You commented on Sound Solutions.  We continue to expect Sound Solutions to improve sequentially through the year as they work to rebuild their share and we saw the evidence of this in the fourth quarter.","The first quarter seasonality, it will be similar to what we have seen in the past, it will be down from the fourth quarter, but it is interesting, Nigel, as we look at a current look at the first quarter, our outlook for this segment for the first quarter isn't any different than we were looking at it 60 days ago, as we were finalizing our plans for 2013.  We're going to see some market share shifts in the quarter but I think our broad coverage of the OEMs and the multiple design wins we have will prove to be quite a benefit.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","That's great to hear.  And then switching to Anthony, so you caught a three points of margin degradation within ES, which I calculated to be about $0.10 EPS dilution which is which changes complexion of the quarter quite a bit, but I'm wondering as if we now move to EPS neutral stroke-positive from 1Q onwards?  And I'm wondering if the 15.5 underline margin for that segment in 4Q, which is normally quite a weak seasonal margin in 4Q where that's a good run rate ex-Anthony going into 2013?","","Brad Cerepak","Hi, Nigel, it's Brad.   Let me try to answer that and then maybe we need a follow on but Anthony as you know acquired mid-December we have a lot of acquisition related costs and rollover of inventory happening in the fourth quarter tagging into the first.  We still feel we're still on our same forecast for Anthony.  I think I said at Dover Day we deliver $0.10 to $0.12 of full year EPS accretion for us.  That continues to be our view except that first quarter will be more neutral as more acquisition rollover happens and then it picks up from that point forward.  Some of that is -- they don't have this same seasonality picture as a Hill PHOENIX but there is some seasonality in the Anthony business of course as well.","I guess I want to just back up for a second on this question of how we move sequentially into the quarter and into 2013.  Bob talked about our expectations in the handset market, I've covered a little bit about the expectation on Anthony will not be contributing in the first quarter, but also the PFresh program was very powerful for us early part of 2012, that's not repeating itself.  So, Hill PHOENIX will also have some more normal or traditional seasonality.  And then, lastly, as we indicated earlier in the year -- earlier in the call we see rig counts growing throughout the year.  So, our drilling business will get sequentially better throughout as well.","So, in terms of the way we see starting the year, our starting the year will be more consistent with what we've experienced in years prior to 2012 in essence.  And 2012 had a lot of strength to it in the first quarter.  And so I would expect -- we don't give quarterly guidance but I would expect that the first quarter EPS should be around 20% of our full year, where I see it today.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay.  And just to clarify on the last point.  So, 15.5 margin ex-Anthony within ES.  I mean was there any mix issue pushing up higher that could wind or, is that a good one rate, just the seasonality for 2013?","Bob Livingston","No, there is nothing unusual than the fourth quarter.  And I would expect the margins at Engineered Systems to be reflective in '13 of what they were in '12 with perhaps a little bit of improvement.","","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Want to talk a bit more about Compaq and I know there is some seasonality here in such but the book-to-bill of 0.88.  Can you help us kind of reconcile, booking is flat versus book-to-bill at 0.88 versus kind of a seasonality; I know a year ago was also lower but I figure the timing of some of your handset guys ramping up production would have caused that book-to-bill to be a little bit higher, so can you help us out there?","Bob Livingston","We see a lot of noise on any given quarter around book-to-bill with individual companies or individual customers.  Scott, it's interesting to note that it's probably a little bit different here with this part of our business than it is with the rest of our portfolio, in that we typically are only showing bookings in our handset activity for about the next two to two and a half months worth of production expectations.  So, I think we are seeing some seasonality return to this business that's reflected in the book-to-bill especially in the latter part of the fourth quarter.  As I commented, I think it was on Nigel's question, we will see the handset business down in the fourth quarter sequentially from the -- or in the first quarter sequentially from the fourth but we're still showing -- we're still expecting the business to show growth in their first quarter year-over-year.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay.  And we will go back to Sound Solutions.  There is a couple of things I'm trying to figure out here.  I mean, in the slide it says, improved sequential performance to Sound Solutions then, to lower is lower Sound Solutions revenue.  I mean are we at the point now where sequentially revenue is going to go up each quarter or you're just talking about profitability improving?","Brad Cerepak","Both.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay.  So, we are at the bottom as far as the revenue ramp?","Brad Cerepak","","Q3 was the bottom.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Q3 was the bottom.","Brad Cerepak","","Q3.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay.  All right, fair enough.  And then, last question just same topic here.  I mean, how much do you I know it's really hard to talk with individual customers here, but how much do you guys really care about the share shifts that are going on in the handset market?  Is it -- are you somewhat customer agnostic I guess is my question or they're kind of diseconomies to scale as you need to ship less to one customer but a little bit more to another customer?  I mean, how does that workout?","Bob Livingston","Well, it always gives little bit of angst within the short-term or the near term as you see the shifts.  But again, let me try to put this in context and let me use Knowles Acoustics as an example.  I think in 2012, we produced and shipped a little over 1.2 billion microphones.  Our plan for 2013 is about 1.5 billion microphones.  You break that down if it were absolutely equal every quarter, which it's not, but if you looked at our quarterly average, what is that about 370 million or 375 million mikes per quarter for Knowles, you see a little bit of noise in ship during the quarter or during a half year period from customer-to-customer, we have to manage through that.  But the volume expectations in serving the broader market and we do have a very, very good design coverage on the border market still gives us plenty of opportunity to grow for the year and to manage internally the ships that we do experience from customer-to-customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","A little more on Sound Solutions and Compaq.  It looks like we're back to kind of a business with 3% of sales being 90% of the conference call, food for thought.  Just wondering, I just want to be clear.  So, on handsets you're expecting Q1 down sequentially for your business overall but Sound Solutions up sequentially?","Brad Cerepak","","Honestly, yes.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Yes.  Can you give us some color, Bob, on just how to think about the profit comparison, the loss you absorbed in 2012, does that move to a zero in '13, the magnitude of that swing and is that swing kind of in your sights given where the current yields are?","Bob Livingston","Okay.  So when you look at our guidance for '13, gosh what is the V or the delta, Brad, on Sound Solutions from '12 to '13.  It's --","Brad Cerepak","Yeah, we would expect the year-over-year would be all in, and when I say all in Jeff, I am talking about including AD&A, which is quite substantial in this business.  As you know it would be $0.13 to $0.18 where our expectation on Sound Solutions will contribute $0.13 to $0.18 for 2013.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","On a V basis.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","On a V basis.  So what I would tell you though is that full in with AD&A, we're still showing some drag on our EPS, there is small amount, but some drag.  And by the time we exit though and we've consistently talked about it in this fashion, as we exit out the second half it's a positive contributor to our EPS.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","And at the operating level ignoring the AD&A, the second half of the year we do have expectations so that the operating margins at Sound Solutions would be in low double digits.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay.  Great.  All right.  Shifting if I could to the production business a) it looked good and b) you know called out Energy.","Bob Livingston","Are you referring to Energy?","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Yeah, Energy.","Bob Livingston","Okay.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","The strength in production, could you elaborate a little bit on the international trends you've obviously spoken about markets opening up in Oman and Mexico and other places, was there some clear inflection in your penetration in those markets?  Just a little bit of elaboration on what's going on there.","Bob Livingston","Yeah, nothing new that we haven't been sharing with you over the last four or five or six quarterly calls.  This has been a focus for us for the last two or three years.  I think, last year, we probably experienced better than a 20% growth in our international business related to production that that continued in the fourth quarter.  We see it continuing in '13, though it may be at a smaller growth rate but off of the higher base, but we're seeing it around the world not just Mexico, but other regions in South America, the Middle East, and Australia.  Australia, over the last goodness 12, 15 months has proven to be a strong growth market for us as well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi.","Deane Dray - Citi","Hey, in product ID the margin improvement that's 280 basis points you called out both restructuring and mix and maybe you can give us some color as to what the contribution of those two were for the quarter?","Brad Cerepak","Oh my goodness.  I'm not sure I can split the difference for you.  The margin performance to margin improvement in the fourth quarter one, number one, it was expected.  We've been working towards this for the last two or three quarters and the restructuring of the third quarter.","Deane Dray - Citi","It is actually.  It was.","Brad Cerepak","It was quite consistent with the third quarter.  But the restructuring activity that we referred to were some changes we made in the business back in late first quarter and the second quarter and Deane it takes a few months for some of the benefits to flow through when we were starting to see those benefits in the third and fourth quarter.  We think the -- we like where we're at now with Markem-Imaje.  We had pretty decent growth at Markem-Imaje in the fourth quarter; I think it was 3% or 4%.  We saw some softness in our industrial markets and that's specifically around our Datamax-O'Neil business that we think will change and we'll see some recovery in 2013.  But the margins that we have at Markem-Imaje today and for the second half of the year we view as sustainable and we're looking for ways to incrementally improve of going into '13.","Deane Dray - Citi","And what specifically was going on with mix is it new product introductions, you capturing more of the business?","Brad Cerepak","I would say it's almost all new product introductions.","Deane Dray - Citi","Okay.  Good.  And just one last quick follow-up over on the Compaq side, Bob you referenced the trend towards some of the lower price point phones with some of the reduced features would that also result in fewer microphones or is the market kind of locked into more is better?","Bob Livingston","No, I think on the lower-end phones it's still pretty safe to use a number of one microphone per phone.  On the smartphones, as I commented earlier, we are seeing the growing trends in multiple mikes and actually it is we've been convinced of this for the last couple of years and I think '13 is going to be a proving point for us.  We see it happening now that most of the -- a lot of the -- most of the new phones being introduced in 2013 will have three microphones.","Deane Dray - Citi","Right.  And I'll just add on that that they're actually advertising some of the microphone technology and filtering and so forth, so that's becoming a bigger cell feature.  But that just remains.","Bob Livingston","I've actually noticed that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So what do you think -- thanks for the unit, the volume numbers for the year on those?  What did the Knowles revenue grow this year and maybe if you give the exact detail in the fourth quarter.  I noticed you guys re-segmented that segment and now it's a much, you can't really see those numbers.  So just curious as to you give us the units which is great, but maybe just the revenue numbers.","Bob Livingston","You're asking for the gross or the year?","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Yeah gross or because out on from last year, you used to disclose what the Knowles revenues were for this year.  What were they?  You know non-stamp solutions and I think you moved some other stuff into that consumer electronic sub-segment for Compaq.  So I'm just trying to pass that out because it's very hard to see what that particularly is doing now?","Bob Livingston","Actually Steve I think what we're showing, what we're showing in consumer electronics actually is a bit cleaner than what we probably have initially.  But consumer electronics, I think is entirely Knowles Acoustics.  I'm excluding hearing aid business.  Knowles Acoustics and Sound Solutions.","Paul Goldberg","Right.  So within that Steve, its Paul, I think what you'll see is the MEMs.  I think the question you're asking is what MEMs volume, what MEMs revenue growth is.  Is that correct?","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Yeah, yeah I mean you guys used to say, call it handsets I think.","Bob Livingston","So for MEMs revenue growth in the fourth quarter, I think it was about 30%.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay that makes a lot of sense.  So then and so that finished the year somewhere in the kind of up 25% to 30% range for the annual number?","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay.  Great.  What was the $5 million charge there at Compaq?","Bob Livingston","Oh, my goodness, restructuring in three or four, nothing major at any one business, but restructuring activity I think at three or four businesses.  And maybe the largest one at any given business was probably a $1.5 million or $1.8 million, something like that.  Brad does that sound right?","Brad Cerepak","Yeah about a $1.4 million.","Bob Livingston","Yeah.","Brad Cerepak","So at one of our businesses.  But a lot of spend this year in Compaq has been around restructuring our Telecom business.  So we've had restructuring charges a little bit each quarter and that continued into the fourth quarter and we'll continue to look at that in 2013 to take more cost out as the Telecom markets remain fairly weak.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay.  And then one last question is on Engineered.  What -- you mentioned a very helpful with the bookings number of $40 million I think you said at PFresh last fourth quarter?","Bob Livingston","Yeah.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Is that right?  So what were the PFresh revenues for -- in '12 for you guys and what were the orders?","Bob Livingston","I am not sure I can give you the orders for the year.  I would say that if you wanted some context on the PFresh Program and Steve, I would think in 2011, it was about a $130 million.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay.","Bob Livingston","In 2012 it was about $30 million down.  In 2012, with all most all of that down comparison being in the second half of last year.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay.","Bob Livingston","And in '13, we expected to be down another $40 million or $50 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","If you were to exclude your tech businesses, what did you see in China in the quarter?  I realize you're not penetrate across the spectrum of your company but just would you corroborate sort of these trends that you are seeing toward Chinese macro improvements?  Just how does that play out?","Bob Livingston","If we were to exclude the tech businesses well, I do not have the data but we would have had growth but it would have been probably single digits in China in the fourth quarter.  Actually, John it is interesting.  If you look at all of Asia for the fourth quarter, the growth was probably little bit better than that.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","So, China is still a little bit of a laggard.","Bob Livingston","Well, we are seeing a recovery in China, we did see it.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Bob Livingston","","The headline news that everyone reads with respect to the improving activity in China was reflected in our activity as well in the fourth quarter.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","","Yeah, that is really well, I was -- what I am searching for.  Bob, the outlook for smartphone is obviously very robust, you got microphone penetration story.  What I am wondering about is that as smartphones are now going to be penetrating, a lot of these overseas markets.  The OE have plans to introduce kind of low-end phones or lot of lower price phones.  That certainly is a conjecture what Apple should respectfully be doing, and it is not just them it is others.  What do you think that does to kind of your pricing in the outlook?  I am not talking about your first quarter anything, but does that change anything in any way and is it superseded maybe because you got more penetration but lower future pricing or is it still premature to kind of call that out?","Bob Livingston","Okay.  Is this a question specific to Knowles?","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","","Yes, it is.","Bob Livingston","Okay.  We tend to play -- let me step back.  With speakers and receivers, we tend to have a position across the entire market whether it is the lower-end handsets ","","With respect to our microphone business, it tends to be much higher concentration in the smartphone segment.  And again, it comes back to the multiple mikes per phone.  The last year or so, I guess the example I would use would be Samsung, who has not only got the top-end smartphone product offerings but the mid range in the lower-end smartphone product offerings.  We have a very, very strong design and share position with that customer and the products that we sell them tend to be same.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","","Okay.","Bob Livingston","Which is irrespective of their price point on the product offering.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","So, you are suggesting that the window into prospectively billions in pricing?","Bob Livingston","I think the relationship in the example I just used here was Samsung, is indicative of what we will see with other lower-end smartphones as they could introduce by other customers.  It does increase the market for us.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","","Just last on Sound Solutions, from an outsiders perspective it seems some of inevitable that you maybe even have to take a write down.  You just talked to us about sort of the process.  Brad, like what -- does this happen kind of once in terms of your review and has it just happened or I mean, how do you do it, is it too soon to kind of make that call obviously, given the sequential improvement that is happening?","Brad Cerepak","","Yeah, I think it is the latter.  It's too soon to make that call.  We do obviously have to look at goodwill impairments, once a year and we do that in the fourth quarter.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","","But we are seeing sequential improvement.  We continue to articulate our high expectations for this company and the prospects for it.  As Bob indicated, we are going to see sequential growth for 2013 and exit at a level that is not satisfactory to us, but a significant improvement.  We see our way back to the historical levels of profitability.  You recall this business at one point had high 20s EBITDA margins and I think that is still within our reach.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","","So, just one last one hopefully, on Sound Solutions we will see, but did it achieve breakeven kind of core pre-AD&A in the quarter and what did you get the yields too on speakers and receivers?","Bob Livingston","Yes, to your first question on an operating basis it was about break-even.  We continue to see we'll use the phrase our financial yields continue to improve and in a couple of the product areas, we're actually quite pleased with the yields that we're at now coming into 2013.","Brad Cerepak","More to do.","Brad Cerepak","More to do, we're not done yet, but it's we were quite pleased with the progress that we made in the fourth quarter.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","So are both pieces basically to break-even type yields at that point?","Bob Livingston","We mean both pieces.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","The speakers and receivers.","Bob Livingston","For product areas, I would say, yes, for individual lines, we probably still have a little bit more work to do on receivers and we have on speakers on the speaker boxes.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay.  And then in terms of this drilling outlook through the year, I mean how much was drilling down this quarter and when do you expect that to bottom and turn positive?","Bob Livingston","Are you referring to our business or the rig count?","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Both.","Bob Livingston","Okay.  So, let's see our drilling activity -- our drilling this revenue in the fourth quarter I think was down about 10%.  Brad does that sound about right, year-over-year?","Brad Cerepak","Right.","Bob Livingston","And again about as expected as we came into the quarter.  Our outlook for '13 for our drilling business is essentially flat.  You'll see it -- you'll see some different numbers during the year when we report quarterly, but our outlook for the year is going to be essentially flat.  Embedded in our guidance is the assumptions and the data we use on what we think rig count will be in 2013.","If you look at average for '12 versus average for '13 in the U.S. market, we expect the rig count average for '13 to be down again versus '12.  Again and again I'm using average for '12 versus average for '13 about 3%.  But if you look at where we ended the year at year-end '12 rig count, I think was like 1,760 units here in the U.S.  We see it moderating down a bit further during the first quarter, but it's -- all indications are after the first quarter is that this will start to increase again and I think the average for '13 versus the year-end number for '12 it's up about 3% or 4%.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Just a follow-up on the Energy, how should we think about mix change within the segment between domestic and international during the year?","Bob Livingston","Mix change.  I'm not sure; it's going to be any different in '13 than it was in '12.  Other than, we continue very strongly to push the expansion of our artificial-lift business and some of our downstream applications into international markets.  I mentioned in my prepared comments, small acquisition that we closed on in December and even though, it's a U.S. business that we acquired, our intent with this business is to dedicate all of its production capability over the next year or so to serving some of our international customers, it will continue to grow.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","But I guess the question of the U.S. rig count is sort of flattish and international is growing, why wouldn't the mix change more towards international or the U.S. is just so big, North America is so big?","Bob Livingston","Therein, is you answer, I still think our North America business -- our North America slice of our drilling and production business is probably still 83%, 85% of the total.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Just a -- in terms of this pace of buybacks throughout the year, should we expect them to rough financial free cash flow or is there any specific pattern that you should -- we should keep in mind?","Bob Livingston","Yeah, I guess when we were at Dover Day, I said at that time that we would complete somewhere around 70% to 80% of the buy against the $1 billion program.  We completed 250 in the fourth quarter.  I think you'll -- you should expect that we'll continue to buy more weighted towards the first half of the year in 2013, not necessarily lining up with free cash flow.","Operator","Thank you.  That concludes our question-and-answer period.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for any closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Paula.

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on this morning's conference call, let's get started on Slide 3.","Organic revenue was up 3% for the quarter as solid demand trends in Engineered Systems and Fluids more than offset the continued weak demand environment in Refrigeration and Food Equipment.","Adjusted Q3 earnings of $203 million and adjusted earnings per share were up 9% and 14% respectively. Bookings remained solid at $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter and are broad-based across the portfolio excluding Refrigeration.","Overall the quarter was largely in line with our internal forecast and our earnings comments at the end of Q2. We expected a slower Q3 relative to the previous quarter in Engineered Systems as a result of demand colonization and scheduled production shutdowns at our European operations, despite this Engineered Systems margin conversion, our volume remained strong at 47%.","Fluids performed as expected with solid results in Pumps and Process Solutions buffering the residual footprint costs in fueling and transport. Refrigeration & Food Equipment proved to be tougher than expected in the quarter and we've incorporated current conditions into our full-year guidance.","Our fourth quarter stacking up to be driven by improved margin conversion in our Fluids segment as we get our operational issues behind us, coupled with the flow-through of our cost initiatives more than offsetting the negative impact of Refrigeration and Food Equipment business and the higher tax rate projected for the quarter.","We have significantly completed our SG&A rightsizing plans during the quarter, which we will address in the presentation and that we're moving forward with our footprint rationalization activities, which we expect to begin executing in Q4.","As a result of the above, we have further tightened the top end of the range of our EPS guidance to $4.80 to $4.85 per share.","I'll pass it to Brad here and come back during the segment slides, Brad?","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4. As mentioned, our results were largely driven by solid demand in Engineered Systems and Fluids. Adjusted segment EBIT was essentially unchanged at $274 million and adjusted margin was 15.7%.","This performance reflected strong conversion in engineered systems and improved performance in fluids, largely offset by lower volume in Refrigeration and Food Equipment. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $341 million.","Adjusted earnings was $203 million and adjusted EPS was a $1.36. EPS benefited in the quarter from a lower tax rate on discrete tax benefits. The full-year effective rate is now expected to be between 20% and 21%.","Moving on to Slide 5, let's get into a little bit more detail on our revenue and bookings results in the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion was comprised of 3% organic growth, offset by a 3% impact from dispositions net of acquisitions. FX was minimal in the quarter.","Organic growth remained above 3% in Q3, despite headwinds in Refrigeration and Food Equipment. FX, which was a tailwind of 2.2% in Q2 decelerated into Q3, resulting in a small headwind of a 0.5%. We are using a US dollar-euro assumption of $1.17 in our current forecast.","From a segment perspective, Engineered Systems grew $35 million organically and fluids grew $58 million on broad-based activity. Weak retail refrigeration markets and delayed shipments and can-shaping equipment drove a $39 million decline in Refrigeration and Food Equipments' revenue.","Bookings increased 3% overall. Organic growth was 6%. Of note, Engineered Systems and Fluids' organic bookings grew $38 million and $77 million respectively, reflecting broad-based market demand.","From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market was flat organically where broad-based growth in Engineered Systems and Fluids was offset by Retail Refrigeration. Europe was up 2% organically and Asia grew 23%, largely driven by strong activity in our Fluid segment. Finally, book-to-bill finished at 0.98%.","Let's take a look at the earnings bridges on Slide 6. Starting on the top, engineered adjusted segment EBITDA improved $8 million, largely driven by solid conversion on broad-based revenue growth. Fluids' EBITDA growth of $9 million reflects better execution in retail fueling and conversion on volume in our other businesses.","The $23 million decline at Refrigeration and Food Equipment reflects lower volume and negative business mix.","Going to the bottom of the chart; adjusted earnings improved $16 million or 9%, primarily driven by lower interest and corporate cost and a lower tax rate.","Now on Slide 7; our nine-month free cash flow was $284 million or 66% of earnings from continuing operations. Third quarter free cash flow was $206 million, was on track with our expectations and largely in line with last year.","We expect the fourth quarter to be our highest free cash flow quarter of the year, which is our normal pattern. Of note, the free cash flow impact of our restructuring initiatives on a year-to-date basis was $39 million of which $11 million was paid in Q3.","In all, we expect to deliver full year cash flow within the range that we provided at our Investor Day in September.","Moving to Slide 8; finally, we completed the open market portion of our 1 billion share repurchase program in the first week of October after repurchasing a 148 million in Q3. The 700 million ASR will be finalized by year-end thus completing the full program.","With that, let me turn it back to Rich.","Rich Tobin","Okay. Thanks Brad. Let's try to put some color around some of the segment performance in the quarter starting on Slide 10 with Engineered Systems. Engineered Systems had a solid broad-based quarter with seven out of eight operating companies posting improved revenue, driving a topline organic growth of 5%.","Margin conversion in the quarter was excellent at 47% with all operating companies improving profitability quarter-over-quarter. Our printing and identification platform had solid performance in market by margin digital printing both of which posted topline growth greater than the average of the portfolio at accretive margins to the segment.","Market modest growth is broad-based geographically with particular strength in consumables, which is positive to margins. Dover digital printing was driven by large equipment shipments and cost control initiatives, offsetting a competitive price environment.","The industrial platform business is all increased comparative profits as our CapEx levered businesses continue to operate in a constructive demand environment. Our ESG business continued to deliver strong absolute profit results despite having a less rich product mix during the quarter and the continued pressure from higher raw material cost pass through.","Our vehicle service group delivered its strong margins margin performance of the year despite its European facilities beings down for scheduled maintenance in the quarter. OKI, DESTACO and TWG continued to benefit from end market CapEx-driven demand and dealer stocking and microwave products continued to perform in what we believe to be a multiyear constructive environment for military spending.","Going into Q4, bookings for Engineered Systems remained solid. We expect the quarter to be a good one, despite some comparable negative product mix in ESG and microwave products and FX headwinds in our businesses that are material exposed to Europe predominantly, Markem-Imaje, digital printing and ESG.","Next slide. The Fluid segment posted organic growth of 9% for the quarter with the majority of the portfolio posting comparative topline growth with particular strength in our fueling and transport businesses.","Consolidated margin for the segment was flat largely as a result of the dilutive impact of fueling systems to segment margin and some transitory footprint issues in our transport business, which should be largely contained in Q3.","Our pumps and process solutions businesses all performed well during the quarter. Incremental margin performance in PSG, MAG and Precision Components were all in excess of 50% in the period, as a result of volume leverage, mix pricing and cost control initiatives, outweighing input cost headwinds and tariff costs on imported components.","Colder continued to perform well in the period in both the top and bottom lines as a result of solid demand in single-use connectors. Fueling and transport had a choppy quarter from a margin conversion point of view, but we are encouraging in our exit margin for the quarter and our forecast for topline and margin conversion leading into Q4.","In Q3, DFS posted solid topline growth and while incremental margin performance was still below expectations, it was improved and leaves us to be confident that the majority of our footprint consolidation costs are behind us and that we are headed in the right direction in meeting our margin objectives as we outlined in our September presentation.","In OPW, while our margin performance was satisfactory, we did have prior period footprint-related costs in the quarter and lost production time at our North Carolina facility as a result of weather-related issues.","Our Q4 forecast for Dover is largely driven by the expected improvement, margin conversion in the Fluid segment, particularly driven by our fueling and transport businesses, improving their operational performance and the beginning flow-through of our cost control initiatives.","I've just returned from our facility in Dundee, Scotland, while there remains much to do, I am confident that our line rates are set to improve through the quarter and will benefit from the industrial absorption and reduction in frictional costs.","Of note, we are assessing the outlook for EMV demand in the U.S. in 2019 and we'll be making some decisions as to the appropriate level of component stock to be carried into January to support projected demand.","Moving on the Refrigeration and Food Equipment had its toughest quarter of the year and Q3 with segment revenue down 12% to $386 million. While we have been expecting another difficult quarter in retail refrigeration, we are caught off guard in our Belvac business, where machine deliveries have increasingly deferred into 2019, negatively impacting our prior forecast for segment margin for the quarter and full year.","Our full-year segment forecast now incorporates a more modest decline in demand and Retail Refrigeration as this business begins to bottom and a push out of machine deliveries from Belvac into 2019, which are as significantly accretive to margins in the segment.","This negative mix impact will be partially offset by cost control actions undertaken in the year, largely in the Retail Refrigeration business. This earnings miss in Belvac does not add an additional operational challenge to the Group, nor does it change the fundamental value of the business in the portfolio as it is unique asset, capable of delivering high, but inherently lumpy returns.","As we presented in September, we've begun in earnest to address our footprint actions in the segment as it is the clearest path to improving margins to the target ranges that we established in the presentation. We expect to begin in Q4 and continue the project through 2019.","Let's go on to the next slide, as we noted in the morning's press release, we are progressing as planned in the rightsizing initiative that we announced at our Investor meeting in September. As you see in the slide, we are well on our way to concluding the reduction in force portion of the plan and you can see the reconciliation of the PLL impact for both the restructuring charge and the SG&A cost reduction in Q3 and the projection of the timing of the charges for the balance of the plan.","The non-headcount portion of the plan will be almost exclusively weighted towards 2019 and I think that Brad addressed converting these charges into cash, we can deal with the Q4 charges and what do we project on that cash impact in the Q&A.","Moving on to the next slide is the guidance, which I addressed in the press release in my comments on the segment outlooks to conclude. We enter Q4 with good order backlog to cost much of the portfolio, which has weathered the challenges of higher input costs in an uncertain global trade environment during the year.","Clearly there remains much to do to deliver on our full year guidance, but by acting decisively our cost structure, we are in a good position to deliver. I've been encouraged by the engagement of our leaders to embrace these changes and I'm looking forward to embarking on the next stage of our initiatives and our objective of delivering best-in-class operating performance.","That's it. Let's move on to Q&A.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Rich. Laurie, before we have our first question, I just like to remind everybody, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, that will be able to get more people in the queue. Let's have our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Rich Tobin","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Rich, at the Analyst Day in September, you mentioned you're starting to see some stability in pricing within Refrigeration. You kind of did talk about in the presentation today, you'd also mentioned some interesting new products coming out. Obviously, you have the Belvac delays there, but margin was lower than most of us thought.","So can you -- is it too early still to call it bottom there and can you keep up with the cost there? Can you use cost pick up to keep up with the volume declines as we go into 2019?","Rich Tobin","Okay. Well, I think that we need to bifurcate the answer between the headwind on Belvac that is really going to move into 2019. That's going to cost us about $10 million in comparable profits to Q4 last year.","We're not where as I mentioned, I am not worried about the business overall. The backlog is there. It's just that these are pretty lumpy revenue and returns and the margin on the Belvac volume is quite high. So we're going to have to make up that particular headwind on that basis from that with cost control actions of the aggregate of the cost control actions.","On Retail Refrigeration, we haven't really seen a positive pricing environment, but I think that early data shows that some of the negative pricing pressure that we saw in the first half of year has begun to moderate.","I don't think we're prepared to call the bottom, but at least from what we can see in backlog is going into Q4 clearly the market started slowing down at the end of last year. So the comp gets better, but the rate of decline in terms of the backlog is significantly smaller than we've been seeing all year.","So I don't think we are prepared right now to say we're at the bottom, but I think the data would show that the decline has come down quite a bit and that the pricing headwinds have moderated some. We're going to really move from our decision-making process going into next year is really going to be to call the size of the market and that's what's going to drive the cost takeout from a footprint point of view, but that's really a full-year project that can take us to do it.","So I'm -- look, I just don't think it's getting that much worse going into '19, but I don't have any indicators that say it's going to be better in '19 other than the fact that I think that we will benefit from the -- through the year cost takeout when we start doing the comps going into 2019.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Great and then Rich, maybe can you give us some more color into revenue growth across the company. Obviously, you talked by geography, U.S. is flat. We know it's Refrigeration sort of holding that down. Asia 0.3%, obviously there is a lot of concern out there on the macro side into China and Asia, but didn't seem like you guys are seeing it.","So maybe talk about the visibility you have in two of the geographic growth as you go Q4 and into 2019?","Rich Tobin","Look clearly the North American market is the leader in terms of the demand, but in our exposure to Asia overall, is relative -- it's not overly material, but right now are the demand that we've seen particular in China is kept up.","A lot of that is in the underground portion or the OPW portion of the business right now. North America I think it's a couple different tales at the end of the day. I think the CapEx levered businesses that we have are posting good topline growth. I think if you go through some of the -- some of the comments that I wrote in the press release about who's clocking double-digit growth, we can go through it again, but our fueling systems is close to 15 for the quarter.","So that begs the question of what going to have to happen to EMV. So I'll leave that to a follow-on question. But overall, GDP in North America is up and it's driving the CapEx end of our businesses.","I think the Markem-Imaje is just performing in the sector. So it's growth was close to 5% for the quarter. So it's clocking quite well and that as I mentioned in the margin conversion in those business has been excellent.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks. That's good color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Winoker of UBS.","Steve Winoker","Thanks and good morning all. Hi, just a couple questions; one, not just because you cheated off. So what was the EMV growth in the quarter? What are you seeing in terms of trajectory there and how are you thinking about that going forward?","Rich Tobin","I won't put it in percentage terms, but EMV grew during the quarter approximately 5%. The expectation that that same rate will continue into Q4, I think that our view is US demand, EMV-driven demand however we want to describe that between [indiscernible] and full units is going to be up next year.","I just don't think we're prepared to put a quantum on it yet, but clearly it's going to be in our 2019 guidance. So it's coming, the decisions that we're trying to make is how much inventory delay in as I said in my comments, how much inventory delay in to be prepared if we get a big flex at the beginning of 2019.","Steve Winoker","Okay. Good to hear. And then I just want to follow up at Belvac commentary as well, simply because if we go back and listen to their comments from last quarter, at that time it was pushed and the thought was look it's backend loaded to Q4. The expectation was that it will remain.","So specifically, it's always easy for a lot of companies as they project push out for large projects. Can you give us a little more comfort level that of what's going on here and why it's sort of just one more quarter and we can then put in our own numbers for Q1.","Rich Tobin","Yeah, look I think that we're pretty transparent. We're caught off guard bias right. We had the backlog and we're moving into beginning the source and we did source some of the raw [ph] to actually get into building out some pretty large units. The deliveries have been deferred.","Now what does that mean for 2019 is an additive. I think it's too early to say, but I think that what we believe is what we had in the pipe. We're going to deliver in 2019, but I mean, look these are very big machines. So they had big ticket prices on them and they have very high margins on is pissed off as everybody that the fact that they got, but I don't believe that it's something that's changed in terms of the market structure that you know what I mean, that some reason that the retail what would it be called, retail food for beverage is rolling over by a stretch imagination and our customers there are a lot of times retail beverage. There's some of the canning makers themselves.","So I don't think it's overly worrisome. I just think that the timing of it is poor and the fact that it happened in a sector that we've already had headwinds in is it makes it doubly poor, but I think it's still a good business and I would expect that, that we'll deliver on that volume that we should have been in 2019.","Brad Cerepak","I would just add to your comment earlier, we'll just have more to say about this in January '19, but I would not at this stage think that it's an automatic ship in the first quarter. We'll come back on the timing of that, which is expected to be slightly later than that or later than that.","Steve Winoker","Okay. All right. That's all really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning all.","Rich Tobin","Good morning.","Jeffrey Sprague","Rich, want to think a little bit more about the puts and takes in a little more detail, the Belvac color is really helpful. If we think about I guess you got roughly $24 million of restructuring tailwinds in the numbers here in 2018.","Should we think kind of the most of the kind of missing upside for lack of a better term is just price cost. Can you give us a little color on price cost in the quarter and what you're dealing with there and any kind of pricing counteraction that you're taking?","Rich Tobin","I think as I mentioned in my comments, I think that both the Engineering Systems Group and Fluids Group performed as we expected. I think at the end of Q2, I made some comments that if you looked at the trajectory of earnings in Engineering Systems that you couldn't just clock that through the balance of the year because of the fact that we knew that Q3 is going to be a little bit light to that trajectory.","Now having said that, the incremental margin on that revenue is still significant. So it's not by any means a bad performance. It's just that we expected that to happen to a certain extent.","On Fluids, I think the growth rate is still very good, but it's a little bit of the same story that we've had year-to-date in terms of the margin conversion on the DFS portion of the business. It actually exited quite well in the month of September and that's why in our full-year forecast, a lot of our operating performance, at least our comparable operating performance year-over-year is can be driven by Fluids.","Jeffrey Sprague","And think I was also curious. I think you said the footprint restructuring is now actually done in fueling. I was thinking that was more of a 2019 exercise. Is that correct?","Rich Tobin","No, no. What I was saying is that we've been carrying around the cost of the Dundee consolidation. The Europe, the first piece of the European footprint, which never went into restructuring. We've been taken that through the P&L all year. That is largely complete. So that's where I was last week.","Look, we're getting into the gory details. Line rates are picking up, the absorption is picking up and without getting into monthly margins, I look at our September margins in DFS. They\u2019ve moved up significantly. So it leads us to feel good about the fact that that's where we have a lot of demand going into Q4, if we can convert September margins, we're in pretty good shape.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And thanks for the concise nature of the preparatory remarks. My first question I guess is on the free cash flow. I saw the detail on restructuring and so forth, but working capital has been a big drain in the first nine months, $160 million or so of the cash out.","So I just wondered how quickly we should expect that to reverse and whether one should expect a much better performance on that next year?","Rich Tobin","Well, I think that Brad said in his comments that we expect to be within the range that we gave as a percent of revenue in the September presentation. It's going to clearly going to take some heavy lifting to get there, but we think we are confident we can get inside the range.","And in terms of 2019 performance, well, if I take out the restructuring, the cash impact on the restructuring, that's going to depend on our guidance for topline revenue right.","So again we are building net working capital, which is pretty much inventory receivables on the back of topline growth. Refrigeration is just not large enough to offset that. So our liquidating inventory on refrigeration side because revenue is coming down but conversely we've been building inventory on some pretty good growth rates on the balance of our business.","We are not clocking at best-in-class cash flow clearly. So there's a lot of work to be done, but before we start giving '19, I think that I'll put it this way. In '19, we'll be through in the range that we gave in September. How that dynamic functions is going to be a question of once we call growth rates for 2019.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just circling back to maybe one more time to RFE, are we right in thinking that this year, the adjusted profit is sort of about $150 million for that business and then yeah if you do or don't want to get caught around that may be related to it, how quickly you think we start to see footprint consolidation savings next year in that business?","Rich Tobin","Let's not -- look, I won't answer the question about the segmental margin expectation, other than the fact I did give you some color on the quarter-to-quarter. It's going to be $10 million negative impact because of Belvac year-over-year. So that something that we are going to have to make up.","The footprint optimization will begin in Q4. It's not to be overly material. I think that the bigger in terms of its positive impact in 2019 but we will give you the color around that when we make the formal announcement.","I think that the bigger positive is going to be the fact that we've taken out a significant amount of overhead out of that business through the year right. So we've been rightsizing as we've gone down.","We have flat revenue and we'll get the benefit of the full-year benefits taking that out. The larger footprint issues are going to take throughout 2019, because there is a pretty large endeavors in terms of -- in terms of lot of automation and then dealing with the actual physical footprint.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good morning. I just have a simple question given that you sort of started our cost cutting in Q3 and Q4 back on September 11, you said $0.53 of net benefit in 2019. Can we assume that everything you have done so far is consistent with that framework?","Rich Tobin","Yes.","Andrew Obin","So still -- so those numbers still stand. And then the second question on sort of timing of restructuring in Refrigeration Food Equipment and also you talked about footprint. Looking at the queue, there was just not a lot of restructuring in the business and I understand that Belvac was part of it, but should we think that this restructuring is sort the timing here is related to the sort of the timing of footprint rationalization as well. Is that the way to think, just thinking about the timing of what's going on in that segment?","Rich Tobin","Yes and no, is the answer to that question. If you go back and look at the presentation in September, there wasn\u2019t a lot of restructuring in that particular segment because management had been taking out costs all year as the revenue had gone down.","So there was not a lot of low hanging fruit per se. There is some restructuring the comes along with the footprint actions, but there is isn\u2019t any kind of residual structuring that we're just waiting on timing in terms refrigeration. It's overly material.","Andrew Obin","Fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning.","Rich Tobin","Good morning.","Deane Dray","Hey, I would like to go, Rich to your comment on seeing competition in inks in Markem-Imaje and I don't think I've heard this before because you do make your own inks and the whole kind of proprietary nature of your inks you could only use your inks with your equipment.","So how has come competition in inks cropped up into this business?","Rich Tobin","Well, I should have been more specific. So I apologize. That was a comment about our JK Business that is part of digital printing. It was not a comment. I think the comment I made about Markem-Imaje is performance and its incremental margin was because it was driven by consumables, which is largely ink at the end of the day.","So no issues in terms of that side of the business. The competition on inks is more on the -- on the digital print side.","Deane Dray","Okay That's really good to hear. All right. Thank you for that,. And then maybe just a broad question about the footprint reductions that you're facing and a lot of questions about like in retail fueling you're cutting back on inventory, what about the other side to this?","Are you going to step up and build some buffer inventory to avoid some disruptions as you go through these footprint reductions?","Rich Tobin","That's two different questions. Number one, we're actually carrying more inventory than we would like in retail fueling. Some of that is based on the fact that the topline growth has been robust, but it's very much impacted by some of this footprint consolidation work that started last year in supply chain, right.","So this whole closing of Malmo and moving to Dundee, you're basically transferring a significant amount of working capital it takes longer to grind through the systems. So we're not -- we're actually not happy about our performance right now. It's understandable but we're not pleased with it.","The comment I made about inventory in DFS is it's a question of how much can we clear out operationally. We've got a good backlog. So we should be able to perform in Q4 and consume a lot of that kind of operational inventory, but we really need to make a decision about EMV for 2019 and we don't want to get caught off-guard.","I don't want to be sitting here at the end of Q1 saying that we've got -- we've got frictional costs for expediting in air shipments because we didn't have enough kits in place to support the demand of EMV Right now we're not entirely sure what the pace of the start off in EMV is going to be in 2019, but I'm reasonably sure there we're going to be prudent and make sure that we carry some inventory into '19 that we can support whatever demand is there.","Deane Dray","How about the buffer inventory, just as a safety practice as you embark on these footprint reductions?","Rich Tobin","Yeah I think when we when we do a material one, I think that would be part of the disclosure.","Deane Dray","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good morning.","Rich Tobin","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","So just to clarify the free cash flow commentary a little bit, you said you're going to be within the range, but it's a little bit of a TBD. Should we just assume kind of the low-end of the range I guess is what you're saying kind of the 8% range for this year?","Brad Cerepak","I think you can assume that it will be in the range Steve. I can't get down to the level of granularity to say it's going to be 8.75%.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And just to be clear, the $40 million of restructuring at about 50 Bps of that headwind?","Brad Cerepak","In terms of the cash flow headwind.","Steve Tusa","Yeah, just a headwind on the cash margin.","Brad Cerepak","I haven't made that calculation. I think that we can expect out of the fourth quarter restructuring charge, approximately I'd say 50% of that charge would be cash and the balance of it would probably slow.","Rich Tobin","We also have some carry over. So I think the full year cash flow impact including Q4 is about $59 million, $60 million of cash. It's little bit higher than 50 Bps if you want to do the math.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one quick, just follow up on PID, you are doing I think some restructuring in PID, I would assume or is any of that restructuring related to you know kind of sales or stand or service?","Rich Tobin","No. It's far more back office and you saw from our press release the other day about it's about as open our digital center part of that has to do with the fact that of the transfer of some assets between Keane and Boston.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett.","John Inch","Good morning, everyone. So the queue called out week refrigerated door case sales and it kind of implies there is a remodeling aspect to this, which I think you might have even cited somewhere in the queue. Is that a new phase of segment weakness?","It may not have as much impact because of it's just not as big as the other but I am just trying to dovetail that with Rich your commentary around sort of the pricing dynamic seems to be improving and getting closer to a bottoming.","Rich Tobin","Okay. Well no nothing's really changed. The build-out -- so the Greenfield build-out of new construction has been weak, what we did not expect at the beginning of the year and we've been kind of been writing it down on a year is that a lot of maintenance cap or refurbishment CapEx has been deferred or is not done in '19.","So dynamic is the same, but the rate of the decline has moderated at the end of Q3 going into Q4. So it's really nothing there.","John Inch","Getting that maintenance get caught back? What kind of deferrals -- that's why I'm asking this question about the context of maintenance and sort of whereas we are at in the industry cycle? Is this somehow would have been normal to expect or is it something that's new. It may not be that impactful, but it's still new suggesting industry troubles are going to go on for a while?","Rich Tobin","Hard to say right now. My best guess is we're bottoming right now. So worst case scenario it's flat in '19 better case scenario, the maintenance portion of the spend starts to move back up.","John Inch","50% almost 50% variable contribution margins in ES, is there a mix angle that's driving such a big off-profit improvement in that segment to drive the margins? What's sort of behind the number to cause for that result?","Rich Tobin","It's a combination of good mix and good operational performance. I think that we've got certain businesses that have done well, pricing in excess of input cost headwinds are CapEx levered businesses, some of them are highly engineered products and those -- and as such, the margins on that volume are very good.","John Inch","Just one last one -- as you've gone through this third quarter into fourth quarter restructuring, is some company that they go through these restructuring programs, the more they cut, the more they realize, they can't cut and I'm just curious where we are today versus your expectations when you started?","Are you seeing as much more -- what's sort of the feedback as you think about the opportunities that maybe the opportunity set to go after maybe even some more overhead cost out that you had previously talked about?","Rich Tobin","I think it's a little bit too early to talk about more overhead cost. What I can tell you is that I'm proud of the management team here embracing the challenge to take the cost out because it's just not easy, but I think that there's a belief that we have a plan in place that allows us to take these costs out while reinvesting in those platforms to make the businesses stronger.","John Inch","Thanks very much.","Rich Tobin","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Rich Tobin","Hi Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So Rich, it look like pricing got a lot better this quarter than it has been the previous two quarters, just maybe talk a little bit about how much of that is tariff-related versus to pricing that you're getting and like how should we be thinking about that number moving forward over the next couple quarters?","Rich Tobin","It's not materially better pricing, I think it's much more weighted towards mix and price overall. I think that by and large I think that we've done reasonably well in terms of price. Some operations better than others based on kind of the backlog and uniqueness of the product, but there is not a lot of price.","I think that there is you see volume leverage coming through and you see better mix coming through, more than price. I mean there is a little element of price, but net of all cost headwinds, it's a relatively immaterial number.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. All right. It just seemed like it had gotten a little bit better just based on the queue, but that's okay. Maybe just following through on like the Belvac discussion, so recognize that Belvac surprised you guys, I'm just curious like what are your customers saying?","Are the deferrals related to tariff-related concerns? I am just curious if there's any additional color there?","Rich Tobin","Yeah it ends up being a dogs breakfast. There is a variety of different reasons, they are all rational. They are timing in terms of all build-outs of their own footprints. I think that there is an element of kind of macro that's embedded there to a certain extent.","It's been -- some of the -- a lot of this volume is international volume and you've got a variety of noise out in the system, which I think is making people little bit more deliberate in terms of their own CapEx plans.","I think that the projects are intact overall, but I think some of it has caught up in that kind of general macro noise.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. And if I can maybe just quickly clarify Andrew's comments from earlier, with the restructuring benefits that you have coming through from the rightsizing this year, so I call it roughly $24 million, the investment right now it all going to happen in 2019 right.","So the incremental benefit should be around $0.39, is that right?","Rich Tobin","Well, I said it was a gross of 130 right and out of the 130 that's round here, 25 gets picked up in 2018 right. So it's a rolling -- it's a rolling 12 on 130. So we're tracking right along.","I said about that '19 is if you go back and look at the presentation, a percentage of it is headcount related, that's the part that we're substantially complete. The balance of it is the consumption of SG&A by that headcount to a certain extent is the kind of broad-based say that you get in '19 right. So the full effect of that portion is in '19.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning. Just to go back to your previous comment Rich about the pricing. At the queue it calls out 1.1% pricing which is pretty decent. It's certainly a lot better than last quarter. Is that a price mix number or is that pure price?","Rich Tobin","Yeah it's a price, it's a pure price right, but it's a pure price net of input.","Nigel Coe","Okay. I'll pull off, but 1.1% is not bad.","Rich Tobin","That's for the earnings thing. That's pure price. That's not mix. On the revenue side, it's pure price on the EBIT side, it's a net number.","Brad Cerepak","As we said, it's slightly better than what we expected going into the third quarter. Material costs are up slightly too. So the net, net is it puts us in the same position we were before. That's the way I think about it?","Nigel Coe","So my question was really, is that 1.1%, is that fully loaded? Was it some price increases that came through during the quarter that makes 4Q better than the 1.1% or is that a good run rate from here?","Rich Tobin","No, I think that's a good run rate because our businesses have been added for a while and we're seeing good momentum in certain of the businesses, which have a higher input cost and I feel like it's pretty stable going into the fourth quarter?","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's helpful. And then Rich, you made small comments, which I thought was interesting. You mentioned that you saw some dealer stocking, I think that was in the sector, but did you see broader dealer stocking during the quarter?","And then you mentioned I think the weakening in Europe going into 4Q. Did I just pick up those right?","Rich Tobin","Sure. Well, look we've got businesses that are in certain cases 80% of the revenue goes through distribution. So you can't really see the retail customer. So our revenues are two dealers at the end of the day. So a dealer stocking is not necessarily a bad thing because of the fact our dealers only stock based on their projection of demand.","So overall we're talking about some of the smaller businesses like TWG and OKI, I wouldn't be worried about kind of the that we're kind of pushing into dealers and that we're going to have to pay the price for that.","I think it's more of a positive comment of some of our businesses that sell through distribution. Our network is positive and they're trying to get their hands on what we make.","Nigel Coe","Great thanks.","Rich Tobin","Yeah and then the second part of it was more of an FX-related comment right. So quarter-over-quarter, there is a headwind on the euro. I think Brad kind of cleared, he went through the trajectory of it and based on I think we use a $19.01 -- $19.07, so there is a headwind at least in the way that we're forecasting on our European levered businesses, which is largely more revenue a revenue issue than anything else.","Nigel Coe","All right. Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mircea Dobre of Baird.","Mircea Dobre","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just looking at your Slide 13, the rightsizing update, I realize this is a little nitpicking but your mix of gross savings has changed a little bit. Can you maybe give us some color as to what's driving assuming a segment level?","Rich Tobin","Yeah, I don't think it's a change at the segment level. I think if you notice on the cost side, there's a little bit of cost now associated with corporate, well that's driving a little bit of the benefit side as well. So it's just a minor change.","Mircea Dobre","Okay. And then just making sure that I understand this correctly, back to any -- so if we're looking at '18 and I was what carries into '19, you're essentially saying that you got $10 million Belvac contribution to operating income that switches into '19 and you've got the savings from the rightsizing here that you\u2019ve detailed on this slide that's another what call it an 10 incremental.","So that takes us to 20. Is there something else that we should be aware of in terms of specific drag that you had in '18 that will no longer be there in '19 or anything else that kind of helps us make that bridge?","Rich Tobin","I think that's enough for now.","Mircea Dobre","All right.","Rich Tobin","I mean we'll do it when we close the year and we give the kind of the guidance overall, we'll give you the color of what we think about '19, but right now you\u2019ve got your fingers on the two pieces right. It's in the cost takeout in '18 and the Belvac mix that you can kind of roll forward.","Mircea Dobre","Well, then maybe you'll humor me with one more, that you mentioned this impact from Section 301 tariffs on fluids. I'm wondering can you detail what the magnitude has been and what the drag would be going forward?","Rich Tobin","You know what, I've got a big spreadsheet in front of me. I can tell you right now that we're covering it through productivity and price. So I don't believe it's a drag. If it's specifically about RF&E, I'm not aware of any material exposure to imported components in that particular segment.","Brad Cerepak","On 301 yeah. Certainly on 232, which we've talked about before, but again we'll have to see how that progresses into '19. but at this stage Rich is correct, it's not a big number on 301 for us. We don't ship a lot of product out of China into the U.S. and at this stage it's been covered to productivity.","Mircea Dobre","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone. I've got one more on the Belvac push-out, I think Brad said don't expect that to ship in the first quarter. So these shipments have now been pushed out probably close to a year. Do you have contractual protections against cancellations in this? How do you feel about the potential for those orders to not shift to the right actually go away and what gives you confidence that, that won't happen?","Brad Cerepak","There is an amount of progress building and once we start the engineering and the procurement phase, so I don't expect a double negative on an additional push out and look and crystallizing that backlog into orders as I think that Brad was right to say, look we believe that it's going to roll into '19, but let's be careful. It's not as of January 01.","We're going to kick it off and we would expect a big comparable bump on the segment in the first quarter because of that translation right. We believe we will get it during the year. It's unclear right now when we kick it off.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks. My second question is on pump and process business. I think during your comments you said that that part of the business realized incremental above 50%, demand there has been pretty good for a while. Can you talk about what's driving those high incrementals in terms of improved pricing in the market versus your internal initiatives that kind of thing?","Brad Cerepak","I think that answers -- ends up being incredibly granular. I think that overall it's a combination of volume leverage because the revenue has been moving up in the segment, having a direct impact. I think that the fact that they've got in front of their input cost headwinds that they're either positive or net neutral has an impact and then demand is there.","So then just pure volume, that's not kind of absorption, not the absorption impact of it. So it's a combination of all those. In certain businesses and then you\u2019ve got companies like Precision Components that the nature of that business when it's up, its highly engineered product. So the margins on some of those products is very good and we've got particular strength as I mentioned at the end of Q2 in our high drawer colder business that we're expanding the footprint of that business because demand has been great and the margins are very accretive to the segment.","Nathan Jones","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Charley Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Charley Brady","Just a quick one for me to finish it here. Your comment back at the Analyst rate of 15% to 17%, I just want to go back to your earlier comments on how that's performing and without getting too granular, it sounds like it's maybe getting a little bit better, faster than you had originally anticipated.","Rich Tobin","I think it's not better and faster. I think there we're just happy right. We've been bragging that around for the full year. I think the team has worked really hard in a pretty bad situation, that we had in terms of that consolidation in Europe, but they\u2019ve ground through it and we see ourselves coming out on the other side.","So we don't have a lot of negative. It wasn't just the consolidation in Europe. It's when you can't get the throughput out of that facility, you're making it up and other facilities, which has got supplier premiums and air freight. So there's a lot of kind of additional frictional costs in the system.","That's all coming out because I think that Dundee's has got the feet on the ground now and you couple that with the demand of EMV coming up and EMV products if you will are beneficial to margins of the Group.","So we like what we saw of our exit margins in Q1 and that leads us in some amount of confidence and going into Q4 meeting our objectives because from a year-over-year basis what we are looking for is a lot of the year-over-year profit change is going to come out of that particular segment.","Charley Brady","Just one more on OPW, you commented there is a weather impact obviously. Can you quantify if that's material on you lost few days on the margin perspective, and now working back, can you quantify that?","Rich Tobin","I don't have the number in front of me. It's not overly material. I think the bigger issue that OPW had, just at a quarter-to-quarter basis was some footprint consolidation cost that they had started before kind of we announced this new initiative right. This is something that's been going on all year.","They finished it up and then they took some charges in the quarter, which weren't helpful, but I think like I said it's largely contained in the Q3. So our expectation is that OPW's margins in Q4 are going to be good.","Charley Brady","Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. That's concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Yeah. Thanks very much for joining us for the Q3 earnings call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's third quarter 2018 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."],"7358":["Dover Corp (NYSE:DOV) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call January 27, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Paul Goldberg \u2013 Vice President-Investor Relations","Robert Livingston \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer","Brad Cerepak \u2013 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Deane Dray \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 UBS","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. We finish the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving solid revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw robust topline growth at each segment, led by Energy and Fluids, results again overall growth of 11%, including organic growth of 6%. We also achieved solid volume leverage as three of our four segments improved margin excluding restructuring cost. From a geographic perspective, we saw solid growth in the U.S., Europe and Asia, whereas Latin America continued to be weak.","Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, revenue growth was strong as U.S. drilling and production customer activity was as expected. Our recent acquisition accelerated, exceeded our expectations, and the automation and bearings and compression markets were solid. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our recent MS acquisition continued to perform well and more than offset European softness in our core printing and coating markets.","The Industrial platform achieved strong broad-based growth led by outstanding results in our auto related and waste handling businesses. Our Fluid segment once again performed well. We are continuing robust market conditions for Fluid Transfer products and improved pump markets resulted in organic growth of 9%. Refrigeration and Food Equipment generated very strong revenue growth of 8%, were strong refrigeration performance was supported by shipments of quarter three push-outs.","Since the end of the third quarter, we have taken actions to strengthen and position our company for 2015 with a focus on our portfolio and cost reduction. We made a decision to divest Datamax O'Neil and Sargent, which now have been reported as discontinued operations. While both are strong companies, these actions increased our focus on our core growth markets.","Also as indicated at our Investor Day in early December, we took decisive actions to adjust our cost and streamline our businesses. We executed well on our restructuring initiatives and completed our planned actions in the fourth quarter. Specific to energy, though U.S. drilling and production revenue and customer activity has been as strong as expected, we have been proactively reducing cost in anticipation of lower customer activity in 2015. Our acquisition pipeline continues to rebuild though no significant deals are eminent. We repurchased 2.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and recently put a new standing authorization in place.","Now let me provide our revenue outlook for 2015, which is unchanged from our Investor Day for Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration and Food Equipment, their markets have remained healthy and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. As you would expect, the big change to our forecast is in Energy, where the rapid decline in oil prices is significantly impacting energy CapEx spending and U.S. rig counts. As a result, within Energy, we expect lower revenue in our U.S. based drilling and production businesses; however, we continue to expect our international oil and gas activity and our bearings and compression businesses to grow.","In Engineered Systems, we anticipate continued growth driven by strong dynamics in our industrial platform and global growth in printing and identification. Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for our pumps and fluid transfer businesses, supported by increased safety and environmental regulations, a positive retail fueling environment and new product introductions. And lastly, Refrigeration and Food Equipment is expected to grow, driven by our focus on customer service and best-in-class products. We expect to grow our position with many customers in 2015, driven by innovative products like CO2 systems and heat exchangers to name just a few.","With that let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 11%. Organic revenue grew 6% and growth from acquisitions was 7% offset by 2% of FX. Adjusted EPS was $1.01, excluding this free tax benefits. This result includes $0.17 of restructuring and other costs. Segment margin for the quarter was 14.8%, 210 basis points below last year.","Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting cost, our overall margin was 17.3%. Bookings increased 4% over the prior year to $1.9 billion, led by Energy and Engineered Systems. Overall book-to-bill finished at 0.95. Our backlog was essentially flat at $1.2 billion. Free cash flow was $390 million for the quarter. For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $787 million, 10% of revenue or a 100% conversion of net income.","Now turning to Slide 4. All segments grew organically in the quarter. Fluids grew 9% benefiting from solid fluid transfer and pump markets. Refrigeration and Food Equipment driven in part by shipments of Q3 push-outs grew 8%. Engineered Systems grew 5%, with strong growth in the industrial platform. Energy was up 1%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 7% comprised of 20% in Energy, whereas Engineered Systems grew 4% and Fluids increased 3%.","Turning to Slide 5 in our sequential results. Revenue decreased 2% from the third quarter primarily reflecting normal seasonality. Overall Energy grew 8%, while Fluids increased 4%. Engineered Systems was down 3%, while Refrigeration and Food Equipment declined 13%. Sequential bookings decreased 3%, principally reflecting anticipated lower orders in refrigeration and the timing of orders in food equipment. In all, Engineered Systems grew 5% and Energy increased 2% on the strength of acquisitions. Fluids declined 2% and Refrigeration and Food Equipment declined 20%.","Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $550 million increased 20% and earnings of $105 million decreased 6% from last year. Excluding the combined $90 million impact of Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings increased 11%. Overall as we expected Energy produced a very good quarter. Strong revenue growth in our drilling and production markets was largely driven by acquisitions, the completion of U.S. shale projects and solid Middle East activity.","Our Bearings and Compression and automation markets remained modestly positive. We took restructuring actions in the fourth quarter as well as additional actions to align our cost to anticipated market conditions. We remain proactive and now expect to incur restructuring cost in Energy of $13 million to $15 million in the first quarter. When the first quarter actions are complete, we will have reduced our energy headcount by approximately 900 or 14% in total. Excluding the Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting costs, our adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, slightly exceeding our expectations. Bookings were $535 million, a 21% increase over the prior year largely reflecting acquisitions. Organic bookings grew 2%. Book-to-bill was 0.97.","Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where revenue of $592 million was up 6% and earnings of $93 million increased 7%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 11% to $97 million. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue increased 4% to $248 million, primarily driven by strong digital printing results. Organic revenue grew 1% where solid equipment sales were partially offset by a softer Europe. FX was a 6% headwind in this platform in the fourth quarter.","In the Industrial platform, revenue grew 8% to $345 million all of which was organic. Revenue growth was broad based with particularly strong performance in our auto related and waste handling businesses. Adjusted margin was up 70 basis points to 16.4% on volume leverage excluding restructuring. Bookings were $623 million, an increase of 11%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 6% to $248 million driven by acquisitions earlier in the year and generally solid market conditions. Industrial bookings increased 15% to $374 million reflecting strong broad-based growth. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.00, while industrial was 1.09. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.05.","Now on Slide 8. Fluids posted a strong quarter where revenue increased 10% to $377 million and earnings of $63 million were up 14%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 20% to $66 million.","Revenue was driven by organic growth of 9% and acquisition growth of 3%. Our Fluid Transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets, increased safety environmental regulations and share gains. Pumps, was driven by healthy chemical markets and new product introductions. Excluding restructuring, adjusted margin was 17.4% an increase of a 140 basis points resulting from strong leverage on volume. Bookings were $346 million, a decrease of 2%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps. Book-to-bill was 0.92.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated revenue of $459 million, up 8% over the prior year. Excluding restructuring of $25 million, earnings improved 19% to $56 million. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong refrigeration shipment supported by Q3 push-outs. Excluding restructuring, adjusted operating margin was 12.2%, a 130 basis point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects improved performance in volume leverage.","Bookings were $368 million, a decrease of 18%, principally reflecting an anticipated reduction in orders in refrigeration and the timing of orders and food equipment. Book-to-bill was 0.80.","Now going to the overview Slide number 10. Fourth quarter net interest expense was $31 million, up $1 million from last year and in-line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $30 consistent with expectations and included a $3.6 million pension settlement charge. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding $0.02 of discrete benefits. This rate was lower than in previous forecast and principally impacted by the R&D tax credit and tax benefits related to restructuring actions.","Capital Expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. For the full year we invested $166 million or 2.1% of revenue.","Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $208 million. For the full year, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $601 million.","Now on Slide 11, which is an update on Energy? As Bob said, a lot has changed in Energy since our Investor Day. As a result, we expect our U.S. drilling and new well production businesses to be significantly impacted by lower commodity cost. We expect this impact to be less but still present in our businesses within U.S. recurring production and automation exposure.","Finally, we expect our Bearings & Compression in international oil and gas activity to remain very solid. We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 6% to 9%, a reduction of about 15 points from our prior forecast, or about $300 million in revenue with organic revenue declining 11% to 14%, the biggest changes in our Drilling and Production markets, primarily driven by the anticipated reduction in U.S. shale activity. Our automation forecast has changed slightly where as Bearings & Compression remains unchanged from our prior forecast.","Now moving to Slide 12 which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be positive 1% to negative 2% principally reflecting our current forecast for Energy, as our other three segments remain unchanged. Completed acquisition will now add 2% down one point from our prior expectations. We now expect the total impact of FX to be a 2% headwind, a point higher than our prior forecast. In summary, we expect total year-over-year revenue to be 1% positive to 2% negative.","Segment margin is expected to be between 17.6% and 17.9% excluding restructuring charges. Corporate expense will be approximately $125 million and interest expense should around a $130 million. We expect the full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 30%.","CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue.","Now turning to the bridge on Slide 13. Note that in the appendix is information that provides the basis of our 2015 guide. In 2015 we expect net restructuring essentially the non-repeat of Q4 cost netted against Q1 expected cost and other one-time items to add $0.09 to $0.10.","Performance which includes volume and price, productivity, compensation investment and restructuring benefits, will be in the range of a $0.10 benefit to a $0.06 decline, largely depending on volume.","The impact of acquisitions already completed will be $0.01 to $0.03. Shares will provide $0.27 to $0.29 based on an estimate of $600 million in repurchases in 2015 and carry over benefit of our 2014 repurchases. Our share repurchases activity will more than offset at $0.18 dilutive impact of discontinued operations.","Interest, corporate and tax rate will have a combined $0.07 to $0.11 impact. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $4.70 to $4.95, reflecting a $0.35 reduction to our prior guidance.","One last note, as we move sequentially into 2015 our first quarter EPS will be impacted by approximately $17 million to $20 million in Q1 restructuring charges, as well as remaining purchase accounting cost. Combined, these items will impact Q1 EPS by $0.13 to $0.14.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Robert Livingston","Thanks Brad. Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance. We grew revenue 8% and delivered 10% EPS growth. We focused on lean and productivity initiatives across the organization and in the fourth quarter, restructured many of our businesses to be better positioned for continued growth and margin expansion.","In 2015, we will continue to execute a strategy that has served us well. This includes investing in geographic expansion, product innovation and providing solutions that increase our customer\u2019s cash flow and reduce their cost through productivity. Across all four segments our business leaders are focused on executing these initiatives and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll deliver a solid 2015. We remain focused on growth.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focused on serving our customers and driving results. Now Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Bob. At this point, I would like to remind all the callers that we have a lot of people in queue. So if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we\u2019ll be able take a lot more questions.","And with that Maria if we can have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Robert Livingston","Good morning Scott.","Scott Davis","Can you give us a sense of how much you\u2019ve stress tested this new forecast in drilling and production negative 17 and negative 19 core growth? And just give us a sense of how you came to that number, was that based on bookings or bottoms up from your customers? Just a little bit more granularity there will be helpful.","Brad Cerepak","Okay, gosh Scott I can\u2019t tell you how many different models we\u2019ve run with respect to the drilling and production activity for 2015. So how was this number - how do we provide this number, what are the underlying assumptions and the work we\u2019ve done? Yes it does reflect a lot of conversations with our customers over the last few weeks. I would tell you that one of the data points that everyone does look at and continue to track is rig count deployment. And this range we provide for 2015 assumes a rig count decrease year-over-year average of 25% to 30%.","Scott Davis","Okay. That seems fair.","Brad Cerepak","I will also tell you that we will - we do expect to see a little bit of the anticipated decline show up in their first quarter, but Scott this is going to be a modest impact in their quarter. We do expect the second and third quarters to bear the brunt of this downturn. We do expect the rig count declined to be rather steep and reflective of what we\u2019re seeing here in the last few weeks.","Scott Davis","Yes makes sense. And you gave a number of $300 million revenue hit, I mean, I know this is hard to do, but given all the restructuring and the cost out, do you plan to do - I mean, what kind of a drop through to profits, do you see that?","Brad Cerepak","Well okay let\u2019s say - what are - repeat that question.","Robert Livingston","So if you take that $300 million\u2026","Scott Davis","So if you take $300 million\u2026","Robert Livingston","What\u2019s the decremental margin?","Scott Davis","Yes.","Brad Cerepak","Well, I mean if I just look at, okay so the way we\u2019re thinking about that and the way we forecasted is that 300 net of. The benefits we see in 2015 of restructuring offset by some costs, as we talked about, would drop to at about 30%.","Scott Davis","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","So that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re assuming, Scott.","ScottDavis","Okay, fair enough. And just last and I\u2019ll past it on. Can you just update us on close-the-case, it didn\u2019t seem all that encouraging the comments you made on Refrigeration and Food Equipment with the book-to-bill that. Is close-the-case something that still is a legitimate or is it getting pushed out?","Robert Livingston","No, close-the-case is continuing to perform quite well. You\u2019re referring to the bookings number in the fourth quarter.","ScottDavis","Yes, down 8%.","Robert Livingston","Yeah. First of, I would tell you that I think Brad commented on this in his prepared remarks, part of that loop is the timing of orders in our Food Equipment platform. We\u2019ve got one business and the food equipment group that does have very choppy order rates. It\u2019s very much of a project business that\u2019s Belvac. And I think that almost half of that 20% or 18% year-over-year decline is just associated to the timing of orders at Belvac. And there is nothing wrong with the Belvac business. It will continue to perform quite well with just timing of orders.","With respect to Hill Phoenix; Scott, I would tell you that we had another record year in revenue at Hill Phoenix. I think they had a 2% or 3% organic growth in 2014. We had a year where book-to-bill again was 1.0% for Hill Phoenix like it was in 2013, but you see between the two years, a very, very different waterfall of quarterly order rates at Hill Phoenix. And part of what you see in the fourth quarter is an anticipated product mix change. I call it a slight product mix change as we go into 2015. And we will expect in 2015 a little bit higher waiting in our business mix towards doors, doors with - our cases with doors and a little bit of a reduced waiting on systems. And part of that is showing up in the fourth quarter order rates. System orders tend to show up anywhere from one to three months before orders per cases do and where the fourth quarter order rates reflect that and it was anticipated.","ScottDavis","Okay. That\u2019s for that granularity guys. Good presentation. Thank you and good luck.","Robert Livingston","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","DeaneDray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Robert Livingston","Hi, Deane.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Deane Dray","I don\u2019t want to sound like Monday morning quarter backing, but I recall in the December\u2026","Robert Livingston","Excuse me.","Deane Dray","I know [Multiple Speakers]. But if we go back to the December outlook meeting when you announced the restructuring, I think most people, my self included, were surprised that you weren\u2019t doing more restructuring on the Energy piece, which everyone knew was in the middle of this downturn and actually early stages, most of the restructuring was in Refrigeration. So now, we\u2019re seeing restructuring actions. Are you behind the curve in this? And the decrementals of 30% kind of means would suggest that you\u2019re right on pace with where you should be. So maybe you just reconcile expectations on the pace of restructuring for starters.","Robert Livingston","Okay, I would - everything being equal, maybe we could have done a little bit more in the fourth quarter. And yes, I would even label that as a little bit of Monday morning quarter backing with respect to my comment. Don\u2019t lose side effect that as went through the fourth quarter, Scott, we were - Deane, we were still in a growth mode within this Energy segment. And a lot of the costs we\u2019re taking out are variable cost related to being able to serve the customer with respect to shipments. It was a bit difficult to take more cost, especially variable cost out in the fourth quarter when we were still expanding our U.S. production rates here to satisfy customers. We are responding, I think, fairly aggressively here in the early part of the first quarter. I think between the actions that we took in the fourth quarter and the actions that we\u2019re pulling the trigger on here in the first quarter, those actions will generate annualized benefits for our Energy segment in the range of $55 million to $60 million, is that the right number, Brad?","Brad Cerepak","That\u2019s right.","Robert Livingston","And I think we\u2019ll end up picking up about $45 million to $50 million of that in 2015 or might a bit high on that.","Brad Cerepak","That\u2019s what the forecast shows.","Robert Livingston","And Deane all I can tell you is that we have - we continue to model and look at different scenarios as we have opportunities or as we think the market activity would dictate. We\u2019re going to take cost out, especially related to U.S. production and drilling activity. But I would also point out, these guys have - are also dealing with an initiative from need [ph] on growth. We are continuing to expand our activity outside of the U.S. We\u2019re continuing to spend a fair amount of money on product development and product innovation. And you\u2019ll see us continue to work the growth initiatives within automation and within Bearings & Compression. And I think those initiatives may even provide a little bit of upside to this segment in 2015.","DeaneDray","So just as my follow-up let\u2019s just stay right there, but if we could, may be just expand on your expectations for the growth in the international oil and gas and in the compression business, this degree of confidence, earnings visibility, length of contracts and so forth?","Robert Livingston","Well it\u2019s probably the one that\u2019s most fun to talk about, perhaps the easiest to talk about Deane, is the activity that we have been pushing, pursuing and growing over the last three years around our geographic expansion, especially around our artificial lift activity. We\u2019ve been fairly successful with that over the last three years or four years, we continue to see an increasing number of tenders that we can participate in with each quarter as we go through this activity outside of the U.S.","Upside activity or upside opportunities in 2015, you know will tell you that we have nothing in our revenue plan for 2015 on non-U.S. tender activity other than what\u2019s in our backlog. And we do know that we\u2019ve got opportunities in front of us on tender orders that will be awarded here in the first quarter and the second quarter and in the Middle East, notably Oman. And some activity and I call it broader Asia and there we\u2019re looking at some interesting activity in India. But those tenders if we are successful and whatever impact they have on 2015 will be an upside for the segment.","DeaneDray","Great, thank you.","Robert Livingston","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady of BMO Capital Markets.","Charlie Brady","Hi thanks good morning guys.","Robert Livingston","Hi, Charlie.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Charlie Brady","Its just on the Refrigeration business, are you guys seeing - you\u2019ve seen targets kind of pulling out of Canada, obviously the Walmart kind of roll out issues still going on, any change kind of in the target Walmart, Dollar Store kind of segmented as far as what they are doing on cap spending and how that\u2019s impacting that segment?","Robert Livingston","You\u2019re asking me to look back or look forward?","Charlie Brady","Look forward.","Robert Livingston","Look forward, fine. Well first of, I would tell you that, if we use 2015 as a - or 2014 as a reference point, our revenue activity with target my goodness in the second half of the year, Charlie, was probably less than $10 million. So even with the continued activity that\u2019s going on at Target to - for them to sort of reposition their business that\u2019s - even if it went to zero that\u2019s not going to have much of an impact on our business and in 2015. Year-over-year and 2014 Wal-Mart and Target together, we probably saw a decline of approaching $30 million year-over-year 2014 over 2013. We do include in our forecast for 2015 another year-over-year decline on the combination of Wal-Mart and Target.","I actually don\u2019t remember the exact number, but I think it maybe even a little bit higher than the $30 million we had in 2014, but it\u2019s not three times that size, but I think we do expect a decline. Where we are seeing the growth in this business is all of the other customers outside of these two. I think we ended up with 5% or 6% or 7% growth and all of the other customers within this refrigeration business in 2014 and we\u2019re expecting something like that number again in 2015.","Charlie Brady","Okay. So simply sounds like when the larger sized retailers, almost a non-event and being well more than offset by companies outside that - those guys.","Robert Livingston","Correct.","Charlie Brady","Okay. Just one more follow-up just on the Energy business, the outlook, the revised outlook from acquisition growth which I guess this is all accelerated. It looks as though you\u2019re forecasted that has accelerated down about 35% relative to what I guess their 2014 revenue is estimated to be on your bottom, is that about right?","Robert Livingston","Okay, I'm not sure I can do the quick math on the percent. I think maybe when we provided our initial outlook at Dover Day in early December; Brad, you\u2019re going to have to help me here, but I think the revenue outlook for Accelerated may have been in the 240 to 250 range in my close.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Robert Livingston","Okay. And for 2015 revised outlook, we\u2019ve got it slightly below 200. Correct me if I'm wrong.","Brad Cerepak","It\u2019s a little bit lower than that, but that\u2019s directionally right.","Robert Livingston","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","And Charlie, I would tell you, I would love to sit here a year from now and tell you I was really conservative with that outlook. I will tell you that the Accelerated team outperformed in the fourth quarter. Goodness I think their revenue in the fourth quarter was about 15% higher than what we had modeled. I know, they are holding a quite well here in January, I was actually down to see the guys, I guess about a week ago or two weeks ago. And it just absolutely amazes me how many different opportunities they are finding to satisfy customers, to help customers with productivity and cash flow projects that we just don\u2019t account for when in forecast when we put together our acquisition model. It is possible but this is one of our business units in 2015 that even if we\u2019re right on nailing the rig count declined of 25% to 30% even with that, here is one business within our official book that get actually outperform our expectations.","Charlie Brady","That\u2019s great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks to the color on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Robert Livingston","Hi, Joe.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie","Hi, so my first question, just going back to Energy for a minute. Clearly things have changed since early December when we met. But I\u2019m just wondering, did you guys see significant deceleration in your order trends in December and then to start January, because right now, it looks like we\u2019ve got orders are up 21%, but it was really based on the accelerated acquisition. So I\u2019m just trying to really get a sense for the trends in your organic orders for the Energy business.","Robert Livingston","Hi, Brad may have details on some of the order trends, but are you asking - was the question sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter?","Brad Cerepak","And then into January, yes.","Robert Livingston","Organically and the fourth quarter - I don\u2019t have the detail, I can\u2019t even remember what the difference was in order rates between October and December. So I\u2019m seeing here a little bit on comfortable trying to take a guess a direction. But there weren\u2019t any surprises Joe and the order rates in the fourth quarter. As we move from the fourth quarter, as we move from December into January, one of the things that sort of seems to incur every single year though it\u2019s always difficult to predict when we\u2019ll deal with it, is a little bit of restocking with some customers especially around our drilling customers, drill bit customers and sometimes with our sucker rod customers. It is not unusual for us to see that little bit of, I call it, two to three week of inventory management period occur in the fourth quarter. It didn\u2019t occur this year. What we did see was it occurring in the first two weeks of January. There was some choppiness in the order rates, both with our drill-bit customers in the first couple of weeks of January as well as with our sucker rod customers. We get beyond those first two weeks, what we call the restocking management activity and order rates have returned to the levels that we have expected here for the first quarter.","Joe Ritchie","So it sounds like that changed your organic growth guidance for the drilling and production business is really driven by customer conversations on what you expect to come as opposed to what you\u2019re actually seeing in your business today, is that a fair comment?","Robert Livingston","That\u2019s a fair comment that I would like to strongly support. It\u2019s the guide down from Dover Day on our Energy business is what we anticipate to see here in the second, third and fourth quarters that guide down is not reflective of the activity we\u2019re seeing here in the early part of the first quarter.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, it\u2019s fair. And I guess the follow-on to that is really relating to the restructuring spend on the energy side of the business. It seems like you took that up by about $0.05 in the first quarter versus your initial expectations in the early part of December. I guess the question is how confident do you feel that you ring fence the issue or if you do start to see the order trends decline significantly as you anticipate as we progressed through the year. Can we presume that there is going to be more restructuring in Energy? I'm just trying to get my head around that.","Robert Livingston","Okay, so, I actually think that business teams and business leaders have been quite responsive. I would even say contrary or even though I may say here Monday morning quarter back as in earlier call or used the phrase, the guys have actually been quite proactive in taking cost out ahead of cost from a reduction in their activity. Is there more we can do if customer activity slips even deeper or even further from what we\u2019ve planned? The answer is yes. And even we\u2019ve got a fairly aggressive cost plan take out for their first quarter, if by the time we get into the March and April timeframe, if we believe then that the customer activity either being driven by even lower rig count deployment in 2015 beyond the 25% to 30% decline or for whatever reason we are fully prepared to take additional cost out and the trigger points have been identified.","BradCerepak","Yes, I guess so, we\u2019d only add to that reiterate what you said earlier Bob is that, while we\u2019re taking a lot of cost out and we\u2019re proactively I believe ahead of the curve of the downturn from rig counts and the commodity impact. One thing we\u2019re - here\u2019s what we\u2019re not doing, we\u2019re not backing off our investment or growth initiatives within Energy and I think Bob said that earlier, we continue to invest in innovation, in new product development, geo reach\u2026","RobertLivingston","Across the board.","BradCerepak","Across the board. And so that that\u2019s what our forecast reflects.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thanks guys. I get back in queue.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of UBS.","ShannonO\u2019Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Robert Livingston","Well, Shannon, welcome back.","ShannonO\u2019Callaghan","Thanks, Bob.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","ShannonO\u2019Callaghan","I appreciate it. I missed all the fun. So in terms of the drilling and production decline of 17% and 19%, can you give us a split of the drilling versus the production piece and also within production what pieces that you expect to kind of hold that better than others.","Robert Livingston","Well, I left that book in my office, I wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with that kind of detail.","ShannonO\u2019Callaghan","Take your shot.","Robert Livingston","Okay, so I would tell you that you\u2019ll see a little bit of a steeper decline in revenue at our drilling business. And that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone it was not a surprise us, we sort of solved that in the last downturn in 0.08 and 0.09. And they solved the sharpest decline, but also the quickest recovery, once we hit the turf. To a lesser degree, we say it in U.S., we used a phrase production, but I\u2019m going to be more specific here in U.S. artificial lift applications, it will start later with artificial lift, then we\u2019ll see with drilling activity. And it will not be uniform across our artificial lift product portfolio.","I think you will see - I think we anticipate more of a decline in our rod business than we do our pump business. Simple, because a much, much higher percentage of our pump activity is after market and repair and service as apposed to new well completion. But I this session will give you actual percentages Shannon, I\u2019d be guessing and then Paul would spend the rest of the day correcting my guesses.","ShannonO\u2019Callaghan","No, no, the - I just the dynamics.","Robert Livingston","Yeah.","ShannonO\u2019Callaghan","That\u2019s helpful in terms of the different product lines. And then as you think about restructuring and sort of trying to defend margins in this downturn, you did it very successfully in the last downturn, is there anything different about the nature of the business now or nature of the downturn, or is it pretty much the same playbook, you feel like you have to execute?","Robert Livingston","Well, I would say we start with the same playbook. The business is little bit larger today, than it was in 2008 and 2009. And we\u2019re a bit more geographic, we\u2019re bit more geographic, than we were in 2008 and 2009. That said, I would say that the playbook in our drilling business is essentially the same today, as it was in 2009. Where you\u2019ll see some differences will be in our artificial lift business and product portfolio, simply because, in 2008 the bulk of it was sucker rods and today it is probably 60% pumps and service activity and 40% sucker rods and I\u2019m probably still being heavy on the rod business.","But the playbook is very much the same, the guys know how to execute this, we know how to take care of our customer as we go through this downturn, we know how to time to take out a variable cost and we know how to time to take out of overhead and when it\u2019s appropriate and we are trying to hold margins, that is one of the objectives. But don\u2019t get hung up on that, thinking that that\u2019s our primary objective, the primary objective it\u2019s actually to take care of the customers. And to continue with our product development and innovation activity, the result of all of this is we do believe we\u2019ll end up with margins within the Energy segment of about 20%.","ShannonO\u2019Callaghan","Okay, very helpful. Thanks Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thanks.","Robert Livingston","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning, hi. Just firstly on the Energy, just talk a little bit about what price degradation you assume in the business this year. And also on automation you made very, very small adjustments organic growth a very large adjustment to the assumption for drilling and production. So why do you feel confident in the automation can hold up at around flat?","Robert Livingston","Okay, there is part of the automation product portfolio that actually deals with drilling and with some down-hole monitoring. We do anticipate a decline in that part of the automation portfolio, when you move beyond that specific product area in our automation portfolio, we actually don\u2019t anticipate much of a decline in automation. In fact there is a lot of work going on internally right now within this segment and within that business to figure out how we actually grow automation beyond what we have in our guidance in 2015. And we think we\u2019ve get some opportunities to do so, but to be quite transparent, there is part of that automation portfolio, I\u2019m repeating myself, that is, that does have some down-hole applications. And our Bearings & Compression activity that we\u2019ve got fairly aggressive growth plans as well as cost containment activity within both of those business as we grow it in 2015. And we don\u2019t see those businesses being directly impacted by the drop in rig count in 2015.","Price, we do have some modest price declines in our plan for 2015. When I say modest - but some of these discussions are still underway, so I would give the nod to the customer let us finish these discussions before I get too specific and responding to an open question like that. But I would tell you for planning purposes, we have low to mid single-digit price declines planned for some of the products and for some of the products nothing, no price declines. And I would say that the activity we\u2019ve encountered here over the last few weeks with our customers gives us some confident that we\u2019ve pegged that number correctly.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just quickly on the Fluids, it\u2019s hard from the outside to get a sense of the different end-markets in that. Any thing you\u2019re seeing that sort of changed or is interesting versus what you said at Dover Day?","Robert Livingston","No, in fact I think I commented, made that comment as I had my prepared remarks within Fluids, within Engineered Systems and within Refrigeration. We\u2019ve made no changes and need to make no changes to our growth plans for 2015 beyond what we shared with you at Dover Day. Fluids it\u2019s an amazing year they had in 2015 with 8% organic growth for the entire segment. And it wasn\u2019t an unbalanced year for that segment, both fluid transfer, as well as our pump businesses did quite well in 2014. And we\u2019re expecting both of them to continue with growth initiatives and growth results in 2015.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, good morning all.","Robert Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Steve Winoker","Just a question on the flip side here so you are taking headcount down 14% in Energy it sounded like, what happens if and when oil prices go backed up and if that were to happen in the six months or nine months how long does it take you to cycle through this between you\u2019ve got your \u2013 the impact which you haven\u2019t even said you mentioned that you\u2019re just starting to see barely now, you are anticipating that. And this could be a little shorter lived than people think. So how are you dealing that with your scenario planning how it is compared to what you did last time? Your ability to - on the positive side of this is probably a nice thing to think about what would happen in the other end, your ability to make your commitments?","Robert Livingston","So I take it by the tone of your question that you are long on oil and you are very short.","Steve Winoker","Yeah, no, it\u2019s not. Let\u2019s not look at presumption in scenario planning here.","Robert Livingston","Look it\u2026","Steve Winoker","So it\u2019s a bottom for everything right?","Robert Livingston","Well I know it. It\u2019s interesting that you asked the question that way because and how honest that we talk about that quite a bit when we go through our planning scenarios. I would just remind you that someone, one of their earlier questions was, are we using the same playbook from the 2008, 2009 time frame and in many instances we are, that\u2019s where we are sort of where we start. And we had a pretty quick bounce in 2009 both on the oil price after it hit its bottom and then a pretty rapid increase in rig count deployment as we went through 2009 and 2010. And I would tell you that we were able to bring employees back, quick enough we were able to bring on new employees, quick enough and to get them trained that our customer service activity, which is always the thing we want to pay attention to, our customer service activity levels were quite high and we did not disappoint customers. And that the other day that\u2019s sort of what guides our decision.","Steve Winoker","And Bob you guys take advantage of M&A in these kind of environments, usually this is your prime time just sort of have a longer view of the cycle I guess in that same way. You still, its hard to get comfortable right now, right? But how are you starting to think about that trade off and buybacks versus M&A, you probably just lifted your buyback may be give us some color.","Robert Livingston","Okay, so we - let me deal first with the M&A question and then you tied into share repurchases. M&A in Energy, gosh! I would tell you that I\u2019m not speaking for anyone other than Brad and I. M&A activity in the Energy sector in the next three or four months, I\u2019m going to use your phrase, could be a bit uncomfortable. Simply because of the uncertainty as the timing, the uncertainty as the debt and then even after the price of oil does recover and start to find a new normal that\u2019s higher than where it is today, is what\u2019s going to happen with investment activity in the U.S. shale fields and I think that\u2019s to me, that\u2019s the more larger question.","But I think as we get through perhaps not the first quarter, the first quarter is probably not going to give us enough information. I think as we get through the second quarter or into and through the second quarter, I guess that not only us, but others in this sector may have a comfort level that\u2019s being developed, that would allow us to make a decision or two on M&A. And if the opportunity is right for us, I\u2019m going to tell you, we\u2019re going to look at it. But the comfort level is pretty high for the next three months to four months. On share repurchase activity, don\u2019t think that our share repurchase activity in 2015 is a diminishment of our ability to execute on M&A. And Brad can give you a lot more detail on this than I will or I could. But in real simplistic way to look at this our share repurchase activity in 2015 is going to be funded by divestures. Said and done. We\u2019re not increasing any debt on our balance sheet to fund share repurchase activity, we\u2019re not using operating cash flow to fund share repurchase activity. I closed my prepared comments with our plan is to grow, well that\u2019s part of our growth agenda. And as opportunities come forward we will execute.","Steve Winoker","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hi, good morning.","Robert Livingston","Hi Steve.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Steve Tusa","Just a question on the \u2013 what degree of pricing you said low-to-mid in some of your business flat in other part in energy. What\u2019s kind of the total is it, does that all mix in the kind of 50 bips of the price pressure they you\u2019re assuming?","Brad Cerepak","Well again I\u2019m going to repeat myself on two points. One, we\u2019re still in discussions with customers so I\u2019m going to treat some of this as confidential discussions with customers right now until we complete some of these dialogues. I\u2019m saying that in our plan where we do anticipate price reduction discussions with customers that the low-to-mid, I\u2019m talking to 2% to 5%.","Brad Cerepak","Part of the portfolio.","Robert Livingston","One of the portfolio is included in our guidance.","Steve Tusa","Okay, what\u2019s the\u2026","Robert Livingston","And I would also tell you Steve, there is just as much activity going on by us to offset that with input cost.","Steve Tusa","Sure, in the gross margin of Energy\u2026","Robert Livingston","I have a suggestion for everyone that\u2019s listening, I don\u2019t think this is going to be a big item in 2015.","Steve Tusa","What\u2019s going to be the pricing?","Robert Livingston","The pricing is not going to be a significant item for Dover in 2015.","Steve Tusa","What does that does 2016?","Brad Cerepak","You should not give any guidance of 2016.","Robert Livingston","I\u2019m not giving guidance of 2016.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Is the gross margin at Energy I would assume it\u2019s above the company average.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. Yes, that\u2019s true.","Robert Livingston","Yes.","Steve Tusa","And is it meaningfully above the company average.","Brad Cerepak","300 basis points, 250 basis points.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So basically, we should think about it as you are going to convert there kind of less than gross margin given the cost take out with kind of pricing TBD around that? What do you think is going to be kind of flat, I guess this year?","Robert Livingston","Well, I don\u2019t know its TBD, but I would say your first assumption is correct that we will convert and I said earlier I think 30% decrementals is the way we think about it. So therefore, we are converting on the downside at less than the gross margin because the cost takeout, that\u2019s the thing.","Steve Tusa","Right, okay, that makes some sense.","Robert Livingston","That\u2019s all in there Steve.","Steve Tusa","But what are the - so you guys - one more question just on the cash flow stuff.","Robert Livingston","Yes.","Steve Tusa","You announced on Datamax O\u2019Neil I think it\u2019s a $180 - $190 million cash inflow, is there any tax impact on that, so what\u2019s the after tax? And then what are the - are there any other divestitures that you\u2019re planning on bringing cash in for, just on the entire, I guess $600 million in buyback.","Brad Cerepak","No. No, no, no others. I would just say generally on both of those that it\u2019s not a lot of tax leakage let\u2019s just say that.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So in total those are going to bring in $600 million?","Brad Cerepak","Pretty close to that, yes Steve. That\u2019s what our expectation at this point.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closings remarks.","Paul E. Goldberg.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I was very pleased with our second quarter results, which were driven by strong revenue growth, especially in the consumer electronics and refrigeration markets. Our energy and fluid markets also contributed solid growth. In all, we generated 5% organic revenue growth, improved margins 30 basis points and grew adjusted EPS 24%.","From a geographic point of view, our North American markets were modestly positive, our China markets were strong, resulting in broad-based growth of 20%. We continued to see significant growth from the investments we have been making in Latin America, the Middle East and Australia. Lastly, European markets were largely flat in the quarter.","Many of the positive trends evident in the second quarter are continuing, giving us confidence as we move into the second half of the year. The served markets within energy, as well as the consumer electronics, refrigeration and food equipment, fluids and fast-moving consumer goods markets should all be strong, as evidenced by 8% bookings growth.","Much like the second quarter, we see third quarter organic growth led by additional OEM product releases in the consumer electronics markets; continued strong performance in our downstream and production markets within energy, helped by an expected modest sequential increase in rig count; seasonal strength in both refrigeration and product identification as several leading retailers continue to remodel plans and consumer goods companies prepare for the holiday selling season; and of course, our global expansion initiatives across our company.","Now some specific comments on our second quarter. At Communication Technologies, our consumer electronics growth was driven by new product launches, notably at Samsung. We expect the growth in consumer electronics to continue into the second half, driven by the Samsung ramp and several OEM product launches anticipated for the late third or early fourth quarter.","In our Energy segment, solid production activity, especially within international markets, and continuing strength in downstream and retail fueling are among the trends that drove solid results. We expect the rig count to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year and for our production and downstream markets to remain strong.","Within our Engineered Systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets were seasonally strong, and our business performance was excellent.","Regarding our fluids markets, our solid results were driven by a healthy mix of long and short-cycle product shipments, with particular strength in our long-cycle pump business. Our industrial end markets were improved, with solid results in our global auto related markets and strong performance in our environmental solutions group.","Within our Printing & Identification segment, growth in our fast-moving consumer goods markets was offset by a tough barcode market and project timing. I am pleased with the recent momentum in this segment, as evidenced by solid sequential revenue growth of 5% and an improving margin.","Our acquisition program was quite active during the quarter, as we built our pipeline and closed 4 small synergistic deals, all of which either expand our product breadth or geographic reach. I'm also pleased to report the spin-off of Knowles is progressing well, and we are on track to complete it early next year.","In summary, we are taking up the low end of our range based on our solid second quarter performance and our confidence in the second half. With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad M. Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Organic revenue grew 5%, while growth from acquisitions was 4%. Earnings per share were $1.70. Adjusting for $0.36 of discrete tax benefits and a $0.02 impact related to spin off costs, adjusted EPS was $1.36, an increase of 24%. A reconciliation of our adjusted earnings per share is in the appendix of our presentation deck.","Segment margin for the quarter was 17.3%, up 30 basis points. This solid result was driven by strong execution and the benefits of prior restructuring. It also included covering incremental restructuring charges of $4 million year-over-year.","Bookings increased 8% to $2.2 billion. These results represent strong 15% growth in Engineered Systems and 9% growth in Communication Technologies. Printing & Identification bookings increased 3%, while bookings declined 1% in Energy. Overall book to bill finished at 0.99, which is in line with seasonal trends. Backlog remained steady at $1.6 billion.","In the quarter, we generated $251 million of free cash flow, representing 11% of revenue. Our full year forecast for free cash flow remains unchanged at approximately 10% of revenue.","Now turning to Slide 4. Communication Technologies, driven by new product releases in the consumer electronics market, grew 11% organically. Energy and Engineered Systems both exhibited broad-based organic growth, posting 5% and 4%, respectively, while Printing & Identification was flat. Overall, our organic revenue growth was 5%. Acquisition growth was 9% in Engineered Systems and 2% in Energy.","Now turning to Slide 5 in our sequential results. Revenue increased 9% from the first quarter, with all segments showing sequential growth. Engineered Systems increased 16%, primarily driven by a strong seasonal uplift in Refrigeration and the shipment of longer-cycle product in Fluids, including a deferred shipment from last quarter. Normal seasonal growth, coupled with new smartphone releases, helped drive 8% growth in Communication Technologies. Printing & Identification grew 5%, representing fast-moving consumer goods growth and barcode product shipments. Lastly, solid downstream activity and improved drilling revenue helped drive a 2% increase in Energy.","Sequentially, bookings were flat, although 3 of our 4 segments achieved growth. Communication Technologies bookings increased 11% sequentially on the strength of OEM product launches in the consumer electronics market. Printing & Identification showed growth, as several deferred barcode projects began to book. In all, bookings in Printing & Identification grew 9%. Engineered Systems grew 2%, principally driven by its refrigeration and food equipment markets. Energy declined 15% due to seasonality, unusually severe weather in Canada and large Queensland gas orders booked in the first quarter, which did not repeat in the second quarter. The order activity related to this project has already resumed in the third quarter.","Now on Slide 6. Communication technologies posted revenue of $401 million, an increase of 11% from the prior year. The strong growth in consumer electronics principally reflects the impact of new product releases in the smartphone market. All other end markets were largely flat, although our telecom market has shown improvement over earlier quarters. Earnings increased 3% to $52 million, while segment margin declined 100 basis points to 12.9%. This decrease largely reflects incremental restructuring costs of approximately $9 million. These costs included productivity and integration activities in our speaker and receiver business and facility rationalizations in our telecom businesses. Absent these charges, margins would have been 15%, an increase of 110 basis points.","The majority of our 2013 restructuring activities are now behind us. We expect to realize the benefits of these actions in the second half. Restructuring benefits, coupled with the expected second half volume increases connected with new OEM product launches, will result in a go-forward segment margin that is significantly above our first half level. We are pleased with the progress as we embark on these new product launches, and we've successfully positioned our business as a true launch partner with our OEMs across all acoustic products.","Bookings were $422 million, up 9% from last year, reflecting normal seasonality and continuation of the Samsung ramp. Book to bill finished at a solid 1.05.","Turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue of $573 million increased 6%, while earnings of $133 million declined 1%. Energy produced another solid quarter, as drilling production and downstream all achieved revenue growth despite an unusually weak Canadian market. As expected, North American rig count declined on a year-over-year basis. Our continued focus on global market expansion allowed us to post another solid quarter of international growth, which was up 37%.","Operating margin of 23.2% was down 170 basis points. This reflects product mix, product development costs and investment for international expansion.","Bookings were $526 million, a 1% decrease from the prior year. Strong bookings growth in drilling and downstream was offset by production. Book to bill was 0.92, reflecting the timing of orders and shipments related to the previously mentioned Queensland project.","Now on Slide 8. Engineered Systems had an outstanding quarter, where sales of $1 billion and earnings of $165 million were up 13% and 24%, respectively. Our Fluid Solutions platform revenue increased 7% to $227 million, benefiting from strong results in our pump markets. In all, Fluid Solutions had organic growth of 4%.","In Refrigeration & Industrial, revenue grew 15% to $777 million, reflecting the Anthony acquisition and strong growth in the food equipment and environmental solutions markets. Organic revenue growth was also 4% in this platform.","Excellent execution drove operating margin up 140 basis points to 16.5%, reflecting strong leverage on volume. Bookings were $998 million, an increase of 15%, driven by recent acquisitions. Overall, book to bill was 0.99. For our Fluid Solutions platform, bookings increased 5% to $213 million, and Refrigeration & Industrial increased 18% to $785 million. Book to bill for Fluid Solutions was as expected at 0.94, reflecting large project-related pump orders shipped. Refrigeration & Industrial's book to bill was 1.01.","Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $251 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Earnings increased 24% to $36 million. Our fast-moving consumer goods market showed modest organic growth, which helped to mitigate softness in our industrial markets, particularly in our barcoding business. Of note, European revenue increased after 2 quarters of decline.","Operating margin increased 280 basis points to 14.3%. The benefits of restructuring actions taken last year and the absence of those charges helped drive margin improvement. Bookings were $259 million, up 3% reflecting growth in our fast-moving consumer goods markets. Book to bill ended at 1.03, up slightly from last year.","Now on Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was up slightly from last year at $30 million. Corporate expense increased $2 million, principally reflecting incurred spin off costs. Our second quarter tax rate was 7.3%, and included discrete tax benefits of $0.36 related to the finalization of various domestic tax audits. Our normalized rate was 26.7% for the quarter and is 27.2% year-to-date. Capital expenditures were $53 million. Lastly, we repurchased 758,000 shares for approximately $59 million in the quarter, all of which were repurchased under our $1 billion program. In total, we have repurchased $600 million and remain on pace to complete 70% to 80% of the program in 2013.","Turning to Slide 11 and our 2013 revenue guidance. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged from our last earnings call. We expect full year revenue growth of 7% to 9%, with organic growth in the range of 3% to 5%. Completed acquisitions were at around 4%.","Now moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are revising our full year EPS guidance to reflect our solid second quarter results, the tax benefits and incurred spin off costs. We now expect full year EPS to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.71, as detailed on the reconciliation page of the presentation deck. As a quick review, we expect full year revenue growth of 7% to 9%. Corporate expense remains unchanged at $150 million. Interest expense will remain around $127 million. CapEx is now estimated to be about 3.1% of revenue. Our full year tax rate of 27% to 27.5% is slightly lower than the previous estimate due to mix of geographic earnings.","Turning to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. 2012 adjusted EPS was $4.44. For the full year, the impact of volume and mix is largely unchanged at $0.31 to $0.44. Net productivity should be a key contributor and add $0.20 to $0.25, up from our last estimate on the benefits of restructuring. We expect completed acquisitions to be $0.13 to $0.15 accretive for the year, largely driven by Anthony. Investments and compensation will have a $0.16 to $0.23 impact for the year due to higher investment in international growth. Our ongoing share repurchase program, coupled with a slightly lower tax rate and offset in part by incremental interest expense, should have net benefit of $0.33 to $0.35. And as mentioned, incurred spin-off costs were $0.02, while discrete tax benefits provide $0.38 benefit. Based on the above, earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be $5.56 to $5.71.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks, Brad. As I mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our second quarter performance as we delivered strong results in a low-growth macro-economy. We also continued our practice of returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. I am committed to completing the $1 billion program by early next year and fully expect to continue our long-standing record of annual dividend increases. Our strong second quarter growth, solid book to bill and the positive trends across many of our businesses give me confidence in our second half growth and earnings forecast.","I'm also very encouraged by the steps we have taken to strengthen our company. We continue to execute on numerous growth and productivity initiatives. I am pleased with our progress in investing for growth in emerging economies, which helped drive significant growth in those markets. Our second quarter organic growth and margin expansion reflects our success with product innovation and productivity programs. In addition, we have a robust acquisition pipeline, with targets that will complement and expand our already strong product and technology positions and further our efforts of geographic expansion. You should expect us to close several deals in the coming quarters.","Also of significance, we believe the spinoff of Knowles will create substantial shareholder value and strength in both companies. When completed, I believe Dover will be a best-in-class diversified industrial company, with a strong growth and return profile, and Knowles will be positioned as a global technology and market leader in the communication technologies space. I am excited with Dover's long-term prospects as we continue to execute on the important initiatives ahead of us.","In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving our results. With that, Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul E. Goldberg","Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions] And with that, Laurie, if we can have our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Bob, first on the consumer electronics performance here, so 27% in the first quarter, that was above the 15% to 20% you talked about. What do you attribute the outperformance to? And then you also didn't change the revenue guidance for the year for that segment. Are you more cautious on the second half, or is that just being conservative in terms of what you're planning for the second half given you outperformed in 2Q?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So you're asking 2 questions. One, the performance in the second quarter relative to the guidance we provided on the April call. And Shannon, I was -- my first comment would be, I was probably being somewhat conservative in my April comments just because we don't always know how the product stream is going to flow from one quarter to the next. It's not as easy to predict as it is in some of our other businesses. The guys had an outstanding second quarter. Third and fourth quarter, we do expect some significant growth sequentially second half over the first half. The driver of this growth is going to be new product releases. I think you picked up in my prepared comments that we look at these product launches from the OEMs being late third quarter and early fourth quarter. I'd like to think I'm also being somewhat conservative with our comments on the product launches and the outlook for the communication technologies space in the second half of the year, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just quickly on Energy. I mean, the international growth has been great. The margins were a little lower this quarter. I mean, could you talk about your sort of expectations, you talked about rig count up a little bit and sort of maybe profitability expectations going through the rest of the year?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. Second quarter margins down a little bit. My first comment would be to treat them -- treat that as a temporary blip. We did have some lower activity in Canada. Actually, it was quite a bit lower than we anticipated coming into the quarter. But the other thing that was -- I would label as temporary, we did have some elevated product development spending in the second quarter. It wasn't all constrained to the second quarter. But the second quarter spending in this product area was quite a bit higher than the first quarter or even what we'll see here in the third quarter. Margins for that segment were 24%, and maybe a fraction in the first half, Shannon. Margins for the year will be 24% for Energy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just the -- obviously, you referred to some of the factors that drove the bookings weakness in Energy Q-on-Q. But obviously that does impact probably the revenue outlook in 3Q. So I'm wondering as we look into the 3% to 5% core growth for the full year, is there more of a bias towards the lower end of that range at this stage, Bob?","Robert A. Livingston","No, absolutely not. In fact, your comment that our lower bookings in the second quarter, you said impact our revenue outlook for the third quarter, that's not true, Nigel. I think as Brad mentioned in his comments, we do see some of the international business activity, especially around production in Energy, most notably around production in Energy, as being a little bit lumpy, and it's not a steady drumbeat. And in fact, Brad mentioned that the Queensland order for our production group in Energy, we did not receive a second quarter order on that project. It did come in, in early July. And the size of this, Shannon, is -- or Nigel is, what is it, $70 million or $75 million?","Brad M. Cerepak","$75 million, yes. That won't all shift in the third quarter.","Robert A. Livingston","Yes. And as an example, that order is actually for product shipments in the late August through mid-first quarter timeframe of next year. Don't pencil this in at the low end of that range.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. $70 million order came in, in early July, okay.","Robert A. Livingston","I think it was actually the first week of July. Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, okay. That's really helpful. And then switching to Comm Tech, you talked about Samsung several times, and I don't think I've ever heard you actually refer to an OEM customer on the call before. So I'm wondering if that's a signal...","Robert A. Livingston","That makes me [indiscernible] what I can refer to.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But is that indicative that Samsung is now your biggest customer?","Robert A. Livingston","No. For the year, they will not be. No. It's fairly -- it's fairly -- it's a fairly close position between customer 1 and customer 2 for the year. They were rather significant for us in the second quarter. We actually have a very, very broad customer base, especially for our microfilm business, and it's growing for our speaker and receiver business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Robert A. Livingston","Scott, you'll have to speak up a little bit.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, sorry. Guys, can you -- you're one of the few companies that have said anything positive about China in a while. And can you reconcile how broad-based within your portfolio is the China recovery that you're seeing and the strength in the quarter?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So Scott, let me preface. Before I give you a response on the second quarter, let me preface this by saying I have shared both at Dover Day as well as a some of the conferences that we've been speaking at that over the last 4 or 5 years, we've actually served 2 key markets within China, one of them being the very, very significant export market for China, the export industry. And that's -- we're doing much less in that today than we did in the past. And our focus today is really -- I use the phrase supporting, servicing and touching the growing consumer class. And I would tell you as an opening statement, that's what you see in the second quarter. I think that's what you're going to see for the balance of the year is continued activity and growth around our various businesses that do support the growing consumer class. It's interesting to note all 4 segments had double-digit growth in China in the second quarter, from our consumer electronics business to our retail fueling activity to our auto business to Markem-Imaje and our Printing & Identification segment. It was -- well, again, I don't know how else to say it. It was rather broad-based.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Very fair. And just as a quick follow-up, I mean, you did 4 small deals in the quarter, I think, and then you talked fairly optimistically about some deals closing. Can you give us a sense of what types of businesses, even with what segments maybe they might fit into, and a sense of kind of average multiples? I mean, what -- higher than historical average, lower? I mean, just maybe a little bit of context to help us understand how the M&A went, I guess.","Robert A. Livingston","Okay, so multiples. First of all, I'm going to emphasize the word \"small\". I could have used the word \"very small\". I think in total, the revenue we acquired in the second quarter was around $45 million or $50 million, is that the right number? Annualized, I mean, so they're rather small. The question around valuation in multiples, may be actually a bit lower than our historic number over the last 4 or 5 years. And I think our historic number for the last 4 years has been 9 or 9.3, something like that, on our trailing EBITDA.","Brad M. Cerepak","[indiscernible] Yes, correct.","Robert A. Livingston","So a little bit lower than that. So we like the valuation on these deals. As I commented, they were all add-on, highly synergistic product expansions [ph]. One of them was a bit of a geographic extension for us. We had a couple of them within Engineered Systems, a small one in our pumps business, another one in environmental solutions group and a small one within Printing & Identification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just following up maybe on that theme and just thinking about capital deployment. As Brad noted, I guess you're on track for the share repurchase for the year. But was there any particular reason you kind of stepped back in this quarter? The deals sound like they were small. Seems like you would have been able to actually do a lot more than you did.","Brad M. Cerepak","You're talking about the acquisitions, Jeff, or the share buyback?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I think the question was why was a share repurchase activity thin in the second quarter?","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Well, yes. I'm kind of wondering if there's maybe a big deal that didn't happen and therefore you didn't do share repurchase.","Robert A. Livingston","No, Jeff. Well, look. As I said, we're right on track with our share buyback, and we still have more to do this year, as I indicated in the prepared comments. Keep in mind, in the second quarter there was a period of time that we weren't in the market as we were nearing a point in the decision around our spin. So I think you'll see us be a little bit more aggressive in the second half than in the second quarter on that, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","All right. That makes sense. And can you give us a little color on Anthony organically, as we think about that on a pro forma basis, how it grew in the quarter?","Robert A. Livingston","Organic. Now I actually don't have that data on what they did last year. We view Anthony as being very much on track with our acquisition model and the expectations we had for the year. Our close-the-case business at Anthony continues to, I will say, expand and execute quite well. The coordination between Anthony and the Hill PHOENIX team is proceeding extremely well, especially on the front end of the business and our sales and market activity and the channel management. We're quite happy with the acquisition.","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes, the only data point I would give you, Jeff, is that I don't have year-over-year either, but we're really pleased with the sequential growth we saw in Anthony. It is into the season, but 25% sequential growth into Q2. We'll see that continue to grow into Q3, and then obviously moderate with the seasonality in that business into Q4. But right on track where we expected it to be, both in terms of our revenue expectations and, importantly, our earnings expectations.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Great. And then just one last one on Samsung. So if we think about your sales for Samsung moving higher in the back half of the year, can you give us some sense, is that just their higher volume pulling you through? Are you still early in, kind of, an adoption curve with them on new products or increased content on existing products?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay, yes. Let me be very specific here. Samsung, year-over-year in the second half, will be up. I don't know what that percentage is, but it's rather significant. We will have very strong year-over-year growth. To put this in perspective, though, Jeff, on a sequential basis, we look at first half versus second half. Expectations from Samsung, modest growth in the second half over the first half. I think it may only be 10% growth in the second half over the first half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citigroup.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","There was a discussion earlier on expectations for an increase in rig count, some of that seasonal. Can you quantify that and what the timing is and maybe the split between gas and oil?","Robert A. Livingston","Oh, gosh. I don't -- I'm not sure that the split between gas and oil has changed any over the last -- over the last -- over the last couple of quarters, Deane. I think the -- when you look at the total rig count that is deployed, gas rigs are down about 20%, and we don't see that changing here in the second half. As we move into the -- as we move into the second half of the year, I think we -- our plans, I think are calling for about a 3% sequential improvement book in North America rig count. Let me -- no, let me correct that. 3% sequential improvement in U.S. rig count second half over first half averages. So it's not -- it's not a big driver of our expectations, but we do see it improving slightly.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is that a seasonal adjustment, would you say?","Robert A. Livingston","No. I'm not going to -- would see the seasonal adjustment in Canada. And it's -- that one tends to be a bit more significant, Deane. The rig count, the rig count in Canada in the second quarter typically drops about 70% from the first quarter, sequentially. And we saw that again in the second quarter, perhaps even a little bit more of a drop than we typically see. That will recover from the second quarter lows as we typically see it. And I think for the year, the second half will lead to an improvement over the first half. But again, it's because of just the seasonal downturn in Canada in the second quarter.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And you mentioned Canada, and we've seen some of the impact -- our discussion about the impact from flooding. How would you characterize that on your business and what kind of snapback recovery you're expecting?","Robert A. Livingston","I don't have an exact dollar impact with respect to revenue. But look, it's pretty safe to make the statement that in the last -- the last whatever it was, the 8 or 9 days of June, southern Alberta, there wasn't much business activity going on. That flooding was pretty severe. We do see it recovering. We do see a return to normal activity in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question on the Comm Tech stuff. So I guess in the back half of the year, to get to your guidance first half to second half, you need about $120 million in sequential increase?","Robert A. Livingston","I think that sounds about right. I don't have that exact number. It may be slightly high, but it sounds about right, yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so if I assume the other businesses, they seem kind of flattish. I mean, are there any dynamics sequentially in the non-consumer electronics businesses that are moving around? They seem kind of flat and stable.","Robert A. Livingston","There will be some improvement in the non-acoustic businesses in the second half versus the first half. But the bulk of the sequential growth, Steve, is as you're inferring. It's going to come from consumer electronics.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So 50% of the business is going to carry most of the load. And you said I think Samsung is up 10%. What is it? Are there that many launches from the other customers? And I guess if there are, are we looking at something other than the traditional handset stuff? Is there -- are there other things that are driving that in a material way? Assuming because Samsung up 10% is fine, but it's still below average of kind of what you need that consumer business to grow.","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So even aside from product launches that I'll comment on here as my second comment, you do see some seasonal balance between second half and first half, especially in consumer electronics. The second half is always a little bit stronger than the first half. So we do expect that, and we will see that. When you look at product launches in the late third quarter going into the fourth quarter, that -- our participation in those product launches is rather significant and it's rather broad-based. And the increased revenue aside from a little bit of a seasonal pickup you get in the second half, the bulk of our increased revenue in the second half sequentially is coming from our participation in the new customers' product launches in late third quarter and fourth quarter.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, but it's handset focused. It's still the -- it's not like some new...","Robert A. Livingston","Almost all of it is handset focused.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So the other business outside of Samsung is growing a lot faster than Samsung. You've got -- the Samsung stuff was really the lift in this quarter that you called out.","Robert A. Livingston","Correct.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick one on Engineered. Very good quarter, much stronger than I was expecting.","Robert A. Livingston","It had a great quarter, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, absolutely phenomenal. I guess, you mentioned the [indiscernible] stuff. I guess you called that out a bit in the 10-Q. But it's interesting that the core -- it seems like the core Hill PHOENIX business, what was that up? Because you were still kind of anniversary-ing the Target headwinds, so that's even more impressive in the face of that. Just curious, what your organic -- I guess, just bottom line what was your organic at Hill PHOENIX? I can kind of back into the rest.","Robert A. Livingston","I think organic at Hill PHOENIX was 4% or 5%.","Brad M. Cerepak","5%.","Robert A. Livingston","5%.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wow. And that includes the Target headwind that you expected?","Brad M. Cerepak","It was more in the first quarter than in the second, but there was headwind there, yes.","Robert A. Livingston","And we called this out on the April call. The real headwind we were feeling at Target was much more noticeable in the first quarter. We still dealt with it in the second quarter, but it was reduced.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Bob, could you give a little more color around your comments on long-cycle pump business strength? What geographies or verticals are actually showing improvement? And I'm just curious what the trajectory is.","Robert A. Livingston","Actually, it would have probably been more helpful if I had mentioned the actual business instead of --. But there is -- our primary business within pumps that is the longer-cycle is Maag Pump, the acquisition we made 15 months ago, I guess. It's not the only one, but that's where we see the primary long-cycle activity is within Maag.","Brad M. Cerepak","And that's where we had the deferred shipment from the first quarter.","Robert A. Livingston","Yes. And John, we did call out on the April call that part of our weakness in the first quarter in fluids was a deferral by a customer of a scheduled first quarter shipment into the second quarter. That was part of the growth in the second quarter. But beyond that, the guys -- we have very, very strong activity in the second quarter within our pumps business.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And is there Bob, the other part of my question, was there a vertical application that seems to be picking up? Because companies that have been serving the fluids industry have been talking about projects being pushed to the right. I'm just wondering if maybe you're starting to see some of these projects perhaps get kind of put back on the books here or something like that.","Robert A. Livingston","It wasn't just one vertical. But if I did -- if I did mention one vertical that was important, it is the plastics vertical.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's plastics. Okay, that's helpful. I want to ask about Knowles. I mean, Knowles really is doing so well. If you were to keep the business next year, I mean our back of the envelope says it might contribute 80-plus cents to your earnings. So my question is how are you thinking about the prospects of maybe stepping up share repurchase or acquisitions? I mean, you obviously called out the very strong pipeline to prospectively replace some of that. What are your thoughts there, Bob?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, your comment was if we were to keep Knowles, let me repeat my previous comment. Our progress on seeing a first quarter spin-off transaction is progressing very well, John. And yes, they had an outstanding quarter. If you annualize it, you get a pretty impressive number for next year, and I think they will have a pretty impressive 2014. We are working through our acquisition program across the group in Dover to pursue the deals that make sense for us and to pursue the deals that have the right valuation for us. We'll see how that rolls out over the next 2 or 3 or 4 quarters. With respect to additional share repurchases, all I'm going to do is repeat the comment that I made and that Brad made. We're on track for being at about 70% to 80% of the $1 billion authorization by year end. Any other comments beyond, that I would defer to a later date or a later call.","Brad M. Cerepak","The only other thing I would add is in addition to looking at acquisitions across the portfolio of Dover, we are, as you noticed in the quarter, stepping up our investments internationally because we see great opportunity for us. And as Bob said, the broad-based growth in China has a lot to do with that.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. That makes a lot of sense. Just lastly, electronic assembly and test, do you still expect those businesses -- I mean, Intel kind of had some weak numbers. I mean, do you expect those businesses still to kind of be on track for something out of the portfolio?","Robert A. Livingston","We're running a process. And I think we -- as I've been saying for the last 3 months or 4 months, I think you'll see us make an announcement here in the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just had a question around the net benefits of productivity. I mean, you pushed that up in your sort of EPS bridge to $0.20 to $0.25 from $0.12 to $0.22. Was that sort of largely a function of the extra Comm Tech restructuring? Or is it was really just in Printing & ID or how you're thinking about that? And I guess related to that point on Printing & and ID, you've got a very, very big margin jump in Q2 off flat sales. You had a high margin base in the second half of '12. Do you think your second half of '13 margins can be above that 16% rate last year?","Brad M. Cerepak","Okay. There's a lot of questions in there. But as I said in my comments, the increase in productivity is specifically due to the restructuring benefits. When we entered -- if I back up for a second, when we entered the year, in our earlier guide, we were expecting to spend in the order of magnitude of $12 million to -- let's call it $12 million to $15 million of restructuring. We are now looking at a number of $20 million to $25 million, of which a lot of that was already executed in the first half. A lot of that actually executed within DCT. And so the benefits we're seeing coming through in the second half have a lot to do with the amount we've spent in DCT to take out costs. You'll see it in the margin expansion in the second half, when we said it would be substantially up. And so that's what you're seeing on the bridge.","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. Your other question, Julian, was around Printing & Identification?","Brad M. Cerepak","Right.","Robert A. Livingston","Yes, I think if you're trying to build your model, and I know that's what you're trying to do, I would feel pretty comfortable using margins in the second half for this segment, second half of '13, to be rather similar to what they were in the second half of '12.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up would be around U.S. kind of short-cycle industrial demand. I think you've made 1 or 2 comments that, that did look better, particularly, I guess stuff related to the automotive supply chain perhaps. Could you elaborate a little bit?","Robert A. Livingston","Yes, and don't -- we call it auto related and it's not so much -- it's not so much the auto supply chain for building vehicles and light trucks here in North America. But it's really a comment around our lift business within vehicle service group. The activity there remained rather robust. Other short-cycle activity here in the U.S., we commented on Hill PHOENIX. Even within environmental solutions group, specifically our refuse truck business, had a very strong second quarter, both on revenue and bookings. We see them having a fairly solid performance in the second half. We obviously aren't seeing the growth in U.S. in North America that we are experiencing and winning in China or other emerging economies. But we do forecast modest growth here in the U.S. market in the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you just talk a little bit about sort of raw material costs? How is that looking -- we've heard from some companies that it's coming in maybe a little bit better than what are currently in current budgets. Can you speak to that effect or what it's having across the business segments?","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes, I would echo that. I would say we are seeing it a little bit better. It's not dramatic. But from where we were earlier in the year, I would say it's improved -- improved quite a bit in the area of steel. But it's not big enough really to call out and say it's helped driving us into the second half.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just in terms of the Energy segment, the impact of the Canadian -- the softness, I guess, in which you said -- you sound as though that's kind of rectified itself going into Q3. First of all, is that correct? Did I hear you correctly on that?","Robert A. Livingston","Yes, that's correct.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then so I guess, can you quantify kind of what the impact was in Q2? And is it all -- has anything shifted outside of '13 or has it just kind of moved a little bit to the right?","Robert A. Livingston","I'm not aware of anything that has shifted out of '13. It's all moved to the right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I would like to just go back to Europe for a second. You commented in your remarks, Bob, that Europe was flat in the second quarter. Is that a kind of better performance than you've seen recently? And can you comment on which markets were better and which markets were worse, and if you think you might have seen an inflection point there?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, I don't -- I'm reluctant to call an inflection point. It was better activity for us in the second quarter than we saw in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter. The businesses that you're asking for a little bit color on what was up and what was down, it is interesting, I think for the first time in 3 quarters or 3 or 4 quarters, Brad, Markem-Imaje was actually up in Europe in the second quarter. It was modest, but I think they were up maybe 3% or 4%, 3% in Europe in the second quarter. Our pump business may have been up slightly. But even with -- it's interesting that even within our pump business, you'll see some brands serving some verticals that were up and you'll see some brands that serve different verticals that were down again. The business that probably struggled the most in Europe in the second quarter was our heat exchanger business. I don't remember now how much they were down, but it's 5%, 6%, 7% down?","Brad M. Cerepak","Right.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if we could -- if I could just talk about Anthony for a minute. I mean, obviously, the Engineered Systems segment had a great second quarter margin performance. I'm wondering if you could give us any color on how Anthony contributed to that improvement and whether Anthony's progressing faster from either a cost-out standpoint or a revenue synergy with Hill PHOENIX standpoint than you had anticipated when you bought it?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So I would say that, your question is, did Anthony contribute to our margin performance. That's the question?","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, potentially more than you had expected it to.","Brad M. Cerepak","No, it's right -- I would say it's right on track year-to-date and in the quarter. Keep in mind, we do have pretty substantial AD&A or amortizations on that business acquisition. So I would say all in, with amortization, it's below the margin.","Robert A. Livingston","It's a drag on margins.","Brad M. Cerepak","It's drag on margins. But if I took out that AD&A, we're really, really pleased with -- I'm not going to go and tell you what the margin is for Anthony. But let's just say it's not an operational drag.","Robert A. Livingston","It's not -- yes.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And if I could just get to one clarification question in, Bob. You said that you expect Energy margins for the year to be 24%. Is that right, which would mean they're down year-over-year in the second half?","Robert A. Livingston","24% and a small fraction. I think it was -- it would be a good number to look at.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mig Dobre of Robert W. Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'd like to go back to Hill PHOENIX, if we can. Very good performance there, as you already talked about. But I'm wondering, can you talk a little bit about the drivers? Is it some share gains? Is it that the market is perhaps behaving better than some of us have anticipated? How should we think about that?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I wouldn't label this as share gains. I wouldn't label it as a stronger U.S. or North American market. I would bring a lot of attention on Hill PHOENIX comment to their continuing efforts to grow their business outside of North America. They've been working on this for, oh, goodness, a couple of years now. We're seeing the benefits of that, a little bit in the latter part of last year. We see some real benefits here in the second quarter. We think we'll see even more benefits in the third quarter. But don't label this as share gain and don't label this as a stronger-than-anticipated North America market. It's our international activity.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And I guess last one for me would be on Print & ID. Maybe can you talk broadly about the growth opportunities in this segment going forward? And how do you think about maybe your opportunity to deploy capital here?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. So growth activities opportunities, I guess my first comment would be with respect to a geographic opportunity. And we still see plenty of opportunities for this business in emerging economies. I commented earlier that all 4 of our segments had double-digit revenue growth in China in the second quarter. Markem-Imaje was part of that success in the second quarter, with double-digit growth rates. We would expect to see that continue for the balance of the year. They had an outstanding growth profile in Latin America and India. And then on top of that, we still see the U.S. market as a growth opportunity for Markem-Imaje. And the second part of your question was capital allocation. We made one small add-on acquisition. And here again, I'll use -- I will use the word \"very small\" add-on acquisition in the second quarter. But within our pipeline, we have another -- oh, I don't know, 2 or 3 opportunities that we're looking at and chasing. We'll see how they evolve and conclude here over the next couple of quarters. It is an area that we would like to deploy some more capital.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Are those opportunities still fairly small or are you looking at something larger?","Robert A. Livingston","They're small but perhaps larger than what we did in the second quarter.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul E. Goldberg","Thanks, Laurie. This concludes our conference call.

Our second quarter reflected the continuation of a trend that began to develop late last year, namely, improving global markets and strong results reflecting solid execution by our teams. These factors resulted in revenue growth and margin expansion that exceeded our forecast. All segments posted sequential margin improvement, most notably, in refrigeration and food equipment, and in fluids. And these segments, our work on integration, productivity, and commercial excellence resulted in improved performance in the quarter. Overall, our segments performed at a high level which we expect to continue. We are raising our full-year guidance for revenue and EPS reflecting our strong second quarter results and our increased confidence in the back half of the year across all segments.","As we highlighted at our June Investor Day we expect strong performance over the next few years in both organic revenue growth and margin expansion. Delivering on our 2017 commitments is a critical step towards achieving our three year plan. I\u2019m pleased to say we are executing well on our revenue growth and margin expansion activities. Our work on involving the portfolio over the past several years is yielding tangible benefits. It has been a steady and purposeful transformation as we have focused on building great businesses. With 60% of our revenue from businesses that hold a Number One or Number Two market share, we have built and expanded the leading positions serving growth markets through platforms like marking and coding, fueling and transport and pumps to name just a few. We continue to have significant potential to expand revenue and margin as we apply our operating model to improve every business and use inorganic investment to strengthen our businesses even further.","With regard to evolving our portfolio, we have focused on markets at all for solid long-term growth rates markets where expertise and solution set is valued and in markets that provide opportunities for further expansion. Regarding our operating model, we strive to make the businesses we own better through the steady application of a number of value creating tools and processes. We started with the establishment of our global sourcing organization several years ago, to investments in talent development and embedding a continuous improvement process across the organization to more recent investments in shared services. ","We have steadily been adding capabilities and have a clear and executable path to sustained business improvement. Our discipline strategy of positioning ourselves in strong markets and improving our businesses allows us to generate significant free cash flow. Some of this cash will be returned annually through increasing dividends while much of it will be in reinvested to further grow our businesses thus creating even stronger platforms. In short, we believe today we have world-class leading platforms and attractive markets and are well positioned to deliver growth, margin expansion, and consistent free cash flow yield.","With that I'd like to turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Bob, good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned we had a very strong second quarter. We achieved organic revenue and bookings growth at every segment. Leverage on this organic growth combined with solid contributions from our recent acquisitions and strong execution on margin improvement activities resulted in an overall segment margin of 15%. Sequentially, this represents a 320 basis point improvement over the adjusted first quarter. There were several highlights in the quarter, including broad-based growth in engineered systems, the return of organic growth in fluids, and meaningful progress in the retail fueling integration, productivity and commercial improvements in refrigeration and food equipment, and lastly strong growth in energy on a higher than expected US rig count and increased well completions. Also from a geographic perspective, US, Europe and China markets all grew organically year over year.","As noted earlier, we are increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance as a result of our strong second quarter and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year. I'll share those specifics with you in a little bit, but first let's go through some of the details on the quarter, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today we reported second quarter revenue of 2 billion, an increase of 18%. Strong organic growth of 10% was complemented by acquisition growth of 12%. Partially offsetting these results was a 4% impact from dispositions and FX. EPS was a $1.04d, exceeding the high end of our expectations, principally reflecting strong conversion on higher revenue. Segment margin was 15%, 190 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by strong incremental margin on increased volume in our energy segment and by stronger performance in refrigeration and food equipment.","Bookings increased 19% to 2 billion. This positive result reflecting organic growth in each segment is comprised of 12% organic growth and 11% acquisition growth, partially offset by a 4% impact of dispositions and FX. Book to bill finished at 1.01. Overall, our backlog increased 21% to 1.3 billion. On an organic basis, backlog increased 16%. Free cash flow was 150 million in the second quarter, a sequential increase of 115 million. We expect very strong free cash flow generation in the back half of the year consistent with our normal pattern. Now turning to Slide 4. Our strong organic growth was broad-based. Engineered systems grew 5% driven by solid activity across both platforms. Fluids organic revenue increased 4%, principally driven by solid retail fueling and strong industrial pump in pharma and hygienic markets. Refrigeration of food equipment increased 5% reflecting alignment with retail refrigeration customers who are investing. Lastly, energy grew 39% organically. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 34% in fluids and 10% in engineered systems.","Turning to Slide 5. Engineers systems revenue of 655 million, was up 5% organically reflecting broad-based growth. Earnings increased 3% as volume leverage was moderated by investments and material cost inflation. Our printing and identification platform revenue increased 5% organically, driven by continued strength in our marking and coding markets. In the industrial platform, revenue increased 15% including acquisition growth of 17% and 5% organic growth. The organic growth was broad based with particular strength in our waste handling business. Margin was in line with our expectations, which included a 90 basis point impact from acquisitions. Bookings increased 14% overall, including organic bookings growth of 9%. Organic growth reflects solid markets across the segment. Book to bill for print and identification was 1.01, industrials was 0.97. Overall book to bill was 0.99.","Now moving on to Slide 6. Fluids revenue increased 36% to 553 million reflecting our acquisitions and retail fueling and 4% organic growth. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by solid activity in retail fueling, especially in Europe and Asia and strong industrial pump in pharma and hygienic markets. Earnings increased 36%, largely driven by volume growth, including acquisitions and productivity gains. Of note, we have accelerated the pace of our retail fueling integration and now expect a 6 million net benefit for the year, up 3 million from our prior forecast. This will put us ahead of the pace for 2018 synergy benefits. Margin in the quarter was 13.3%, up 330 basis points sequentially representing meaningful progress in our retail fueling activities, including integration and commercial actions. Bookings grew 34%, driven by acquisitions in organic growth of 4%. Organic bookings growth was driven by solid activity in our pumps and our hygienic and pharma markets. Book to bill was 1.0.","Now Turning to Slide 7. Refrigeration and food equipments revenue of 426 million included organic growth of 5%. The organic increase was largely driven by strong activity in our retail refrigeration business. We outperformed the border market on the strength of our alignment with customers who are investing in energy efficient solutions and enhanced fresh and prepared food merchandising. Food equipment results were in line with our expectations, with solid results in our can-shaping business more than offset softness in our commercial cooking equipment markets. Earnings increased 4% from the prior year or 8% on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact from a prior-year disposition. Margin expanded 70 basis points year-over-year and 600 basis points sequentially, reflecting improved execution and volume leverage offset in part by previously mentioned material cost inflation. Bookings increased 6% organically. Book to bill was solid at 1.09.","Now on Slide 8. Energy revenue of 359 million increased 39% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Earnings were 53 million and segment margin was 14.9%, both significantly improved over last year. These results exceeded our prior forecasts largely driven by US rig count growth, increased well completion activity and strong results in bearings and compression. Bookings were up 43% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, setting us up for a solid third quarter. With respect to the third quarter, we expect revenue will be up about 1% to 2% sequentially. Book to bill finished at 0.98.","Now going to the overview on Slide 9. Our second quarter corporate and interest expense were both essentially in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was slightly higher than forecast at 28.9% and included 2.5 million of discrete tax costs. Excluding these costs, our effective tax rate was 27.8%. Now moving on to Slide 10. We now expect total revenue to increase 12% to 14% versus our prior forecast of 11% to 13%. This forecast includes organic revenue growth of 5% to 7%, up 1 point. The impact from completed acquisitions, dispositions and FX is essentially unchanged. From a segment perspective, organic growth of engineered systems and fluid are both being raised 1 point, driven by solid second quarter and broad-based bookings growth. Refrigeration and food equipment remains unchanged from our prior forecast. Energy is now expected to grow 24% to 27% organically, up 4 points over the last forecast, largely driven by strong second quarter growth and continuing constructive markets.","Our full-year forecast for corporate expense is up 5 million, primarily on increased investments. We expect third and fourth quarter tax rate to be about 28%. Further our forecast for CapEx and free cash flow is unchanged. Lastly, we now expect full-year adjusted segment margin to be up slightly from our prior forecast. As a result, we now expect full-year EPS to be in the range of $4.23 and $4.33, up $0.15 from our prior forecast at the midpoint or an increase of 38% over 2016 on an adjusted basis. The revised guidance reflects increased second half performance and in all segments. Please note that our guidance bridge can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck.","With that I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Brad. I am very excited with our strong first half performance. All segments positively participated in our results through acquisitions, improving end markets or internal initiatives. Each segment had multiple drivers of performance improvement. Now let me take a minute to share my views on some of the important drivers that should positively impact our midterm performance. In engineered systems, our printing and identification platform will continue to deliver consist solid performance, driven by our focus on consumables and product innovation and marketing and coding and our unique position in the digital textile printing market. In our industrial platform, we have built leading positions in vehicle service and waste handling. Our focus in these markets is around providing full solutions rather than simply equipment. Within fluids, we expect to the EMV [ph] upgrade cycle in the US to accelerate starting in the second half of 2018.","Along with that, our growing participation into hygienic and pharma, and industrial pump markets should provide for solid mid-digit growth in the segment. This growth will be complemented by margin expansion from our retail fueling integration and from the application of our operating model across the segment. In refrigeration and food equipment, the strengthen in our retail refrigeration business reflects our leading position in cases and systems, our technology around energy efficiency as well as our expertise helping our customers effectively merchandise fresh and prepared food. The retail food market continues to evolve and is shifting to these areas where we are the acknowledged leader. Finally, within energy, the significant drilling activity we've seen over the last few quarters has created a large backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells. We expect that many of these wells will get completed over the coming quarters and we will have strong participation in this activity. In all, our markets remain solid and I expect our execution to remain strong.","With that I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for remaining focused on our customers. Now Paul let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Bob. Before we take the first question, I'd just like to remind the listeners if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up we\u2019d be able to get more questions. And so with that Stephanie, can we have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Bob, could you pick up on the last point on drill but uncompleted wells and provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing there. Just eyeballing your book to bill and a little bit of backlog draw, some of which is not unusual seasonal, but it does kind of raise the question if this wave of drilling is going to be fully followed by kind of the wave of completions, which would seem to be necessary to carry your results into the back half. So any color there on the visibility that you have in that business and maybe the state of play on the number of wells and backlog et cetera could be helpful.","Bob Livingston","Maybe I don't do it in the exact order you've asked the questions, Jeff. So let me start with the last question on the status of drilled but uncompleted wells. I don't have the data here in front of me, I did look at it a few days ago and I think the status of drilled and uncompleted wells at the end of the second quarter was a bit higher than it was at the end of the first quarter. Even though well completion activity did increase during the second quarter. The drilling activity has been rather robust during the second quarter. Our outlook for the second half of the year, Brad, you're going to help me here with a number. But I think for the second half of the year in drilling, our forecast assumes that rig count will be up. ","I think it's rather modest 1% or 2% from where it is right today, Jeff. We're not forecasting much growth and further rig count deployment. We do continue to see the completion of wells continuing in the second half of the year. The activity in the Permian remains quite strong and in fact I think sequentially, June was up 15% over May, I don't remember what the data was, May over April, but I do know that June was up 15% over May in the Permian. And we feel fairly solid with our forecast for the second half of the year depending upon rig count, it could be conservative.","Jeffrey Sprague","And just shifting gears to another topic. Refrigeration is up 5% organic in the first half. What gets us to up only 1 to 3 for the year, what's really happening in the back half?","Brad Cerepak","I would start first by telling you that our first quarter was probably a bit stronger than we anticipated. Our second quarter was a bit stronger than we anticipated. Our bookings were strong during the quarter. June bookings were solid. I think we feel fairly comfortable and confident with our third quarter forecast. And I will tell you that sitting here today, I feel like we're being a bit conservative with our fourth quarter forecast. This was the only segment where we did not raise organic growth for the balance of the year. And Jeff, my color comment on that was the activity within this segment wanted to see a raise in organic growth in refrigeration and I would just tell you, I think we're being a bit conservative with our outlook for the fourth quarter and did not raise organic growth. But the activity sort of, today sort of warrants that, but I think we're being conservative.","Paul Goldberg","Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on, EMV and Wayne, it looks like its steady sequentially, but how should we model revenues in the second half of \u201917 and where are the orders trending for US fuel. How should we think about I guess the regulatory cycle.","Bob Livingston","Well we shared - we shared the outlook over the next two to three years at our Investor Meeting in June. We do expect EMV in the activity in the second half of the year to moderate and to be less than we expected as we open the year. That said that's primarily a US comment. I would compliment that US comment by saying that for both Wayne and Tokheim, most notably at Tokheim, our revenue activity, our market activity in Europe, Middle East, Asia has been stronger than we anticipated both in the first quarter as well as a second quarter. And even though we see a little bit of moderation of activity in the US here in the second half, I would be remiss by not sharing the fact that our earnings for the year are remaining as we have held since we opened the year, we have strong earnings potential.","Andrew Obin","And that's a question on cash flow. As I look at the first half cash flow and it makes perfect sense given where the organic growth is for the business so far year-to-date, but 140 million versus 170 million last year, but you are calling for a very strong cash conversion, 140% for the year. If organic growth continue, how do you get working capital out of the company with strong organic growth.","Brad Cerepak","So let me take that question. You do point out quite correctly that in the quarter we had very strong organic and total growth as well at 18%. So, working capital did increase, net about 50 million in the quarter with AR being about 100 million up. So, given the sequence within the quarter, with June being the largest part of the quarter's results, gives me some confidence that as we go into the back half that receivables will be collected. Now let me comment on inventory because I think this is an important point. We did see our inventory; we said this in the first quarter. ","We continued to carry into the second quarter with inventory increase of about 50 million more than we would have expected principally driven by a few areas, one being as we referred to before to better manage our peak periods of production flow in refrigeration, we increased some inventory there. That will burn off in the second half. We also selectively increased inventory as we started to see some material cost inflation in very specific areas, not broad based, but very specific areas. So all in all about 50 million of inventory builds over above where we would have expected that I have full confidence will burn off in the second half.","Bob Livingston","Brad, the only other comment I will make there is on working capital as a percentage of our revenue. I actually think we're at the lowest working capital number as a percentage of revenue since I've been CEO.","Brad Cerepak","Well, longer than that.","Bob Livingston","Longer than that, yeah. So it was a record low of 17.6% in the quarter, which shows really the guys are doing a great job on looking at and managing our working capital in total.","Brad Cerepak","Andrew, we feel quite comfortable with our cash flow forecast for the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","So I just want to pick up on Andrew\u2019s points on Wayne. Is the second half pretty much tracking to you know how you saw with maybe two months ago. I think you mentioned perhaps that the first half was a litter bit stronger second half but weaker than back in June. I just wonder if that dynamic has changed at all.","Bob Livingston","I think the comments \u2013 well, you say two months ago, let me refer to my comments that we shared with all of you at our June Investor Conference. And I think the second half is shaping up fairly close to what we - to the color we shared at the June investor conference. EMV activity is down in the second half relative to what we expected coming into the year. And again that's a US comment, but I will tell you it's - we are very, very pleased with the activity of both Wayne and Tokheim outside of the US. And we actually feel, we actually feel quite good with the commercial activity and the integration activity within this platform.","Nigel Coe","And then switching back to energy Bob, this mix between drilling and production, so I\u2019m just wondering, as these ducts start to complete, that 1% to 2% higher revenue in 3Q, is the mix between drilling and production materially different to what we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year, 2Q and do you think you can actually grow margins sequentially on the back of them?","Bob Livingston","Yeah. We\u2019ll see a bit of a tapering in the growth in our drilling activity. Actually, I would maybe rephrase it. I think we will see more than a bit of tapering in the growth of our drilling activity. But offsetting that, we do expect growth in well completion activity that will be recognized by our artificial lift in our automation businesses.","Brad Cerepak","But specific to margin, off of the second quarter rate, we do expect to expand that margin in the back half on energy.","Nigel Coe","Sequentially?","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Charley Brady","Just wondered if you could comment on the Amazon Whole Foods merger as it relates to the refrigeration food equipment business and kind of some of the consolidation that's going on, taking place in there, and maybe how it affects your view of that business long term.","Bob Livingston","Okay. Well, there's two parts. So the consolidation within the industry, goodness, we've been seeing that occur for several years now and of course, when it does, when company A and company B go together, it's not uncommon for us to see a bit of a pause, while the combined business decides what they\u2019re going to do with respect to remodel or new store construction. But that's sort of normal for this industry. The first part of your question, with respect to Amazon and Whole Foods, my answer is not going to surprise you. We're not seeing any change right now and there really hasn't been any communication that we've received from either of the two that would lead us to believe that it's going to have any impact on our business.","Charley Brady","Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, just I want to clarify the comment on the Tokheim business in Europe, so you're saying that that European business is the strength there to fully offset the softening you're seeing in EMV in the second half?","Bob Livingston","Yes. In fact, let me clarify that. It's not just Tokheim. It\u2019s Tokheim and Wayne, seeing better activity in Europe, the Middle East and Asia that is truly offsetting a little bit of the softness we're seeing in the second half with respect to EMV activity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Bob, so clearly the chassis issues that you had in waste handling seem to be behind you. So how do we think about your overall industrial business within energy and engineered solutions going forward? Can you sustain mid-single digit organic growth and then you mentioned last quarter that waste handling could be up high single digits for the year. Do you see that kind of growth potential for that business?","Bob Livingston","Well, I'm going to give you both a comment for the year and then echo what we shared with everyone at our June investor conference. The growth we've seen in the first half, especially in the second quarter, we see it continuing in the second half. In fact, relative to our guidance, it's going to edge up a bit. Our waste handling, our [indiscernible] management business is performing well. The chassis issue is behind us. That business built revenue during the quarter with, I would say, June being, I think, it was a record shipping month in June for that business. And the outlook for the second half of the year for that business is as solid as we've been signaling all year long. It is high single digit growth in that business for the year.","The other comment I would share is beyond 2017 and this is what we shared at the Investor Conference a few weeks ago, we see the industrial platform is having strong mid digit growth -- organic growth for the next two to three years and we think we're in a very good market position. We think we're in a very good technology position and it's not just waste handling, it's across the platform.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Bob, that\u2019s helpful. And then, can you talk about your appetite for bigger portfolio management, specifically how that -- how you're thinking about energy now. When you look at rig counts, they have shot up faster than really anyone expected. There\u2019s been some oil price volatility here, which leads to some fear that rig counts are peaking. Does that incentivize you at all to potentially try and monetize energy faster, how are you thinking about it right now?","Bob Livingston","Look, I think that's at least the third question that I've had this year on energy and our portfolio inclusion. And my answer, I\u2019m smiling when I say this. And my answer is really the same. This is -- we've built a great position with these businesses around our upstream energy portfolio. We did expect strong growth in these businesses this year. We've seen it. We'll see how the second quarter or the second half performs. I happen to think we may be slightly conservative on that second half guide. And it is that and other topics that are similar to this is something that Brad and I do review with our board on a very periodic basis. I have no other new news to share with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Good execution in the quarter. Definitely, all these issues of the last year or so or a year and a half ago are pretty much, look like they're remedied. So congrats on the execution.","Bob Livingston","Thank you. I appreciate that and the teams have done a good job.","Steve Tusa","Yeah. So on the energy business, so it looks like organic is up about mid-20s in the second half on the top line. Rig count year-over-year is up pretty dramatic, up I think like 70%, 80%, given the easy comps year-over-year, assuming a stable, assuming so. So is there any way to kind of give us the variability around, what if rigs were actually down, what would your revenue kind of -- what is the revenue profile of like how much that completion activity comes on to offset. So I'm thinking more kind of on a 12-month basis, if rigs were down year-over-year, is there enough duct activity out there, what -- I guess the question is, at what rate of rig decline and kind of over a 12 to 18 month period, would you still be able to grow the business, given the significant completion activity that's out there. How are you kind of thinking about that as you plan for the next year?","Bob Livingston","Steve, I don't have enough time remaining on this call to give you a complete answer to that. So let me, okay, I really want to do this.","Steve Tusa","Yeah. I guess let me simplify. Let me simplify this, is given the complexion of what you expect on completions and all these may get an \u201918 question, I mean I know you guys don\u2019t want to give guidance, but if rigs were down 10% year-over-year in \u201918, 10%, what do you think your kind of -- can you backfill that with completion activity and still grow the business?","Bob Livingston","If rigs were down 10%, the well completion activity could very easily offset the decline we would see in our drilling activity. And we -- as -- we have done that analysis and if the price of oil remain constructive in the $45 to $50 area, we actually think we could have modest increase in revenue for the segment.","Steve Tusa","Okay. That's a great answer. And also just the mix of margins would obviously be a little bit different, right, because drilling is \u2013","Bob Livingston","Somewhat, but not dramatically.","Steve Tusa","Okay. That\u2019s a really great answer. And then lastly, just on energy, what do you -- did you change at all your margin expectations. What's the margin you expect for the full year?","Bob Livingston","Oh gosh. I don't have that data with me. I don't think from the margin expectations from our April call, the answer is no. In fact, they may have edged up 20 or 30 bps, 40bps from the April call expectation.","Brad Cerepak","No. I think they're up a little bit more than that. I think our expectations now are up about somewhere around 80 bps.","Bob Livingston","80 bps.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And that\u2019s 80 bps from where you were, from where you had originally guided?","Brad Cerepak","That\u2019s right. ","Steve Tusa","Okay. One last quick question, on refrigeration and food, you got like 2.5% price, 2.4% price. Where did that come from? What drove that?","Brad Cerepak","So some of it is material surcharges, offsetting the material inflation we've seen in the first half of the year. And in fact, I think in the second half of the year, the price increases -- and the price increases are done by the way. They were done at the end of the first quarter and coming into the second quarter. I actually think the price increases we've seen in that segment negate the material inflation that you would -- that we would receive as an input cost in the second half of the year.","Steve Tusa","Is that a new mechanism for you guys?","Brad Cerepak","Some of it is also strategic pricing, Steve, but we have been very aggressive on material surcharge pricing.","Steve Tusa","Is that a new mechanism that you guys have put in place, because I recall this business was a little bit more pinched historically? So that's kind of something you guys have done as a reaction to kind of the last ten years of kind of history or whatever it is, where you know you're just kind of operating smarter?","Brad Cerepak","I'm not sure it's 10 years, but I would say the last five or six for sure. Yes. And it is new.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Mircea Dobre with Baird.","Mircea Dobre","Just wanted to ask a question on optics rather than content, so for several years no, energy was typically the first segment discussed in your slides, it was the first segment discussed in Q. Now we've seen the second move at the end and obviously performance here is quite good. So I'm just wondering as to why this change has been made, what should we interpret that as and why now?","Brad Cerepak","Well, I guess the biggest reason for that -- my answer is I was a bit bored. So for four years now, the order of the presentation has been alphabetical. I just decided to change it. Actually, we started to change it with our June investor conference and we just moved it from large to small. It's just as simple.","Mircea Dobre","Okay. All right. So I shouldn\u2019t read anything else in it?","Brad Cerepak","I'm just bored.","Mircea Dobre","Okay. And then my follow-up, maybe talking a little bit about engineered, sort of a guidance question for the second half. Performance here has been good, north of 3% organic for revenue in the front half. The bookings have grown organically double digits and yet your revenue guidance is only 3% to 4% organically for the year and the comps really aren\u2019t getting tougher. So I'm wondering if it's the same level of conservatism as to what you apply in our revenue or if there's something else I should be thinking about.","Bob Livingston","Look, I have pointed out, I guess with two segments, both refrigeration and energy that our guide for the second half could be conservative. I'd like to think on that way for the entire group of segments for Dover. Don't read anything into, don't read anything into disparities here at Engineered Systems for the second half. We've got a fairly strong third quarter planned. I think across the board, we've taken a bit of a conservative attitude towards the fourth quarter and we just have a lot of delight with what's going on in engineered systems.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","I guess I have a question about the font you used in your presentation.","Bob Livingston","I'm not going to answer that one.","Brad Cerepak","Don't imply anything by the size of the font.","John Inch","That was a cheap shot, but I couldn't resist. Okay. The performance, including restructuring this year, the $1.36 to $1.40, Brad, can you remind us how much of that you say it's including restructuring benefits, how much of the restructuring benefits again in 2017 and are there a spillover that you could quantify that go into \u201918?","Brad Cerepak","Oh gosh. Okay. But restructuring benefits, I think last time we said within that line item, the restructuring benefits would be about 46 million, which included carryover from the prior year 2016. Now given the acceleration that we're talking about with respect to the integration with DFS and other activities, we're now at about 52 million, so up 6 million of restructuring benefits. At this point, I really don't have a good number of the carry over into \u201918, but certainly we're going to continue to see the continuing impact of the integration activity where we said 35 plus million I think, we were thinking. It wants to go higher and we\u2019re not seeing a lot of that right now in 2017, because of the costs. The delta between the benefits and the cost being about 6 million, that continues to grow into those out years, so that you can count on.","John Inch","Yeah. That makes sense. Bob, what were your comments around EMV in \u201918, I missed it. You were talking about EMV picking up significantly in \u201918. What\u2019s the framework in context of that again please?","Bob Livingston","To be specific, we shared this at our June investor conference that we do expect some slowdown and softness and EMV roll-out here in the US in the second half of \u201917 and in the first half of \u201918. But we do expect that EMV activity to start to pick up in a measurable way in the second half of \u201918.","John Inch","So that makes sense. So that's just basically the anniversarying of the soft patch because of the push out in spite of the deadlines, are customers kind of giving you that feedback? I mean, obviously your primary competitor is sort of saying the big oil companies are still spending and what, I'm just trying to understand how kind of hard and fast some of these estimates sort of are, so \u2013","Bob Livingston","Yeah. I would agree with that. Our larger customers, the oil companies and some of the larger chains have continued with their EMV upgrades, especially in the first half, but those commitments were made by the customers in the October-November-December timeframe of last year and they have continued with their EMV upgrades and we still see continuing EMV upgrades in the second half. It hasn't fallen to zero. It's just not as strong as we would have expected eight months ago. But the input we're getting from customers is, they can defer it a year and many of them are deciding to do that.","John Inch","That makes sense. If we go back to earlier in the year, you were cautioning against getting too crazy in terms of us forecasting too high a variable contribution margins for energy and I think one of the commentaries was, look, we might have to put back or layer in some cost. So I guess I'm wondering is that still sort of valid, I mean, you did really great variable contribution margins this quarter and the context I'm sort of trying to understand is, as the rig counts kind of swap the baton with well completion, is there something about the mix of those activities or sort of absorbing fixed costs that naturally would cause for variable contribution kind of rates if you will to ebb against this notion of, I do actually have to hire people back because the business is just really good.","Bob Livingston","No. I understand your question. So I would tell you that we did especially in our drilling inserts business, we did see cost added in the first quarter. We saw some additional cost added in the second quarter, and in the second quarter, we did make a conscious decision that we wanted to bring our lead times and our delivery cycles back in. We divide and stretch a little bit, but we\u2019re willing to bring them back in. Within artificial lift, the bulk of the cost adds here in the first half of the year, I don't want to say all of it, but it has been primarily related and restricted to cost adds around our ESP business. In the second half of the year, as we expect well completion activity to pick up a bit, we will have to add some cost in other parts of artificial lift.","John Inch","And just last, our energy, so all this opining about divesting energy, what about the prospect of doing an energy deal or two maybe in -- maybe in the submersible pump business or something like that, is that off the table and if so why would it be?","Bob Livingston","Well, that question has been asked before and I -- my response -- my response over the last six or nine months has been, look, what we have today and especially in artificial lift and automation, it reflects the strategy that we laid out in \u201909 and \u201910 to build this upstream business and we were really focused around artificial lift. And if you look at where our spending on acquisitions has been over the last six years, Brad, over the last six years, within this segment, gosh, I think 90% of it has been in artificial lift. We actually feel we're pretty much done with larger deals in the upstream business. There is always a smaller opportunity or two that we look at. We're looking at one or two right now that would help us expand our capability, especially around technology or geo in artificial lift. But you shouldn't -- you shouldn't expect us to be spending any significant M&A dollars in our upstream energy business next quarter, the following quarter or next year.","John Inch","Yeah. Just wasn\u2019t sure if the thought had maybe changed, considering the industry has rebounded to the degree it has.","Bob Livingston","No. I think if you're going to see anything of any, I call it, reportable size within upstream, you'd see us execute on something around automation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","Yes. Back to energy and I may have missed this, but can you comment on the contribution from price across the business by drilling and production and bearings and automation.","Bob Livingston","Okay. My comment, my lead comment on price for energy for the second quarter is that it was neutral. Maybe, it was what, a positive 0.5% or something, which is called neutral. We actually do expect a little bit of a price increase activity in the second half, Deane. I would label it as very specific, very modest and most of what we're looking at right now is to offset the increased costs we're seeing on some steel input.","Deane Dray","And then when I look at the book to bill just under 1 and I'm trying to reconcile that with the comments and the nice things you're saying about bearings and compression growth in the quarter. Since that's a bit longer cycle, I would have thought you would have seen that come through in higher bookings and I know on an absolute basis, bookings were up big, but why wouldn't that have been reflected in a higher book to bill?","Bob Livingston","I just wouldn\u2019t read anything to it. I think it's just all a matter of timing. We had an outstanding quarter at bearings and compression in the second quarter. The revenue and earnings were a bit higher than we had anticipated, coming into the quarter. And it's -- that business is pretty much a book and ship business. It just doesn't carry a lot of backlog.","Operator","Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","If we could start with some of these investments, you called out engineering and corporate investments, are there an increased level of investments going on in other segments? Is this, maybe you\u2019re catching up on some stuff that you'd scaled back in the last couple of years when demand wasn't great and how you're thinking about making some of these, what I assume are more voluntary investments going forward?","Bob Livingston","No. At the segment level, I think the only significant investment that we've called out and we did that early in the year, I think on the, at our January meeting and our January call was within engineered systems and we did make a very conscious decision late last year as we come into 2017 to increase some investment spending, we call it investment spending, it's the P&L around the build out of our digital textile business and a little bit more, little bit of an increase in product development spending and innovation spending within our marketing and coating business. But if you look at the other three segments, yes, I mean we've increased spending, but it was not along the lines of warranting a call out, like we did at engineered systems. ","With respect to -- your other comment was with respect to what corporate and it is up a bit this year. We have increased our spending around IT security. We've increased some spending around IT infrastructure. And we're carrying a little bit more of expense at corporate right now with respect to helping us manage our digital rollout.","Nathan Jones","Okay. And then just in the fluids business, you\u2019ve obviously seen a big pickup in the short cycle energy business, some of your long cycle energy business that\u2019s hitting fluids, have you seen any change in trends in that business there.","Bob Livingston","So within, this is specific to pumps, correct?","Nathan Jones","Yes.","Bob Livingston","All right. Within the pumps, I would say the only thing that we've noticed in pumps with respect to our longer cycle oil and gas exposure is that we have seen throughout the year, it was more noticeable in the second quarter than it was in the first. We have seen an increase in pump activity, especially in the Permian. But that's not what was driving the 4% organic growth in the second quarter and I\u2019m sitting here today, I will tell you that's not what's driving our increased outlook for fluids in the second half of the year. It really is an increased activity in, what I would call, industrial applications and continuing increased activity in the hygienic and pharma.","Operator","At this time, we have time for one additional question. Your next question is from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","I have one question and seven follow-ups. My primary question is about the fueling and transport business. And, I know the part of the idea behind acquiring Wayne was to build your critical mass, not just in EMV, but really also away from the EMV, that portion of the business and what gets this business growing, when does that critical mass start to be brought upon the market to accelerate the growth away from EMV?","Bob Livingston","Oh, I think we're seeing it this year. As we have, I think shared at least once last year and a couple of times this year, we see the -- we see that retail -- we see that retail fueling market as a sort of -- as a baseline globally, growing something like 3% a year. And then, you have some, I call it, special cycles that you add to it, EMV being one of them. And we\u2019ll experience that in 2017. Don't lose sight of the fact, don't lose sight of the fact that within fueling and transport, which includes OPW that there's a business within OPW that provides components and hardware for the railroads. And that rail business is actually down about 20% this year. And we have been talking about that and signaling that for the past, I don't know Brad, four or five quarters, but it will continue to be down this year and it is a headwind for that fueling and transport business. The other parts of fueling and transport I think are doing quite well.","Scott Graham","My follow up is simple, the pumps business. We saw some nice organic growth in that business. Did you see anything in any specific end market that was the driver there? I know the comparison was easy, but still up 6 is up 6 and just kind of wondering what was the driver there.","Bob Livingston","Well, I\u2019ve sort of commented on that from an application point of view, it was General Industrial. It was hygienic and pharma and the only other color I would add to that, it was very broad based from a geographic expansion. We saw growth here in US, North America, Europe and China and Asia. It was quite broad based.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Stephanie. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today on the conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call.","Our first quarter results were quite solid and in line with our expectations, driven by the production and downstream markets in energy, growth in consumer electronics and the performance of our recent acquisitions. We were also pleased with the level of seasonally strong bookings as we move into the second quarter.","From a geographic point of view, our North American markets continue to be very solid, and our China markets remained positive. Our industrial markets in Europe were soft but did show signs of improvement in selected end markets as we ended the quarter. Though still modest, I am pleased our growth in the Middle East and Australia continues at a very healthy pace.","We see many positives as we start the second quarter and are excited about our prospects. The production and downstream markets within energy as well as the consumer electronics, refrigeration and food equipment and commercial aerospace markets, should all be solid as evidenced by our strong bookings. We are also quite pleased with the performance of our recent acquisitions, which helped drive acquisition growth of 6%. With respect to our Anthony acquisition, our integration and synergy plans are ahead of schedule.","We continued to execute on our previously announced share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for approximately $290 million.","Overall, I am pleased with our results. Bookings growth of 7% and a book to bill of 1.09 gives us confidence going into the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. For the year, organic growth will be driven by new OEM product releases in the consumer electronics markets, continued strength in production and downstream energy and a recovering rig count, seasonal strength in refrigeration and our expansion initiatives in fluids with a focus on plastics and chemical verticals.","Now some specific comments on our first quarter. We posted revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 4%. And our adjusted EPS of $1.10 was a 9% improvement over the prior year.","In our Energy segment, increased production activity, especially international markets, and continuing strength in downstream and retail fueling are among the trends that drove solid results. We expect the rig count to continue to improve through the year and drive a higher rate of growth in the segment.","At Communication Technologies, our consumer electronics revenue growth continues to be driven by new product launches. We expect the second quarter revenue within consumer electronics to show strong sequential growth and will accelerate in a very active second half.","Within our Engineered Systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets remained solid, and our business performance was again strong. Regarding our fluids markets, results were impacted by some customer push-outs into the second quarter, but we remain well positioned as evidenced by their 1.1 book to bill. Our industrial end markets were mixed, with good results in our global auto-related markets.","Within our Printing & Identification segment, a continued weak  European economy and a soft barcode printing business resulted in an organic revenue decline. Our fast-moving consumer goods market continues to outperform our industrial markets in all geographies. We expect our revenue to improve as new laser equipment gains traction and we execute on a customer expansion campaign.","Though we didn't close on any transactions in the first quarter, our acquisition pipeline remains active. You should expect us to continue to strengthen our company with additional deals this year. Our outlook for the year is largely unchanged from our last earnings call. We are reaffirming our previous guidance and expect to deliver full year EPS of $5.05 to $5.35.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad M. Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone.","Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Organic revenue declined 1%, while growth from acquisitions was 6%. The impact from FX was minor. Earnings per share were $1.12, a 12% improvement. Adjusting for $0.02 of discrete tax benefits, adjusted EPS was $1.10.","Segment margin for the quarter was 16.2%, down 50 basis points. This result was significantly impacted by higher costs associated with restructuring initiatives and other onetime charges. In the first quarter, these costs were more than $11 million, with roughly $7 million being incremental over the prior year period, impacting margin 30 basis points.","Bookings increased 7% over the prior year to $2.2 billion. These results represent strong 9% growth in both Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. Energy had bookings growth of 6%, while bookings declined 5% in Printing & Identification.","Overall, book to bill finished at a strong 1.09, which is in line with seasonal trends and slightly better than last year. Backlog remained steady at $1.6 billion.","In the quarter, we generated $31 million of free cash flow. The first quarter is always the slowest for cash generation due to seasonal increases in working capital and compensation-related payments. Our full year forecast for free cash flow remains unchanged at 10% of revenue. Cash flow generation continues to be a key focus area for us.","Now turning to Slide 4. Communication Technologies, driven by consumer electronics, grew 4% over the prior year. Energy's organic growth was essentially flat, although our production and downstream markets growth was strong. A decline of 1% in Printing & Identification was the result of a soft European industrial market. Lastly, Engineered Systems declined by 5% due to tough comps in refrigeration, largely reflecting the non-repeating Target business.","Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Engineered Systems increased 6%, primarily driven by acquisition revenue growth. Solid production activity, including a small acquisition, helped drive a 4% increase in Energy.","Printing & Identification decreased 6%, largely the result of normal seasonality, project affirmance and a soft European industrial market. And normal seasonality in the consumer electronics market was the primary factor for Communication Technologies' decrease of 7%.","Bookings were up 12% sequentially. We achieved growth in 3 of our 4 segments. Engineered Systems grew 20%, principally driven by its refrigeration and fluid markets. Energy grew 13%, with strong growth across all end markets, including drilling. Communication Technologies' bookings increased 4% sequentially on the strength of OEM product launches. The continued softness in the industrial markets caused Printing & Identification bookings to decline 6%.","Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $373 million, an increase of 4% from the prior year. These results reflect normal seasonality in consumer electronics. Medical technology was solid, while our aerospace\/defense and telecom\/other markets were largely stable year-over-year.","Earnings decreased 5% to $44 million, and segment margin was down 110 basis points to 11.9%. This performance largely reflects OEM customer mix within consumer electronics and approximately $7 million of incremental restructuring costs and legal expenses. The legal expense resulted in a favorable outcome to a long-running MEMS intellectual property dispute. The restructuring costs included cost reduction activities in our speaker and receiver business recently undertaken by our new management team.","Absent these charges, margins would have been 14%, an increase of 60 basis points over an adjusted prior period. We'll continue to look for additional restructuring opportunities within this segment to drive further cost reductions and integration.","Bookings were $379 million, up 9% from last year, largely reflecting normal seasonality. Book to bill finished at a solid 1.02.","Turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue of $561 million and earnings of $140 million both grew 6%. Energy produced another solid quarter as oil prices remained supportive of continued production activity and downstream markets continued to expand.  And as expected, North America rig count declined year-over-year, impacting our drilling business. Whereas our continued focus on global market expansion allow us to post another quarter of solid revenue growth in both production and downstream, we are pleased that international revenue in developing markets increased more than 50% year-over-year in the quarter.","Our operating margin of 24.9% was flat with last year and reflects strong execution and an ongoing focus on productivity. Bookings were $621 million, a 6% increase over the prior year. Book to bill was very strong at 1.11.","Moving to Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $868 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Earnings declined 4% to $117 million. Our Fluid Solutions platform grew revenue 13% to $204 million, benefiting from acquisitions completed in the prior year. Fluid Solutions' organic revenue was flat, with solid results in North America offset by continued softness in Europe and the timing of orders into the second quarter.","In Refrigeration & Industrial, revenue grew 3% to $664 million, reflecting the Anthony acquisition. Organic revenue declined 6%, largely reflecting the anticipated lower volume at Target. Operating margin was 13.5%, a 140 basis point decrease from the prior year. This decline largely reflects the impact of the Anthony acquisition. Bookings were $978 million, an increase of 9%, resulting in a seasonally strong book to bill of 1.13. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 21% to $224 million, and Refrigeration & Industrial increased 6% to $755 million. Book to bill for Fluid Solutions was 1.1 -- 1.10, while Refrigeration & Industrials was 1.14.","Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification's revenue was $238 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. Earnings increased 14% to $30 million. Our fast-moving consumer goods markets remained solid and helped to partially mitigate softness in our industrial markets, especially in Europe. Operating margin improved 180 basis points to 12.5%. The benefits of prior restructuring, continued productivity and a favorable product mix helped drive margin improvement. Bookings were $237 million, down 5% from last year, reflecting continued soft industrial markets. Book to bill ended at 1, largely consistent with last year.","Moving to Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense was essentially flat with last year at $30 million. Corporate expense decreased by $3 million year-over-year. Our tax rate was 26.1% and included discrete tax benefits of $0.02. Adjusting for these benefits, our normalized rate of 27.8% was in line with our expectations. Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter. Lastly, we repurchased 4 million shares for approximately $290 million in the quarter, all of which were repurchased under our $1 billion program. We have now repurchased $540 million in total, and we expect to complete 70% to 80% of the program in 2013.","Turning to Slide 11 and our 2013 revenue guidance. Our revenue guidance in total remains unchanged from our last call. We expect full year revenue growth of 7% to 9%. Organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5% for the full year, with a reduced estimate for our Printing & Identification segment. We now expect their organic growth to be in the range of 1% to 2%, down about 1.5 points due to lower industrial end markets. Completed acquisitions will add around 4%.","Now on Slide 12. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year EPS guidance. Again, we expect full year revenue growth of 7% to 9%. Corporate expense remains unchanged at $150 million. Interest expense will now be around $127 million, and CapEx should be about 3.4% of revenue. We expect our 2013 tax rate to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%.","Turning to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. 2012 adjusted EPS was $4.44. For the full year, our bridge remains essentially unchanged from our prior guidance. The impact of volume and mix is $0.28 to $0.46. Net productivity should add $0.12 to $0.22. We expect completed acquisitions to be $0.13 to $0.16 accretive for the year, largely driven by Anthony. Investment and compensation will have a $0.12 to $0.18 impact for the year. Corporate expense will have a $0.05 impact on higher pension expense. Lastly, our ongoing share repurchase program, coupled with the tax rate and offset in part by incremental interest expense, should have a net benefit of $0.25 to $0.30. Based on the above, earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be $5.05 to $5.35, representing 17% growth at the midpoint.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Robert A. Livingston","Thanks, Brad. As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased with our first quarter performance as we delivered solid results. We ended the quarter with a strong book to bill of 1.09, which bodes well as we begin the second quarter. Looking forward, I remain confident in the positions we hold in our key growth spaces.","For instance, the acquisition of Anthony and our leadership in the retail refrigeration market provides us with opportunities to continue the momentum we've exhibited the last several years. Leveraging our broad product offerings, leading technology and geographic reach, we expect to generate significant revenue growth.","Our close-the-case offering is gaining traction in several international markets due to retailers' concerns with higher energy costs and food safety. Of note, we booked sizable orders in Mexico, Brazil and India since the year began. We see this dynamic extending across all geographies over the course of the next 5 years.","Communication Technologies will continue to grow as consumer demand for better audio products in their mobile devices remains a driving force. One OEM has already begun ramping for a new product release. We also expect several additional new OEM product launches as the year unfolds. Many of these new launches utilize 3 microphones, and even 4 when counting the headset. This trend of more content, along with secular growth in the smartphone market, will continue to drive this segment's growth.","Global expansion opportunities in production and downstream have and will continue to fuel Energy's growth. Our global growth plans, along with the anticipated recovery in drilling, will result in solid revenue growth for the full year. Artificial lift products and services will drive over $60 million in incremental sales in Australia and the Middle East in 2013, and we continue to pursue internal initiatives and acquisitions to build upon this momentum.","And lastly, fluids will increase revenue nicely as we continue to leverage our global distribution channels and bring our leading technology to new markets and verticals, especially the plastics and chemical markets. Our recently acquired Maag business saw tremendous success in capturing customer projects in the first quarter.","In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. With that, Paul, let's take some questions.","Paul E. Goldberg","Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions] And Laurie, if you can compile the questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I guess the first question was just on...","Robert A. Livingston","Julian, this is Bob. You'll have to speak up a bit.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry about that. Is this better?","Robert A. Livingston","I can barely hear you. Okay. Go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, yes, the first question is really on the outlook for organic sales growth. Yes, it was minus 1% in Q1. I think the organic bookings growth year-on-year in Q1 was around plus 1 or plus 2. So assuming you get plus 1% or 2% core growth in Q2 to hit 3% to 5% for the full year, you've got to be doing 6% to 10% in the second half. And I just wondered, what are the 1 or 2 things that have happened the last couple of months that give you ongoing confidence in that acceleration? Or is it the case that your Q2 number, you have more of an acceleration than I think?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I think your waterfall for the year on organic growth is pretty close to what we're looking at, Julian. I guess my first comment and response would be a comment on the first quarter and our organic growth of a negative 1%. Actually, I would look or point out 3 -- make 3 specific points on the first quarter. Europe for Dover was down 2% year-over-year. That was a little weaker than we expected coming into the quarter. Our Target business at Hill PHOENIX was down year-over-year as expected, about $23 million, $24 million. That's about a 1% negative decline for all of Dover. And our drilling business in the first quarter was down 9%. As we exit the quarter, again, I commented on this, a book to bill of 1.09. Very solid, very strong as we exit the quarter. And I would also say here in the early part of the second quarter, we see some improvement in Europe. The March and April activity show this. Our second and third quarter is shaping up to be a quite strong period for Hill PHOENIX and Anthony. Our acoustics business will be up in the second quarter. Not only up sequentially, Julian, but I think if we look at it year-over-year, the acoustics business, our handset business is going to be up year-over-year mid-teens to almost 20%. And we expect some strong growth, organic growth, in the second quarter from fluids just based upon the backlog we have coming into the quarter. So we -- if I were to give you a specific response on the second quarter, we've guided for the year of organic growth of 3% to 5%. The second quarter should be right in that range, and the balance of the growth obviously is in the second half of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just my follow-up question. In the Energy business, the margin performance was very, very good in Q1. I just wondered if there was anything abnormal in terms of a mixed tailwind or something that helped you that may flip back again in Q2.","Robert A. Livingston","No. Well -- no. There wasn't anything unusual in the first quarter. But when you say the flip in Q2 or for the balance of the year, the -- I guess the variable that we are monitoring pretty closely is the rig count. And we do expect the rig count to continue to improve through the balance of the year. That will have -- that direction of change does have a little bit of bearing on the margins on Energy. But we expect a fairly solid year from Energy for 2013.","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes, I would just add the execution in energy was really very, very strong in the first...","Robert A. Livingston","Superb.","Brad M. Cerepak","In the first quarter through productivity and cost initiatives. Because as you know, the drilling business is some of our higher-margin businesses. So the mix naturally wants the mix mixed down on the margin a bit, and the team really did a great job in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Wondering if you could talk a little bit on Comm Tech, just the mix effect on margins. You mentioned some of the shifting around with OEMs and how that kind of progresses into margins throughout the year and also what the -- you talked about some sequential improvement in 2Q. There's been -- an Apple supplier last night talked about some noise around weakness into 2Q related to the supply chain. So just wondered if you could touch on those topics.","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. Well, your first question was about margins in the first quarter and the outlook for the year. We do expect margins to continue to improve at Comm Tech as the year unfolds. I would say that the second quarter activity within Comm Tech, and especially within consumer electronics, is very focused on solidifying our design wins, some new design activity and some -- a very, very strong focus on operational management to be prepared for a rather active second half of the year in consumer electronics with several new OEM product launches. Specific to the first quarter margins, Brad, you're going to have to chime in here. But our restructuring and our legal cost I think did weigh on our margins. But I think if you back that out, they were either similar to or slightly above our operating margins of last year. I actually think we had a very strong execution quarter at Comm Tech in the first quarter.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And then just quickly on fluids, you mentioned some shipments pushed to 2Q. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that and maybe some of the -- how maybe Maag is doing and how that business is growing right now.","Robert A. Livingston","I think maybe all of the push-outs we saw late in the quarter, into the second quarter, were related to Maag and some European customers. That happens. I mean, it was unfortunate, but we do see that on occasion in that business. They are pushed into the second quarter. We had very strong bookings within our fluids business, especially within pumps in the first quarter. And we're looking for a fairly solid performance from the group in the second quarter. I think their organic growth expectations in the second quarter year-over-year are mid-single digits. Maag is doing great. We've been very pleased with this acquisition. It does give us the opportunity to address some different customers and some new verticals. I've mentioned this in my prepared comments, especially chemicals and plastics. But we've been quite pleased with this acquisition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Bob, can you maybe just fill out a little more color on some of these OEM design wins you're talking about? I mean, I know they're -- it's not all reflected in your bookings in the quarter, but you sound like you have some visibility into the second half here. Can you just fill that out a little bit in terms of what you can see at this point?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, we've had a -- we've been participating in a new OEM design launch that's occurred here in the last few weeks. We are not -- if there's anything -- I don't think there's anything major or significant that we're looking at from an OEM product launch in the second quarter. The bulk of the activity for new OEM product launches is in the second half of the year and, I'd say, more specifically, the third quarter. We have some visibility to those product launches. We'll have greater visibility as we exit the second quarter. And Shannon, I would say that as we work through the second quarter, what we want to get a little bit firmer on is the exact timing of the product launches and the share content we'll have on those product launches. And then I think by the time we get through or end the second quarter, we'll have much, much better visibility on those 2 variables than we have today.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And you sound pretty pleased with the operating performance of the business in the quarter. I mean, what is that -- where does that put Sound Solutions at this point in terms of profitability and yields and what you think you have left to do there?","Robert A. Livingston","Yield improvement continued to be executed on quite well during the quarter. I'm also pleased to share with everyone that they did a great job in rebuilding a share position with several customers during the first quarter. We think that will continue during the second quarter. Revenue was slightly less than we anticipated, even with our share gains, Shannon. We did see with one specific OEM some reduced, I'll call it, production builds late in the quarter. We've got that reflected in our outlook for the second quarter. But I know I'm repeating myself. The game plan for the second quarter is truly to be prepared for a very strong acceleration in product demand from several OEMs in the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just following up on Shannon's last question on Sound Solutions, last quarter, I believe you mentioned we were expecting about $0.13 to $0.18 in incremental EPS from Sound Solutions for '13. Are we still on track?","Robert A. Livingston","Well we've taken some self-imposed headwinds on that one, Joe. We took some restructuring charges in the first quarter. We're going to take some additional restructuring charges in the second quarter. And as we get through the second quarter, we'll have an outlook for what additional cost reduction activities we'll have on the table for the second half of the year. The yield improvement, the gross margin improvement, the execution with our customers is improving. And I would say that the first quarter performance came in very, very close to our expectations.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And as you kind of progress  through the rest of the year on Sound Solutions, is the goal then to get to profitability by 3Q with some of the product launches that you're seeing in the back half of the year and exiting the year with positive operating margins?","Brad M. Cerepak","That's still the same.","Robert A. Livingston","That still the same. In fact, the more definitive plan I would tell you is exiting the year with a fourth quarter run rate of double-digit operating margins on a performance basis, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Bob, just a little bit more on Comm Tech, if you could. You used the word, \"solidify\" a couple times. Just unclear, have you actually won this new business or not and it's just a question of kind of timing of volume ramp? Or is there still...","Robert A. Livingston","Designs have been approved by the OEMs, and we have won the business. What we don't know sitting here today, Jeff, is the exact date of the OEM product launches in the third quarter. We have a pretty good idea of what our share content will be. But I think by the time we get to the end of the second quarter, we will have a definitive answer on that share content. But the design wins are bought.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And we should think of this stuff going through the Vienna plant?","Robert A. Livingston","No, it's both. Both Vienna as well as Beijing.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then just one...","Brad M. Cerepak","[indiscernible] Knowles.","Robert A. Livingston","[indiscernible] And the Knowles facility, yes.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And Knowles. Okay.","Robert A. Livingston","It's not just [indiscernible].","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And just on Anthony, the margin impact you're talking about, was that simply just mix effect? I assume it's not. I'm just -- can you just give us how much purchase accounting and other noise might have been in there?","Brad M. Cerepak","Sure. What we said was that -- if you recall, we said that Anthony would start the year -- I think we said it would be fairly neutral in the first quarter. We actually were a little bit better than that, Jeff. They were positive earnings in the quarter even after covering amortization and acquisition-related costs. So they were better than we expected, but at a low rate because it is not their most significant quarter. They build into the second and third quarter, just like Hill PHOENIX does, and we still believe we're right on track. In fact, maybe just a bit ahead on Anthony given the first quarter. But simply, the math of volume with very little accretion on the EBIT line impacts the margin mechanically.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just digging into Engineered a little bit more. So the Target had -- when you said it was around $25 million, I think, Anthony...","Brad M. Cerepak","No, I think that's $24 million.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","$24 million?","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. We'll take $24 million. And then on the Anthony deal, around $70 million in revenues for Anthony?","Brad M. Cerepak","Or lower.","Robert A. Livingston","For the first quarter? No. It was less than that. I want to say it was $60 million or low 60s.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, low 60s. Got you. So the -- x Target and x Anthony, the business was basically flattish?","Robert A. Livingston","X Target...","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","For refrigeration and food. Revenues went up $30 million.","Robert A. Livingston","No, I would -- I don't have that math. I would say...","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well revenues for refrigeration and food went up $30 million.","Robert A. Livingston","I would say they've been slightly negative in their first quarter, even pulling Target out. And when I say slightly negative, excluding Target, it may have been -- revenue at Hill PHOENIX may have been down less than $10 million -- maybe $10 million. Maybe at [indiscernible] in the first quarter. But I would label that as timing.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's just timing. So what -- I recall in the third quarter, 10-Q from last year, you guys still talked about remodels from retailers. I don't know if that was Walmart or Target. When does the -- just remind us when the Target comp rolls off.","Robert A. Livingston","The Target comp rolls off -- so last year, we had a very strong first half of 2012. But I think the delta on the first half, Steve, on Target, first half of '13 versus first half of '12 with respect to Target, it's down about $45 million.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So it gets much better in the third and the fourth quarter. So that's a part of that kind of a...","Robert A. Livingston","I would tell you right now, because we -- we don't make the decisions, the customer does. But our planning right now would be that our activity in the second half of the year with Target would be about flat with the second half of last year.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one just quick question. Your commercial paper went from like minimal to $600 million at the end of the year, and then it went up another $100 million in the quarter. I assume that's just timing because of your free cash flow. How should we expect that balance to kind of move throughout the course of the year?","Brad M. Cerepak","I would expect to see as we pace through the year, as our cash flow improves -- the first quarter is our lowest because we're building inventory for the cycle on Hill PHOENIX and Anthony -- that we will continue to see that commercial paper come down. The increase in the commercial paper in the quarter though, is directly related to us executing on our buyback.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last -- one really quick one. What were the Sound Solutions revs in the quarter? Was it around $65 million? Is that right?","Robert A. Livingston","No. I don't -- $5 million, $7 million higher than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just going back to the organic growth cadence, just want to clarify. Did you endorse the 1% to 2% range for second quarter?","Robert A. Livingston","I -- repeat that, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So you gave some color on organic growth in 2Q in second half. Did you endorse that range, 1% to 2%?","Brad M. Cerepak","For the second quarter? No. I think what Bob said was we have an expectation of 3% to 5% organic for the year. Well we don't give guidance in the second quarter. Given the strong book to bill, you look back a year coming off of first quarter book to bill of 1.09, we should be with -- well within that range for the second quarter of the full year range. I know that sounds convoluted, but we're going to see growth in the second quarter higher than that 1% to 2%.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. No, I was just clarifying because I'm getting 3% to 4%. So actually, that makes sense.","Robert A. Livingston","I happen to like your number, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's good. And then on the EPS phasing, you gave some color on 1Q. And 2Q, you normally make somewhere between 26% to 27% of full year. Do you still think you'll be in that range for 2Q?","Robert A. Livingston","I don't have that waterfall with me.","Brad M. Cerepak","I'm going to say we're not going to really comment on that. We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. I give you the top and I give you the bottom, and then we're in quarterly guidance mode. So I think you can look at our history, and we gave some color on the first quarter because it was a little bit different given the seasonality we were seeing on our business and the impact of Target and rigs. But beyond that, we're not really going to provide that kind of color going forward.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, that's fair enough. And then just taking a step back, since the last earnings call in January, what are you -- what are the puts and takes in terms of your framework? I mean, obviously, you've taken down PID by about 1 point or so. It sounds like Europe came in weaker, but seems to turned the corner a little bit. But versus your expectations and then in light of the strong book to bill, what's changed since January?","Robert A. Livingston","Well your comment on Europe would be the -- probably my headline comment. It was a little bit weaker in the first quarter than we anticipated. We have, I would say, lowered our expectations very, very modestly for Europe for the year, and that's probably it, Nigel. I will tell you that as we go through the second quarter, and I've already commented on one of these points, that as we go through the second quarter and end the second quarter, what we're going to be watching very carefully is going to be the launch dates within Consumer Electronics, the new products from the OEMs, and to see how the rig count is developing for the U.S. market in the second half of the year. We still believe that the rig count will continue to improve throughout the year, and we've seen some signs of that \u2013 some positive signs of that here in April. But those are going to be \u2013 from my perspective, those are the 2 key variables that we're watching for the second half, and I actually feel pretty good with our setup right now for the second quarter.","Brad M. Cerepak","Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Bob, is that I agree with the European comment being a little bit softer than maybe coming into the year. But what we're seeing in terms of the international growth on our Energy business is higher than we had expected. Now we don't see it in the changing of our guide range for the top line growth, but I would tell you we're very encouraged by that number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady of BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just want to -- back on the question of the rig counts, I think last quarter, you had said you expected drilling to be -- in '13 to be flat with '12, assuming about a 3% decline in rig counts. Is that still your expectation?","Robert A. Livingston","I do believe that was the expectation that we shared with you on the January call, was rig count down year-over-year. I'm talking averages now, about 3%. I haven't done the math, but I would say it's still about that same number, maybe even 1 point weaker, Charlie, with -- in our outlook. Now it is interesting to note that we -- in our outlook, we have an average -- and I'm talking the U.S. market now, not North America -- we have an average for the U.S. market in the second quarter to be very precise, 1,742 units. I mean, that's how we rolled it up. Here in mid-April, the latest data point I've seen is rig count deployment in the U.S. market right now is at 1,771 units.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. Okay. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up on Comm Tech, your commentary on preparing in 2Q for a very active second half, can you just help me understand when you're saying preparing it? Should I assume additional cost inputs in that? Or am I looking at that the wrong way?","Robert A. Livingston","No, I think if you look at any incremental cost inputs in the second quarter, it will be related to additional restructuring and some integration activities that we want to undertake in the second quarter. When I say preparing for the second half, the second half is a big period. It's going to be a significant growth period for Comm Tech, especially in Consumer Electronics. I think I mentioned earlier that, we see growth in the second quarter in our Consumer Electronics business of mid-teens, maybe almost 20%. The growth in the second half of the year is even more significant. I don't -- I can't tell you an exact number, but I would tell you that the revenue split between first half and second half in our Comm Tech business is probably very close to 45 in the first half and 55 in the second half, and that sort of underscores my earlier comment about getting prepared for some accelerated activity in the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to go back to your commentary on product ID, just if you could flesh that out. You said a softer barcode market is -- but you also mentioned a new laser technology coming online. So how much of this is lower volume? And is there any share loss implicit in this guidance?","Robert A. Livingston","Okay. Well, you're -- you had 2 different companies here. On the barcode business, I would tell you that the disappointment in the first quarter was all around some large projects that have been deferred either into the second or the third quarter, one of which we've actually booked the order on here in April. So we've captured that. With respect to our largest business in this segment, Markem-Imaje, the softness was in Europe. In fact, the -- goodness, North America Markem-Imaje had low- to mid-single-digit growth. Latin America was probably I think 6% or 7% growth. We have 6% growth in China. And Europe, I think Markem-Imaje was down 3% or 4%.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then a separate topic, Bob. I was hoping you could comment on the implications of GE's acquisition in artificial lifts. Obviously, it validates the attractiveness of the space, but now you've got a bigger competitor, bigger capitalization, you'll likely see more pressure as they try to consolidate this space. How does this impact your outlook for the business near term, longer term?","Robert A. Livingston","Near term, we don't see an impact on our business near term. I do agree with your comment that it does validate the value of our business and why this business is important to Dover. Longer term, we'll see how that plays out. We think we've got a very, very strong position. At the end of the day, the customers make the decision based upon the best product and the best service and the best technology, and we like our position.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Will it be harder to do M&A in this space?","Robert A. Livingston","No. In fact, I would tell you that -- oh gosh, I don't know the count, but I commented earlier about our acquisition pipeline. I'm not sure how many deals we have that we're actually pursuing right now. But most of them, if not all of them, are within either refrigeration or fluids or the energy space. And in the energy space, we are looking at some very attractive add-ons and -- that can be bolted into existing businesses in production, as well as downstream. And I happen to like the -- I think the pricing is attractive as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The execution of the rest of the buyback, I'm trying to remember, have you guys said that this would be prospectively contingent on receiving proceeds from electronic as test and assembly or right about -- that'd just go ahead regardless of that?","Brad M. Cerepak","No, we didn't say it was contingent on that. Obviously, that process is continuing. We are on track where we want to be, and I'd say we continue -- we will continue to execute on that buyback.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the sale of [indiscernible], is that a '13 event most likely based on everything you know?","Robert A. Livingston","On the electronic assembly?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","Robert A. Livingston","Yes. Brad said we're well on track. We're on process, and I would expect a transaction on these businesses in the third quarter.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","We shift gears to sort of your outlook for pricing. I think in the Q, you called out customer mix on the Comm Tech side, a little bit of a reference back to, I suppose, GE and Lufkin and pricing. I mean, how are you guys thinking about pricing? You're getting all this new business but -- with respect to new handset platforms and so forth. But how are you seeing this sort of evolve, right? Because there's obviously a degree of observation that the OEs on the handset market are going to have to introduce significantly lower priced point product. I mean, how do you dovetail it all, Bob?","Robert A. Livingston","Yes. I wouldn't agree with that comment, John. Gosh, last year -- let me start by giving a comment on 2012. That's easy to do because it's history. But for 2012, I would say that ASP decline was very, very low single-digit percentage. And when I say low, I think it was less than 3%, John. Now that's for the business. On any individual customer, it's going to be a different product and a different price point based upon the age of the product or the age of the design and the performance specs by the OEM. I would say that's -- we don't see any change in 2013. In any given quarter, we can see some noise around customer mix simply because of that. The difference between product performance specs and the design that we're delivering can carry different price points.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So all else equal, don't you think the...","Robert A. Livingston","The ASP decline last year was extremely modest.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I know it was. Basically, ASP, you think, is in the zone for the foreseeable future? That's what you think?","Robert A. Livingston","Yes.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And consequently, margins probably hold, particularly if you have done Sound Solution restructuring and you've got this new volume business coming through. Is that fair?","Robert A. Livingston","We expect margins to improve, not just hold. We expect margins to improve in this segment as the year unfolds.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Sorry, I meant at least hold. Okay, got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question. You commented on China that China was solid in the quarter. How did it progress throughout the quarter, and what was the trend post the Chinese New Year, if you can comment on that?","Robert A. Livingston","Yes. Well, the Chinese New Year in the first quarter was in February. And whenever \u2013 whatever month that falls into happens to be the weakest month we're going to see in China for that quarter. And the first quarter was no different. So I would say we had 2 strong shoulders in the quarter, January and March, and with February being down a bit. We did like the activity \u2013 the level of activity we were seeing as we exited the quarter, but we were rather pleased with not just our overall Dover performance in China for the quarter but -- goodness, you could list the long list of our operations, our businesses that operate in China, and I think all of them had growth in their first quarter, with the exception of one and it's a project business. It's going to be up and down throughout the year, but even that business is expecting growth in China for 2013.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just looking at order dynamic in Energy, how do you guys -- talking to your customers, how do they balance the view with nat gas now back north of $4 but then WTI is falling? How do you internally balance the view, and how do your customers balance the view?","Robert A. Livingston","Well, I -- we're not quite that privy to all of the internal debates and decisions that our customers make. We do see the outcome of those decisions. It is interesting to note that even with the rig count decline we've experienced over the past year -- and let's see, I think in the first quarter, rig count in the U.S. was down 12% versus the first quarter of '12. What's interesting to note is that in the rigs that are being deployed for the drilling of oil, that rig count is actually up 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. Now that goes -- that's a little bit of a data point that sort of speaks to your question, and I -- there is a lot of speculation that as the rig count increases here in the U.S. in the balance of the year, that we'll see some additional rigs being deployed for gas drilling.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mig Dobre of Robert W. Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple quick ones, first is on the overall bookings. Can you tell us exactly how much of the growth was contributed by the recent acquisitions?","Robert A. Livingston","Oh, my goodness. I'm not sure I have that data point. Brad?","Brad M. Cerepak","Well, I would just -- I don't have the data point either, but I would say it's a very small number in that bookings because the acquisitions were, other than Anthony, were pretty small. And Anthony is more of a book and shift business, so there's not much of a build in the backlog around the bookings for Anthony.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, I see. And then sort of sticking with Anthony there, can you comment a little bit on the seasonality of this business? From what I understood, you're expecting a nice uptick in second and third quarter. I wonder, normally, what do these 2 quarters account for when it comes to the total year's revenue? And maybe also, talk a little bit as to how you've seen order progress through the quarters -- through the quarter for Anthony.","Robert A. Livingston","No, I'm not sure I can share with you, simply because I don't have the detail on how the orders progress during the quarter with Anthony. My guess would be they were fairly stable or fairly linear. Your question of how much of the revenue would occur in the second and the third quarter, and it's going to look very similar to what we have shared with you over the years with respect to Hill PHOENIX, and I would say it's 60% to 65% of the annual revenue is going to fall in the second and third quarter.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul E. Goldberg","Thanks, Laurie. This concludes our conference call, and we'd like to thank you as always for your continued interest in Dover. And we absolutely look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good day.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time.  Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Goldberg.  Mr. Goldberg, please go ahead, sir.","Paul Goldberg","Thank you, Paula.  Good morning and welcome to Dover\u2019s third quarter earnings call.  Today\u2019s call will begin with comments from Bob and Brad on Dover\u2019s third quarter operating and financial performance and follow with our outlook for the remainder of the year.  We will then open the call up for questions.  As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up.","Please note that our current earnings release, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website, www.dovercorporation.com.

We would also direct your attention to our website where considerably more information can be found.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Bob.","Robert Livingston","Thanks, Paul.  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call.  Before I get to our third quarter results, I\u2019d like to share a few observations on the macro environment during the quarter.  During our last quarterly call, we discussed the significant decline we had experienced in Europe and moderating activity in China.  We also saw North American markets as mostly stable.  Ninety days later, I would say these trends are generally continuing.  Europe has remained at a low level, though the weakness is broader-based than last quarter.  China has weakened, especially with respect to the electronics markets.  The bright spot this quarter again was U.S. industrial activity.  In summary, these conditions result in moderately slower global growth rates as we enter the fourth quarter.","Now some comments on our third quarter results.  We posted revenue of 2.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%.  Our third quarter EPS of $1.32 was an 11% improvement over the prior year, largely driven by strong leverage on volume.  In our energy segment, expanding production activity and strong downstream investments in distribution and retail fueling are among the trends that drove excellent business results in the quarter.  Our drilling results were impacted by the lower year-over-year North American rig count, though rig count did increase sequentially.  Overall, energy\u2019s performance was characterized by continuing growth and strong margins.  We expect these trends to continue in the fourth quarter.","At our communication technology segment, several handset OEMs launched new products towards the end of the quarter, which drove solid sequential results.  Our MEMS activity was very strong, reflecting the breadth of our OEM coverage and the benefits of multiple design wins.  The challenges at Sound Solutions led to lower revenue than expected.  This along with normal seasonality in the handset market will continue to impact results through year-end.  While I was disappointed with our performance at Sound Solutions, we continued to work through significant business transitions and are making substantial progress.  I firmly believe we will make further progress in this important business in the coming months.","Within our engineered systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets remain quite solid and our business performance was strong.  Regarding our fluids platform, markets remain much the same as last quarter, highlighted by the excellent results of recent acquisitions.  We expect the segment\u2019s fourth quarter results to reflect the normal seasonality of our refrigeration markets and slightly moderating macro growth trends.","Within our printing and identification segment, strong organic growth in our fast-moving consumer goods market, along with the benefits of our second quarter restructuring, helped drive solid margin performance.  The China electronics equipment market weakened through the quarter and was below our prior expectations.  We believe this trend will continue and now project this segment\u2019s performance to be lower in the fourth quarter.  Overall, the strong market positions of our businesses and productivity initiatives enabled us to deliver third quarter segment margin of 18%.  ","During the quarter, our acquisition pipeline developed nicely and we have several deals that have matured and are actionable.  I remain bullish on our five growth spaces and am enthusiastic with the strategic add-ons in our pipeline.","In summary, the majority of our businesses performed very well.  I am quite pleased with our third quarter results and the responsiveness of our businesses.  As we enter the fourth quarter, the softening global economy, especially impacting electronics, and lower volumes at Sound Solutions result in an outlook that is less than we expected at the beginning of the third quarter.  We remain focused on our growth initiatives and investments, select restructuring activities, and the pursuit of strategic acquisition opportunities, all of which will help deliver further earnings gains in 2013.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob.  Good morning everyone.  Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck.  Today we reported third quarter revenue of 2.2 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year.  This was comprised of 1% organic growth, 4% from acquisitions, and an unfavorable impact of 2% from foreign exchange.  EPS was $1.32, which included a small benefit from discrete tax matters settled during the quarter.  After adjusting for minor tax benefits realized in the third quarter of both periods, EPS improved 10% over the prior year.  ","Segment margin for the quarter was 18%, an increase of 100 basis points.  This result reflects solid performance in all segments and the absence of one-time acquisition-related costs incurred in the third quarter of last year.  Bookings increased 1% over the prior year to 2.1 billion.  These results represent solid 6% growth in energy and modest increases in both communication technologies and engineered systems.  In printing and identification, bookings decreased 10% as further weakness in electronics markets impacted the segment.  Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.94, in line with normal seasonality.  Backlog grew 6% to 1.5 billion.  ","In the third quarter, we generated 230 million of free cash flow, or 10% of revenue.  We expect free cash flow for the year to be roughly 10% of revenue.  ","Now turning to Slide 4 and our revenue growth.  Organic growth remained solid at engineered systems and energy, achieving 4% and 3% respectively in the quarter, reflecting strong performance in the food equipment production and downstream markets.  Communication technologies\u2019 organic revenue declined 1% while printing and identification decreased 6%.  For the quarter, acquisition growth was strong at energy and engineered systems as they both posted 8% and 7% growth respectively.","Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results, revenue increased 2% from the second quarter with three of our four segments showing sequential growth.  Communication technologies increased 10% primarily driven by the handset market.  Energy increased 4% led by the production in downstream markets.  Engineered systems showed modest sequential growth of 1%.  Printing and identification declined 3%.  Bookings decreased 3% sequentially from the second quarter, in line with historical trends.  Growth of 8% in communication technologies was led by the handset and aerospace markets.  Engineered systems bookings declined 8% sequentially, largely reflecting the normal seasonality of our refrigeration markets.  The sequential bookings decline of 4% in printing and identification was primarily driven by continued weakness in the electronics markets.  Energy bookings declined 1%.","Now on Slide 6, communication technologies posted revenue of 396 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior year.  These results reflect modest revenue declines in all end markets, with the exception of aerospace industrial.  Within the handset market, very strong MEMS activity was offset by lower volume at Sound Solutions.  Earnings increased 19% to 64 million and segment margin improved 290 basis points to 16.1%.  This performance reflects strong leverage on MEMS volume, weaker results at Sound Solutions, and the absence of one-time costs associated with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of last year.  We expect segment revenue and margin to moderate sequentially in the fourth quarter on anticipated lower volumes, primarily due to seasonality and mix.  Bookings were 412 million, essentially flat with last year.  Book-to-bill finished at 1.04.","Turning to Slide 7, energy revenue increased 10% to 562 million while earnings increased 11% to 139 million.  Energy produced another solid quarter as oil prices remained supportive of continued production activity and downstream markets remained strong.  Rig count declined year-over-year, impacting our drilling business.  Our focus on international growth coupled with the diversity of our end markets allowed us to post another quarter of strong revenue growth in both production and downstream.  Operating margin was 24.7%, a 20 basis point improvement.  Bookings were 527 million, a 6% increase over the prior year.  Book-to-bill was 0.94.  ","Now on Slide 8, at engineered systems sales were 892 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year.  Earnings improved 15% to 144 million.  Fluid solutions revenue grew 26% to 218 million, benefiting from recent acquisition.  Fluid solutions organic revenue was flat with solid results in North America and Asia offset by a weak Europe.  Refrigeration industrial grew 5% organically to 674 million.  Revenue gains were broad-based with Hill Phoenix posting a quarterly record for revenue.  Operating margin was 16.2%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year.  This was primarily driven by solid operating performance and our focus on cost improvements.  Bookings were 798 million, an increase of 3% resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.89.  Our fluid solutions platform bookings increased 13% to 198 million.  Refrigeration industrial was essentially flat with last year at 600 million.  Book-to-bill for fluid solutions was 0.91 while refrigeration industrials was 0.89.  The segment book-to-bill principally reflects the normal seasonality of the refrigeration market and softer European and Asian markets.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9.  Printing and identification revenue was 358 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year.  Earnings decreased 14% to 51 million.  Gains in our consumer goods markets helped to partially mitigate the continued softness in our electronics markets as well as unfavorable foreign exchange.  Our electronics markets were down over 30 million year-over-year.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth in the fast-moving consumer goods end market was 6%.  Operating margin declined 40 basis points to 14.4%.  The benefits of prior restructuring and continued cost improvements largely offset significantly lower volume in electronics.  Looking forward, we do not see a near-term recovery in the electronics markets.  Bookings were 343 million, a decrease of 10% from last year.  In the consumer goods and industrial markets, bookings increased 1%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.  Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.  ","Moving to Slide 10, third quarter net interest expense was generally in line with expectations.  Corporate expense decreased by 2 million year-over-year.  Our third quarter tax rate was 27.9%.  This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast and largely impacted by mix of geographic earnings.  This rate also included a $0.02 benefit from the resolution of discrete tax matters.  Our CAPEX spend for the quarter was 69 million and we repurchased 4.3 million shares since our last call.","Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance.  We now expect full-year revenue growth of around 7%.  Organic growth is estimated to be about 3%, including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange.  Completed acquisitions will add around 4%.  Breaking down revenue growth by segment, we expect communication technologies growth to be around 11% for the year, about seven percentage points lower than our last guidance.  The main drivers of this change are OEM launch delays and lower volumes at Sound Solutions.  Energy growth is expected to be approximately 16%, largely unchanged from our prior forecast.  Engineered systems is forecasted to grow around 9%, again in line with our prior expectations.  Lastly, within printing and identification a weakening electronics market is driving our revenue forecast down one percentage point.  We now expect revenue to decline around 9% for the year, inclusive of a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.","Now on Slide 12, which shows our full-year guidance.  As previously mentioned, we now expect revenue growth to be around 7%.  Corporate expense decreased slightly while interest expense and CAPEX remained substantially unchanged.  We now expect our 2012 tax rate to be 27.9%, reflecting changes in the mix of geographic earnings.  Based on the above, we expect our full-year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.55 to $4.65.","Now let\u2019s go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13.  As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of discrete tax benefits.  Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.24 to $0.30 for the full year, down about $0.06 from our last forecast.  Net productivity will add $0.20 to $0.24.  Investment and compensation is now about $0.05, a $0.06 adjustment from our last forecast.  We expect completed acquisitions to be about $0.14 dilutive for the year, down from our prior forecast.  This revision largely reflects the impact of Sound Solutions.","On a net basis, the impact of corporate expense, interest expense, share count and our tax rate is largely unchanged from our prior forecast.  The net result is full-year EPS of $4.55 to $4.65.  ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments.","Robert Livingston","Thanks, Brad.  As I mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance.  We delivered strong earnings growth in a tough environment.  This is a testament to the strength of our businesses and the responsiveness of our leadership teams across the company.  ","As Brad just mentioned, our fourth quarter outlook has been reduced.  I expect a few of our highlights for the quarter to be further progress at Sound Solutions, continuing strong gains in our MEMS business, continued strength in energy, and a continuation of our focus on cost reduction via select restructuring activities.  Our reduced guidance does not change my conviction on the long-term growth opportunities before us.","Looking ahead to 2013, I remain confident in the positions we hold in our five key growth spaces.  Our focus in energy, fluids, refrigeration and food equipment, product identification and communication components offer us substantial growth opportunities.  I look forward to sharing specific details regarding 2013 at our investor day conference in New York on December 10.","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their hard work and dedication.  Their focus on serving customers and achieving results will continue to drive Dover\u2019s success.","With that, Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Bob.  At this point, I\u2019d like to remind the callers that we would kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up so we can get more callers on the call.  Paula, can we have our first question, please?","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Good morning, guys.  So Bob, we\u2019ll start with \u2013 surprise! \u2013 Sound Solutions.  Can you explain\u2014you know, take another crack maybe in a little more detail.  You\u2019ve got the Vienna facility at Sound Solutions that\u2019s very good at high throughput automation.  You\u2019ve got Knowles people who know how to do high-flex automation very successfully, and I know it\u2019s slightly different what you\u2019re trying at Beijing Sound Solutions, but can you explain in a little more detail why you think you\u2019ve had such trouble with that and why you can\u2019t better leverage the knowledge base of those other parts of the company to get the yields up.","Robert Livingston","Okay, wow \u2013 that\u2019s about four questions, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Well, it\u2019s all one topic.","Robert Livingston","All right.  So let me back up to about 15 months ago and just highlight what I would label as the three primary objectives we had as we entered the third quarter right after the acquisition of Sound Solutions.  We knew we were dealing with the significant change in the marketplace with Nokia and a couple of other OEMs, but objective number one was aggressively pursued design wins with new OEMs.  I would say objective number two sort of goes to the heart of your question, which was a significant manufacturing transition in the Beijing operation with a focus on the high-flex automation.  And the third objective would be to work the new designs quickly to drive yield improvements and volume.  ","Shannon, the execution on all three of these objectives has been slower than I expected, slower than we expected, and it has been disappointing.  Your question about the capability we have both in Vienna as well as the Knowles team is true.  In fact, as we exited the second quarter, early part of the third quarter, we did start to make some management transitions in Beijing; in fact, the general manager of Beijing now, the operations manager, I think the quality manager and probably about five other key leadership positions have been changed since the end of the second quarter with Knowles China personnel taking over responsibility for these positions.","So now let\u2019s comment on the third quarter.  I think we\u2019ve learned a lot in the first six months of this year.  I think those learnings, along with the management transitions that we started to make at the end of the second quarter and into the early part of the third quarter, we have seen some progress.  On the high-flex lines, we like what we have and we feel we made the right decision.  We\u2019ve had lots of learning between Line 1 and where we are today, but I would also label that this high-flex automation objective as no longer a challenge.  Our yields continue to improve.  We had significant during the third quarter, more in the latter part of the third quarter than we did in the early part, and we will continue to make more progress in the fourth quarter.  The volume has been lower than expected, but I also expect it to continue to increase.","Shannon, I\u2019d share one further comment, and it has less to do about performance and more to do with sort of the outlook for this business.  As focused as we have been in the last six months on bringing up the high-flex automation and improving our yields, we are already working on several new designs for 2013 OEM product launches; and actually, a couple of the key designs are actually scheduled for first quarter qualification tests, and we\u2019re on schedule.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful.  Thanks.  And then just one more from me, just on balance sheet \u2013 I mean, nice to see a little over 4 million of share repurchase in the quarter.  It sounds like you\u2019re also feeling good about the acquisition pipeline.  You have the free cash flow on the balance sheet to kind of do them both.  How are you thinking about those into the end of the year and next year?","Robert Livingston","I\u2019ll take that question.  Again, I think at the price and the multiple on our stock right now, we find it very attractive; and therefore in the quarter, we did go ahead, as we\u2019ve been saying, and buyback ahead of dilution more so than we did even last year.  That\u2019s obvious at 4.3 million shares purchased.  I would say we continue to make an assessment of what\u2019s in our deal pipeline all the time and the price of our stock.  At this time, though, I would say we would expect to continue with some modest share repurchases into the fourth quarter.  We like what we\u2019ve done in the second quarter and I think we\u2019ll continue to do that.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay, thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady at BMO Capital.","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital","Hi, thanks.  Good morning guys.  Just to go back to Sound Solutions for a minute, and I guess specifically on the OEM launch and some of the yields on some of the products going into that.  I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense of\u2014I know you\u2019re not giving 2013 guidance, but at what point does that problem linger into 2013?  I mean, at what point are you anticipating the yields getting up to a level that the product is acceptable to the customer and you can start shipping that product into that OEM?","Robert Livingston","We are there now, Charlie.  The yields on the new designs that we\u2019ve been focused on bringing into production and the ramp over the last three or four months are being delivered to the customer.  The customer is accepting them and is pleased with the yields, though I would also tell you we have further room for improvement on the yields.","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital","Okay, that\u2019s great.  That\u2019s helpful, thanks.  And just quickly on the energy business, on the bookings, can you kind of break it down by the three end markets?  I\u2019m assuming that the bookings on the drilling were not as strong, but maybe just give a sense of the three end markets there.","Robert Livingston","No, I actually don\u2019t have the bookings data here for recall, Charlie.  I think you go back to the comments that Brad share with you and his comments on the three sectors with respect to revenue.  My guess is that the bookings followed pretty closely to the revenue pattern.  We didn\u2019t have a lot of distortion in book-to-bill between the three sectors.  ","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital","","That\u2019s helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical","Thank you.  Good morning everyone.  Hey Bob, just to follow up on that last point \u2013 so yields are now acceptable on speakers and receivers, and you\u2019re shipping into the new customer.  Is that something that happened in the quarter?  Is that an October event?","Robert Livingston","No, let\u2019s see.  Part of the product activity would have\u2014I\u2019m going to say late August.  Late August, we had product going into the customer\u2019s, I call it hub, late August.  Everything that we have been able to manufacture, in other words full capacity, what we\u2019ve been able to manufacture and ship into the hub since the end of August on speakers has been pulled and placed into product.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical","But not receivers?","Robert Livingston","Pardon?","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical","But not receivers?","Robert Livingston","On receivers, we\u2019re probably 30 days beyond that.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical","But you\u2019re now shipping?","Robert Livingston","We\u2019re now shipping.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical","So just thinking, then, about the guide reduction, the guide reduction is no longer about your inability to deliver, I presume.  It\u2019s solely on OE volumes, or do you think your share was somewhat impaired for a while because of the initial disruptions with the business?","Robert Livingston","Okay, so let me\u2014in case there maybe a misconception here.  On our guidance down, Jeff, we\u2019re actually\u2014included in our guidance, we actually have a modest revenue increase in the fourth quarter for Sound Solutions sequentially.  ","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical","You do?  Okay.","Robert Livingston","So it\u2019s not a decline.  We\u2019ve got a modest increase in revenue in the fourth quarter, and an increase in operating earnings.  More importantly, I would say less of a loss, okay?  The concern we have in this handset business for the fourth quarter is that December is always such a wildcard.  We truly do not have visibility into the month of December on what\u2014we know what the production forecast looks like right now.  Our experience has been that December can have some wild movements.  ","Brad Cerepak","I would just add the sequential growth that we originally talked about in the last call\u2014","Robert Livingston","This is modest.","Brad Cerepak","This is modest now.  This is, you know, mid-single digits growth sequentially.  And again, I would say where we were 90 days ago as to where we are today, we are shipping, as Bob has indicated.  We are booking revenue, and we have line of sight now on where we are in Sound Solutions.  But a lot of room for improvement.","Robert Livingston","","Yeah, still a lot of room for improvement, but if I could add any color to that with respect to, I\u2019ll label it as risk assessment, I actually\u2014when we look at what we have in our guidance for Sound Solutions and the fourth quarter, sitting here now I would tell you that there is\u2014we feel there is very, very little downside.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical","I\u2019ll call it a second and a half question \u2013 I\u2019m sorry \u2013 as a follow-up.  You did speak to kind of the improvements late in the quarter.  Just to your very point you made there, Bob, is there something kind of in the monthly book-to-bills or something that can give us a little more comfort on that, to the extent that you can share any additional color?  And I\u2019ll move on, thanks.","Robert Livingston","I don\u2019t have monthly book-to-bills.  I\u2019m not sure I could share anything else on the order rates.  We did have a positive book-to-bill for Sound Solutions in the third quarter.  That would be expected, and I would label it as normal.  As I said, we are shipping what we can produce, and the customer is pulling it from the hub and it\u2019s going into product.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from John (Inaudible) of Deutsche Bank.","John \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Morning everyone.  I want to ask Brad about the guide on the acquisition line.  So the minus $0.14, it was $0.03 to $0.05.  So I think this is sort of a down 40 to 50 million of OP if you just run the basic math.  Bob, I think you had commented before that Sound Solutions had lost maybe 12 to 16 million pre-tax in the first half.  If it\u2019s actually sequentially getting better, it doesn\u2019t seem to bridge the down $0.14.  And I appreciate your comments around December; I\u2019m just trying to understand.  Brad, you implied the bulk of that was Sound Solutions.  What am I missing?  How do you get to the down $0.14?","Brad Cerepak","Okay, no I think\u2014it is, the bulk of it is Sound Solutions.  It has a lot to do with this change in the revenue line.  You\u2019ll recall coming out of the second quarter, we were looking at sequential growth at Sound Solutions of between 20 and 25%.  Our sequential growth going out of the second quarter into the third on Sound Solutions was very modest at around 6%.  We see modest again into the fourth quarter.  That volume reduction is very, very significant, especially with respect to the cost structure of Sound Solutions.  They incrementally convert very, very high on the upside and likewise on the downside, and so that impact is entirely related to our expectations going out of the second\u2014in the second quarter, what we expected in the second half for Sound Solutions.","John \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So there\u2019s a\u2014I think I get it.  It\u2019s high fixed cost.  So if the trajectory based on what you are describing holds, and I kind of get the sense that Sound Solutions\u2019 progression will be sort of linear, right?  It\u2019s going to progressively continue to improve.  What kind of a run rate does this imply in terms of revenue and contribution on profits for 2013?  And you don\u2019t have to be specific, but just in general what kind of a trajectory?","Robert Livingston","","Well, it will continue to improve, John.  Our operating results and including in our top end guidance at the high end of the range for Sound Solutions in the fourth quarter is essentially break-even.","John \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.  So post-that, that means Sound Solutions makes money each of the following four quarters.  That would be your expectation?","Robert Livingston","That would be our expectation.","John \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And just lastly, you guys commendably repurchased your shares.  Is sort of a 2% net reduction kind of a decent placeholder to think about throughout next year, recognizing that there is some dilutionary impact and obviously you want to opportunistic with M&A.  But is that your thinking at this point, or is it just more of a\u2014you just want to be a little bit more opportunistic this quarter based on, who knows, cash flow timing or something else.","Robert Livingston","You\u2019re asking about \u201913, our thoughts on \u201913?","John \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah.","Robert Livingston","I would look back to what we did in \u201911 to be maybe as a baseline for \u201913, which means we would continue to stay above dilution.  I think we were a little over 2 million shares in \u201911 above dilution.  I think that would be a best guess at this point.","John \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Kind of 2%, then?","Brad Cerepak","One to two.","John \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, one to two.  Okay.  Thanks guys.  Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Hi, good morning guys.  This is the first time in a couple quarters you really talked about M&A picking up, and I guess things have been kind of shut down since Sound Solutions.  Is there a sense of the size range and the type of deals that you\u2019re looking at, meaning are we focused mostly on kind of non-com tech stuff, or is there a continued build-out of your technology capabilities?  I mean, just give us a little bit of sense.  Obviously I know you can\u2019t name names, but give us a sense of the type of stuff you\u2019re looking at.","Robert Livingston","Well, I\u2019m not going to name names, but let me correct a misstatement.  You say we\u2019ve been shut down since Sound Solutions.  That\u2019s not true.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Well, you\u2019ve been quiet, more quiet.","Robert Livingston","Since Sound Solutions, I don\u2019t know what the spend has been, but it\u2019s probably 600 million.","Brad Cerepak","Five, 600 million.","Robert Livingston","Yeah, 500, 600 million, and with the two largest ones being Maag Pump that we closed on in March, and PCS that we closed on in April, and I guess Oil Lift was, what, last November or December \u2013 something like that, Paul?  But to bring the comment forward, the profile of the properties, the businesses that are in the pipeline today, none are as large as Sound Solutions.  The bulk of them would probably be in the 50 to $150 million range on evaluation, and let\u2019s see \u2013 I\u2019m doing a quick sort of nose count here as we go through this.  None of them are in communication technologies.  We\u2019ve got a couple of smaller ones that we\u2019re looking at within energy, but it\u2019s mostly to continue our efforts to broaden and complete our artificial lift product portfolio.  And I think you\u2019ll see more of a focus over the next year or so around capital allocation within engineered systems and our printing business.  And we\u2019ll give you more color on that at Dover Day.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Sure, I understand.  My follow-up question is on printing and ID.  When you think about electronics, obviously slowed down markedly for you guys.  I mean, is it share changes kind of stopped here, or have you lost\u2014you know, accentuating kind of that decline is maybe some share shift.","Robert Livingston","You\u2019re asking about electronics?","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Printing and ID, and specifically on electronics since that\u2019s the one that bled the most.","Robert Livingston","Oh no, I do not believe we are dealing with any share loss at Markem-Imaje, I would say, in the last three quarters \u2013 in the last two quarters, for sure.  ","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","So down 20%, is that\u2014","Robert Livingston","At Markem-Imaje, we feel like we\u2019ve got our stride back at Markem-Imaje, not only with the products and the service rates, but I would also tell you our margins, if they are not back to their historical levels of the past two or three years, they\u2019re within just a few basis points of being there.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","So down 20, just to follow up\u2014I apologize for the follow-up, but down 20 is a much bigger number than we\u2019ve seen historically in any of these sub-segments.  I mean, is there some sort of inventory de-stock that\u2019s occurred or something that kind of explains this?  I mean, I\u2019m having a tough time picturing that end market at the OE side being\u2014you know, production being down a full 20.","Brad Cerepak","Are you talking about electronics, Scott?","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Yes, sir.  Yes, I am.","Robert Livingston","Well again, I would say it\u2019s all electronics, and even to be more specific it\u2019s probably much, much more weighted towards the semi and the solar part of the portfolio than it is our electronic assembly piece.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Okay.  Fair enough.  Okay, I\u2019ll follow up with you guys offline.  Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, good morning.  I hate to be so predictable, but I just wanted to go back to Sound Solutions.","Robert Livingston","You\u2019re very predictable, Nigel!","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Oh, always!  So if I take your comments, Bob, that Sound Solutions could have year-over-year growth in 4Q, that\u2019s\u2014at least to the best of my numbers, that implies about $100 million of revenues.","Robert Livingston","Oh no, no.  ","Brad Cerepak","Sequential growth.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Sequential growth \u2013 okay.  I took that as a year-over-year.","Robert Livingston","No, no \u2013 sequential.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.  And is that, then, a good run rate for 2013, or would you expect sequentials to improve again into \u201913?","Robert Livingston","No, if you\u2019re asking a question, would I take fourth quarter times four and accept that as a good number for \u201913, the answer is no.  ","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, no, that\u2019s very clear.  Okay.  And then if we switch to the energy business, obviously we\u2019ve seen a big divergence between production and drilling trends.  You make very good margins in drilling.  Does that create a mix issue as we go into 4Q and beyond?","Robert Livingston","Yes.  I think we have shared this with the investor community in the past if you look at our three sectors in drilling and production and downstream, that we do have higher margins in our drilling activity than we do in production and downstream.  Interestingly enough, Nigel, as we enter the fourth quarter, we actually see a bit of a sequential increase in drilling activity over the third quarter.  It\u2019s not significant, but we do see a bit of an increase.  The third quarter, we did deal with year-over-year declines in rig count deployment, but we also think that what we were experiencing in the third quarter was a little bit of a squeeze out of inventory with our customers and within the channel.  We happen to think that\u2019s behind us right now.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.  And so the kind of\u2014the crux of the question really is you had this huge mix issue in 3Q, yet you showed 20 BPs of margin expansion.","Robert Livingston","Okay, don\u2019t label it as huge.  There is a mix issue, but don\u2019t label it as huge.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I think drilling was down materially, wasn\u2019t it?  Down 10%?","Robert Livingston","Yeah, that sounds about right.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, so therefore we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about margins down in energy going forward?","Brad Cerepak","Not meaningfully.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Thank you.  Good morning everyone.  I wanted to dig into a couple of the discretionary spending parts of your guidance, and it looks like you\u2019re pulling back on some investment and compensation versus previous guidance, as well as corporate expense is less of a headwind.  Maybe give us some color on what you\u2019re pulling back in terms of discretionary spending.","Brad Cerepak","Well, I would say it\u2019s really two things.  It is tightening up a little bit around what I call pure discretionary spend \u2013 you know, the normal things you would expect in that bucket called travel and other types of consultant-type expenses.  But fundamentally, the downward adjustment in our investment and compensation is compensation.  It\u2019s reflective of what our current guidance is now at versus where we were just 90 days ago.","Robert Livingston","Okay, let me be more specific.  It\u2019s variable comp being adjusted.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","So how much of that would be over on the investment side?  You\u2019re suggesting it is not a big pullback there.","Robert Livingston","Negligible.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","","Okay.  And then given the rally in the euro, you\u2019re not big exposure there; but for the fourth quarter, what are you expecting FX and what\u2019s the currency impact that you\u2019re baking in?","Brad Cerepak","Well, our current view is it\u2019s about 2% impact for total Dover for the whole year, and I think we were at 2% or so in the third quarter.  I don\u2019t see any real change in trajectory on that.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.  ","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot.  Good morning.  My first question was just around the net productivity benefits.  When you did the call in July, you talked about around $0.27 of tailwind for the year; now it\u2019s $0.22.  And I guess I would have thought that with the book-to-bill being down year-on-year, with the second guidance cut the productivity savings should be going up as you\u2019re taking out costs.  So just a question around that.","Robert Livingston","Well before Brad gets into a number or two, I would tell you that probably the thing from my perspective that affects that the most is lower volume.","Brad Cerepak","And that really is it \u2013 it\u2019s lower absorption on lower volume.  That\u2019s the only thing driving it.  Our productivity efforts inside Dover actually have continued to accelerate in terms of the actual project work we\u2019re doing in productivity to take cost out, and as Bob indicated, we continue to do what I would call very selective incremental restructurings which are a little bit more broad-based in the third quarter.  What I mean by that is it\u2019s across all of our segments, including DCT and others, and we continue to look for opportunities to take cost out.  Those costs actually\u2014we put those costs, we characterize those costs included in that number as well.  So it\u2019s a little bit of that, but mostly absorption on lower volume.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, got it.  Thanks.  And then just the follow-up would be within printing and ID, the industrial business was down, I think, mid-single digits, stripping out currency in Q3.  That is worse than what you had in Q2.  You know, you called out Europe.  Was Asia getting worse as well as we went through Q3, or it\u2019s really just the European problem?","Robert Livingston","It would be mostly Europe, though let\u2019s not ignore this \u2013 we are seeing some, call it weakening of the growth rate in China, and it is showing up in some of our businesses and it does affect this industrial piece.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it.  Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Wherly of Janney Capital Markets.","Mike Wherly \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Good morning guys.  First off, I just wanted to ask how big a portion of Sound Solutions\u2019 sales are still Nokia in the third quarter.","Robert Livingston","","Oh my.  I\u2019m looking at Brad.  I don\u2019t know that exact number, but I can take a guess, and I want to say it\u2019s between 25 and 30%.  ","Mike Wherly \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, and that\u2019s down from almost 40 or so coming into the year?","Robert Livingston","Oh, coming into the year?  No, I think it still may have been closer to 50% at the beginning of the year.","Brad Cerepak","If not a little higher.","Robert Livingston","If not a little higher.","Mike Wherly \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay.  And then follow-up on the wide range of guidance with just one quarter to go.  Is that all from\u2014I mean, is most of that just the volatility from the handset market that you talked about in December, or what\u2019s the biggest reason for such a wide range with one quarter to go?","Robert Livingston","Well number one, I\u2019ll agree with you \u2013 it is a wide range, and we spent a lot of time talking about this and debating this, as you would normally expect us to narrow that to a nickel.  Let me give you some color.  I will tell you that as we sit here today, we clearly are focused on achieving and hitting the top end of the range with respect to EPS.  That is our target and that is our goal.  As we came through the third quarter, September bookings were the lightest month of the quarter, and I don\u2019t think it was an aberration.  September bookings was the lightest month of the quarter, and that statement is true for three of our four segments, the one exception being communication technologies.  That gives us a little bit of a pause and, I call it, increases the uncertainty level as we come into the fourth quarter.","I\u2019ve got a very short data point for you, and that\u2019s after the first two weeks of this quarter, after the first two weeks of October, the order rates and activity would have us comfortable with a minimum of the midrange of our revenue guidance.  So why do we have this sort of, you know, someone could say conservative safety net at the bottom end of the range?  Part of that is the uncertainty we have around the month of December with respect to our handset business. ","A couple of other points I would share with you is we exited the third quarter, if not with a record backlog, pretty darn close to it at Hill Phoenix.  And the interesting characteristic on that backlog is a much higher percentage of their third quarter ending backlog is actually scheduled for first quarter delivery, enough so that it actually appears odd.  And we have a little bit of a concern that there could be some further push-outs from the fourth quarter into the first quarter.  Nothing has been signaled in the last two weeks; we just have a little bit of an elevated concern.","And the third one, I would just say some unease and uncertainty around the macro environment in the fourth quarter.","Mike Wherly \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, thanks for that color.  That helps a lot.  ","Robert Livingston","Don\u2019t lose track of my first two comments.  From an earnings perspective, we are clearly targeted and focused on delivering the top end of the range.","Paul Goldberg","Next question, please?","","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob McCarthy of Robert W. Baird.  ","Mick Dobray \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hello, this is Mick Dobray sitting in for Rob McCarthy.  Good morning.  I\u2019d like to sort of stick with Hill Phoenix here.  Can you provide a little more color about the drivers of that business, and apparently it\u2019s performing quite well.  How do you think about it going forward? ","And then as a follow-up there, what is the impact of Hill Phoenix for engineered systems margins, and as that mix changes with Hill Phoenix continuing to hopefully do well, how should we think about incremental margin going forward?","Robert Livingston","Okay.  So well, the first one\u2019s a fairly broad question on Hill Phoenix, so let me try to give you some color on 2012 activity.  We are seeing market growth in the North America served market in 2012.  The data we would have, the latest data we would have would be through August.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen September data yet, but the year-to-date August data would tell you that in the case business, the market\u2019s up maybe 3 to 4 percentage points over last year.  Our business has expanded this year greater than the market growth rate, and through August we think we\u2019ve added maybe three or four points of market share.  We continue to do quite well in our systems business as well as the case business.  ","This business is very much project driven and we can see some interesting changes from year to year when you look at first half versus second half in any given year.  If you look at this year in our first half, revenue at HP\u2014at Hill Phoenix was up 13, 14% - is that right, Brad?  Thirteen or 14%?  ","Brad Cerepak","Mm-hmm, yeah.","Robert Livingston","In the second half of 2012, it\u2019s actually going to be down slightly versus the second half of 2011, and when I saw down slightly, 1%, 2%.  But we are coming in pretty darn close, if not a bit better, than what our plan was for the year, and that\u2019s just all project driven.  You look at our prospects for 2013, and without jumping the gun because the guys at Hill Phoenix haven\u2019t share with us their annual operating plan for \u201913, but they expect and we do, too, that they would have another good solid growth year in 2013, and a lot of things going on in the market that they are participating in and winning.","I guess your last question was on margins, and Brad, you\u2019re going to have to help me.  I would say that the Hill Phoenix margins are probably around the average for the segment.","Mick Dobray \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay.  Then if I may, another follow-up \u2013 it\u2019s more clarification on print and identification.  If I\u2019m looking at your guidance right, I guess it would imply flat revenue on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter.  And if I\u2019m right about that, I\u2019m wondering how should we think about margin?  Is roughly the 14% range still applicable on relatively flat revenue for the fourth quarter?","Robert Livingston","Okay, so help me here, Brad.  I think at the top end of our range, what we have in for that segment is actually a little bit better than flat.  I think it\u2019s 1% growth in the fourth quarter year-over-year, and I don\u2019t know\u2014I can\u2019t recall what the margin trend looks like.","Brad Cerepak","Well, I would just add on the margin trends for that segment and our other segments is that they\u2019re going to follow pretty much the historical pattern for three of the four.  DCT will be different, but I would expect DPI to come down slightly in the margin in Q4 based, really, on just mix of the business.","Paul Goldberg","Let\u2019s take our final question now because I think an hour\u2019s just about up.  So can we have the final question, Paula?","Operator","And your final question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel Nicolaus. ","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning guys.  I thought we could just go back to the order trends that you saw in September there, would September normally be the softest month for orders in the quarter?","Robert Livingston","","Well, you have to look at some of the parts.  It is not unusual for Hill Phoenix to see September as their weakest order month of the quarter, simply because their business activity tends to soften a bit in the latter part of the year versus the first part of the year.  But when you pull Hill Phoenix out of the order book and look at everything else, you typically don\u2019t see a decline in September order rates versus July and August, and we did.  As I said before, we did in three of the four segments.  I\u2019m not talking about a large number, but it was enough of a pattern there that it was noticeable.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Is there some overarching theme in why you think September was softer, ex-Hill Phoenix, or is it discrete related to each individual business?","Robert Livingston","No, I\u2019m labeling it more as a reflection of the macro environment.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay.  And if I could just get one more in on the balance sheet \u2013 your accounts payable was up a good bit, and inventory was pretty flat sequentially despite heading into a seasonally slower revenue quarter.  Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that, and if there\u2019s any actions you\u2019re talking to address that?","Brad Cerepak","Yes.  I would say our working capital, generally speaking, was a little bit higher than we normally would have expected at this time of the year.  I think it came in roughly\u2014our calculation comes in at about 20%, and normally we\u2019re between 18 and 19 at this stage.  So a lot of that is just timing, timing on collections of receivables and timing of some of the payables.  The payables are linked to our CAPEX spend, so you will see a little bit of abnormal-type move in payables, but nothing significant there.","Our focus is to continue to execute on working capital in the fourth quarter, and our expectations are we\u2019ll bring that back to our historical 18 to 19% level.","Nathan Jones- Stifel Nicolaus","Perfect, thanks guys.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks everyone.  This concludes our conference call.  With that, we want to thank you for your continued interest in Dover and we definitely look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.  Have a good day.  Bye.","Operator","Thank you.  This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.  You may now disconnect.  Thank you for your participation and have a great day."],"6696":["Dover Corp.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our solid fourth quarter capped off a record year in revenue and earnings, as we posted quarterly revenue growth 15%, including organic growth of 6%. This growth enabled us to deliver fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year.","In our Energy segment, we continue to see strength across all end markets especially production-related activity. Market dynamics, including the shift from gas to oil drilling remained very solid for us and we anticipate this strength continuing well into 2012.","Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and food equipment businesses continued to execute extremely well, driven by market leading technology and customer focus. We were pleasantly surprised with the strength of fourth quarter bookings in refrigeration and begin 2012 well-positioned to deliver another outstanding year.","Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The fluids performance was driven by significant investment we\u2019ve made throughout the year and product development and growth in emerging markets.","At our Communication Technologies segment we saw extremely strong MEMS microphone activity, as well as solid life science and commercial aerospace markets. We expect the handset market to show high single-digit growth in 2012 with smartphone growth rate much higher.","Within our Printing & Identification segment, I\u2019m encouraged by the actions taken by our Markem-Imaje team to deliver new products and expand our global sales and marketing activities. Our customers have responded very favorably to our new printers which are for broader market and application coverage than the prior generation. These investments in product and resources will drive even better growth in the coming year.","These strong performances helped offset continued fourth quarter headwinds in alternative energy and semi-con markets and weakness in telecom infrastructure markets. Despite these headwinds and general economic softness in Europe, we finished the year with the book-to-bill of 1, illustrating the depth and the resilience of our business mix. I feel we are well-positioned as we enter 2012.","For the full year of 2011, we achieved record revenue of $8 billion, up 20%, including organic growth of 11% and acquisition growth of 7%. Segment earnings were also a record, up 18%. Full year margin were 17%, a very strong result considering we absorbed over $30 million in deal cost and a significant increase in acquisition amortization. In addition to revenue and earnings, we set full year record for EPS and free cash flow. We also increase our dividend for the 56-consecutive-year.","During the year we took several important steps to better position Dover for the long-term. We realigned our businesses into a new segment structure to more closely match our five key growth markets. We also divested three businesses which did not fit our long-term strategy. We received over $0.5 billion in proceeds for these businesses and believe we have positively impacted our long-term profile.","In 2011, we spent $1.4 billion in acquiring nine businesses, all in our growth spaces. Most notably Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions, Harbison-Fischer was a great addition to our Energy segment and delivered a strong year. Our Sound Solutions acquisition was also an exciting deal for us as it expands our products and technology in the handset market.","As you know we acquired the business just as it started to ramp new automation and products. The production ramp has been more challenging then originally anticipated impacting us in the short-term. That being said, my enthusiasm around the combination of Knowles Sound Solutions is stronger than ever. Our pipeline remains active and we expect to announce additional deals in the next three to four months.","In summary, I\u2019m pleased, actually proud of our 2011 achievements and results, and believe we are well-positioned as we enter 2012.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on slide three of the presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 15%. Earnings per share also increased 15% to $1.12. After adjusting for tax benefits in the quarter, EPS was $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year.","Segment margin for the quarter was 16.5%, down 50 basis points, solid performances in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems were offset by the expected lower volume in Printing & Identification, solar and semi markets, as well as significant acquisition-related costs.","Bookings increased 14% over last year to $2 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification booking were stable in our fast moving consumer goods markets. While the alternative energy in semi-con markets continue at low levels.","Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1, which is in line with our seasonal pattern and historical fourth quarter trends. Backlog grew 15% to $1.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $276 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year we generated $786 million of free cash representing 10% of revenue.","Now turning to slide four. Fourth quarter revenue growth of 15% was comprised of 6% organic growth and 9% from acquisitions. Organic revenue growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 25% growth in the quarter.","Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw solid growth, 8% and 6% respectively, driven by the handset, refrigeration, fluid and industrial end markets. Printing & Identification was down 13%, largely driven by weakness in solar and semi. These results were partially offset by fast moving consumer goods markets.","For the quarter, majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies and Energy, where acquisitions contributed 35% and 16%, respectively.","Turning to slide five in our sequential results. As expected, revenue declined from the third quarter. Strong energy results were offset by normal seasonality in other segments and weakness in some end markets.","Engineered Systems normal seasonal pattern was evident as revenue declined 11% sequentially, primarily driven by the refrigeration markets. Printing & Identification and Communication Technologies were down 8% and 2%, respectively, due to normal seasonality and weak alternative energy and telecom end markets.","Bookings also declined from the third quarter of 2011, largely reflecting normal seasonal patterns. Of note, we saw strong bookings in refrigeration and food equipment, and solid energy order rates.","Now on slide six. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $396 million and $71 million of earnings, an increase of 41% and 40%, respectively. These results were driven by strong MEMS in aerospace OEM and aftermarket activity.","Sound Solutions volume accounted for 35 points of the revenue growth. Operating margin was 17.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix in the handset market and production ramp challenges, as well as softness in telecom and the impact of acquisition-related costs.","Bookings were $350 million, an increase of 21%. This growth was largely driven by our very strong MEMS handset markets. We also saw robust order rate in aerospace. Book-to-bill was 0.88 reflecting normal seasonality and the timing of orders based on new product introductions from handset OEMs. The handset market will continue to be strong in 2012, as cell phone grow, smartphones in particular, will be positively impacted by new product releases.","Turning to slide seven, Engineered produced another -- Energy produced another excellent quarter, as North American rig count modestly grew and oil prices were favorable. During the year and continuing right through the fourth quarter, we saw a shift from gas to liquid and oil rigs. Oil rigs are now approximately 70% of the market, a dynamic that is positive for our energy businesses.","Revenue increased 41% to $510 million, while earnings increased 40% to $122 million. Acquisitions accounted for 16% --16 points of the growth. In the quarter, we saw a growth across all end markets, drilling, production and downstream.","Operating margin was 23.9%, 30 basis points lower than last year. Our margins remained extremely strong even after the impact associated with 2011 acquisitions. Bookings were $520 million, a 42% increase over the prior year, which included 29% organic growth. Book-to-bill was 1.02. We expect the energy market to remain strong as we start 2012, driven by the shift from gas to oil and continued growth in North American rig count.","Moving to slide eight. At Engineered Systems, sales were $731 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 13% to $163 million, while Refrigeration & Industrial grew 7% to $569 million. Segment earnings increased 17% to $93 million. These excellent results were broad-based with strong performances in both platforms and across most end markets.","Operating margin was 12.7%, an increase of 100 basis points, reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $783 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.07.","Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 10% to $159 million while Refrigeration & Industrial was up 11% to $626 million. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions and Refrigeration & Industrial were 0.98 and 0.1, respectively -- 1.1, sorry, respectively.","The strong growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad-based, while Refrigeration & Industrial was led by very solid refrigeration and food equipment orders. We begin 2012 with a healthy backlog in this segment.","Now let\u2019s turn slide nine. Printing & Identification revenue was $368 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 43% to $45 million. The declines reflect the continued weakness in alternative energy in semi-con markets as compared against a very strong prior year.","These markets accounted for $50 million of revenue in the quarter, down 50% from the prior year primarily driven by solar. That aside, activity in the fast moving consumer goods markets overcame a softening Europe and continue to expand on the strength of new product introductions. Operating margin declined 640 basis points to 12.1%, reflecting significantly lower volume.","Bookings were $354 million, a decrease of 11% from last year. These results were driven by weak semi-con and alternative energy markets, which we believe have stabilized. With regard to our fast moving consumer goods exposure, we expect solid market conditions in 2012. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.","Going to slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were both in line with our expectations. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter rate was 22.3%. The rate was favorably impacted by $0.05 tax benefit. Adjusting for this benefit, the rate would have been 25.5%. For the full year after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefit, our normalized rate was 26.5%. Our tax rate continued lower due to the impact of geographic mix of earnings.","Now turning to slide 11 in our 2012 revenue guidance. We expect 2012 full year revenue growth of 7% to 10%, consistent with expectation shared at Dover there. Organic growth is estimated to be 4% to 7%, with acquisitions adding around 3%.","Breaking down revenue growth by segment, we expect Communication Technologies will grow organically 11% to 13%, driven by strong prospects from MEMS microphones. Acquisition growth will add 10% to 12%.","Energy should grow in the range 10% to 12% comprised of 8% to 10% organic growth and 2% from acquisitions. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow organically 3% to 5%. We also expect 1% from acquisitions for total growth of 4% to 6%. Lastly, Printing & Identification revenue is forecasted to be flat.","Moving on to slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We expect corporate expense to be around $145 million, up about $7 million from 2011, representing continued investment in incremental pension costs. Interest expense will be about $118 million. We are forecasting our full year tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%.","CapEx should be approximately 3% of full year revenue, as we continue to invest in capacity expansion and automation, and emerging economy growth. We again anticipate generating significant free cash flow, roughly 10% of revenue. Based on the above, we anticipate full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.70 to $5.","Now let\u2019s go to full year earnings bridge on slide 13. 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefit. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.26 to $0.52 for the year, while net productivity is expected to generate $0.21 to $0.31.","We now expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22. We will continue to make investment in sales and engineering for growth. The combined impact of these investments and higher compensation costs should be $0.20 to $0.30.","Lastly, interest expense, a slightly lower share count and our normalized tax rate all largely offset each other -- in a $0.01 impact. The net result is earnings per share growth of 14% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments.","Bob Livingston","Thanks Brad. We had an outstanding 2011 and we expect to grow revenue and earnings nicely in 2012. As we start the year, we believe energy will continue to perform at a high level as will fluids, refrigeration and food equipment and most of our other industrial markets. We also expect the handset market to be very strong, which should help drive significant demand for our MEMS microphones and acoustic products.","I firmly believe we had the right organization and team in place and are serving the right markets. Our focus on customers, technology and higher growth applications in economies should enable us to deliver another fine year to our shareholders.","In closing, I\u2019d like to personally thank our employees, customers and suppliers for their strong contributions and support in making 2011 a great success for Dover. I look forward to their continued contributions in the coming year.","Okay. Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks Bob. At this point, I\u2019d just like to remind everybody that if you can limit to one question with a follow-up, we\u2019ll be able -- we\u2019ll be better able to answer everybody\u2019s question. So, with that, Jackie, let\u2019s have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot. Hi. Yeah. I guess\u2026","Bob Livingston","Morning. Morning.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Morning. The first point, you said you spent $1.4 billion on M&A last year, obviously at the very beginning of this year. I mean what are your thoughts on the pace at which you want to ramp up M&A given it\u2019s been kind of six months waiver and you really sold businesses and not bought any?","Bob Livingston","Well, I\u2019m not sure we feel like we\u2019re ramping M&A. M&A is actually quite active right now, but it was in the second half of the year following the Sound Solutions acquisition as well. We just didn\u2019t close too many deals in the second half. As I commented in my opening comments, I would expect to announce three to four acquisitions or some acquisitions in the next three to four months, but it is currently active.","Brad Cerepak","We did close three small deals in the fourth quarter into the early part of January. But they were relatively small.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks. And then secondly on the Energy business, you talked about 8% to 10% organic growth in 2012. There\u2019s obviously a lot of noise in the last two weeks around the weakened outlook for gas related CapEx given prices. What sort of assumption you\u2019re factoring in for your business which is towards gas rather oil this year?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Well, let\u2019s, on key assumptions, I guess, you\u2019d start with rig count. And 2012, our assumptions and forecast do assume a very modest single-digit increase in rig count over the year-end number and Julian, I think our modeling is 3% or 4% increase in rig count in 2012 over the year end number, but it is interesting when you look at that number for 2012 against the average for 2011, it\u2019s about a 10% increase year-over-year comps on rig count deployment.","We do -- we have been seeing this for -- goodness for the past year. The switch from less gas to more oil on the rig deployment, the announcements in the last couple of weeks that you refer to, I think would encourage that shift even more and I have to tell you that sort of plays to our favor.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, you had pretty big decremental margins, I guess, in Printing & ID in Q4. How you\u2019re thinking about the cost base there and I guess if bookings has stabilizing in semiconductors and alternative energy, does that mean you\u2019re kind of hanging in there with the fixed cost based on the assumption that you could get quite a big revenue ramp this year?","Bob Livingston","Well, the bookings have stabilized and to give you a little bit more color on that, I would tell you that for not just for sending in solar, but for all of the electronics activity in that segment. Our 2012 assumption is that we\u2019re going to have revenue that\u2019s about equal to the second half of 2011 annualized.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.","Bob Livingston","So even -- but even with the stabilization that we\u2019re saying in the market activity, we have been taking some fixed cost out of this business during the second half of 2011 and we have more actions plans in the first half of 2012 as well.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Bank of America.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning, everyone.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, John.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, John.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning. Brad or Bob, is there a way, perhaps, we could flesh out a little bit more, quantify some of the production ramp cost spending that I\u2019m assuming Sound Solutions incurred in the quarter. And how do you expect that sort of to progress because obviously you\u2019ve got some new business ramp that\u2019s expected to come in, maybe a little bit of help on that dynamic?","Brad Cerepak","Well, I would start first by saying the challenges around the production ramp have more to deal to do with yield than with customers or market. And the yield on some of the new designs, as we transition to some new customers had been a bit more challenging than we would have liked.","We do expect those yield challenges to continue through the first quarter well into the second quarter until we get our full automation up and convert from labor to automation. And we expect the Sound Solutions business to expand margins and earnings sequentially through the year.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","Bob, is this an issue going on in China because I know that business had been hiring a bunch of folks in China or is just has to do with just kind of overall since you\u2019ve owned the business trying to having tap into some other aspects of integration, I mean?","Bob Livingston","No. I would not label this at all as having anything to do with integration. It is all production ramp in China.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","And then my follow-up, really I guess the historical Markem-Imaje business. That business does have quite a bit of exposure to Europe. Yeah, I think the core result\u2019s pretty good. I mean, what do you think is going on there maybe a little bit of color and do you expect the business to kind of fade given leading indicators in Europe or do you think this new product launches are superseding that impact? What do you think?","Bob Livingston","A lot of it all. We -- number one, we do have a strong business base in Europe. John, our business in Europe, you could actually split it into two pieces. We did see some softness in Europe end of fourth quarter. It was without any exceptions. It was restricted to Southern Europe.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","And in Northern Europe, Central Europe, business activity continued to be fairly strong. If -- to give you a little bit of color for 2012, we\u2019re sitting here with our guidance assuming 10% to 11% organic growth at Markem-Imaje for 2012. We\u2019re not expecting much growth in Europe for Markem-Imaje next year.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","And most of them assuming as new products?","Bob Livingston","New products and all regions of the world except Europe.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","Lastly, Bob, strategically, the divesture of Heil makes a lot of sense. I guess the question is, do you foresee Dover doing further divestitures, you\u2019re talking about acquisitions but how do you think about the portfolio now given the moving parts and I realized you talked about semi-con at Dover Day, so maybe exclude those businesses what about the rest of, say, your mix, how are you thinking about that?","Bob Livingston","John, it would be quite direct about it. We have no current plans for divestiture activity that we\u2019re currently working on, but I will repeat what I said at Dover Day and I\u2019ve said this before. I think you\u2019ll see us continue to sort of tweak the portfolio this year, next year, the year after when we believe timing is right and there\u2019s a different, better owner for a business than Dover.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you.","Bob Livingston","But I wouldn\u2019t expect anything major like we did in 2011.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","Yeah. That\u2019s seems clear. Thanks very much.","Bob Livingston","Okay.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","I appreciate it.","Operator","You\u2019re next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Terry.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Terry.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, Bob. I wonder if we just make sure we get the complete list of kind of what changed in your thinking about the 2012 Mosaic versus Dover Day. It looks like the Communication Technologies organic has gone up a bit, the acquisition growth down a bit. You talked about the ramp issues on Sound Solutions, presumably the Comtech is just the handset view that you have. And then has anything really changed around your segment margin expansion expectations of 40 to 70, it looks like maybe that came down a little bit, but maybe you can complete that list for us.","Bob Livingston","Got you. Brad said, Brad\u2019s going to give you the detail response. My response sitting here as we\u2019ve looked at this over the last three or four weeks is, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much difference in our guidance and our outlook for 2012 versus what we shared with your at Dover Day, perhaps a little bit of minor noise around margin expectations but it\u2019s minor. But, Brad, do you want to add anything?","Brad Cerepak","Yeah. I think I would just say, I think you understand the sales well. You articulated that correctly, little bit changed there, not much. With respect to margin expectations at Dover Day there\u2019s really no major changes. I would say, the minor things I would say is we would expect DE and DES to be a bit stronger than what we\u2019ve said at Dover Day and DPI maybe a little bit less.","And your observation is correct, I think total segment margin expansion is probably, we said 40 to 70 basis points. We\u2019re probably 10 off on that range at this stage. It\u2019s not much. Not much change is the way I would think about it.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Helpful. And Bob, can you explain more why this shift from gas to oil is a positive -- is a net positive for Dover and in that context, the 8% to 10% organic is kind of in line with that rig count forecast you have and you\u2019ve been outgrowing the rig count in a couple years past. So let me just square those up.","Bob Livingston","Okay. So there\u2019s two questions there. So let me give you a little bit of color on the markets for Energy, drilling, production and downstream. And drilling we -- because of the -- I call it the tapering off of the growth rate and the rig count deployment for drilling growth in 2012. We\u2019re looking at mid single-digit growth in drilling next year, 6% to 7% and downstream and production, low double digits. So that gives you a little bit of color on the markets.","Your question on why the shift to oil favors us. Well, to be rather -- to be better rather frank about it, on a typical gas well to bring it in production, we will get maybe $10 or $12,000 of revenue per completed gas well on an oil well or a liquid-rich well. It\u2019s about $50,000. We just have more product content.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And maybe Bob you could help us with the rough percent split of business as you see it now between drilling, production and downstream.","Bob Livingston","Oh! Goodness. Production is about half of the Energy business. Downstream and drilling obviously the balance and the balance is probably split 55,45 in favor of downstream.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. I\u2019ll past it on. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Jeff.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Could you elaborate a little bit, Bob, on the strength that you\u2019re seeing in refrigeration? Is there some new problematic type activity at some big retailers or some share shifts going on, just any additional color that would be great?","Bob Livingston","Well, I wish I could sit here and tell you that the market is booming. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing and that wasn\u2019t what was behind the fourth quarter strength. In fact, Jeff, I would tell you, we went through the fourth quarter and saw the bookings coming in a little bit stronger than we had anticipated. I have tell you our initial response is we were probably seeing some pull-forward order activity from the first quarter to the fourth quarter and that\u2019s always a bit difficult to predict anyway, the fourth quarter bookings.","So that was sort that our consensus as we were chatting with you at Dover Day. I have to tell you as we, January is not over but we\u2019re three weeks into the New Year and bookings activity at Hill PHOENIX is remaining fairly strong. I think there is some share gain that Hill PHOENIX is capturing and we are seeing a rather significant increase in opportunity for Hill PHOENIX in Canada and Mexico.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","And just wondering on\u2026","Bob Livingston","Jeff, don\u2019t ignore the acquisition that we just completed here for this business and I think it was in November. I think we\u2019ve got about, gosh, we\u2019ve got about $30 million of revenue\u2026","Brad Cerepak","Annual revenue.","Bob Livingston","\u2026 annual revenue and are planned in 2012 from downturn.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Okay. And\u2026","Bob Livingston","Jeff, the businesses are doing very well.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Yeah. It sounds like you\u2019re still taking some nice share.","Bob Livingston","Yeah.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Just thinking about your deal pipeline and obviously, it just depends on when things close and all that and I get that, but is the window closing and it stands for 2012 deals to be able to add to 2012 earnings just thinking now the timing of when things might close and your knowledge, obviously what\u2019s in the pipeline on handicapped and what might close?","Bob Livingston","Well, it ends up being deal specific like it always is, if we can close on a couple or three deals here in the next three to four months, obviously the timing of that early in the year gives you the opportunity to have a little bit of opportunity for EPS accretion.","But at the same time, each deal is going to be unique with respect to the integration cost and some of the upfront costs to bring in the business ended over. Let us announce the deals and we\u2019ll give you some guidance as we make the deals.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Right. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura Securities.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Hey. As you think about this year-over-year decline in the Printing & ID margin, I know we have the semi stuff and solar, but you guys had also obviously been ramping a bunch of investments in the product ID side of things. I mean, can you of the 640 basis point decline, give a broad stroke of what the chunks of that are?","Bob Livingston","The fourth quarter decline I think would be primarily due to the lower volume in semi and solar, and the other electronics part of the business compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. But we have and making some significant investments. We continue making some significant investments with Markem-Imaje, as well as Datamax-O\u2019Neil and some of the decline in the fourth quarter was attributed to some minor margin declines at Markem-Imaje, do you want to add any color to that?","Brad Cerepak","Well, yeah, I would agree with that, Bob. I think they\u2019re minor and they do reflect -- they do principally reflect a little bit of investment and we saw a little bit of a mix in the fourth quarter as well that work a little bit of against Markem-Imaje, but nothing significant and nothing permanent.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay.","Bob Livingston","And let me clarify that. What Brad refers to the mix issue in the fourth quarter? Printer sales were a little bit higher percentage of revenue for Markem-Imaje in the fourth quarter than consumables and I think that reflects the sort of the surge that the guys are seeing with the take-up of the new product offerings.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Do you have, I mean is Markem-Imaje kind of back to where you wanted it to be after you had the kind of take the margins down for investment purposes to get the new product out or is that still kind of ramping?","Bob Livingston","I would label that still a work in process. They asked me that question a year from now and I\u2019d like to be able to answer, yeah.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","And then just on the margins in Engineered Systems, the strength there, anything unusual you would point out in that or what do you credit that to?","Bob Livingston","Nothing unusual, very broad-based, strong conversion at that segment in the fourth quarter.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Robert W. Baird.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Robert.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Can you give us some visibility on what your expectation is for book-to-bill in the Communications Technologies segment, I mean, do you consider the below 1.0 number in the quarter to be sort of an aberration and we have to look for combination of seasonal factors and stronger order flow to take us back above 1 as early as the first quarter or to take a little bit longer for that to happen?","And is a perhaps related shift in growth expectations for the segment to a little more backend-weighted the explanation for why your organic growth forecast went up a little bit and your acquisition contribution number went down a little bit?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Your first question was around book-to-bill for the fourth quarter and actually, Rob, I would label the fourth quarter of 2011 to be more normal and the fourth quarter of \u201810 to have been a bit of an aberration.","You do typically, especially in the handset business. You will typically see the reduction. You will see a very, very strong order flow in production through mid-November, sometimes through the end of November, sometimes into the middle of December. But typically, December is normally a fairly weak order month for the cell phone guys. And that holds true through Chinese New Year.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay.","Bob Livingston","So we\u2019ll see a significant change in order rates as we come back off of Chinese New Year here in a couple of weeks. We would expect order rates in the latter half of the first quarter and the second quarter will be quite strong.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. And so, the related question then of whether the changes, bumping up the organic growth number for Comtech and taking down the acquisition contribution, really it\u2019s first half concentrated, does that, I mean, I sense that you\u2019ve shifted your revenue growth expectations for that segment to a little bit later in the year?","Bob Livingston","That\u2019s true. I would also tell you that we\u2019re probably seeing the opportunity for a little bit more growth at Knowles this year than maybe we shared with you at Dover Day. And when we look at Sound Solutions, I think the guys sitting around me would tell you I\u2019m being conservative, but I have -- we have backed off the Sound Solutions revenue forecast for 2012 or for Sound Solutions by about, I think it\u2019s about $15 million.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay.","Bob Livingston","And it\u2019s all Nokia.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yeah. All right.","Bob Livingston","And I\u2019m sitting here now, I would, if you\u2019re looking for any upside opportunities to our guidance\u2026","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yeah.","Bob Livingston","\u2026 I would like to think we could outperform that slightly in 2012.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yeah. Okay. And my related question to that is, I mean, just really big picture, is it a fair characterization to say that most of the earnings per share growth that you\u2019re forecasting will occur in the second half of the year? I mean you got short-term ramp issues? You got a little bit of hangover from Printing & IDs especially in the first quarter, et cetera?","Bob Livingston","Well, I don\u2019t look at it that way. So I don\u2019t have that detail in front of me but it, from a revenue perspective, I\u2019m not sure I can equate it directly to EPS. Forget organic and comps, I would tell you that when we look at revenue for 2012, about $4.2 billion in the first half of \u201812 and about $4.4, $4.45 number in the second, so the second half is a little bit better than the first half. But, yeah, I\u2019m not sure I would label that as unusual.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","","Okay. All right. Thanks Bob.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","","Hi. Good morning. ","","Bob Livingston","","Good morning, Steve.","Brad Cerepak","","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Question on the Communication Technologies, can you just help me just help bridge the gap, I \u2013 people view this is an iPhone play, but I\u2019m struggling to bridge the gap from what Apple\u2019s putting up and 6% core growth in Communication Technologies and the 7% that you did this year and how that kind of [bridge] it to the \u201811 to \u201813 that you\u2019re talking about for next year, what gets materially better?","","Bob Livingston","","Okay. What gets materially better, well\u2026","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","","I guess just describe the moving parts because 6% core growth is solid, but not something that I guess that we would expect looking at kind of the smartphone type of volumes you\u2019re talking about. I know there are other businesses\u2026","Bob Livingston","","Okay. Well, you look at the whole segment, Steve, well, obviously you know this as well as everyone else that it\u2019s not all handsets, but when you look at the major markets that we\u2019re serving within the segment and I can\u2019t break this out between organic and acquisition, but the area that is down in 2012 is telecom and some other small applications, and that represents about $200 million of revenue for this segment and it\u2019s down 14% in \u201812.","All other segments that we\u2019re serving, we\u2019re showing growth from very, very modest low single-digit on military and I know that seems odd but we actually have line of sight on some growth in military, but it\u2019s very low single-digit. Aerospace and industrial markets we\u2019re seeing growth of 9% to 10% in \u201812, life sciences mid single-digits, by 5% to 6%, and obviously, the bulk of the growth is our handset business.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","","What was the biggest headwind in the quarter like by those buckets what was the worst type of decline, was it the telecom business?","","Bob Livingston","","In the quarter?","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","","Yeah. For fourth quarter.","","Bob Livingston","","Fourth quarter comps against the fourth quarter of \u201810, life sciences was down slightly you know like maybe 3% or 4% year-over-year, military was off slightly, again, 3% or 4% year-over-year, aerospace, industrial was actually up nicely. What was it Brad, 25%, 30% growth in the fourth quarter and everything else was handsets. Actually telecom was down slightly, I think 2% or 3% in the fourth quarter.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","","So handsets was up what?","","Bob Livingston","","The balance.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","","I guess I could walk through with Paul offline.","","Bob Livingston","","I don\u2019t remember the number. It was well over 100%.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","","Sure and then one last question just on Engineered Systems, I mean, it looks to me like you guys took that \u2013 organic is down from 4 to 6 to 3 to 5, but you\u2019re talking more positively about Hill PHOENIX, is there something else going on in that business?","","Bob Livingston","","No. I think I would label the guidance at DES to be quite reflective of what we were seeing in the final three or four months of 2011 and we probably got two segments that I would say we\u2019re baking in a little bit conservatism with respect to Europe, those two segments being Printing & Identification and DES.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","","Got you. One more very quick one, just housekeeping, so I\u2019m just unclear, Sound Solutions looks like you\u2019re guiding out kind of incremental revs of about $150 million to $160 million. You have been expecting something at around $200 million I think. Again, is this a customer issue or is this \u2013 you said it automation prob or ramping production ramp problem or what exactly is that?","","Brad Cerepak","","I would say we\u2019re not guiding down on that full year number for 2012. As Bob said, if you think about where we were last time on this call to where we are now maybe $15 million guide down, but the number remains substantially unchanged and a lot higher than the number you\u2019re talking about.","","Bob Livingston","","The only difference between what we\u2019ve been sharing over the last couple of calls, and our guidance and outlook for 2012 is about a $15 million reduction and how we look at Sound Solutions revenue opportunity in \u201812 and as I said earlier, it\u2019s all round Nokia.","","Brad Cerepak","","Nokia and a little bit of RIM.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Hi, guys. Good morning. ","","Bob Livingston","","Good morning, Scott.","","Brad Cerepak","","Good morning. ","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Specifically for you Brad, I mean we haven\u2019t talked about the whole concept of centralization in a while and some of the things you\u2019re working on like procurement and such I mean can you give us an update there? Are we pretty much done or is there more to do in 2012?","","Brad Cerepak","","Well, there\u2019s a lot more to do and we continue to work on it. I would say we still expect more incremental impact in 2012 on our supply chain efforts, and I would say that that number is pretty much \u2013 the incremental is pretty much in line with what we achieved in 2011. So, we continue to see good opportunities there.","We\u2019re working on lot of other areas including efforts around our IT infrastructure and as well as we\u2019re in a very early days of taking look at some back office opportunities. And you\u2019ll perhaps see that unfold a little bit as we get later into 2012 about things that we can expect to achieve in the back office and to IT, but that\u2019s an area that up to now Dover hasn\u2019t spend a lot of time working on. It\u2019s the natural progression coming off of our supply chain efforts in centralization.","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Make sense. Just following up a little bit from Steve\u2019s first question, we saw this list of Apple suppliers and it\u2019s the first time I can remember saying the list may be they put it out before, but it\u2019s first time I\u2019ve seen it.","","Bob Livingston","","It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve published that.","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Obviously, they list you guys and then they list your key MEMS competitor AAC. Have some of the capacity constraint issues that you guys are talking about, is that opened a door a bit for somebody like AAC to build out scale and be able to compete more effectively with you guys? How do you kind of view that?","","Brad Cerepak","","Number one, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a capacity constraint issue that has led to a position where we have not been able to satisfy or support a customer in the way they wanted us to support them. So let\u2019s be sure about that.","This is a pretty large market, it\u2019s becoming a larger market and it would \u2013 as much as we would like to say, we\u2019re the only one in the market, this is something we\u2019ve known is going to be happening ever since we acquire the business in 2005. It was interesting, someone asked earlier about the assumptions around Energy \u2013 let me tell you the assumptions around MEMS for this year and next year, number one, we still believe there\u2019s going to be significant MEMS encroachment on the old-style audio technology for microphones.","We think that\u2019s still has a lot of room to move and that as we see that further encroachment on MEMS technology, we believe we\u2019re going to maintain a very, very high share of the MEMS microphones for the cell phones guys. For the next two to three year, we believe there\u2019s going to be continued growth in the cell phone market. There will be competition, it\u2019s a big market.","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","","How much does that help having Sound Solutions now? I mean does that allow you to, for lack of better word, bundle or \u2013 how does that kind of work? Are they still pretty disparate businesses?","","Bob Livingston","","I don\u2019t like the word bundling, but it sure does help on cross selling. In fact, I would tell you that it is interesting when you look the target opportunities and revenue opportunities for Knowles. In the MEMS business in 2012, we\u2019ve added two customers for 2012 that we did not have prior to Sound Solutions and the cross-selling has been a result of Sound Solutions.","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Okay. Good. Thank you, guys.","","Operator","","Your final question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Thanks, good morning. ","","Bob Livingston","","Good morning, Nigel.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","So you must get through the whole call without fielding a single semi-cap question. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not a cheater.","","Bob Livingston","","I\u2019ll kill you, Nigel.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not going to go there. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the comps given it\u2019s in the segments and you saw a really nice ramp up in margins from 3Q to 4Q and I\u2019m actually wondering how much of that was due to the Sound Solutions yield improvements and how much was just due to acquisition accounting which rolled forward \u2013 which washed out in 4Q?","","Bob Livingston","","I\u2019m not sure I understood the question, Nigel.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","The sequential improvement in Comtech margins from 3Q to 4Q?","","Bob Livingston","","I would label the bulk of the improvement \u2013 just the elimination if you want to call it that of some of the deal cost we incurred in the third quarter. In fact, I commented about some of the production ramp up cost.","I will confess that the yields in the fourth quarter at Sound Solutions weren\u2019t much better than they were in our third quarter and that\u2019s a challenge we\u2019re going to continue to struggle with as I commented earlier going into the first quarter until we can get the automation completely online and that\u2019s going to be late this quarter and into the mid of the second quarter before that project is complete.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Are you still aiming to have the automation lines up and running by March I think?","","Bob Livingston","","Let\u2019s see, there are schedule Nigel. The first one is actually up and running now. The second line is being tested and prepared for handoff to manufacturing as we speak and it\u2019s probably in total about a five or six week process to complete that transition. The third automation line, I don\u2019t think it goes into the factory until early March and that\u2019s why I say it\u2019ll be well into the second quarter before that one is complete.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","So we got a yield improvement story coming through the next two quarters?","","Bob Livingston","","Yeah. We do.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. I know you guys don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but\u2026","","Brad Cerepak","","That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not\u2026","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","But on the comp side, you got Chinese New Year so you would expect to have some volume absorption issues coming through, well, it looks like absorption issues coming through in 1Q, then you have the yield improvement coming through from Sound Solutions. How should we think about 1Q margins in comps compared to 4Q?","","Brad Cerepak","","For Dover or for this for Communication Technologies?","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Exactly Comtech.","","Bob Livingston","","Comtech, got you. I don\u2019t have that Brad, do you? Hardly similar?","","Brad Cerepak","","High level I would say the volumes, because the Chinese New Year are down, down off of the fourth quarter and therefore we would expect the margins to follow suit. We don\u2019t give specific guidance, but that would be a normal pattern I would expect.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful and then Brad, just quickly 4% to 7% core growth, does that includes FX as well?","","Brad Cerepak","","Yeah. It does.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our third quarter results were disappointing. As the continuing weak macro environment further declines in longer cycle oil and gas applications and production inefficiencies and our retail refrigeration business impacted both volume and earnings. These results were well below our expectations, and more than offset solid improvements in our upstream drilling and production businesses, as well as continued strong performance in our Printing & Identification platform.","From a geographic perspective our US and China activity declined organically, both sequentially and year-over-year. On an organic basis our European markets improved sequentially and year-over-year. Within Energy, revenue was up 5% sequentially largely within our drilling and production markets, this improvement was driven by increases in the North American rig count principally in the Permian.","The recent trends in rig count and oil price are constructive and supportive of continued near term improvement in our early cycle businesses. That said, within this segment we continue to be challenged in longer cycle applications. Engineered systems organic growth of 1% was driven by another strong quarter in Printing and Identification which posted organic growth of 5%. And the Industrial Platform organic revenue declined 2%, though our vehicle service equipment business had a very strong quarter.","Fluids posted 17% revenue growth driven by acquisitions. However our organic revenue declined of 9% reflects activity reductions in our businesses with longer cycle oil and gas exposure as well as tough comps. Lastly, growth in retail fueling was less than anticipated while our businesses serving to hygienic and pharma markets continue to show very strong growth.","Refrigeration and food equipment revenue declined 2% organically principally driven by tough comps and can-shaping equipment. Margin performance was well below expectations at Hillphoenix primarily driven by production challenges in case manufacturing. We continue to implement changes to improve the business.","Regarding acquisitions we have closed two deals since our last earning call both in Engineered Systems. We added a small Automation and Data Analytics business and also acquired a European Lift business. The addition of the lift business gives us a $500 million platform into growing vehicle service equipment market. We also recently announced that the Wayne acquisition due to an extended regulatory review in the UK will now likely close in the first quarter. Our teams are actively exploring measures to satisfy the regulators\u2019 concerns as quickly as possible, this matter relates only to the UK dispenser business which is very small in the context of the transaction.","Now looking forward. Within Energy, we are encouraged by the recent improvements in North American rig count and oil prices and believe both are constructive for continued near term improvements in our business. That said we anticipate our longer cycle oil and gas related businesses to remain sequentially flat.","In Engineered Systems, we anticipate activity and our industrial platform to remain soft due to a challenging macro industrial environment as well as from activity deferrals, as some customers push out order delivery in 2017. We expect our Printing and ID platform to have strong growth. Fluids overall growth will be less than we expected in our prior forecast, driven by continued weak longer cycle oil and gas markets as well as CapEx reductions like integrated energy customers. We expect the strong growth we\u2019ve seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue.","Finally within Refrigeration and Food Equipment, we expect customer spending to slow as we close out the year. We also expect margin challenges to continue as we work to improve manufacturing at Hillphoenix. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today we reported third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion a decrease of 4%. This result included in organic revenue decline of 7% growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%, EPS was $0.83. Segment margin for the quarter was 14.1% below last year largely driven by lower revenue and the impact of acquisitions and production inefficiencies.","Bookings decreased slightly from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in Engineered Systems grew 5%, Refrigeration and Food Equipment grew 6%, while Energy was down 22% and Fluids decreased 9%. Overall book-to-bill finished at 0.99.","Our backlog increased 4% to $1.1 billion or 1% organically. Fresh cash flow was $189 million for the quarter or 11% of revenue. We remain on track to generate free cash flow roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 4.","Engineered Systems organic revenue increased 1% reflecting solid growth in printing identification partially offset by soft industrial markets. Refrigeration and Food Equipments declined 2% driven by tough comps and can-shaping equipment and softer customer spending in retail refrigeration. Fluids organic decline of 9% was largely driven by upstream and midstream oil and gas exposure tough comps and lower than expected growth in retail fueling. Energy organic revenue was down 24%. As seen on the chart acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at fluids with 27%.","Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $273 million decreased 25%, on a sequential basis revenue increased 5% driven by our upstream drilling and artificial lift businesses. Earnings of $13 million included restructuring cost of $5 million. Adjusting for these costs earnings were $18 million and margin was 6.8% in line with our expectations and sequentially improved.","Current quarter activity, order activity remains positive and we believe we\u2019re on track to exit the year with margin near 10%. Bookings were $271 million, a 10% sequential improvement. Book-to-bill finished at 0.99.","Now on Slide 6. Engineered Systems revenue of $571 million was up 1% organically. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5% principally reflecting the impact of a disposition and also impacted by business mix. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue of $253 million increased to 11%. Organic revenue was up 5% reflecting solid global marketing and coding and strong digital printing activity. Acquisitions added 7% growth.","In the Industrial Platform revenue was $317 million which included in organic decline of 2%. The organic revenue decline was fairly broad based and also reflected activity deferrals into the first quarter at environmental solutions. Margin was 17% and 80 basis point decline. Bookings of $580 million were up 3% which included organic growth of 5% in both platforms. Book-to-bill for Printing and Identification was 0.98, industrial book-to-bill was 1.04, overall book-to-bill was 1.02.","Now on Slide 7. Within Fluids revenue increased 17% to $413 million while earnings decreased 12% to $66 million. Revenue performance reflects 27% growth from acquisitions partially offset by a 9% decline in organic revenue. The organic result was driven by declines in our longer cycle upstream and midstream oil and gas businesses and tough comps reflecting $18 million in project shipments last year that did not repeat.","In addition spending from certain integrated energy customers particularly in retail fueling was lower than anticipated. This decline was partially offset by very strong results in our hygienic and pharma markets. Margin declined 530 basis points reflecting lower organic volume and the impact of acquisitions and deal cost.","Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 16%, this result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions on an organic basis, bookings declined 9%. Book-to-bill was 1.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration and Food Equipments revenue was $451 million included an organic revenue decline of 2%. Earnings of $64 million declined 16% from the prior year largely driven by production challenges at Hillphoenix, the impact of the disposition and product mix.","The organic revenue decline was largely driven by tough comps in our can-shaping business. Margin was 14.2%, a 140 basis points below last year. Within this result production inefficiencies at Hillphoenix were $6 million or about 130 basis points of the decline. Bookings of $429 million were flat year-over-year and included organic growth of 6%. Organic growth was largely driven by strong order activity in our can-shaping business which will be shipped in 2017. Book-to-bill was 0.95.","Let\u2019s go to the overview Slide on Page 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $27 million and net interest expense was $33 million both largely in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 28% generally in line with expectations. CapEx was $43 million in the quarter.","Now moving to Slide 10 which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted to reflect reduced forecast. We now expect total revenue to decrease 4% to 5%. Within this estimate organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%. We continue to expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth partially offset by dispositions and FX. From a segment perspective, Energy\u2019s organic decline is essentially unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect further sequential revenue improvement into the fourth quarter.","Fluids and Engineered Systems full year organic revenue forecast had both been reduced two points. We now expect Fluids to decline 6% to 7% and Engineered Systems to be flat to 1% growth for the year. The Refrigeration and Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered three points and now is negative one to flat.","With regard to margin, we now expect adjusted margin to be around 14.1% this excludes restructuring and deal and other cost.","Turning to 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let\u2019s start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring cost in 2016 to be about $0.05. Performance including changes in volume, productivity, pricing, restructuring, benefits will impact earnings $0.73 to $0.71. This has reduced $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior forecast. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.11 to $0.09 reflecting a roughly $0.09 reduction from our prior forecast.","Acquisitions less dispositions is $0.05 lower than our last forecast. Reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions and also softer retail fueling activity. In total, net acquisitions will be about $0.07 accretive.","Lastly the combined impact of interest corporate expense and the tax rate has been adjusted $0.01 from our prior forecast. In total we expect 2016 EPS to be $3 to $3.05 down about $0.38 to midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.06 of this reduction is attributable incremental fourth quarter deal and restructuring cost.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts.","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Brad. As I look back over the last 18 months our results certainly haven\u2019t been up to our expectations. That being said, I don\u2019t want to lose sight of the many positive achievements our businesses have made over this time. In Energy, we effectively managed to recycle that saw a US rig count drop from 1,200 to 400 in six quarters.","Through this down cycle we streamlined our business while maintaining strong service levels. We are now very well position to service our customers as activity in North America upstream markets improve. In Engineered Systems, we have expanded our Printing and Identification platform which has historically been a strong performer. Our industrial platform has also performed very well over the last few years, though facing some tough comps this year. I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019ve done in this segment especially with our recent acquisitions.","Within Fluids, we have built a strong plastics and polymer. We are also in the process of building a world class retail fueling business. Our Fluids performance will improve through ongoing integrations and the addition of Wayne.","Lastly, in Refrigeration and Food Equipment, we\u2019ve done a good job diversifying our customer base and growing share with several customers. While this new business has certainly put stress on manufacturing, we have executed well on customer service, quality and delivery times.","As previously noted, we have added scale in several markets where we see strong growth potential. In addition, we\u2019ve further focused our business by divesting non-core assets. In all, our recent acquisitions combined with Wayne will add over $700 million in revenue next year. These deals together with a continuing recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and our commitment to improve margins give me confidence we are on the right path.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. Now Paul let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, we have lots of people in queue so I\u2019d like to remind you - please you get one question with one follow-up and with that, Paula if we can have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays","Scott Davis","I\u2019m trying to get sense, I struggle sometimes the model you guys - because when things come back it\u2019s going to be probably pretty darn good. But when Energy comes back is the incremental margin and I\u2019m talking more on upstream stuff. Is the incremental margin higher in 2017 than it was in kind of the good years as to say three years ago or is it lower? And I guess the reason why I\u2019m asking this question is that, does the restructuring mean that you get a higher incremental margin or does that get offset by weaker price?","Bob Livingston","Well I would start first by saying I don\u2019t - with everything we\u2019re looking at with respect to our planning for 2017, we are not assuming that we are going to have price increases.","Scott Davis","Yes, I\u2019m just talking about - did the decreases hurt you, I mean I would assume prices are going to be down in their backlog, right?","Bob Livingston","Yes, we don\u2019t see further price degradation in 2017, Scott but we surely are not planning on price increases. But to the heart of your question with respect to the incremental margins in a recovery phase. I would say in the early months of the recovery let\u2019s say at least the first six months, we are going to be quite diligent and not adding any cost unless they\u2019re absolutely required to service the customer. So I think as we see, a 10%, 15%, maybe even up to a 20% increase in volume. We will not be adding the cost base back like we would have had in 2014. I think as you get behind the flex point of the manufacturing capability and you\u2019ll see us adding some cost. But I think in the first few months of the recovery you\u2019ll see incremental margins that will be quite attractive.","Scott Davis","Yes, okay that\u2019s helpful and then, I know there\u2019s lots of questions so I want to ask quick follow-up on Hillphoenix. What does production inefficiencies really mean? I mean in my world it means volumes are light, you didn\u2019t control cost, but does it mean something different, to you guys?","Bob Livingston","Well no, actually volumes aren\u2019t light, Scott. In fact I was pretty pleased with the bookings at Hillphoenix in the third quarter and I will tell you that maybe I\u2019m being a bit cautious here but the booking, the order rates, the booking rates here in October are coming at a bit stronger than we had anticipated for a normal fourth quarter order run rate.","Brad Cerepak","Seasonally strong.","Bob Livingston","Seasonally strong. So the production inefficiencies have nothing to do with the reduced volume. It\u2019s actually the complexity that we\u2019ve added into the organization with many new customers and smaller product box and I would tell you sort of the fixes and changes that we\u2019re making sort of fall into two key areas. One is little bit better integrity around our comp [ph] bond releases and a little bit better integrity around holding our production schedules once they\u2019re released and that\u2019s been a challenge for the team over the last three or four months.","The guide we have in the fourth quarter. I would like to believe I\u2019m being cautious with this guide with not only the segment but specifically with Hillphoenix, that our guide for the fourth quarter does not assume any further improvements in our production variances beyond what we were running at in September. That said, we continue to work every week, every day to improve the manufacturing flow at Hillphoenix. You want to add anything to that, Brad?","Brad Cerepak","No, I would just say that\u2019s a view versus our expectations and year-over-year the team continues to make progress. I mean I would say the added piece I would say is that the production through the facility year-over-year is not abnormal. And what I mean by that is that, the production cost seem to be fairly in line it\u2019s where our expectations are much higher for further productivity.","Bob Livingston","I\u2019ll give you a number. We measure this with respect to their production variances. The cost for us in the third quarter for these production variances at Hillphoenix was $6 million.","Scott Davis","Okay.","Bob Livingston","It\u2019s a significant number.","Scott Davis","Great answer. Okay, thank you guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Winoker, Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","I want to stick on Hillphoenix for a while. I have been known that business for more than 15 years and they were one of the few folks who were able to make money in this industry, when so many others were bleeding and a lot of that was the magic of the whole business model and you\u2019re talking, I know as you\u2019re making everything more complex or sorry as the customer mix is becoming more complex that is one of the problems that the old guys always had before you took over one of them and others struggle. So is this more than just a small manufacturing fix but rather a whole design for manufacturability and broader fix. I mean I\u2019m just a little more concerned of what I\u2019m hearing.","Bob Livingston","Longer term, we\u2019re looking at I would label it as product design opportunities but that\u2019s not impacting our product flow today. It is just unbelievable how much the, I call it the mix complexity has changed at Hillphoenix over the last six and nine months and as we hit the seasonal ramp period here in late second quarter and in the third quarter that complexity really did hammer us, Steve.","Steve Winoker","Okay, all right well we can maybe dive in later. But and then just on that point, you mentioned $6 million production.","Bob Livingston","And by the way when you Hillphoenix has always made money, look we\u2019re still making money, which is not to our expectations. I\u2019m not just saying my expectations we\u2019re not operating at Hillphoenix\u2019s expectations.","Steve Winoker","Okay, fair enough and just so I\u2019m clear that production variance of $6 million. Is there any way to sort of give us the thought for how much of, I don\u2019t know the year-on-year negative impact came out of these inefficiencies?","Bob Livingston","Well let\u2019s see, I think Brad you shared a comment that margins were down 130 or 140 basis points. Actually I think if you do the math, maybe 120 of the 140 decrease was the $6 million of production variances. Am I close on that number?","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Bob Livingston","In the third quarter and we\u2019re talking third quarter year-over-year.","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Steve Winoker","Okay, I think I used my follow-up question. So I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","So just not to [indiscernible] this too much but just one last question on Refrigeration and Food Equipment. When do you think this gets rectified and does your new production design allow you to then potentially stem share loss and potentially even gain share. So how are you guys thinking about that?","Bob Livingston","Well, your comment about share loss I would say that one is behind us because you\u2019re referring to the loss of the business at Walmart.","Joe Ritchie","Yes, I just look at your trends. I\u2019m sorry.","Bob Livingston","Yes, go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","No, I was just going to say I was just looking at your trends in the most recent quarters and I think they\u2019ve been flat to down depending on which sub-segment we look at and it looks like you\u2019re continuing to lose share in certain pieces of your business and so I\u2019m just curious whether this allows you to potentially stem some of that?","Bob Livingston","Okay and this is a question specific to Hillphoenix.","Joe Ritchie","Correct.","Bob Livingston","Okay, I will tell you that aside from the Walmart global bid that we lost the chunk of business and we have not lost share with other customers, we\u2019ve been gaining share.","Joe Ritchie","Okay.","Brad Cerepak","Keep in mind we do have a disposition in there that you have to take out when you do your comparisons.","Joe Ritchie","Fair enough.","Bob Livingston","[Indiscernible] business was divested in the fourth quarter of last year and if I remember correctly, I think.","Brad Cerepak","[Indiscernible].","Bob Livingston","We can say $85 million to $90 million in sales.","Joe Ritchie","Got it, but I guess in terms of maybe the initial question was, when does it get rectified so maybe some thoughts there?","Bob Livingston","Again, you\u2019re asking a question about the Walmart business.","Joe Ritchie","I\u2019m talking more about the production inefficiencies that contributed to the margin that you.","Bob Livingston","I think you\u2019ll see us having the two key areas that I\u2019ve mentioned here around the integrity of the comp [ph] bond releases and the integrity of the holding the production schedule. I think you\u2019ll see us have that completed here in the three or four months.","Joe Ritchie","Got it and then maybe coming off of refrigeration and food equipment for a second and talking about fluids. If I take a look at the organic orders over the last few quarters they\u2019ve continued to deteriorate. I guess at what stage do you think that this reverses clearly Wayne closes will help you from a growth perspective, but I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re feeling about 2017 from organic standpoint, where we stand this year?","Bob Livingston","Look the biggest year-over-year decline within fluids that we\u2019ve experienced has been in the applications and the businesses that are either in the upstream or the midstream oil and gas markets. And when I shared that comment I\u2019m including what we would label internally as our transportation activity around railcar, tank cars as well as terminal loading arms. And the bulk of that decline has been in North America, that decline has been fairly significant. I think year-over-year if I rolled all of that together it\u2019s probably down about 23%, 25% and it\u2019s about this oil and gas exposure is about 22%, 23% of the segment when I include transportation.","We\u2019re not expecting any recovery in the fourth quarter that I can tell you. I think the outlook for 2017 in this part of the business is going to be dependent upon further recoveries in the upstream oil and gas market and I think we\u2019ll have a better feel for that as we move through the fourth quarter.","Joe Ritchie","Got you. I\u2019ll get back in queue, thanks guys.","Bob Livingston","We will provide our outlook and some detail in this part of the business at our investor dinner in December.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, good enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Maybe just a little more color on Fluids in terms of the Fluids transfer business. You know I think Joe asked about, it did weaken this quarter versus last quarter a little bit more that particular business. You guys have mentioned big integrated not spending in the past you mentioned Canadian OPW\u2019s weakness and then of course Tokheim you were setting some improvement in the second half of the year. It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s materialized as much as you thought, so maybe you can talk about the pieces of fluid transfer.","Bob Livingston","Okay, so across the board within fluid transfer. No actually I don\u2019t want to say across the board because in the couple of our businesses that deal with hygienic and pharma markets, their order activity and business activity is up actually quite strong. I think its high single digits 8% or 9%. The bulk of the headwinds that we have experienced this year and again I\u2019m repeating myself from Joe\u2019s question have been in the upstream and midstream oil related markets. The North American retailing fueling market and this is not Tokheim, this is now OPW we\u2019ve had growth in North America but it\u2019s been less than we expected and I think third quarter growth year-over-year for North America retail fueling this is the OPW legacy business. I think was 6%.","That said, North Canada was significantly lower than we expected and it ended up being a decline in spending the customers or from customers in Canada. Tokheim, I think we\u2019re probably going to end the year. The second half will come in fairly close to our expectations of Tokheim that we had in July but we do see some changes. Middle East is softer than we were looking at three months ago. China has degraded a bit but not much. I\u2019m talking a $1 million or $2 million but it hasn\u2019t changed that much since the July call and absent my comment or excluding my comment on the Middle East. European activity has had growth with Tokheim during the second half. Do you want to add anything?","Brad Cerepak","Yes, I would interject on there. I think from our last views on Tokheim we probably see a softer sales number now for the year of about $10 million to $15 million and it\u2019s impacting us about $0.02 in the acquisition line but as Bob said it\u2019s really more the emerging markets part of Tokheim.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay that\u2019s helpful but maybe just on \u201817. I\u2019m not asking for guidance but if you look at sort of the non-organic pieces just sort of puts and takes. You\u2019ve got lower restructuring spends in 2017, incremental restructuring savings, your auto aftermarket acquisition and Wayne potentially coming in, Tokheim more accretive given the deal cost go down there\u2019s just a lot of moving pieces. Are there any sort of advice you could give us on how to model the pieces and then it looks like competition indefinitely came down significantly this year that headwind next year.","Brad Cerepak","Well there\u2019s - we\u2019ll have a lot to say about.","Bob Livingston","I\u2019m glad to get the question because I told Brad we\u2019re not give guidance today.","Brad Cerepak","We have a lot to say in December but you\u2019re right. I mean I would echo some of things you\u2019re saying. And we do see a lower restructuring spend next year. We expect 40 to 44 this year, we always have restructuring so not giving guidance today but it\u2019s always been put aside tough markets 15 to 20.","Bob Livingston","15 to 20, yes.","Brad Cerepak","So that will be lower, we have carryover benefits on restructuring which will take us into 2017 my rough number would say that\u2019s about $30 million. I think we\u2019ve said that before, we still see that as an opportunity. You\u2019re right the acquisitions will be better for us next year. We do have Wayne slipping out now best estimate its first quarter, we were hopeful to get that done this year and get some of the final expenses and not only the final expenses but I would say the early amortization step ups through the P&L and the first part of the fourth quarter here, that will now hit us in 2017. And I think there will be a lot more to talk about in terms of the integration and the synergy benefits there as we get into December, but too early really to pin point a number, we have to first close the deal.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on fourth quarter. Seasonally Q4 is usually below Q3 and I appreciate there was some idiosyncratic things in Q3 but we\u2019re modelling Q4 in line with Q3 and I was just wondering if you could give us big buckets as to what the sequential positives are and specifically also want to understand if you sort of highlighted lower compensation and investments versus your prior guidance, how much of that is in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?","Brad Cerepak","Well I\u2019ll take the last one, first and then Bob can talk sequentially, but probably the segment would be best. You know that compensation, when you think about that investment and comp line, I would say half of it is comp, half of it is just holding back on some adds that we would have normally have done this time of year going into next year. And I would say it\u2019s 50-50 split between the third and the fourth, we trueup [ph] comp accruals every quarter and so year-to-date updated that during the third quarter and you\u2019ll see a little bit of that coming through in the fourth on that comp line. As far as.","Bob Livingston","Okay with respect to sequential trends third to fourth. We expect Energy to be up a bit on the top line more than that improvement on the bottom line. We expect Fluids to continue to have growth sequentially into the fourth quarter and.","Brad Cerepak","4%.","Bob Livingston","Yes and I would tell you that the bulk of not all of it, but a significant chunk of it maybe 60% of the growth we\u2019re seeing in fluids from the third to the fourth is retail fueling.","Brad Cerepak","We have growth in MOG [ph] pump too.","Bob Livingston","And MOG [ph] pump. DES will be up, but I would say that\u2019s probably all related to the acquisition, I think organically, DES is probably flat. We\u2019ll see continued growth in our product ID platform and maybe very modest decline organically in our industrial platform and refrigeration segment is down but it always is, it\u2019s seasonally down.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question. You made comments on broad sort of industrial weakness and I appreciate you\u2019ve given some color. At the same time if you look at the Product ID, those short cycle more consumer driven businesses seem to be doing well, just from a 40,000 foot view what\u2019s happening in the economy because it seems a lot of other industrials have had weak second half of September.","Bob Livingston","Yes, you pulled out a good example here with our Product ID business especially [indiscernible] and number one I think we commented on this a couple times earlier this year with respect to both China, what we\u2019ve seen in China over the last couple of years and in Europe and I think we\u2019re seeing it here in the states, here over the last six months or so a clear difference in customer spending of what I call OpEx items versus CapEx items and I label our market and coating business as an OpEx item.","It is interesting when you look at our order trends during the third quarter what did give me some pause as we close the quarter, was September order rates were actually less than August. That\u2019s a bit unusual for us. We have really peeled that to try to understand what\u2019s going on and where we\u2019re seeing it, but and again I\u2019m going to repeat it September order rates were less than August, that\u2019s giving us a little bit. I call it pause for I guess maybe I hope what proves to be a bit of a cautious approach with respect to our fourth quarter guidance.","If I were to share with you some early reads here in October. October order trends are actually a little bit better than we expected.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Bob Livingston","And that\u2019s across the board. I would tell you something else we started to see here in the second quarter or in the third quarter. Not only with orders that were in our backlog but with new orders, we can pretty easily circle about $50 million of revenue that was expected to ship either in the third quarter or the fourth quarter where customers have pushed it out to 2017. It\u2019s not anything significant with any individual business but collectively the number surprise me.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan","Steve Tusa","So just wanted to make sure I got the fluid. You said revenue is up 4% sequentially in 4Q and so I guess is ultimately and I\u2019m not sure what base you were talking about with Tokheim, but what\u2019s the actual revenue number you\u2019re thinking about with Tokheim, this year?","Bob Livingston","I don\u2019t have it with me, Brad.","Steve Tusa","Well you said, you tweaked it by $10 million to $15 million, so it\u2019s kind of specific comment, that\u2019s all.","Bob Livingston","Yes, but you asked me for total number and I don\u2019t have that here with me right now.","Brad Cerepak","Yes, well it\u2019s going to be Steve around $230 million to $240 million. It\u2019s down significantly due to the emerging markets mainly China as we talked about before. Sequentially Tokheim had second quarter into third quarter 13% growth rate, this is the seasonality of that business and we see that continuing into the fourth quarter with about 10% sequentially on Tokheim specifically 4%.","Bob Livingston","For the segment.","Brad Cerepak","For the segment, that\u2019s on the strength of some tenders we won, we\u2019ll see them ship in the fourth quarter into 2017 by the way. So 2017 in Tokheim I think will have better comps, a better opportunity for us.","Steve Tusa","Okay and then just a quick follow-up by, that\u2019s great color by the way on the fourth quarter. On refrigeration and food, your margins have kind of they treaded [ph] down this quarter, they were down even adding back their production inefficiencies, I mean will you be able to grow margins at this business in the fourth quarter and also, has Kroger gotten into you guys as far as giving you any indication of what they\u2019re going to spend in 2017 or does that come kind of later in the year?","Bob Livingston","We have an indication, but we don\u2019t get enough, I call it specifics until a little bit later in the year. And help me with the number. We did see within the Hillphoenix backlog, I think about a $1 million worth of orders and maybe it may have been bit less but there was something, it wasn\u2019t a bit number but we did see it.","Steve Tusa","How big is Kroger now for you guys, are they almost as big as Walmart?","Bob Livingston","No.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Bob Livingston","A third.","Steve Tusa","And then just quickly 4Q margins for refrigeration directionally because they were down but they were up in the first quarter, so just curious is to how you kind of play that out as you run through these production inefficiencies.","Brad Cerepak","Fourth quarter margins are little bit better.","Steve Tusa","Year-over-year?","Brad Cerepak","Yes.","Steve Tusa","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","A couple things, just on oil back to energy specifically. Just a couple pieces of color I\u2019m looking for. First you commented about long cycle weakness. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s a comment away from the drilling and production numbers in the bearings and compression, can you just elaborate on that first.","Bob Livingston","Well let me, give you a perhaps a better definition of what I refer to when I say our early cycle applications and it really is drilling and artificial lift, Jeff. When I label our early cycle applications, our longer cycle applications yes is bearings and compression as well as our wench business.","Jeffrey Sprague","So are you seeing further downward pressure specifically in the gas driven market?","Bob Livingston","This is not deteriorated since the second quarter. And our bearings and compression business and third and fourth quarter, we actually see a very, very modest. In fact it\u2019s so modest, you have to call it flat. Flat performance from the third to the fourth and our bearings and compression business and slightly improved margins.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then back to the early cycle stuff on the drilling and production side, what are you seeing now on production, completion specifically, is there an uptick in completion activity with kind of wells here with, kind of five handle any real inflection in those two there?","Bob Livingston","Yes, there was an increase in activity in the third quarter on the completion of wells. Let me give you a data point here at comp. so if I look at rig count, second quarter to third quarter and my number is going to be the poorly average from second quarter to third quarter. The rig count was up I think 14% and in our early cycle applications around drilling and artificial lift combined, the growth in that part of the business was almost identical to the increase in the rig count. It correlated very, very well, Jeff.","We would expect that correlation to hold true for October and November as well. We\u2019re being a bit cautious here in our outlook for energy with respect to the month of December. We have some concerns that we are going to see something similar to last year, when customers went really quite for the last two weeks of December and in fact many of our customers actually did not take product delivery at all through the final two weeks of the year.","I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to see that same phenomenon again this year, but we do expect a little bit of slowing in activity in December and it\u2019s not connected to rig count per se, it\u2019s just connected to customer spending and I call it balance sheet management.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes, I would have guessed and correct me if I\u2019m wrong but what you said there about you\u2019re up 14 tracking to rig count up 14 implies I guess no net draw down on ducts [ph] in the quarter and I guess I would have thought that in my cap.","Bob Livingston","Okay, there was a net draw down, I don\u2019t have a number but I think it was significant relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the last three or four quarters. I think, the net draw - and we haven\u2019t seen the final data on that. But I think the net draw down on ducts [ph] in the third quarter could be approaching a 1,000 wells. You have to appreciate that 20%, 22% better than 20% I think it maybe 22% or 23% of our artificial lift business is outside of North America and that especially in the Middle East and Latin America in the third quarter, we actually saw, I think a small single-digit decline year-over-year in our non-North American business and our US artificial lift business the, it was a little bit better than the rig count increase.","Jeffrey Sprague","And just finally I\u2019m sorry, if I could sneak one in, you gave us in the bridge kind of the fuel cost impact in Fluids, but can you give us the sense of what the overall mix effects of all the M&A is in Fluids, if you can parse that down to kind of almost the same store sales basis on the core underlying Fluids.","Brad Cerepak","You want core margins, Jeff?","Bob Livingston","Do you want core margins?","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes.","Bob Livingston","So let\u2019s see, we had a.","Brad Cerepak","Core margins, ex-acquisitions.","Bob Livingston","Ex- acquisitions and deal cost 20%.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Yes, we caught a lot of grounds so couple of clean ups from me. So just going back to Andrew\u2019s question about the sort of 30,000 foot macro view, what you hearing from customers? I mean, are we seeing budgets to third or budget cuts or is there some softening in the solution channels, where we are seeing some inventory headwinds, I mean any color there will be very helpful.","Bob Livingston","It depends, I think it somewhat depended upon the sector. I think what we continue to see in our longer cycle, oil and gas applications is continuing budget cuts and I\u2019m not so sure that the customers are actually cutting their CapEx budgets but are being reallocated. We are convinced that\u2019s happening a little bit here in North America with respect to the EMV rollout, even though we in our OPW legacy business have shown organic growth year-to-date and we\u2019ll show it for the year. It is less than expected and we are rather certain that part of that reduction is being diverted to the EMV rollout.","So they\u2019re not necessarily cutting their budgets but reallocating where some of the CapEx spending is going. In the industrial that one\u2019s a tougher one to call, Nigel. The orders do seem to be closing a bit longer, the cycle is a bit longer and as I mentioned earlier the push outs that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months, I made the comment to Brad just recently, we\u2019d go back several years before we would find a quarter really saw that level of push out activity.","Nigel Coe","Yes, that\u2019s the [indiscernible] of my question. I\u2019m just trying to figure out what caused that to happen this quarter as oppose to maybe first half of the year. Yes, okay.","Bob Livingston","I\u2019m not sure, I can answer that question. I can tell you that it\u2019s rather evident right now.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great and then just on the fluids margins. You know in previous calls you call out the impact of acquisitions it\u2019s obviously lot of noise in that number. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us.","Bob Livingston","Let me maybe correct that, when we say ex-acquisition and deal cost, maybe that number is also ex-restructuring. It\u2019s all out, its ex-restructuring acquisitions and deal cost.","Brad Cerepak","So it really is the core margin of the continuing business of fluids.","Nigel Coe","And sorry, what was that core margin again, Brad?","Brad Cerepak","20%.","Nigel Coe","20%, okay that\u2019s helpful.","Brad Cerepak","In the quarter, yes.","Nigel Coe","Right, and then just a quick one on the Energy, you know the comments in your prepared remarks seems to point us to minus 26% or there are about on your full year guide, but then you commented about the December caution. So the reason for the range on energy, the wide range of energy would be because of the December caution perhaps.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Nigel Coe","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC.","Deane Dray","One of the changes that people are talking about in retail refrigeration is the recent announcement that Amazon is planning to move into grocery stores and so what might the prospects be for Hillphoenix this new customer, what the timing might be and are you in discussions with me?","Bob Livingston","Amazon is a customer of Hillphoenix, we are working with them pretty closely on their distribution centers and I know that guys are having discussions on their, I call them their neighbourhood rollout program.","Deane Dray","Any chance you could size for us, what an opportunity that might be and the time out?","Bob Livingston","They can\u2019t even size it for us. Deane. From a timing perspective, I doubt you would see anything measurable in our business before the second half of next year and that\u2019s a guess rate now based upon what little bit we know that\u2019s been shared with us.","Deane Dray","Got it and then on potential divestitures, are you still contemplating others like you did with Tipper Tie, what might the prospects be for those in timing there?","Bob Livingston","So I\u2019ll turn this over to the guy, who runs M&A.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob. I don\u2019t want to say too much about timing on other things but as you know we\u2019ve always communicated that there are parts of the portfolio that given the right opportunity perhaps, we would love to do something once, now that\u2019s the best I could tell you at this point.","Deane Dray","That\u2019s pretty vague, Brad.","Brad Cerepak","I know. I\u2019m not announcing divestitures today. I\u2019m not - announcing any divestitures today.","Deane Dray","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse","Julian Mitchell","Thanks for saving the best to last.","Bob Livingston","We did, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Welcome. I\u2019m glad to hear it. Just on the refrigeration again, really on the top line and I guess there doesn\u2019t seem to have been much linkage so far between the year-on-year change in organic orders and the year-on-year change in organic sales, orders have been trending pretty good I think organically up about 5%.","Bob Livingston","Orders have been strong, yes. Orders have been strong.","Julian Mitchell","So when should that gap start to close because it sounds like Q4 again will be tough for the revenue line, is it all coming in the first half of next year although the visibility is low on that?","Bob Livingston","I would say, you\u2019ll see that gap closed, maybe not all in the first quarter but it will close in the first four months.","Julian Mitchell","Understood and then just within the energy business the pricing pressure I guess has been stable at around 1.8% in the last couple of quarters.","Bob Livingston","[Indiscernible].","Julian Mitchell","That\u2019s the good rate for next year, okay. And that should be the good rate for next year, is that what you meant by no sort of further degradation earlier on.","Bob Livingston","Should not be any worse than that.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thank you, Paula. This concludes our conference call. With that we want to thank you once again for your continued interest in Dover and we will look forward to speaking with you again next quarter and just a reminder, our Investor Day will be in early December and we will send out invitations for that.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our first quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth, broad-based bookings growth and building momentum as we through the quarter. Most notable, fluids delivered 26% growth and Engineered Systems grew 7%. In all, we generated 7% revenue growth and grew EPS 9%.","From a geographic perspective, our U.S. markets were strong. Our European markets continued to show improvement for the third consecutive quarter. Lastly, our China markets moderated sequentially.","Now, let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, we continued to benefit from improving well activity and a modestly increased rig count, especially in the U.S. We should continue to see broad-based growth as the year unfolds driven by increased well completion.","Our bearings and compression markets were very solid and should remain so for the balance of the year. Overall Energy\u2019s results were in line with our expectations going into the quarter.","Within our Engineered Systems segment, we saw strong growth across both platforms. In our Printing & Identification platform, solid growth in both our fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets, complimented by acquisitions resulted in strong performance.","The industrial platform also saw a broad-based revenue growth led by outstanding results and our waste handling and vehicle service markets. Our fluids segment outperformed, where our recent acquisitions plus healthy market conditions were both pumps and fluid transfer resulted in very solid revenue growth.","Our pumps businesses are benefiting from strong demand in the plastics and petrochemical verticals. And first quarter results were boosted by strong project shipments into these markets.","Our refrigeration and food equipment segment results were solid, though slightly below last year and our expectations, is the timing of customer projects impacted the quarter. Our bookings were very strong, giving us confidence in this segment\u2019s growth plan for the full year.","Across the segment our customers continue to seek our productivity, energy efficiency and merchandizing solutions that enable them to better compete in their markets.","In all, we were pleased with the start of the year. Business activity was strong and we executed well in our strategy. We continue to focus on growth through international expansion and acquisitions. The most notable initiatives were adding resources for artificial lift in Australia and the Middle East and the acquisition of companies in the digital print space.","Regarding near-term business activity, we expect ongoing solid performance in Energy, driven by the continuing increase in well activity, continued growth in Engineered Systems driven by improved U.S. industrial trends and expanded global sales and service resources in Printing & Identification.","Strong results in our fluid markets are the benefits of our recent acquisitions and generally helping global end markets. And greatly improve sequential results in our refrigeration and food equipment markets.","Beyond these near-term trends, macro-trends such as improving U.S. industrial activity and the continuing recovery in Europe will also help drive growth given our geographic business mix.","In addition to an improving macro-environment, we have ample opportunity to improve margin. We are working to drive synergies on our recent acquisitions and are increasing lean and productivity projects. As a result, we do expect stronger margin in the back half of the year as we continue to execute on these plans. Our pipeline remains active and we are working on several small to medium sized deals.","In summary, I\u2019m very pleased with our results. The combination of a strong first quarter, growing bookings and backlog and our positioning with customers, give me great confidence that we will have an outstanding year.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks, Bob, good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported first quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 7%. Organic revenue grew 4% and growth from acquisitions was 3%. Adjusted EPS was $1.1, an increase of 9.","Segment margin for the quarter was 16.7%, a 40-basis point decrease from last year. This result reflects solid execution in our core business and was in line with our expectations. Margin was impacted by recent acquisitions in three of our four segments and in all, had a 70-basis point impact in the quarter.","Bookings increased 5% over the prior year period to $2 billion. This result represents 20% growth in fluids, and 11% growth in Engineered Systems. Bookings increased 2% in refrigeration and food equipment.","Energy bookings decreased 7% primarily driven by tough comps on a large international artificial lift project. Adjusting for this project, Energy bookings increased 5%. Overall, book to bill finished at 1.98, which is in line with seasonal trends. Backlog increased 7% to $1.5 billion.","Now turning to slide 4. Fluids grew 14% organically driven by strong markets and project related activities in plastics and petrochemical. Energy grew 4% on the strength of drilling activity.","Engineered Systems also grew 4% with broad-based growth across both platforms. Refrigeration and food equipment declined 3% largely the result of project timing with our customers. Overall organic revenue growth was 4%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 3%, comprised of 11% in fluids, 3% Engineered Systems, and 1% in Energy.","Now turning to slide 5 on our sequential results. Revenue was essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter where strong sequential growth of 5% in energy was largely offset by a 4% decrease in refrigeration and food equipment.","Sequential bookings grew 8% largely in line with our normal seasonal pattern as all segment showed growth. Engineered Systems bookings growth was 11% broad-based across both platforms. And refrigeration and food equipments increased 10% driven by normal seasonality in our refrigeration markets. Energy bookings increased 9%, with growth in all end markets. Lastly, fluids bookings were up 3%.","Now on slide 6. Energy revenue of $479 million increased 4% in earnings of $119 million were unchanged. Energy produced another solid quarter with revenue growth in both our drilling and production in bearings and compression end markets.","Within drilling and production, growth was driven by improving well activity, especially Shale related, though partially offset by weak winch markets. Operating margin of 24.8% was down 90 basis points from last year, in line with our expectations.","Bookings were $478 million, a 7% decrease from the prior year. Solid growth in bearings and compression was offset by tough comps in drilling and production, principally reflecting lumpy orders related to a large international artificial lift project. As reported, book to bill was one. Adjusting for this project, book to bill was 1.04 representing 5% growth.","Now turning to slide 7. Engineered Systems had an excellent quarter, where sales increased 7% to $650 million and earnings of $92 million were up 11%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue increased 11% to $264 million, driven by broad-based organic growth of 5% in recent acquisitions.","In the industrial platform, revenue grew 5% to $386 million reflecting 4% organic growth. Our waste handling and vehicle service markets were particularly strong in this platform. Continued strong execution and cost reduction activities drove operating margin to 14.2%, up 40 basis points, reflecting solid leverage on volume.","Bookings were $710 million, an increase of 11%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 19% to $283 million boosted by recent acquisitions and strong execution in the U.S. and China. Industrial bookings increased 5% to $428 million reflecting broad-based growth.","Book to bill for Printing & Identification was 1.07, while industrials was a strong 1.11. Overall, segment book to bill was 1.09.","Now on slide 8. Fluids posted an excellent quarter, where sales increased 26% to $345 million and earnings of $58 million were up 22%. Revenue was driven by strong organic growth of 14% across the segment with particular strength in our oil and gas and plastics and petrochemical end-markets. Our five recent acquisitions, contributed 11% growth.","Segment margin was 16.8%, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior year. Recent acquisitions aside, our core business performed extremely well in the quarter and achieved 20% margin on strong volume leverage.","We expect overall segment margin to improve in the coming quarters, as we progress on the integration of these recently acquired companies.","Bookings were $363 million, an increase of 20% driven by continued solid demand across most end markets and recent acquisitions. Book to bill was a solid 1.05.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 9. Refrigeration and food equipment generated revenue of $411 million down 3% from the prior year and earnings of $45 million, a decrease of 14%. Revenue was impacted by the timing of orders in both refrigeration and food equipment markets especially early in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, refrigeration shipments began to accelerate. We expect that momentum to continue into the seasonally strong second quarter.","Operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 10.9%. This result reflects good execution on lower volume and $5 million of one-time items in the prior year.","Bookings were $494 million, an increase of 2%. Book to bill ended at a seasonally strong 1.20.","Now going to the overview slide on page 10. First quarter net interest expense was $33 million, up $2 million from last year and in line with expectations. Corporate expense decreased $3 million to $31 million, largely reflecting reduced pension expense.","Our first quarter tax rate was 30.7% excluding discrete tax benefits, in line with our prior forecast. Capital expenditures were $33 million in the quarter.","Lastly, we repurchased 3.6 million shares for approximately $293 million in the quarter, completing our $1 billion program.","Moving to slide 11. Our guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2014 organic revenue growth to be broad-based at 3% to 4% with all segments prior forecast on track for the year. Completed acquisitions will add 3%. In total, we expect full year revenue growth of 6% to 7% and segment margin to be about 18%.","Corporate expense will be about $123 million, interest expense remained $133 million. Our full year tax rate is anticipated to be around 31%. CapEx should be about 2.5% of revenue and we expect our free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue.","Now, turning to the bridge on slide 12. The bridge is largely consistent with our last forecast. We\u2019ve increased acquisition slightly to reflect our recent activity. We have also made minor adjustments in a few other categories, now that we have a quarter of accruals (ph) behind us. In total, we expect 2014 EPS to be $4.60 to $4.80. This represents 9% growth at the midpoint.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob, for some final thoughts.","Bob Livingston","Thanks, Brad. 2014 is off to an excellent start. We delivered solid revenue and earnings growth, and also saw strong quarter activity. Overall, I like our positioning and our serve to markets, and we continue to execute on our growth initiatives. Some of which are within our Energy segment, you\u2019ll see the continuing push to grow outside the U.S. especially in artificial lift.","We also have ample opportunity to grow our core business by expanding our presence in faster growing basins, and increasing our application coverage in bearings and compression.","In Engineered Systems, we plan on expanding our verticals served in Printing & Identification beyond our core fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets. Our strategy in the industrial platform is all about delivering customer productivity solutions. The focus is on reducing labor, improving safety and ultimately allowing our customers to compete more effectively.","Fluids, has a large opportunity to expand into international markets and is targeting significant growth in markets outside North America and Europe. In addition, fluids intends to push their station in a box, retail fueling solution, expand our hygienic pump presence and pursue cross-selling opportunities into the North American plastics and oil and gas markets.","In refrigeration and food equipment, we are pursuing a growth strategy that targets our customers\u2019 needs for productivity, energy efficiency and enhanced merchandizing systems to drive performance. As an example, we launched a reengineered refrigeration door package, which will provide an even faster payback to our customers on close the case projects.","In addition, several of our businesses are releasing new products, especially in food equipment, which will enable us to expand on our already strong positions. In all, I am more confident than ever about our positioning and long-term prospects.","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.","With that Paul, let\u2019s take some questions.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks, Bob. (Operator Instructions). And Jackie, if we can have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Our first question comes from the lines of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. I just had a question on refrigeration and food equipment. You had margins down a fair amount in Q1. But at the same time, you talked about sales trends improving in recent months. So, I just wondered how comfortable you were with the outlook for a sort of a flattish margin for the full year in that segment.","Bob Livingston","Actually, the order activity in refrigeration and food equipment was quite healthy in the first quarter. And Julian, as we look at the second quarter, second quarter starts this, I call it the middle of the year, a seasonal ramp especially for Hill Phoenix. And I would tell you that we are very, very well loaded at Hill Phoenix for the second quarter. And I feel pretty confident on their plan, both on revenue and margins for the year.","Your specific question about margins in the first quarter, if you were to back out and Brad commented on this in his script, if you were to back out of the first quarter of last year, I think it\u2019s the $5 million of one-time net gains. The first quarter margins are pretty similar to last year. And we feel very good about our plan here in the segment for the year.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it, thanks. And then within, just my follow-up is on the Energy business. You talked on the last call about some weakness in the sucker rods in parts of the U.S. I just wanted to check if that weakness is all kind abated now? And how you\u2019re feeling about your sort of forecast for the year on energy in terms of the rig count?","Bob Livingston","Okay. So, you\u2019ve got two questions here, rig count and sucker rod activity. Sucker activity here in the U.S. recovered nicely. And I don\u2019t know what the growth rate is year-over-year or sequentially that\u2019s going to get into some detail here. But we were quite pleased with the artificial lift activity in the U.S. especially around sucker rods in the first quarter.","Rig count, we came into the year looking at a rig count average for the U.S. of I think it was 1,760 some units, essentially flat with the average for 2013. It\u2019s been up a bit and I call it the second half of the first quarter, and coming into April, up above our expectations for that period. We\u2019ve actually raised our average now for the year to almost 1,800 units, about 2% increase. And we\u2019re feeling pretty positive about the energy outlook for the balance of the year.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Paul Goldberg","Hi, Joe.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, well, my first question is on fluids. If I heard you correctly I think the organic growth for the quarter was 14% and it was driven predominantly by petrochem and plastics growth. But then your guidance for the year is 4% to 5% organic growth. And so it clearly implies a pretty significant step down. And so, just help me understand that a little bit?","Bob Livingston","I think you just summarized it very well Joe. We had a great first quarter. The organic growth rate as you said was 14%, don\u2019t expect that from us in the second, third and fourth quarters. I think that the balance of the year is going to be a little bit closer to our guidance for the year.","I would tell you that their performance in their first quarter on revenue and supported by the booking activity in the first quarter would perhaps want to see us increase our forecast for the year. And I\u2019m reluctant to do that at this point in time. I\u2019d like to see how the order rates develop here through the first half or at least April and May here in the second quarter. But obviously with that first quarter performance, we feel quite bullish on fluids for the year.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","All right, that\u2019s helpful there. And just a follow-up on bookings, you had a good quarter, I think the book to bill was 1.09. Was there any impact for that book to bill from the acquisitions that came through this quarter or is that an organic book to bill?","Bob Livingston","No, that includes the acquisition that includes the acquisition activity from 2013. I actually hear right now Joe, I do not know what the organic book to bill was.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. I can follow-up with Paul on that one.","Bob Livingston","Yes.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And I guess, one last question. Really I guess on free cash flow, it seems like Q1 tends to be seasonally pretty well quarter, it seems fairly weak this quarter. You guys did not change the guidance. I\u2019m just kind of thinking about your free cash flow generation now as a standalone entity and how I should think of that moving forward, it\u2019s just a 11% of sales, the right way to think of free cash flow over the long term for you guys or perhaps some color there would be very helpful?","Bob Livingston","Yes, well, we agree with you the first quarter was little bit lower than I think we would have expected going into the year. But that doesn\u2019t change our views about the cash generation of the portfolio in the company. We do see sometimes impacts as revenue ramps up, ramps down, you\u2019ll see that through into the second quarter for normal seasonality. But we feel very confident with the 11% for the year.","If you look at our profile, our profile is a company that generates most of the cash from the tail end of the year, that\u2019s just way the second and third quarter is usually setup and the fourth quarter being lower than those. And a high collection type of period for us. In the long run we feel confident on that 11% number.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, good morning.","Bob Livingston","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes. So, just going back to the book to bill ratio, if 1.2 for refrigeration very strong. I mean, obviously it\u2019s here with about 1 in 1Q but just in terms of some loan refrigeration on the new basis, 1.2. Would you say that\u2019s normal or would we say that\u2019s actually better than what you normally see?","Bob Livingston","Maybe a bit better than the average. But let me share something else with you, Nigel. And I don\u2019t have this on all of the businesses, but I tend to watch this one pretty closely here in the first quarter. Book to bill for Hill Phoenix, all in, all of it for Hill Phoenix was a very healthy 1.3 in the first quarter.","And that, I share that data point with you and others because my comment and my script was at least, we feel very, very confident about our upcoming \u2013 we\u2019re into it now. Our seasonal ramp here with Hill Phoenix in the second and third quarters. We see some nice things happening at this business.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So, does that mean that some of these retail projects that have been pushed, that were pushed in the second half of the year, are coming through. And what does that \u2013 is there a read here for the board of U.S. economy in your view?","Bob Livingston","Well, I would, if you wanted a read on the U.S. economy across the Dover business profile, I would probably point more to our industrial businesses rather than the retail grocery activity.","Your comment, your question here about some of the project referrals, Nigel, these were fairly modest, I\u2019m talking $7 million, $8 million or $9 million of business activity that we would have expected in the first quarter has been shifted to either second or third quarter, it\u2019s actually a rather modest number.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, okay. And then just wanted to come back to the comment on fluids margins of 20% plus acquisitions, I believe that 1Q seems to be your lowest margin quarter from your perspective 1Q and 4Q, the 2Q, 3Q better. So, I\u2019m actually wondering?","Bob Livingston","I could work with that.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Once we get beyond this M&A dilution, can you think the 20% plus is a good run rate for maybe 3Q, 4Q?","Bob Livingston","Well, I think I\u2019ve even commented on this in the January call Nigel, when we gave our initial guidance. We still have, we still have a target for the year of about 18% margins.","The second half is going to be stronger than the first half, the first half is truly taking some of the, I call it the headwind from the early days and the integration cost of some of our recent acquisitions. But it\u2019s also carrying some of the weight of a couple or three large I call them productivity projects that we\u2019ve launched in the second half of last year.","And are really in, I call it the execution mode here in the first half. And that\u2019s around Energy being one and refrigeration and food equipment being the second one. But we remain quite confident with our second half outlook on an up-tick in margins.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Good morning, guys.","Bob Livingston","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Hi, maybe just one quick follow-up on that I mean, on this acquisition impact, I mean, how much of that in the fluid margins is sort of permanent acquisition cost that\u2019s going to just remain in terms of amortization or otherwise, in terms of those GAAP to the 20%?","Bob Livingston","Oh my goodness, you\u2019re good again to the detail here. I\u2019m going to have to defer to Brad. Brad shared with you in his comments that absent to the acquisition activity in fluids, operating margins were 20%.","I wouldn\u2019t label, I would not label 20% as non-sustainable or unsustainable with respect to the core business. Now, the acquisitions we\u2019ve made out, what is it, four or five in this segment, just in the last nine or actually in the last six months. Each one of them is a little bit different.","The profile of each is different and the timeline of moving those recent acquisitions to the point where they are either neutral or perhaps even accretive to second margins, it\u2019s a little bit different. But we did increase obviously.","Brad Cerepak","Yeah, so maybe another way to answer because I don\u2019t have that data with me is that, the acquisitions in the first quarter specific to the total company and in fluids was dilutive to our EPS. And as we\u2019ve stepped through the year, it becomes accretive. And you saw on our bridge that we expect to have $0.05 to $0.07 of performance out of those acquisitions.","The key point is that, the integration is going to take some time. And I would think in the fluids business, we won\u2019t see the margins come up to more our level or our standard until \u201815.","Bob Livingston","Until \u201815, yes.","Brad Cerepak","So there will be a drag on those margins through the whole year.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay. In Printing & ID, I mean, do you have the organic revenue and order numbers for Printing & ID and just also maybe a little color on how you think you\u2019re doing after you\u2019ve kind of reinvested in some of the product portfolio there?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Organic for Printing & ID for quarter one was 4%. Actually I would share with you to me the real success story in Printing & ID in the first quarter was Mark Mommage (ph). And now that I share with you that organic growth at Mark Mommage (ph) in the first quarter was quite healthy, 6%.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay.","Bob Livingston","And we were quite pleased to see where it came from. We had some nice road at Mark Mommage (ph) in the first quarter in the U.S. market and the China market as well as South America. We continue to see the strength in Europe that we have seen over the past couple of quarters at Mark Mommage (ph). But the results in the first quarter were really led by China and the U.S.","Paul Goldberg","Yes, Shannon, just to be clear. In Printing & ID, the organic growth was 5% in the industrial platform the organic growth was 4%. There was a little bit of lack in there too but that was the pure organic growth numbers.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","And then, Paul, do you happen to have any order organic number?","Paul Goldberg","I don\u2019t have that right now but I\u2019ll have it when we talk later.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Bob Livingston","Hi Jeff.","Brad Cerepak","Hi Jeff.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Bob, I wonder if you could just address kind of managerial bandwidth now on the M&A front. For example, if I think about what\u2019s going on in fluid? Are those guys kind of full up on what they can handle for a year or two or are you still comfortable doing deals in there or should we expect kind of your activity would be oriented somewhere else in the portfolio?","Bob Livingston","Well, our pipeline is fairly well spread among the segments. But Jeff, included in our pipeline, we\u2019ve got some deals that we are pursuing in the fluids segment. The acquisition activity were smaller ones, but the acquisition activity in fluids over the last six months or so, have actually been fairly well split between our pumps businesses and our fluid transfer businesses. It\u2019s not all with one management team. And we do have more bandwidth for acquisitions.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","All right. And we should expect you to kind of modulate between share repurchase in deals this year depending on the case at which deals materialize. Is that a fair statement?","Bob Livingston","That\u2019s a fair statement.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And then I guess, finally from me, could you just interest pricing in Hill Phoenix if you said anything I missed it. But with this piece of order activity, is there actually some positive price in the business and to what extent?","Bob Livingston","My comment wouldn\u2019t even just be restricted to Hill Phoenix, Jeff. I would tell you that sort of across the board for Dover, I would label pricing as pretty gone neutral.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay, neutral overall.","Bob Livingston","Neutral overall.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay, thank you.","Bob Livingston","Including with Hill Phoenix, but if I say if that would be a fairly standard comment that we would use with all four segments.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay, thank you, Bob.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Bob Livingston","Hi, John.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning, John.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And by the way, just as a follow-up on the pricing point. Would that apply to the backlog as well, was there any discernible price notation in the backlog within any of the segments or any?","Brad Cerepak","No concern on pricing, John.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Probably mentioned Mark Mommage (ph) in China was good. What moderated in China, because it seems that what\u2019s happening in China, it\u2019s less about macro and it\u2019s more company specific, some better, some are worse. Could you provide a little more color on what you see there?","Bob Livingston","I don\u2019t remember this I don\u2019t remember our organic growth rate in China. I know that our all-in growth rate in China was I think 6% for the quarter. Well, still pretty healthy, but for us it\u2019s a bit of moderation.","And I would tell you that when we define it as a bit of a moderation we\u2019re going to describe some project shipments on food equipment, especially around some of our can making equipment that was absent in the first quarter. And we saw some nice activity in that business area in 2013. If you look at the other businesses that are quite active for us in China, be it Mark Mommage (ph), be it some of our fluid businesses, activity was pretty solid.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That makes sense. Bob, I think you were at a conference recently, you mentioned that Energy and refrigeration could outperform your organic growth targets. The Energy makes sense but what about refrigeration, I realize you made earlier comments this call, that you see a better sort of line of sight to improvement as the year progresses. But we are down sort of, we have a pretty low start for the year. Can you just maybe add to why \u2013 what\u2019s your confidence there?","Bob Livingston","Okay. Well, don\u2019t \u2013 I would caution you to not overreact to a negative revenue comp number for the first quarter for this segment, we\u2019ve seen that before. And that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual. The \u2013 I look at energy and I see the rig count and drilling activity, especially in the U.S. being a little bit healthier and stronger than we had embedded in our forecast and our guidance in the beginning of the year.","And that gives me a little bit of confidence that maybe there is a tailwind against behind our forecast for the year there than we had believed was there at the beginning of the year.","And our refrigeration and food equipment segment, I\u2019m going to tell you just, let\u2019s see how the second quarter unfolds here. We are watching pretty closely our order rates. And I\u2019ll repeat myself, I feel very bullish on their opportunities for 2014.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, that\u2019s fair. One final one from me, the drivers of energy, globally seemed pretty good artificial lift, Middle East, the well count that you described. I think actually there is a perception that your Energy margins, admittedly are sure very robust and very healthy but they\u2019re not, they just don\u2019t have a ton of upside. Why again is that the case, if you\u2019ve got really solid organic growth coming through, is it \u2013 just remind us as next is it reinvestment back into the business, because I know you\u2019re restructuring it nor as to get some cost benefit? Why just big picture, Bob or Brad, your Energy margins is not going higher over it\u2019s not?","Bob Livingston","Brad could probably give you a more detailed response that I\u2019m prepared to give you. But I think we\u2019ve been sharing this message around margins with the Energy business for goodness, at least 18 months now that we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunity and we pursue these opportunities to increase our operating margins within the segment at the individual businesses.","We will see some noise from quarter to quarter or from period to period based upon product mix. But we continue to have opportunities to increase the margins. We are flowing a significant part of that margin improvement back into, I call it people investment and geographic growth initiatives within Energy. And John, you\u2019ll see us continue to do that for the next couple of years.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","Good morning, Bob, Brad, Paul.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Brad Cerepak","Hi Nathan.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","If we could go back to I think Bob in your prepared remarks you talked about new product releases in food equipment. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some more color on what they are \u2013 what the timing of that\u2019s likely to be and when you think will have a positive impact on results?","Bob Livingston","Within unified brands, again this is it, the food equipment space, not in the refrigeration space, within unified brands, we\u2019ve got two that I \u2013 two different product launches I can think of sitting here that roll out this year that are both for the fast food restaurant activity.","And on I would tell you, one of them we\u2019ve actually \u2013 we actually believe we\u2019d want a $12 million order placement, it won\u2019t flow through this year but will see the beginning of this order flow here in the second half. And it\u2019s a pretty positive impact on unified brands.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","Great. And just on the productive projects that you talked about in Energy and food equipment, is there any quantification you can give us for that? And is this something that would be unusually large endeavor or is this just something that it\u2019s part of their regular cause of doing business actually?","Bob Livingston","Well, I wouldn\u2019t label the benefit of the projects to be unusually large for us. The projects themselves were probably a little bit larger in scope than what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. But I think I\u2019ve shared this at least on one or two other calls, here in recent quarters.","And one of the big projects was a new facility construction in the Houston area for our energy segment that will be the primary location for one of the businesses in Energy. But it will also, it will also house the Houston operations of three or four other Dover businesses. And the project, by the time we finish it, we end up reducing roof count in the area I think by four or five roof counts.","We\u2019ve done a similar project with in refrigeration especially around Hill Phoenix. And again a large building project in the Atlantic area. It\u2019s complete we\u2019re starting to occupy the facility now. And when the project is complete it will be the primary location for the systems business of Hill Phoenix, the East Coast operations for Anthony and the assured Roman headquarters for one of the other businesses in that segment.","Again the project scope on both of them is a little bit larger than we typically see within Dover, the benefits I don\u2019t remember the exact benefits on both of them. But we\u2019re looking at I think in the range of $2 million to $3 million, $4 million of annual benefits on each of the projects.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, thanks. Just on Energy, maybe you can just talk about, you talked about the large order last year in 1Q. Are there other orders that we should think about that happened in 2013 as we looked at the comps? And Bob, I think you talked about the potential for some large orders in Australia, I mean, at some point this year, maybe your confidence there as well?","Bob Livingston","This question is specific to the energy segment?","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Correct.","Bob Livingston","Okay. So, Brad commented on the large order we had for Australia that we booked in the first quarter of last year. And Brad, you\u2019re going to have to help me. I think that order in the first quarter of last year was $60 million. But there was a second order last year for the Australian lift project that I think occurred like July, third quarter activity.","I have to confess, I really don\u2019t remember the size of that order but I think it was about $40 million. And if you look at the activity for 2014, specific to this \u2013 for this Australian project, the next large order award is anticipated to be made in the latter part of this year. We think it\u2019s going to be in the fourth quarter. And we were \u2013 we think our performance is well and some of the people investments we\u2019ve made here in the first quarter have continued to position us quite well to continue to serve that customer.","Brad Cerepak","Yes. I would just add to that, just an observation that the orders are lumpy but the sales are very steady.","Bob Livingston","That\u2019s true.","Brad Cerepak","For sure, yes.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. And then, maybe just a follow-on with capital allocation, I think you mentioned that there could be some balance between buyback and M&A. Is that going to be more opportunistic or should we expect kind of an ongoing program with buyback?","Bob Livingston","Yes, okay. Look, I think we\u2019d probably give you a little bit more definitive guidance here on share repurchase activity as we get through the second quarter, understand how the pipeline or acquisition pipeline will develop and execute this year.","But don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that we do have an open and outstanding share repurchase authorization as we sit here today. We did complete the $1 billion program in the first quarter. But our open authorization as we sit here today is just a shade under 4 million shares.","You\u2019ll see us use that during the year to keep the existing share count flat if not tweak it down a bit. But that\u2019s how we normally manage that. Anything beyond that activity, I think you\u2019ve got to wait for us to see how the acquisition pipeline develops over the next three or four months.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. And that\u2019s not \u2013 you\u2019re not assuming future buybacks on the guidance correct?","Bob Livingston","Correct. We are not assuming future buybacks. We do know how the weighted average will flow through the year. We\u2019ll naturally take down the share count throughout the year, having completed the $1 billion buyback in the first quarter. That\u2019s just simple averaging.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets.","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, good morning guys.","Bob Livingston","Hi, Charlie.","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","I don\u2019t know if I missed or not, but on the Energy side, did you give the bookings broken out by the drilling production and the bearings business?","Bob Livingston","No, we did not give that. And my goodness, don\u2019t ask me for that, I don\u2019t have.","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, fair enough. It\u2019s some on the fluids business, I mean, in your prepared remarks you talked about some of the growth opportunities and expansion that was going on. It sounded as though that was a fairly significant focus, I mean, maybe more than it\u2019s been previously to my recollection. Is that \u2013 are you focusing on organic there or is that going to be primarily done by M&A or is it split fairly even?","Bob Livingston","No, the comment that I had in my closing remarks about the focus on growing fluids significant growth outside of Europe and North America, that comment is based upon our existing product portfolios, within that segment today.","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay.","Bob Livingston","And keep in mind that the five acquisitions we did in that space are all international deals that we did and we completed that.","Brad Cerepak","And a key part of this.","Bob Livingston","And a key part of our drive for more international growth.","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And then just, one more on your comment on M&A. Can you just remind us when you would find small, medium sized deals kind of what range you\u2019re looking at within those buckets?","Brad Cerepak","Well, let\u2019s just put it this way. I would define the top end of a medium sized deal could be $250 million or $300 million.","Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Bob Livingston","Hi Deane.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi","In the following the no-spin, can you comment on any stranded cost and then what are you thinking about in terms of any other portfolio cleanups that might be next in priority?","Brad Cerepak","Okay. Let me take the first one.","Bob Livingston","Brad can handle stranded cost.","Brad Cerepak","Well, we\u2019ve commented on this in the past. And I would say, we estimated overhead or to stranded cost to be in the range of somewhere between $20 million and $25 million. We have ongoing efforts to take out cost.","But what we\u2019ve said was that some of those costs relate to the very sizable resources we have internationally that we intend to retail even though the Knowles was broadly international, we will continue to keep those resources in places we want to grow into more into international and grow into the overhead.","So the way we think about it is, our goal is to take out about $10 million of those stranded cost. And I think we\u2019re well on our way of doing that.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi","And then for other portfolio cleanups?","Bob Livingston","Look, we\u2019re looking to get the closing here by the end of this quarter or during the second quarter on the sale of our deck business in the U.K. Beyond that we have no processes on divestiture underway.","But Deane, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s an ongoing discussion with \u2013 here with the management team as well as with the board over the next couple or three years, I think it would be normal and expected to see us continue to narrow the scope of Dover. But don\u2019t expect me, but we have nothing underway at this moment.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi","Great. And just last one from me is, if you go back to the Energy side, I don\u2019t mean to pile on. But just to comment about the increase in rig count expectations. And that just brings up this mist that still persists at Dover that you\u2019re so tied to rig count. And it seems as though the industry has changed to where you should be publishing more on wells per rig. But Bob, maybe you just address that?","Bob Livingston","Yes, the wells per rig, is \u2013 well completion is actually the better statistic and metric especially around artificial lift Deane. For the drilling activity, rig count is still a good number to look at for drilling activity.","But for artificial lift and production it is more around well completion. The well is completed per rig. We are going to see some variation on that depending upon the basins that you\u2019re looking at here in North America. But it still to us is an indicator of the activity that\u2019s going on in the North American Energy space.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Global Hunter.","Bob Livingston","Good morning.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter","Hi, thanks and good morning guys. I wonder listening to the call, everything sounds pretty positive across the board, Printing, fluids, refrigeration and Energy. And I just wanted to get a little bit more color on your view for guidance and why you didn\u2019t at least take up the low end of guidance or what could go wrong in 2014 that you\u2019re concerned about?","Bob Livingston","You\u2019re asking me why I didn\u2019t take guidance up?","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter","Yes.","Bob Livingston","I\u2019d actually like to get through the bulk of the second quarter before we actually have a real serious discussion internally about it. I\u2019d like to see what the order rates are for April and May. I will tell you that we look at a range of $460 million to $480 million. Folks, I\u2019ll tell you what, we\u2019re focused on, we\u2019re focused on the top-end of that range, not the mid-part of that range.","The bottom end of our range, yeah, we could, I\u2019ll plead guilty to that that we could have \u2013 we could have had a very serious discussion about increasing the bottom end of the range. But again, I\u2019m going to say, let us get through and see at least what order activity is for April and May, we\u2019ll have another discussion on that at the end of the quarter or on the July 12.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter","Okay, good. That\u2019s very good to hear.","Bob Livingston","But I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ll tell you again, what we\u2019re focused on. That\u2019s the top end of our range.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter","Okay. If I can just do a follow-up on the Energy, I didn\u2019t hear you talk about how it trended through the quarter, January, February, March. Usually when this market picks up, I think it can pick up a little bit quicker. I wonder if you could just comment on that?","Bob Livingston","I don\u2019t have that data here in front of me. But my recall is that it was fairly consistent through the quarter for Energy.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter","Okay. And maybe just a last one, the winch market being down a little bit, is there anything wrong with that market or is it just timing and orders?","Bob Livingston","It\u2019s \u2013 look, it\u2019s timing of orders. And what I call the oil field patch. But we also continue to deal with a headwind. You go back two years ago and my goodness, 30% or 40% of this business was supplying winches into the \u2013 for the military. And we continue to see that part of the business activity decline we\u2019re going to see another significant decline end of this year. But it will decline to the point in 2014 where, if it declines any further in \u201815 is not a comment. I mean, that\u2019s all I can tell you.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter","Okay.","Bob Livingston","It\u2019s getting down to some nits and gnash in the military business on that business.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter","Okay, good. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period.

Bookings remained solid at $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and are broad-based across the portfolio excluding retail refrigeration.","The Apergy spin-off is completed at the beginning of the quarter and as a result we have executed a good portion of the announced share repurchase program which Brad will take you through, the impact on the share count later in the deck.","We are tightening the full-year EPS guidance range to $4.75 to $4.85 a share despite the full-year demand environment and retail refrigeration being below our original forecast and largely as a result of improved margin conversion in the Fluids segment expected in Q4, tight corporate cost controls, and share count reduction.","As we have noted in the press release this morning, we will be implementing a cost reduction program beginning in Q3 which is not reflected in our current full-year EPS guidance and will be subject to a separate announcement I will deal with that, I think, in the Q&A.","So let's go on in the presentation, let me pass it off to Brad.","Brad Cerepak","Thanks Rich. Good morning everyone.","Let's start on Page 4 of the presentation deck. As mentioned, our results were largely driven by solid demand in Engineered Systems and Fluids. Overall revenue grew 3% to $1.8 billion. Adjusted segment EBIT improved to $276 million and adjusted margin was essentially flat at 15.3%. This performance reflected solid conversion in Engineered Systems which was offset by continued footprint consolidation supply chain issues in Fluids and lower volume in Refrigeration & Food Equipment.","Adjusted segment EBITDA was $343 million.","Adjusted earnings increased 19% to $200 million. And adjusted EPS was $1.30. The EPS benefited from a slightly lower tax rate on discrete tax benefits whereas the full-year effective tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 22%.","On Slide 5, let's get into a little bit more detail on our revenue and bookings results in the quarter. Second quarter revenue growth of 3% was comprised of 3% organic growth and 2% from FX. Partially offsetting these results was a 2% impact from net dispositions. Importantly on a sequential basis, organic growth accelerated from 1.7% in Q1 to 3.5% in Q2. FX which was a tailwind of about 4% in Q1 decelerated into Q2 to about 2% as a result of the U.S. dollar appreciating against our other trading currencies.","We are using a U.S. dollar Euro assumption of $1.17 in our current full-year forecast.","From a segment perspective, Engineered Systems grew $39 million organically and Fluids grew $44 million. Weak retail refrigeration markets drove a $24 million decline in Refrigeration & Food Equipments revenue. Booking increased 6% overall. Organic growth was 6%. Of note Engineered Systems and Fluids organic bookings grew $62 million and $80 million respectively reflecting broad-based market demand.","From a geographics perspective, the U.S. our largest market grew 2% organically while Europe was up 1%, Asia grew 19% largely driven by strong activity in our Fluids segment.","Finally book to bill finished at 1.05.","Let's go to the earnings bridge now on Slide 6. Starting on the top, Engineered Systems adjusted segment EBIT improved $15 million largely driven by solid conversion on broad-based revenue growth. Fluids EBIT growth of $7 million reflects weak conversion due to footprint consolidation and supply chain issues. The $15 million decline at Refrigeration & Food Equipment reflected lower volume.","Going to the bottom of the chart, adjusted earnings improved $32 million or 19%, higher segment earnings, lower interest, and corporate costs and a lower tax rate drove the improvement.","Let's look at Slide 7. Our first half free cash flow was $79 million or 28% of earnings from continuing ops. Second quarter free cash flow was largely in line with last year. Our CapEx spending was focused on multiple projects which will help drive growth and productivity. Working capital increased $59 million on volume growth although working capital as a percent of revenue came down 130 basis points to 16% of revenue.","Now on Slide 8. As previously mentioned during the second quarter we initiated an accelerated repurchase program funded by the $700 million Apergy dividend. Beyond the completion of the ASR, we expect to repurchase 150 million more in shares in the second half on the open market. By year-end, we will substantially complete the 1 billion repurchase we committed to last year. And as you know, the ending full-year 2018 weighted average drops further into 2019 on these 2018 repurchases.","With that, let me turn it back over to Rich.","Richard Tobin","Thanks Brad. Let's move on to the segment slides.","Engineered Systems delivered a solid broad-based quarter. Margin conversion organic revenue was very good at 46% in the period a result of the following. In printing and identification the positive comparable performance was driven by volume growth in Markem-Imaje and improved product mix in digital print as a result of the timing of LaRio printer deliveries which should have been expected in Q3 but delivered in Q2.","In the Industrial platform, performance was more mixed as they are more subjected to material cost and tariff issues. ESG and TWG both delivered very strong performances as a result of the continued demand strength in fleet renewal in ESG and recovery vehicle accessories demand in TWG, with volume leverage and mix more than offsetting input cost headwinds in both businesses.","DESTACO and MPG delivered good results on volume and improved mix on the back of automation demand and an uptick in military spending.","While VSG reported absolute profits up for the quarter incremental margins were lower than expected as volume leverage and pricing were unable to cover input cost increases as a result of the delays in pricing and implementation which is being enacted going into H2.","Full-year outlook for Engineered Systems is expected to remain strong with earnings levered towards Q4 as a result of industrial facility maintenance shutdowns primarily in Europe in Q3 and the timing of digital print large printer shipments pulled into Q2.","Okay, let\u2019s go forward to Fluids. The Fluids segment posted organic revenue growth of 7% during the quarter with all operating companies growing revenue from comparable period with especially improved performances in our pumps, process solutions, and transport businesses. Consolidated margin performance for the segment was underwhelming as a result of the execution issues in fueling and transport specifically in DFS partially offsetting strong performances in the balance of the segment.","Let me comment on some of the strong results in the segment because it's a little bit of a tale of two worlds here. In pumps and process solutions, PSG colder hydro and to a lesser extent MAG all delivered top-line and bottom line conversion in the quarter. PSG's June shipment rate was the highest in three years which is a positive sign that our CapEx levered businesses continue to gain strength.","The colder business has had a strong start to the year which continued through Q2 this is becoming a business of significant attraction in the segments portfolio and one that is earmarked for capacity expansion.","Results in fueling and transport were mixed. OPW was the fastest growing business at 23% largely driven by regulatory related spending in China and U.S. below ground products. Margin conversion could have been better as a result of facility consolidation costs which we consider transitory and beneficial to margins going forward and a geographic mix of revenue with APAC revenue being dilutive to consolidated margins. The expectation is that OPW will have a solid second half as end market demand remains firm.","DFS while posting top-line growth of 3% posted negative earnings conversion as a result of the continued operational costs associated with the European footprint consolidation, significant supply chain costs and expediting fees, and discrete items in the quarter.","Our expectation is that a significant portion of these issues will be behind us by the end of Q3 and that the second half performance will be materially improved going into Q4. What I can tell you is that during the quarter we did the operational issues and discrete items that cost us approximately $7 million of earnings and if I add that back to our margins, there still remains much to do to get margins on track in this business.","The encouraging news is that we're confident it's not a product issue from the performance perspective as bench -- product benchmarking and customer feedback is positive. And it's clear that our operational execution has to improve and we have to establish and execute clear paths for profit improvement plans in Europe and APAC which are underway.","Let's move on to Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Refrigeration & Food Equipment had another tough quarter in Q2 as revenue was down 6% primarily driven by reduced demand trends especially in Dover Food Retail and calendarization of shipments out of food equipment particularly at Belvac which are back-end loaded in 2018 to Q4.","We have updated our full-year forecast for this segment and align with the current backlog and demand trends. EBITDA margin in the quarter declined over 200 basis points or $15 million on reduced earnings in Dover Food Retail, $14 million in Belvac and $4 million on a comparable basis.","Our expectations that a full-year demand will remain weak in Dover Food Retail through the balance of the year but for comparable segment margin declines to narrow in Q3 and refuse -- and reverse in Q4 as a result of improving shipment mix in United Brands through H2, Belvac and Belvac shipments in Q4 and the flow through of cost actions in Dover Food Retail which has reduced its year-over-year headcount by 18% through June.","Moving on to Slide 14, as I mentioned earlier in the presentation, we've updated our full-year revenue outlook to reflect softer than forecasted demand conditions in Retail Refrigeration and tightened our range on the EPS to the higher end of the range with a bias towards the top end.","Our revenue trends and backlogs indicate we have strong businesses that are largely participating in markets with increased demand profiles. It is clear that we need to execute on better margin conversion in some areas of our portfolio and to aggressively implement actions to offset raw material and input inflation.","During the last 90 days, I have visited approximately 70% of our total company revenue and our management teams in the quarter. The commitment to deliver improved performances there and we are committed to implementing the necessary actions to achieve it.","That's the last slide, so we will move on to Q&A.","Paul Goldberg","Thanks. Crystal, if we can have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Welcome to Richard and thank you for the candid tone. In terms of I guess any extra color you could provide on the cost reduction measures that you've talked about in terms of magnitude and perhaps also speed of execution and how quickly investors should expect to see a meaningful payback on those cost reduction efforts.","Richard Tobin","We\u2019re well through our plans. I expect that our plans will be complete by mid-August from there we will work on the accounting treatment quite frankly because there's some issues we have to deal with war notices and a variety of other things. Before the end of Q3, we'll be announcing the timing of those measures, the cost of those measures, and the flow through on our cost going into 2019 as a separate announcement, but I guess in a nutshell we're well under way at this point.","I'm confident in our ability to execute and I think as a clarifying point what I've written in the press release, it said overhead, and I don't want to confuse that with what has gone on here before about rightsizing if you will nor do I want you to think of that as corporate cost. This is SG&A across the group including the SG&A in the segment, so the scale of this rightsizing initiative will be materially larger than some of the rightsizing initiatives that we have seen as a result of the Apergy spinoff.","Julian Mitchell","Understood, thank you. And then my second and last question would just be around the Refrigeration & Food business and then I guess you\u2019ve obviously done a lot of cost measures already at food retail. It seems like you\u2019ve obviously decided to keep the business in light of the reviews you've done in recent months, maybe talk a little bit about your impressions on the longer-term sales growth outlook in Refrigeration & Food overall and how that informs the scale of necessary cost reduction?","Richard Tobin","The cost reduction initiatives are solely in retail refrigeration because that really is the part of the portfolio that's suffering the revenue decline. I think from an earnings point of view both UB, UB is on track for the full-year. I think that we've got some calendarization differences running through the P&L right now in Belvac. So if you look at the segment performance, it's negative to a certain extent because of Belvac, our backlog in Belvac is impressive right now it's purely a question of the timing of the deliveries right now they're loaded into Q4 and that's why in my commentary, I'd said that the comparable performance for the segment actually rolls over in Q4 where we expected to be positive which is largely as a result of the cost takeout in retail refrigeration and the shipments in Belvac.","So in terms of the portfolio review and the decision about keeping anything I mean we've gone through the portfolio review in terms of what we can expect about medium term performance but there's been no real decisions about a greater portfolio decision at this point. I think that I understand that there is this issue of well why don't we spinout refrigeration or monetize refrigeration, monetizing the business at it -- at its current demand levels. I'm not so sure about that from a decision point of view. So I think what we're doing right now is rightsizing that business in terms of what we believe the demand is going to be for the balance of the year. We'll have a better idea as we go through Q3 of what we expect to happen in 2019 and we're committed to making sure that that we maximize the segment profitability for that period. In terms of what we're going to do from a portfolio point of view I think that's a future consideration.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Good morning Rich. Good morning, Paul. A long, long time, good morning Brad, long time I didn\u2019t see you.","Brad Cerepak","Good morning.","Richard Tobin","Yes, long time Andrew.","Andrew Obin","So the question is I guess question for Rich as you move from the board to the CEO position and I know you sort of highlighted SG&A moves, are there any obvious things other than SG&A in terms of how the company run that you have seen as a target for improvement and the second part of my question, how long would it take for you would think to sort of steady the operation that Dover moves them in the direction where you want for you can sort of restart thinking about using the balance sheets strategically i.e. M&A?","Richard Tobin","Okay, I think there's two primary issues. One is clearly that the expectation of demand in retail refrigeration of what we thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year and what it's likely turning out to be for 2018 is significantly different and that goes through 2019. So I believe that we're reaching the bottom from what I've can ascertain so far but right now we're moving as quickly as we can to intervene on the cost space to protect margins as they are.","We'll make further decisions based on as I mentioned the previous question about where as we stack up on, we're taking a lot of costs out right now, we\u2019re incurring those costs of the P&L of what kind of on the run margin profile is for retail refrigeration but a variety of demand scenarios into 2019 but clearly that's a significant difference between what we had thought at the beginning of the year and what it's turned out to be, so it's up to us to action that and quite frankly, segment management has been doing a lot of heavy lifting, so I can't criticize the execution of the cost takeout year-to-date.","The other issue is the execution on the facility consolidation in DFS and the margin profile of that portion of the Fluids segment has been disappointing. This has been ongoing for some period of time. I think it is demonstrated that there are some gaps in the organization about handling facility consolidation and complex industrial moves and we're paying the price for that. So right now in terms of margin of dilution accretion, we've got a significant portion of the Fluid segment that is very dilutive to the balance of the portfolio and that's a problem. We're getting our hands around about on the run profitability for that segment, if I can strip out some of the noise. But we're not moving fast enough in my mind in terms of the execution. I think that we will make some progress in Q3, so comparable earnings trajectory versus the first half move up in H2 but we're still far away from expectation in terms of the margin of that business and it's significant to our revenue stream, so it's something that that we need to fix and I think that that is going to undertake us bringing in a mix of some other kind of talents into the group to ensure that because there is other footprint initiatives that I think that will be coming through 2019 and we just got to do a better job of executing there.","In terms of inorganic investment this is not a scenario of while we're going to go through a cleanup period here and then we're going to come out of the other side. We're still looking at inorganic opportunity and the balance of the portfolio we've got certain portions of our business that are executing very well I mean I highlighted some of them in the opening commentary. We're looking at a few right now and the scale in terms of purchase price is somewhere, it\u2019s less than $0.5 billion but more in the $250 million range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning. Hey Rich thanks for all the color on kind of the operational and CEO kind of new view just on the maybe some of the more kind of practical near-term operational things, can you just give us a little color on really what the supply chain disruptions are, how do you tackle those and also just a little bit of an update on what is happening on price cost in particular your efforts to get price in the business?","Richard Tobin","Sure. For the most part in supply chain issues that we've had, that have been negative to earnings have been mostly isolated in Fluids and almost exclusively in DFS. And that is part and parcel to this facility consolidation to a certain extent and trying to manage our SNL pieces systems of getting the right product out. So we've had a bunch of frictional costs associated that whether that's freight expediting.","On the balance of the group, it's being reflected in working capital performance where I think that the supply chains in certain parts of the business have been somewhat strained. I think in certain areas we've tried to buy forward a little bit on the industrial businesses for steel to kind of mask price increases to a certain extent and that really needs to be normalized going to the second half because we're not entirely pleased with the cash flow performance year-to-date. So those are really two of the areas where it's manifesting itself.","Jeffrey Sprague","And how about on price attempts specifically Rich, how is the market accepting that, is there kind of negative demand response when attempting to get price or any blow back anywhere on that?","Richard Tobin","Yes, we've got a pretty mixed portfolio, so any answer I give you is going to be kind of mixed, I mean I think that we've estimated that our commodity headwind is approximately $55 million or so, that needs to be offset in price. Clearly in the business, I called out VSG where we've been negative so far and that's a little bit because of -- that's a distribution business and there's a pal on kind of rolling that into distribution which we're committed to fixing in the second half of the year.","The other businesses like TWG and ESG which are heavily levered towards commodity prices because of the demand profile has been there. They're doing reasonably well on price and they're offsetting the balance because of the volume leverage on the industrial side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Thanks for the abbreviated script and a lot of time for Q&A. We appreciate that. On the free cash flow, you mentioned you just mentioned some working capital. I know the prior guidance was 10% of revenue, well, I know you have a big second half usually can you maybe just update us on that metric for the year and then may be little color on how that may improve in the next couple of years and just a quick follow-up on that.","Richard Tobin","I'll take the time to avoid the next couple of years Steve for the time being.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Richard Tobin","I can deal with that in Q3 but let's deal with between now and the end of the year. I'm not aware of anything that's changed in the dynamic or the cash flow dynamic of the business right now. So I'm not taking 10% of revenue off the table by any means.","Clearly as I'm sure you\u2019ve heard during the Q3 commentary we did -- we are backend loaded in certain of our businesses and that would imply that receivable balances in Q4 may be going up but that, so we're going to have to work pretty hard in terms of the industrial inventory and payables to offset that, but I don't see any fundamental change that we've moved to at a heavier profile in terms of inventory or cash conversion but getting into kind of doing the timing quarter-by-quarter, it's hard for me to say right now I've gone through it at the Opco level, I think any kind of fluctuation in that is going to be based on timing of receivable balances and at the end of the year we're shipping out a bunch of LaRio machines and shipping out a lot of Belvac, I mean that's going to be negative unless we can carry some payables to offset into it. But right now I don't see any reason to come off 10% of revenue in terms of a target.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then just a quick one on RF&E you talked about taking rightsizing actions I don't see really any restructuring in the quarter at refrigeration is that because a lot of the plan that you're going to kind of come up with and announce it's more kind of let's put stop saying let's evaluate and that would be a big part of kind of what we hear about in Q3 like kind of a calm before the storm if you will?","Richard Tobin","A little bit less those than you think, I think that that the rightsizing that's been going on in refrigeration has been flowing through the P&L and it's on the variable labor side more than anything else I think that what we're going to do in the segment is take a look at the footprint because the footprint is probably well it is right now at current demand levels a lot larger than we would need, so there's going to be a part of that in it but to be clear the restructuring that we're going to announce in Q3 is not -- is more of a group wide SG&A reduction there will be some amount of footprint in it but quite frankly I think that the footprint decisions are going to take a little longer and that'll be done I don't want to say separately but I mean as you can imagine you need to prepare a supply chains and do a variety of other things to deal with a footprint so a lot of that will probably go into 2019.","What we're going to do in this coming quarter is take a look at across all of the segments, so group wide SG&A because clearly as we've taken a look at the benchmarking versus our peer set, we\u2019re a bit heavy I think we've done a lot of work in the past to put in systems to allow us to take out some non-customer facing kind of costs and that's what we're going to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with UBS.","Steve Winoker","Thanks very much, good morning and thanks for the color this is really helpful across the business. I just wanted to start with a little bit more of that operational review that you had across the whole business you've talked about, hitting 70% of the revenue base, you\u2019ve talked about SG&A and some of the supply chain issues but to what extent is there sort of a broader operational and lean opportunity when you see about -- see how the businesses are working, do you think these are really just isolated incidents or is this more of an opportunity kind of rethinking the operations of the business forward on a portfolio basis?","Richard Tobin","Yes, I think that right now we are concentrating on the actionable items, so SG&A clearly as an actionable, addressable item and as we have mentioned we've got some pretty big execution issues that we need to deal with in DFS and DFS as a material portion of our total group revenues and clearly we're kind of swimming upstream a little bit on retail refrigeration until that business stabilizes itself, so there is a lot we can do in terms of operational performance. That it's going to require that's but that is more of a sustained kind of grinded out effort. So I mean it's not something that we can turn the dial between now and the end of the year. I think other than just begin to turn it philosophically.","But in my going around I think that that we do need to bring into some of our businesses some expertise in terms of operational efficiency. I think we do a fantastic job of keeping close to the customer. I think we do a really good job in terms of new product development, so kind of close to the customer and developing the products which is reflected in our top-line which has been very competitive against our peer set. I think that part of it we do quite well I think that we just need to take that kind of effort and turn some of it back in terms of operational execution. But that is something that is we can put it in it as an ethos between now and the end of the year but we're going to have to grind that out and that's more of a 18 months before we really get on a cadence that I'd like to see it out.","Steve Winoker","Okay. And just to clarify on the comment this morning when you talk about asset intensity, you mean driving higher asset utilization across the business.","Richard Tobin","Yes, yes, absolutely, absolutely.","Steve Winoker","Okay.","Richard Tobin","I won't use intensity again we're not going to become more asset heavy. We are going to sweat the assets that we have more intensely.","Steve Winoker","Perfect and then so I had to get that in but on the EMV side, can you just talk to us a little bit about EMV growth.","Richard Tobin","Somewhere in this pile here is the chart where do we say we were on EMV penetration 40%?","Brad Cerepak","Yes, roughly 40% that's hard -- that's hard to know because we're seeing more and more -- we're seeing more and more new dispensers a lot of customers are looking at the age of the dispenser in the field and making decisions about earlier upgrade and maybe they normally would do and we're seeing that manifest itself in order rates on dispensers. The first half as you know was a challenging first half as EMV last year was pretty solid in terms of kits and conversions. The back half we'll see that more to dispenser, so but roughly speaking the number Rich gave is about where we think we are with a lot of room to consumer to run here in the back half into 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome Rich.","Richard Tobin","Thanks.","Deane Dray","Hey maybe we can start with what you're thinking and I know it's a moving target regarding potential tariff exposures and you mentioned $55 million in commodity headwinds you need to offset but any color there for starters would be helpful?","Richard Tobin","The $55 million is a mixed number which is, it's got tariff in there and it's got price escalation right and parsing that out --","Brad Cerepak","It's small.","Richard Tobin","Yes, parsing that out is relatively difficult. We are keeping a close look at our exposure to China in terms of our revenue base clearly and not only our exposure from a revenue point of view but also the mismatch between what we make in China and selling to China versus what we import exports. So we're running the traps on all of that it looks manageable at this point, so I don't see any significant issue. I'd like to see our Asia-Pac margins move up group wide a little bit but and I\u2019d mention that in the color around LPW but at the end of the day from a growth point of view it's from a absolute profit point of view we will take it, so we're running the traps on both kind of tariff scenarios but for us right now it's less tariff and more commodity cost headwinds and then it's just a challenge for us to offset it between price and productivity.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then, Rich, I appreciate that we're still early in your tenure and you're laying out some broad strokes on the operating side and what needs fixing, but can you address capital allocation broadly? You mentioned that you're not going to stop on acquisitions. You're looking at $250 million to $500 million-sized deals. But broadly, how are you thinking about return requirements? Are there any changes that we should be sensitive to in terms of how you're looking at capital allocation broadly?","Richard Tobin","Right. We're looking closely at it. We -- I'm very cognizant that everyone is looking for a structured answer from me on that, our intent is hopefully before the end of Q3 around the close of Q3 that we're going to come out and I'll give you a whole presentation in terms of my thoughts on capital allocation in the short-term Brad alluded to what we're doing in terms of the share repurchase as, a) it was a commitment in the past but it's a relative valuation play at the same time, so I think we've given you a lot of color in terms of our intent there. But I understand that everybody is waiting to hear from me about capital allocation and I'm working on the presentation as we speak.","Deane Dray","Understand we'll be patient. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So when you look at refrigeration, I know there has been a few questions there but it's been a couple of years where it's been little tougher go over so when you look this quarter I know Bob had talked last quarter about a couple of new customers coming in and booking more, what\u2019s happening in the business, what is worse? The CapEx environment we all know looks weak but Bob had talked about specialty store growth so what -- it just seems like it's a moving target and what should it look like from here are you think that, where we are in terms of guidance is pretty conservative now, Rich.","Richard Tobin","I hope it's conservative. I guess maybe we're talking about retail refrigeration. I think when we look at the segment. It's going to have enough it's going to have a tough Q3 and then -- these are comparable numbers now it\u2019s going have a tough Q3. And then it's going to roll over in Q4 because quite frankly the comps get better and as I mentioned the non-retail refrigeration portion of the portfolio is backend loaded right now based on our forecast, so you're going to get that kind of uptick. But the fact of the matter is we're nothing's really changed, we're in a bit of a CapEx strike by food retail as everybody struggles with the digitization and what they're going to do to react to that.","It is clearly below replacement demand now so I wouldn't say does it get worse from here, I don't think that it gets worse from here but we don't see a runway for it to get demonstrably better other than to run the trap lines to say at some point maintenance capital, replacement capital has got to come back so but clearly the proportion of new build to replacement build is changed forever to a certain extent and we're going to have to size ourselves based on that.","In terms of other revenues streams there you guys you could imagine we are working strenuously to diversify the business from case and door to other products within in food retail. I think that we've got some interesting irons in the fire in that regard but they are not going to impact earnings in 2018.","And assumes we can put some color around it and I'm sure you'll hear from us about it but for the medium term this is all hands on deck of rightsizing ensuring that our quality remains best in class setting ourselves up for even at flat revenue we actually make comparable profits go up because of cost takeout and then working strenuously in kind of diversified the revenue stream from a product point of view.","Andrew Kaplowitz","That\u2019s helpful. Then if you just back up last year this time or maybe early in the last summer and there was an Analyst Day Bob had talked about some of these long-term growth guidance for the different segments obviously refrigeration has changed but when you look at ES and Fluids you've laid out 3% to 5% growth and it looks like ES have been pretty strong so as you've looked at the overall segments Rich in terms of growth is that the way you\u2019ve looked at ES and Fluids look solid versus that 3% to 5% growth or situation looks little worse any comments on how those targets that were set last year?","Richard Tobin","Yes, I know that there's a need or everybody wants me to reconcile the 2019 targets. I can just guess and I've looked at them closely. Clearly as you articulated both Fluids -- all right let's go back Engineering Systems from a top-line growth and a margin accretion point of view is largely on track. Fluids because of the negative conversion in DFS is problematic and I think we've beaten this issue of food retail. I'm more of a consolidated margin person, this is a portfolio there's going to be ups and downs in terms of the demand cycle in the portfolio but if I look at it from a consolidated point of view part of the reason that we're taking this action in terms of overhead costs is to close that gap which is a portion of it is our execution issues that we have in DFS that need to be reconciled and more importantly the headwinds that we have on refrigeration.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Charley Brady","Just on a bigger picture you talked about you particularly in refrigeration and I guess more fluids bringing some more talent on the operational execution issue, do you think as you and I know it's a little bit far to 2019 but these type of things generally take a bit more time you've got to bring people and you've got to get the plan in place and you've got to execute. I mean as we look from a margin perspective particularly on that DFS business and more into refrigeration do you see kind of going through 2019 before you and exiting 2019 before you see any real meaningful margin improvement there or should we expect it sooner than that timeframe trying to get a framework of how long do we see sort of some of these subpar margins in parts of the business before they start getting really better on the plan you going to put in place.","Richard Tobin","Right. As I mentioned earlier from an execution point of view on refrigeration and the actions that have been taken on the cost basis I'm confident that the plans are in place for the comparable margin to rise it's purely a question of demand so it's a top-line issue, right, so I think that's the segment management is on it from a cost point of view it's not there's not an execution issue going on in retail refrigeration it's more of -- it's got a significant top-line headwind and because of that your fixed cost absorption becomes problematic, so it's easy you know what they've done up until this point is do with a variable cost which they take through the P&Ls on a comparable basis even a flat revenues it actually moves up going into 2019.","And then it's clear that we're probably going to have to take some action in terms of the fixed cost in that business to right size it based on future demand. We're not there yet because I'm not I think we need to see some stabilization in terms of the demand profile on that portion of the business.","On DFS I can tell you that if I clear out of the noise of the facility consolidation and everything else it's a material amount of earnings increase at flat revenue. But I'll also tell you that the profit margin even if I clear out the noise is unacceptable from a comp base. And that is likely to take, I think we will make improvement I think you're going to see some improvements in the second half of this year largely in Q4, I think that you'll see improvement assuming we clear out the noise which we're committed to doing in 2019 but it\u2019s going to likely take throughout 2019 to materially get this closer to benchmark profitability which is our target.","Charley Brady","Understood thanks and just one more quick one on, you talked about one of the things you think you guys are pretty good at are new product development that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue but I\u2019m wondering if you look across the portfolio, are there areas where things may have been under invested in terms of new product development and that's an area that need a little more focus or is that kind of squared up across the board?","Richard Tobin","It\u2019s such a mixed bag, I think it's very difficult to answer, I think by and large as I mentioned before the customer facing portion of the business is executing. So and that includes new product development, right a lot of what we do is I would almost classify as co-engineering in a lot of cases. I think from an investment point of view, if there's been any opportunity in terms of investment it would be at the industrial level and that's a productivity issue, right. So there may be some amount of flex of investing in the industrial footprint to derive future productivity out of it and be less labor intensive in some of our more industrial businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mircea Dobre with Baird.","Mircea Dobre","Yes, good morning and welcome Rich. If I may, I\u2019d like to maybe ask you kind of a longer-term question if you're looking out three to four years I mean I certainly understand what you're trying to do from a cost reduction in restructuring standpoint in the near-term but what is your sense on where the biggest opportunity for value creation would be in the company, is it on self help driving margins or is it more along the capital deployment portfolio management side?","Richard Tobin","In the -- in the near-term it's driven by self-help and in the longer-term it moves more into investing where we are advantaged from a market structure point of view and we believe that we've got advantage. So over the next 18 months, I think it's more of operational execution and self-help I think that I've basically pointed my finger of where we believe that the biggest material changes can take place. But over the -- but at a certain point if we execute on that then it becomes more of an issue of capital allocation and allocating our capital where we believe that we\u2019re structurally advantaged in terms of whether it's market structure or product or a variety of other considerations. So but it's not to say I think I should repeat myself that we're going into some kind of black period where we're going to almost exclusively concentrate on execution issues, I think that we're able to do a little bit of both.","So we are going to be considering inorganic investment over that period of time. So it's not a black white, so if you're asking a longer term question I think that once we get beyond kind of some of the operational challenges that we have in front of us then I think it becomes more of a -- are we going to be a disciplined allocator of capital. And I think we're committed to doing so.","Mircea Dobre","I see. And then maybe clarification on guidance, if you're willing to provide it, can you comment at all on how you\u2019re thinking about segment margins for the full-year by each segment?","Richard Tobin","No, I won't give you segment margin for the whole year I think that if you go back and you look of what my comments were I think that I've given a good amount of color in terms of what our expectations are by segment in terms of calendarization between Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Rich, it sounds just maybe just asking the margin longer-term margin guidance question directly, it sounds like we've talked a little bit about bridging the gap to what the old targets were for 2019, when do you think you're going to be in a position to either affirm or provide new margin guidance on a longer-term basis?","Richard Tobin","No, I think that what I alluded to before about coming out and doing let\u2019s call it a Capital Markets Day for lack of better word about presenting something about capital allocation clearly as part of that it's going to be something about what we think about future margin performance is going to be. I just need some time to get it all sorted and I think it's important that we have a definitive answer in terms of the costs and the role forward about the actions that we\u2019re going to be taking in the next 90 days as part of that presentation.","Joe Ritchie","Got it, that makes sense and following up maybe on that question earlier on asset intensity and running your assets harder, I'd be curious just based on your first few months on the job, how do you evaluate the level of investment that\u2019s been made across the businesses and what and whether you have to make incremental investments in your assets to drive better productivity?","Richard Tobin","I think that the opposite. As you're aware, I think that the asset base of Dover is diverse, I think to be kind. So there is ample slack capacity throughout the group and even if you drove down that by operating coming in second and everything else. So I think that there is an amount of opportunity if we're talking about driving longer-term productivity of changing the profile of some of our industrial assets to make them less labor intensive over time.","But I think that the payback on those investments will be solid. But it is very much a mixed bag between how old the assets are and whether they\u2019re industrial assets or non-industrial in terms of their profile. So it's -- I'll just give you anecdotal comments but there are opportunities, if we're confident about the revenue streams going forward and the volume for some amount of automation that may require some amount of CapEx but quite frankly I don't think it's going to flex CapEx of revenue as a percentage of revenue demonstratively and I think that the payback will be satisfactory.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Helpful, if I could sneak one more in just on price cost. But just on price cost, it looks like you got in roughly $25 million or so price in the first half of the year, you're talking about $55 million or so of commodity inflation for the year, I'm just curious is the expectation in the back half of the year that price cost is going to be positive based on what you know today just completely offsetting or how are you guys thinking about it within the guide?","Richard Tobin","I think neutral is the best answer I can give you, I mean you got so much flex in mix going into the second half and a lot of comparable performance changes. Clearly, we didn't I think that DES in most of their industrial businesses did a great job in Q2 or some high value shipments but we got out the door quickly. So from a comparative basis, we're going to be really leaning on DFS in Q3 and really leaning on DFS and retail refrigeration from a comp basis in Q4 and because of retail refrigeration not retail refrigeration because of DFR being reliant upon Belvac in Q4 which are low shipments in number but very lucrative in terms of its margin profile.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","So we've seen, in the past, facility consolidation issues. We've seen supply chain issues. These are, unfortunately, not new things. So what I'm wondering here is, as we look to slim down improved processes, what is the risk that 2019 becomes one of the -- those infamous transition years for you guys?","Richard Tobin","I don\u2019t want it to be my transition. So I think the commitment of clearly from an execution point of view in DFS, I can't speak to the past. I can just speak to what we're dealing with right now; I think that we could have handled this better, right. I think that I'll put it in my lap; I know how to do that stuff. So I think that it's just a question of doing the preparation beforehand and executing on the plan. And just so I think also as I mentioned that we are going to be taking the industrial footprint but over the course of the next 18 months. And we may have targeted actions there but what I can assure you is, is that when we take those actions that will tell you upfront what the cost is going to be and what the timeline of the execution is and it's not going to be modeled in kind of on the run results.","Scott Graham","So it's entirely possible that, let's say, for example, the first half of next year could be a little, for lack of a better term, squishy off of what you're trying to do over the next 2018?","Richard Tobin","I'd like is it possible, I don't think so. I guess is my answer right I mean I think if it\u2019s squishy let's take an example. If we want to intervene in 2019 on the industrial footprint of retail refrigeration for example, it would be squishy to the extent of there are some amount of redundant costs both in preparation for and working capital to prepare to make that transition.","All right, but those are relatively known and easily measured right as opposed to having difficulty with the transition and not starting up appropriately where you're basically having difficulty executing on your backlog and then you get all of the frictional costs associated with that whether that is redundant labor significant overtime, freight expediting, paying supplier premiums, that part of it is execution and that's the part that while we may intervene on the industrial footprint, I think that the planning of that and our ability to demonstrate this is what it's going to cost and this is what the timeline, that part we'll fix.","Scott Graham","All right. That's very helpful. And let me just be sort of a -- maybe a little bit more near-term-oriented here with my sort of second question. You laid it out very clearly that you're leaning fairly heavily on DFS for Q3 and retail refrigeration for Q4. And, I guess, I would say -- and I know that you don't want to go back to the past, but we've kind of done this. We're relying on this thing in the past. And I'm just wondering, do you have sort of plan Bs in those areas or in other areas to make sure that you stay within the guidance range?","Richard Tobin","Well I mean we put the guidance out there and I can see that there's some pushback on the $4.85. So I think -- and I told -- what I said was the bias was to the upper end, right. So I think that we're trying to take into account all forecasts are associated with executing the business. Clearly, I think that the comp to comp in Q3 is going to be unexciting and it's going to be backend loaded, I don't see anything in Q4 that could swing the number significantly that wouldn't allow us to make it up, right.","As I said it may be from a segmental point of view, it maybe puts and takes, I mentioned before we're ever reliant on Belvac shipments in Q4, if those get deferred into Q1, that's something that we're going to have to make up in DES or somewhere else. So we're again I\u2019m taking that into account in terms of the movement of the total portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for the day. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks.","Paul Goldberg","Thank you. This concludes our conference call. With that, we want to thank you for your continued interest in Dover and look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good day, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s second quarter 2018 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."]}}
